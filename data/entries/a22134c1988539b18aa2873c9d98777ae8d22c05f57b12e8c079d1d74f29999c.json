{"title":"AltStore PAL Alternative App Marketplace Launches on iPhone in EU","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/17/altstore-eu-alternative-app-marketplace/","date":1713375027000,"content":"One of the first alternative app marketplaces went live in the European Union today, with developer Riley Testut <a href=\"http://rileytestut.com/blog/2024/04/17/introducing-altstore-pal/\">introducing AltStore PAL</a>, a version of his AltStore that can be accessed in EU countries.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/altstore-pal-eu.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://altstore.io\">AltStore PAL</a> is an open-source app that is designed to distribute apps from independent developers. At launch, it features two apps, including Testut's Delta game emulator and clipboard manager app Clip. Delta is also being <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/17/delta-game-emulator-iphone/\">simultaneously released in the App Store</a> outside of the European Union, but it looks like EU customers will need to download it from AltStore.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTestut says that once AltStore PAL is \"running smoothly,\" third-party app developers will be able to submit their apps for distribution outside of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>. The app marketplace is designed to be decentralized with no directory, so developers will need to self-promote their apps and direct users to their websites to install an app through AltStore.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDistributing apps through AltStore is free of charge, but it is worth noting that apps that see more than one million first annual installs will need to pay Apple an 0.50 euro Core Technology Fee. App marketplaces have to pay the fee for every install with no free allowance, so AltStore is charged 0.50 euros each time it is installed. To afford the fee, Testut is charging 1.50 euros per year for AltStore PAL access.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTestut has been working on AltStore PAL since Apple announced plans to support <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/08/app-store-connect-alternative-app-marketplaces/\">alternative app marketplaces</a> in iOS 17.4. It is open to all apps, but Testut says that it makes the most sense for \"smaller, indie apps that otherwise couldn't exist due to ‌App Store‌ rules.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAltStore PAL is equipped with Patreon integration to allow developers to monetize their apps. Developers can offer their apps to just their patrons, and this method of distribution also allows for a sub-1 million cap on those who can subscribe to use an app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> users in the European Union can download AltStore PAL <a href=\"https://altstore.io\">from the AltStore website</a>. Alternative app marketplaces are not available outside of the European Union.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/\">European Union</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/17/altstore-eu-alternative-app-marketplace/\">AltStore PAL Alternative App Marketplace Launches on iPhone in EU</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/altstore-pal-alternative-app-marketplace-launches-on-iphone-in-eu.2424392/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a22134c1988539b18aa2873c9d98777ae8d22c05f57b12e8c079d1d74f29999c","category":"Apple"}
