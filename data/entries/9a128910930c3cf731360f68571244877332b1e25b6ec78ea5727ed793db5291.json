Arizona and Georgia will be the first states to support the feature, with Connecticut, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Oklahoma, and Utah to follow, according to Apple.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/apple-wallet-drivers-license-16x9.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nApple said select TSA security checkpoints in participating U.S. airports will be the first locations where customers can present their digital driver's license or state ID in the Wallet app. Participating states and the TSA will share more information at a later date in regards to when and where mobile driver's licenses and IDs will be supported.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple is already in discussions with many more U.S. states as part of its plan to offer the feature nationwide in the future, according to Jennifer Bailey, Apple's vice president of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe ability to add a driver's license or ID to the Wallet app is a feature of iOS 15, which will be publicly released later this year. Once a participating state begins offering this capability to its residents, customers will be able to add their driver's license or state ID to the Wallet app and simply tap their iPhone or Apple Watch on an identity reader at a TSA checkpoint, without taking out their physical card.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-wallet/\">Apple Wallet</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/01/apple-shares-us-states-adopting-wallet-ids/\">Apple Announces First U.S. States That Will Let You Add Your Driver's License to Your iPhone</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-announces-first-u-s-states-that-will-let-you-add-your-drivers-license-to-your-iphone.2309418/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=pfUyaXvLM9s:NIElaxDElmY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=pfUyaXvLM9s:NIElaxDElmY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/pfUyaXvLM9s\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9a128910930c3cf731360f68571244877332b1e25b6ec78ea5727ed793db5291","category":"Apple"}
