As you might remember, back this past fall, Strava restricted that ability, instantly removing any links you added. And by “restricted”, I mean: Killed links in the most clumsy way possible.</p>\n<p>In their attempt to deal with what they claimed was ever-increasing spam (sometimes adult/phishing in nature), they stopped allowing you to put any external links (e.g. to website.com) on Strava activities/posts/etc. This included your own activities, comments, club descriptions, club events, etc… The problem was, when Strava implemented this, they did so very poorly. Specifically, it ended up purging *anything* with a period (.) in it. Thus, people who even wrote 26.2 (as in 26.2 miles) in the title of an activity, would see it erased. This was all part of their <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/10/strava-problems-fit-file.html\">Fall 2024 plan to see how many different ways they could trigger users to cancel</a> their subscriptions, while concurrently angering their partners. Speaking of which, I still need to write about the 60M+ activities that were purged <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/11/stravas-changes-to-kill-off-apps.html\">as a result of that</a>…</p>\n<p>While those initial URL parsing mistakes were corrected, the ultimate goal (restricting external links) was achieved, and since then, all external links would get zapped.</p>\n<p>I’ll be honest, despite having a <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/athletes/dcrainmaker\">moderate number of followers on Strava</a> (~24,000), I literally can’t remember the last time I had any spam-like comments. Years maybe? As many people assumed, this seemed it was more about Strava trying to rein in 3rd party apps that posted app names/URLs, as well as trying to keep people from meandering off the platform. I’m not saying there isn’t any spam on Strava, I’m simply saying it wasn’t the end-all-be-all that some made it out to be. Pretty sure 100MPH leaderboard segments is still the…uhh…leader there.</p>\n<p>In any event, as of Monday, anyone can start putting links again in the following locations:</p>\n<p>– Athlete Profile<br />\n– Club Descriptions<br />\n– Event Descriptions<br />\n– Activity Descriptions<br />\n– Club posts (but only admins of a Verified Club on Strava)</p>\n<p>It’s worth noting that Strava also initially implemented links for Verified Athletes and Verified Clubs back in December. Inversely, Strava says that any previously removed links/content won’t be coming back. It’s gone-gone dead. Likewise, <a href=\"https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/34413026584461-Links-on-Strava\">Strava’s FAQ</a> on the topic implies there may still be some blocks in place “if it is formatted similarly to a URL”, but they’re pretty fuzzy on that.</p>\n<p>Strava <a href=\"https://press.strava.com/articles/links-are-back-on-strava\">went on to say the following in their statement</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“These areas were chosen because they are among the most engaging and meaningful parts of Strava—key places where links help our community connect with one another.</p>\n<p>We recognize that disabling and removing links last September was disruptive to our community. This was never the intention. The decision was necessary to protect users from a wave of harmful spam attacks that included links to fraudulent and misleading content. To prevent this type of harmful content from being posted on Strava, we moved fast and didn’t clearly communicate why. We’re sorry for the frustration this caused, and moving forward, we’re committed to greater transparency.</p>\n<p>Since then, we’ve made significant improvements to Strava’s spam detection and prevention systems, such as an upgraded machine learning model. This helps us better detect and block suspicious activity—so users can share links in the places that matter most. “</p></blockquote>\n<p>In doing a quick test, I was indeed able to add a link to my activity (to here at dcrainmaker.com, as well as even a link to Relive.com to see if they’d block that. Both worked). I haven’t sat around though and tried to figure out which creative links will break it. I’m sure the rest of the internet will do that.</p>\n<p>With that, thanks for reading!</p>","author":"Ray Maker","siteTitle":"DC Rainmaker","siteHash":"32f541eec2062fbf675b0daf837db78b41cd6160cf993de3c4b5e9b44a978706","entryHash":"41d54a2689c922fd66984426fc855dead03da4ecf2e190e615c1030f275f9c31","category":"Cycling"}
