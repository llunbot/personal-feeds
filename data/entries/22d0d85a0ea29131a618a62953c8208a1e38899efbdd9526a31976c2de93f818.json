A new survey of 300 director-level IT workers at companies that are customers of North American VMware provides insight into the customer reaction to Broadcom's overhaul.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.cloudbolt.io/industry-research/vmware-acquisition-aftermath/\">survey</a> released Thursday doesn't provide feedback from every VMware customer, but it's the first time we've seen responses from IT decision-makers working for companies paying for VMware products. It echos <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/broadcom-ceo-admits-vmware-changes-have-brought-unease-to-customers-partners/\">concerns</a> expressed at the announcement of some of Broadcom's more controversial changes to VMware, like the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/12/broadcom-ends-vmware-perpetual-license-sales-testing-customers-and-partners/\">end of perpetual licenses</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/broadcom-execs-say-vmware-price-subscription-complaints-are-unwarranted/\">growing costs</a>.</p>\n<p>CloudBolt Software commissioned Wakefield Research, a market research agency, to run the study from May 9 through May 23. The \"CloudBolt Industry Insights Reality Report: VMware Acquisition Aftermath\" includes responses from workers at 150 companies with fewer than 1,000 workers and 150 companies with more than 1,000 workers. Survey respondents were invited via email and took the survey online, with the report authors writing that results are subject to sampling variation of ±5.7 percentage points at a 95 percent confidence level.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029533#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029533&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"22d0d85a0ea29131a618a62953c8208a1e38899efbdd9526a31976c2de93f818","category":"Tech"}
