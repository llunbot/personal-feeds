These are upgraded in a few ways from the AirPods 2, with spatial audio, Adaptive EQ, force sensor controls, sweat and water resistance, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BDHB9Y8H%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$19 OFF</div>AirPods 3 for $149.99</div></a></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMoving to the Pro lineup, Amazon has both AirPods Pro 2 earbuds at all-time low prices. The AirPods Pro 2 with Lightning/MagSafe Charging Case is <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BDHWDR12%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\"><strong>$189.00</strong></a> and the AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C/MagSafe Charging Case is <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWRXH8B%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\"><strong>$189.99</strong></a>, both of which represent about $60 in savings. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe USB-C model was just released a few weeks ago and this is a great price for the newest AirPods model. Because of this, as long as the two models are around the same price, we recommend going with the AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C over Lightning.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHWRXH8B%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$59 OFF</div>AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C) for $189.99</div></a></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLastly, the high-end AirPods Max are available for <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08PZD76NP%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\"><strong>$479.99</strong></a> on Amazon, down from $549.00.
