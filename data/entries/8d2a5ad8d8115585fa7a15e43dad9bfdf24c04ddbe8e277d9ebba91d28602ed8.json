This was to ensure that a supplier wouldn’t go\nbust overnight if a new Apple design did away with components it\nmanufactured. So as iPhone volumes soared from under ten million\nunits on its launch in 2007 to more than 230 million in 2015,\nApple would encourage its suppliers to grow their non-Apple\nbusiness just as quickly. The upshot of this policy was that Apple\ngave birth to the Chinese smartphone industry.</p>\n\n<p>In 2009 most smartphones sold in China were produced by Nokia,\nSamsung, HTC and BlackBerry. But as Apple taught China’s supply\nchain how to perfect multi-touch glass and make the thousand\ncomponents within the iPhone, those suppliers took what they knew\nand offered it to Chinese companies led by Huawei, Xiaomi, Vivo\nand Oppo. Result: the local market share of such brands grew from\n10 per cent in 2009 to 35 per cent by 2011, and then to 74 per\ncent by 2014, according to Counterpoint Research. It’s no\nexaggeration to say the iPhone didn’t kill Nokia; Chinese\nimitators of the iPhone did. And the imitations were so good\nbecause Apple trained all its suppliers.</p>\n\n<p>To get this message to Beijing, Tim Cook and his deputies visited\nZhongnanhai, the citadel of communist power near the Forbidden\nCity, in May 2016. They explained that Apple wasn’t just creating\nmillions of jobs; it supported entire industries by facilitating\nan epic transfer of “tacit knowledge” — hard-to-define but\npractical know-how “in the art of making things”, as defined by\nthe China-born Federal Reserve economist Yi Wen, who believes that\nsuch knowledge was “the secret recipe” behind Britain’s Industrial\nRevolution.</p>\n\n<p>A former Apple executive says this message was “music to the ears\nof China”. Beijing had spent decades trying to catch up with the\nWest’s lead in advanced industry, scientific research and\neconomic might. It often resorted to spying, outright theft or\ncoercive tactics. But here was America’s most famous tech giant\nwillingly playing the role of Prometheus, handing the Chinese the\ngift of fire.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>McGee’s book was in the works for years, but the timing of its publication couldn’t be more serendipitous, with Trump’s stupid tariff war.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/22/excerpt-from-patrick-mcgees-apple-in-china\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"8d2a5ad8d8115585fa7a15e43dad9bfdf24c04ddbe8e277d9ebba91d28602ed8","category":"Tech"}
