I also paid full price for my Ti Desert Moose. And I’d do it again. However, just because Adam and I have a relationship that spans ten years, my integrity is very important to not only you (I’m assuming) but to the value of this website.</p>\n<p>This review is sincere and was wholly my idea.</p>\n<p>Seeing a bike that has brought me welling moments of joy and helped me better understand who I am as a person being offered at a much more affordable price point is something I’m willing to wade into conflict-of-interest territory for.</p>\n<p>With that out of the way, let’s get to it…</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/07/LittleBeltsTour-118.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/07/LittleBeltsTour-118.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/07/LittleBeltsTour-118.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/07/LittleBeltsTour-118.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-11-2.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-11-2.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-11-2.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-11-2.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-68.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-68.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-68.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/CDT-Bike-Tour-July-2023-68.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Taxonomy: Mountain Touring Bikes</h3>\n<p>There’s nothing better than a rigid mountain bike, except perhaps one with rack mounts and touring accoutrements. Mountain touring bikes are mountain bikes with rack mounts. These are different from standard mountain bikes, which lack rack mounts. Sure, you can bikepack race on any bike, but a true mountain touring bike is designed to take racks. I’ve reviewed a number of these bikes and love a lot of them but none have matched my beloved Desert Moose.</p>\n<p>The ideas that spawned this bike have been poured into the new Sklar PBJ production bike.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/SKLAR_PBJ_Touring_bike_00.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/SKLAR_PBJ_Touring_bike_00.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/SKLAR_PBJ_Touring_bike_00.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/SKLAR_PBJ_Touring_bike_00.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Sklar PBJ Quick Hits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>$1,650</strong> frame and fork</li>\n<li>Complete pricing: GX Mechanical – $<em>4,350</em></li>\n<li>Size <strong>XL</strong> reviewed; built up sans racks at <strong>31 lbs</strong></li>\n<li>Frame Material: Double-butted, heat-treated chromoly steel</li>\n<li>Designed for 485 mm AC Fork (included) or 100 mm suspension fork</li>\n<li>Chromoly steel fork, 110 x 15 mm spacing, 180 mm post mount, 1-1/8” steer tube, internal dynamo routing</li>\n<li>Fork has cargo cage mounts on either side, as well as M5 bosses mid-blade, at the dropout, and hole at the crown for a rack or fender</li>\n<li>148 x 12 mm Boost spacing</li>\n<li>160 mm post mount rear brake insert</li>\n<li>Designed for 29” x 2.6” tires (clears some 2.8’s, but this bike is meant for 2.4- 2.6″ tires)</li>\n<li>31.6 mm seat post (stealth routing for dropper)</li>\n<li>3 bottle cages: one under the down tube, 2 in the main triangle</li>\n<li>73 mm BSA bottom bracket shell</li>\n<li>EC 34 mm / 44 mm Headset</li>\n<li>Clearance for up to a 36-tooth chainring</li>\n<li>Full external cable routing</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-59.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-59.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-59.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-59.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar_PBJ_Review_Geo.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar_PBJ_Review_Geo.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar_PBJ_Review_Geo.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar_PBJ_Review_Geo.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><em>As a 6’2″ human that weighs 190 lbs with long legs and arms, the size XL with an effective top tube of 700 mm fits me perfectly…</em></p>\n<h3>Geometrically Speaking</h3>\n<p>After riding a custom geometry Sklar PBJ, I was amazed to find the XL fit me perfectly. Not just in terms of reach or extension but geometrically. While on the tour, I was riding next to Adam and remarked, “What is this seat angle? 74º?” “I think so,” he replied.</p>\n<p>The steel PBJ feels very balanced and eerily familiar. In fact, the XL geometry of the production PBJ is pretty dang close to <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/titanium-sklar-bikes-pbj-review/#:~:text=Geometrically%20Speaking\" target=\"_blank\">my custom titanium frame</a>. With a 69º head angle, the front end maintains its snappiness while handling extra cargo weight, without offering even the slightest wheel flop around tight turns. The long reach allows for easy control, too. I really like bars with backsweep on a PBJ, and the <a href=\"https://sklarbikes.com/collections/soft-goods-accessories/products/pbj-handlebar-riser-bar-for-alt-cyclists\" target=\"_blank\">Sklar PBJ bars</a> and their 28º backsweep fit this bike’s temperament quite well.</p>\n<p>The rear center on my titanium PBJ is shorter, and the production bike felt a tad longer overall. Thanks to the slider dropouts, the chainstays are slightly longer, so you can dial in the rear-end feel by adjusting the chainstay length. Because my bike was designed for 3″ tires, the bottom bracket height is about 3 mm lower than that of the production PBJ, which is specced for 2.6″ tires.</p>\n<p>My PBJ is also Super Boost and the production steel PBJ is boost-spaced.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2019/10/2019-Grinduro-Ti-Sklar-Rigid-29-MTB-17.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2019/10/2019-Grinduro-Ti-Sklar-Rigid-29-MTB-17.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2019/10/2019-Grinduro-Ti-Sklar-Rigid-29-MTB-17.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2019/10/2019-Grinduro-Ti-Sklar-Rigid-29-MTB-17.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>The OG Sklar PBJ</h3>\n<p>Back in August of 2018, while <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/a-week-of-big-sky-mountain-biking-in-bozeman/\" target=\"_blank\">visiting Bozeman – where Sklar used to be based – with a bunch of framebuilders</a>, I asked Adam to build me a custom titanium bike. My love for the Mojave Desert and solo outings in its vast, expansive mountains led me to want a bike that was lightweight, nimble, and equipped for the rugged terrain found in the world’s hottest desert.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2019/10/CalderaBikePack-54.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2019/10/CalderaBikePack-54.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2019/10/CalderaBikePack-54.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2019/10/CalderaBikePack-54.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>My requests were the frame had to have clearance for 29 x 3″ tires due to the alluvial sand, rack mounts, a long reach, with a big front triangle and straight top tube optimized for a roomy frame bag. Most importantly, I didn’t want suspension, so I wanted the bike to be flexy, giving it very important traction in this domain. For this reason, noting the size of the bike, we decided on titanium over steel. I slid into Adam’s queue, and he began to sketch out ideas, which led him to make a <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2019-grinduro-ti-sklar-super-boost-rigid-29-mtb/\" target=\"_blank\">similar steel bike for himself for Grinduro</a> the next year in 2019.</p>\n<p>Adam’s yellow bike was the OG Sklar PBJ.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2019/10/The-2019-Chris-King-Open-House-Sklar-27.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2019/10/The-2019-Chris-King-Open-House-Sklar-27.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2019/10/The-2019-Chris-King-Open-House-Sklar-27.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2019/10/The-2019-Chris-King-Open-House-Sklar-27.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/CalderaBikePack-174-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/CalderaBikePack-174-1.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/CalderaBikePack-174-1.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/04/CalderaBikePack-174-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>In late 2019, I picked up my titanium Sklar PBJ from the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/the-2019-chris-king-open-house-mercredi-mosaic-northern-pursuit-sage-sklar-speedvagen-stinner-sycip-victoire/#:~:text=Sklar%20Bikes%3A%20Ti%20Basket%20Bike\" target=\"_blank\">2019 Chris King Open House</a> and immediately took it on an overnighter <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/into-the-caldera-the-bishop-volcanic-tablelands-overnighter/\" target=\"_blank\">in Long Valley</a> en route to multiple-day rides in the Mojave. Since then, I have ridden it all over the Western United States, both loaded down for <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/deserted-dusted-and-dolomite-a-central-death-valley-bicycle-tour/\" target=\"_blank\">fully-self-supported desert exploration</a> and as a normal mountain bike. It really has been perfect and there is not a single thing I would change about it. And it oughta be that way, as the bike cost me around $10,000.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-2018-02.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-2018-02.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-2018-02.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-2018-02.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-2018-03.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-2018-03.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-2018-03.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-2018-03.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-2018-01.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-2018-01.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-2018-01.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-2018-01.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Sklar Bikes Production</h3>\n<p>As you can imagine, spending that kind of money on a bike comes with a lot of stress; both for the customer, who wants to be sure they’re making the right decisions on things like stack height, top tube length, and tire clearance, and for the builder, who wants to nail the landing, so to speak. This pressure adds up.</p>\n<p>Feeling burnt out by making custom bikes like mine, Adam began to think about making his most popular models in Taiwan to solve a few problems. Making frames ain’t easy, and any builder will tell you it’s a grind. If you only had to weld frames, it’d be one thing, but framebuilding is a small business, and with that comes a multitude of responsibilities.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-90.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-90.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-90.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-90.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>From customer emails regarding everything from bike geometry to frame finish, social media, ordering supplies, working on the complete builds, packing, shipping, and every bit of minutiae in between, it all takes a toll on sole proprietors. When I asked Adam if referring to his state of mind in 2020 as being “burnt out” was appropriate, he replied, “Yeah, man, I was ready to quit.” We’ve all been there, myself included, and I don’t actually <em>make</em> anything physical.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, I understood where he was coming from.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-2018-05.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-2018-05.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-2018-05.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-2018-05.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/From-Biocrust-With-Love-83.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/From-Biocrust-With-Love-83.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/From-Biocrust-With-Love-83.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/From-Biocrust-With-Love-83.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><em>Sam rallying his <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/a-week-of-big-sky-mountain-biking-in-bozeman/\" target=\"_blank\">Sour Patch Kids paint job rigid Sklar MTB in 2018</a> inspired me to ask Adam to build me a rigid MTB of my own…</em></p>\n<p>When you make a brand, particularly a bike brand, you want it to be accessible. As stated above, a $10,000 complete bike is anything but that. I worked my ass off to be able to afford that bike and sold two bikes and a camera to pay the bill because the bike was exactly what I wanted and I knew it’d open doors for the sort of riding I love the most.</p>\n<p>But not everyone can sell off stuff to buy more stuff, or even fathom what it means to spend that much on a bike.</p>\n<p>In 2019, Adam reached out to a Taiwanese framebuilder to inquire about moving most of his production models overseas. The first was the Super Something gravel bike, then the Tall Tale hardtail MTB, and now, the PBJ mountain touring bike. A steel US-made PBJ frameset would have run around $3,500, but the Taiwan-made PBJ frameset is only $1,650.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-57.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-57.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-57.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-57.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>On Speccing Everything</h3>\n<p>There is a common misconception that all steel bikes use the same tubing. To further this confusion, another commonly repeated thing I hear is, “That’s just a catalog bike.” While there are certainly brands that select catalog blanks, or <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/boutique-steel-bikes-taipei-cycle-show/#:~:text=a%20quick%20breakdown%3A-,Open%20Model,-%E2%80%94%20The%20factory%20designs\" target=\"_blank\">open models</a>, to rebrand as their own, or perhaps send in a frame drawing with no butting or tubing specs, also known as <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/boutique-steel-bikes-taipei-cycle-show/#:~:text=Original%20Design%20Manufacturer\" target=\"_blank\">original design manufacturing</a>, but not all Taiwanese-produced bikes are made that way.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-103.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-103.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-103.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-103.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Adam has taken the decade-plus knowledge from building US-made bikes and worked with factories to custom draw tubing to his specific butting profiles. <em>Butting is when a tube is thicker at the ends and thinner in the middle.</em> This makes a tubeset flex more or less depending on the tube profile and saves weight compared to straight-gauge tubing.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-104.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-104.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-104.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-104.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Sklar Bikes is an <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/boutique-steel-bikes-taipei-cycle-show/#:~:text=Original%20Equipment%20Manufacturer\" target=\"_blank\">original equipment manufacturer</a>. By specifying butting, diameters, and even shapes, Adam can <em>nearly</em> match the same bikes he was making in the US at a fraction of the cost. However, with an increase in production comes a few compromises. For instance, if he is to make 500 frames, he’ll err on the side of what most people would want in a bike.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-52.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-52.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-52.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-52.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>When working one-on-one with a customer, Adam can inquire about their riding style and preferred terrain. This helps him spec the correct tubing profiles and even frame material for the customer. Every builder has these conversations. I’m a big dude that rides big bikes and I like to ride my bikes pretty hard, but I’m smooth, so I prefer the bikes to be light-footed in their disposition. The best material for my bike was titanium because it offers the feel I enjoy and the strength to deliver it at the size frame I require. These decisions influence every spec.</p>\n<p>For instance, on my PBJ, he went with straight 1″ steel fork blades because they were what was available to him at the time, but on the production bikes, he went with 1 1/8″ to 1″ tapered blades because the factory in Taiwan could draw those blades custom for him. These tapered legs make for a slightly stiffer fork.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-86.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-86.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-86.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-86.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Titanium, for me, is all about the wiggly ride first and foremost. The fact that the frames are lightweight and won’t rust are secondary to the ride quality. I explained this to Adam during my ordering process and we felt like the 1″ blades for how I liked my bikes to flex made the most sense. However, most people wouldn’t jive with that feeling.</p>\n<p>It’s all a balance. A lot of production bikes are very stiff, so riders have grown accustomed to having forks that don’t flex nicely. Most of the fork flex comes at the fork ends. So a tapered fork allows for that flex while offering stiffness at the crown. Too much girth and the fork can be too stiff. Too little and it can be a noodle, flexing a lot under heavy braking.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-69.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-69.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-69.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-69.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-61.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-61.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-61.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-61.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-60.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-60.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-60.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-60.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-62.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-62.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-62.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-62.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Similar decisions are made throughout the bike. PBJ steel frames use 8/5/8 tubing with different diameters depending on the frame size. <em>8/5/8 refers to the butting profile, where the ends of the tube are .8 mm thick and the center of the tube is .5 mm thick.</em></p>\n<p>With production models, Adam is able to use cast steel yokes, as opposed to 3D sintered stainless yokes. Cast steel is stronger and cheaper to make at higher volumes, and Taiwan has the equipment to do so. His custom dropouts and fork ends are also cast.</p>\n<p>In many ways, working with Taiwan manufacturers has increased the quality of Sklar frames.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-77.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-77.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-77.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-77.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Titanium vs. Steel</h3>\n<p>I would argue less than 2% of steel Sklar PBJ customers would want the ride quality my titanium Sklar PBJ delivers. The Ti Desert Moose is a noodle. It’s super flexy. Like a spring. And I love it. I wouldn’t want it any other way! The sensation feels like it melts through rocks and chunder, finding the path of least resistance. When I load it down and shift my hips side to side, it jiggles like my love handles after week-long burrito lunches. This flexiness helps with maintaining traction, course correction, and overall fatigue at the end of the day. I don’t feel beaten up after a long day in the saddle thanks to the frame compliance.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-99.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-99.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-99.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-99.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-97.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-97.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-97.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-97.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-98.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-98.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-98.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-98.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><em>The “Moss Green” color has green hues in some environments (above) but grey in others (like in the photo below)… </em></p>\n<p>Yes, the bike is flexy, but no, the tires do not rub the fork or stays. It’s not that sort of flex. It’s butted titanium tubing, so the very long top and downtube twists in the middle, while the straight gauge stays keep the rear end planted and tracking forward.</p>\n<p>As for weight, the titanium frame is about two pounds lighter than the production PBJ steel frame.

This is a touring bike with rack mounts, so plenty of people will want to load it down heavily. However, most people might only ride the bike heavily loaded for 5-10% of the time. Adam wants the Sklar PBJ to be an all-rounder, so he designed it to ride like a normal bike unloaded while still maintaining some flexy feels when loaded.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar_Bikes_PBJ_Review_tour_BW_05.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar_Bikes_PBJ_Review_tour_BW_05.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar_Bikes_PBJ_Review_tour_BW_05.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar_Bikes_PBJ_Review_tour_BW_05.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar_Bikes_PBJ_Review_tour_BW_04.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar_Bikes_PBJ_Review_tour_BW_04.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar_Bikes_PBJ_Review_tour_BW_04.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar_Bikes_PBJ_Review_tour_BW_04.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://theradavist.com/sklar-bikes-pbj-bike-tour/\" target=\"_blank\">On our recent bike camping trip</a>, he asked me how the bike felt loaded down compared to other models I’d ridden.

It symbolizes the “catch-all” nature of the bike’s intent. Adam prides himself on making capable, fun bikes, and while a vintage MTB with a basket might be a cheap and easy entry point into the basket bike world, he wants the Sklar PBJ to be a modern equivalent without compromise.</p>\n<p>I figured since this is the “Performance Basket Jammer,” I ought to tour with a basket, which is not my preferred method of carrying gear in rough terrain. Normally, I’d use a big flap-top bag like a <a href=\"https://ronsbikes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Fab’s Chest</a> or a <a href=\"https://www.bagsxbird.com/in-stock-now\" target=\"_blank\">Bags by Bird Goldback bag</a>, with front and rear racks or a <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/shovel-research-rod-steward-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Rod Steward</a> acting as bag supports. I’ll toss on a sleeping pad, a chair, and sandals, or maybe just panniers front and rear, and leave the bar bag at home.</p>\n<p>Baskets and racks often rattle, <em>unless it’s the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/old-man-mountain-basket-and-elkhorn-rack-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Old Man Mountain Basket</a></em>, and then strapping a bag into the basket seems like a redundancy but alas, I wanted to give basket touring a solid effort before coming to a conclusion on the PBJ.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-7.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-7.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>My friends Jim and Kyle at Outer Shell let me use one of their <a href=\"https://outershell.com/shop/rack-bag-1\" target=\"_blank\">Rack Bags</a> that Nick attached to a Wald basket aboard a <a href=\"https://www.sim.works/products/obento-rack?srsltid=AfmBOopsKf_H3rT8iCboDmB8kcV2v7f2Xc2Tq3yA3hhiiMcgpbfyoPNl\" target=\"_blank\">Sim Works Obento Rack</a>. All in, this was a pretty hassle-free setup. I “hacked” the Rack Bag to operate like a randonneuring bag, extending the shock cord around the stem and stiffening the flap with a piece of acrylic rod. Inside, I put my food, jacket, and camera lens. On the climbs, I’d take my camera out of my hip bag and put it into the handlebar bag, reversing that on descents.</p>\n<p>This rando-style opening made it easy for on-the-fly deployment, and while it jostled a lot on rocky fast descents, everything was stable and secure. I think this setup would be perfect for people riding on hardpack gravel roads and pavement, or for a commuter bike, but for rough and rugged doubletrack, I still like bags like the Fab’s Chest as they weigh considerably less overall.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-4.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-4.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-4.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-4.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-45.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-45.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-45.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-45.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Sklar PBJ Rear Rack Prototype</h3>\n<p>I love rear racks and dropper posts. They solve the number one problem of carrying stuff on your bike and being able to use a dropper in what I would argue is the most elegant solution. On a tour or camping trip like ours, I like keeping the rear pretty lightweight, putting things like my sleeping bag and tent in mini panniers, with a RidgeRest pad on the top, strapped to the platform with my chair and sandals. This allows me to be able to bunnyhop and kick the rear end around while descending and still use the dropper post.</p>\n<p>These “light racks” or “bag support racks” are super prolific these days. For a heavier-duty setup, I’ll use an <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=9810ede6-4922-46d9-b096-e2993c490cc6&amp;website_id=6ec3743b-a948-4c16-9d12-4b79ac107f25&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Foldmanmountain.com%2Fproduct%2Felkhorn-bike-rack%2F\" target=\"_blank\">Old Man Mountain Elkhorn</a> or a <a href=\"https://tumbleweed.cc/collections/racks\" target=\"_blank\">Tumbleweed T-Rack/Pannier rack</a>.

Because he often makes prototype frames and components like this in-house, he has samples much faster than if he were to get them made in Taiwan, which typically has a six-month turnaround. The shakedown tour was a perfect opportunity to test it out. We made some notes, but overall, it worked out really well.</p>\n<p>More to come on that as events warrant.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-51.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-51.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-51.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-51.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Sklar PBJ Riding Notes: John on Steel</h3>\n<p>I already spoke a lot about why I love my titanium frame Sklar PBJ and why I feel like most people would prefer the steel PBJ. After the tour, I had a good idea of what the PBJ’s intent was in touring mode (and basket mode) but I was curious how it would ride as a mountain bike. Adam and I took to the singletrack that snakes around the various parks in San Francisco to try it unweighted.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-47.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-47.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-47.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-47.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Immediately, I felt like this was the terrain the PBJ was designed for. While it excelled as a tourer, as I previously noted, the bike’s intent feels more balanced on the side of the “daily driver.” Unless you’re out on a dedicated tour for years on end, there’s probably not much reason to go all-in on a stout touring bike. The steel PBJ balances the ability to strap racks and bags to it and handle it all with sure-footed confidence with being damn fun unloaded in XC singletrack bike too.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-48.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-48.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-48.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-48.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The frame movement is noticeable but not noodly like my titanium bike. The fork isn’t as flexy since its tapered blades add a smidge of stiffness. Sitting on the saddle and rocking your hips side to side while riding on pavement provides some lovely, comfortable sway. Overall, I feel like most people will adore the ride quality of the steel chassis and would probably be sketched out by the titanium frame’s flex.<br />\nBeing able to rally the bike on inner-city singletrack really made the whole experience feel complete for me.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-58.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-58.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-58.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-58.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I like that the geometry is mostly the same as my titanium PBJ because it offered a true frame material test. The 74º seat angle is honestly the perfect middle ground for a bike that’s meant to be ridden on mixed terrains. Rigid bikes with super steep, like 77º, seat angles can be ass-hatchets, since you’re so close to being over the top of the bottom bracket. A slacker seat angle allows for some springiness.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-50.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-50.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-50.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-50.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-49.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-49.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-49.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-49.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>As we were heading out on our third day, Nick and I were chatting about the difference between the two bikes. When I bought my titanium Sklar PBJ, Adam didn’t offer production frames, so I paid a premium. Nick noted, “I’d rather have the $4,000 complete bike with $6000 left over to pay for a big, long tour than the $10,000 complete custom bike…”</p>\n<p>He’s onto something there. So let’s hand the mic over to Nick…</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Bike-Tour-90.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Bike-Tour-90.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Bike-Tour-90.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Bike-Tour-90.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Bike-Tour-130.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Bike-Tour-130.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Bike-Tour-130.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Bike-Tour-130.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Sklar PBJ Riding Notes: Nick on Titanium</h3>\n<p><em> Disclosure: Nick works as a copywriter and editor for The Radavist and Sklar Bikes, so we’ll be mindful of the very obvious conflict of interest here.

It’s been used primarily as a rigid mountain bike and daily commuter, so my PBJ has been naked; that is, unloaded and rack-free. Without baggage, it’s a lithe and fun all-terrain romper. The steel tubing flexes and pops like a sprinter out of the blocks, and the big 2.6″ tires offer all the traction that I’ve needed in the damp shoulder season in Northern California.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-92.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-92.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-92.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-92.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-105.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-105.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-105.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-105.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-106.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-106.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-106.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-106.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Since I got my hands on the bike, I’ve wanted to try out my PBJ as a touring rig. I imagined something set up similar to the Desert Moose, a bike that occupies a top slot on my imaginary <em>Dream ATB Touring Bike</em> moodboard. Imagine my excitement when John pitched the idea to switch bikes and go on a mini-tour with Adam. I was stoked!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Bike-Tour-36.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Bike-Tour-36.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Bike-Tour-36.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Bike-Tour-36.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Over the past few days, I’ve had the chance to pedal with several of my favorite bike people through the coastal landscapes and idyllic redwood forests of West Marin aboard a bike that I’ve drooled over. I had a big dumb grin on my face the entire time. The Ti Moose rode like a dream, although its riding characteristics were distinctly different from what I expected.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Bike-Tour-101.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Bike-Tour-101.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Bike-Tour-101.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Bike-Tour-101.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>This thing is a wiggle machine! The entire frame slithers like a snake over obstacles when climbing or descending. I can say without a doubt that it’s the most flexy rigid bike that I’ve ever piloted. After getting used to it, I truly enjoyed the feeling. It took the edge off of some of the chunky serpentine descents on Tam. But it’s an acquired taste, and like many idiosyncratic inventions, it’s not for everyone.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Bike-Tour-122.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Bike-Tour-122.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Bike-Tour-122.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Bike-Tour-122.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I’d say that the steel PBJ is the zenith of everything Adam Sklar has been refining within the past decade as a framebuilder. While the Ti Desert Moose is a unique one-off creation with some interesting ride characteristics, the steel PBJ is the best version of the PBJ platform. It’s affordable, it’s utilitarian (but still performance-oriented – this thing truly rips on trail), it’s a gorgeous and well-made frame, and it’s a great option for those of us who want a touring bike that also serves as a daily driver and an all-purpose fun bike.</p>\n<p>My opinion may be very biased, but I stand by my word.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-44.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-44.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-44.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-44.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>TL;DR</h3>\n<p>We create strong connections to our bikes, pushing ourselves and them to the test on life-changing rides and tours. Some of my fondest memories are on my beloved Ti Sklar PBJ. It’s a dream bike. Adam Sklar wanted to make dream bikes for more people, so he took the same DNA from my custom Ti PBJ and produced bikes made of steel in Taiwan for a fraction of the cost.</p>\n<p>In a world where bikes can be very complicated, the PBJ offers simplicity and balance in a completely steel chassis that is a literal “catch all” for most people’s daily riding. Its 60/40 split between being a daily driver and touring ally. That means it pedals smoothly unloaded and still offers some compliance while loaded down.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-96.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-96.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-96.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Sklar-Bikes-PBJ-Review-96.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Its geometry is zippy but comfortable, tire clearance is plentiful, and best of all, the bike feels light on your feet. While I’d never give up ye olde Desert Moose, it’s really fucking cool that the bike model that has brought me so much joy over the years is now available at a fraction of the cost. Priced competitively at $1,650 for a frame and fork or a complete starting at $4,399, it’s a great deal for a great platform.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sklarbikes.com/collections/bikes/products/pbj\" target=\"_blank\">Sklar Bikes</a> is currently holding a pre-order for the first production run of steel PBJ frames, with a July 2025 delivery date.
