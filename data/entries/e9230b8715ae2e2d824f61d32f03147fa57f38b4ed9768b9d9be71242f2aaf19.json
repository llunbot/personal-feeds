{"title":"iOS Voice Dictation Bug (?) Briefly Flashes the Word ‘Trump’ When You Say ‘Racist’","link":"https://www.theverge.com/news/619434/apple-fixing-voice-transcription-bug-trump-racist","date":1740596546000,"content":"\n<p>Chris Welch, writing at The Verge:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple has acknowledged a peculiar bug with the iPhone’s\ndictation feature that briefly displays “Trump” when someone\nsays the word “racist.” The Verge has been unable to reproduce\nthe issue, but it picked up attention on Tuesday after a video\ndemonstrating the strange substitution <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@user9586420191789/video/7472830639327366446\">went viral on\nTikTok</a> and other social media.</p>\n\n<p>The company provided a statement to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/technology/iphone-dictation-trump-racist.html\">The New York Times</a> and\n<a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/tech/apple-iphones-voice-to-text-feature-periodically-shows-trump-when-user-says-racist\">Fox News</a> confirming the bug. “We are aware of an issue with\nthe speech recognition model that powers dictation, and we are\nrolling out a fix as soon as possible,” an unnamed spokesperson\nsaid, according to Fox News.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/technology/iphone-dictation-trump-racist.html\">the Times story</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The issue appeared to begin after an update to Apple’s servers,\nsaid John Burkey, the founder of Wonderrush.ai, an artificial\nintelligence start-up, and a former member of Apple’s Siri team\nwho is still in regular contact with the team.</p>\n\n<p>But he said that it was unlikely that the data that Apple has\ncollected for its artificial intelligence offerings was causing\nthe problem, and the word correcting itself was likely an\nindication that the issue was not just technical. Instead, he\nsaid, there was probably software code somewhere on Apple’s\nsystems that caused iPhones to write the word “Trump” when someone\nsaid “racist.”</p>\n\n<p>“This smells like a serious prank,” Mr. Burkey said. “The only\nquestion is: Did someone slip this into the data or slip into\nthe code?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Paul Kafasis (my guest on <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2025/02/24/ep-417\">the latest episode</a> of The Talk Show) <a href=\"https://onefoottsunami.com/2025/02/26/theyre-certainly-synonyms/\">captured a video of the glitch in action</a>. I guess it could be a protest prank from a rogue employee, but I suspect it’s just a machine learning glitch — maybe caused by the fact that Trump’s name gets mentioned alongside “racist” so often? It’s definitely a little weird, but all sorts of things about Siri are a little weird.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/26/trump-racist-speech-to-text-glitch\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"e9230b8715ae2e2d824f61d32f03147fa57f38b4ed9768b9d9be71242f2aaf19","category":"Tech"}
