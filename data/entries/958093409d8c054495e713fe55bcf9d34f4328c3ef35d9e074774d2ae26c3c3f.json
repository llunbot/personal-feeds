Twin solid-fueled boosters and a hydrogen-fueled core stage engine powered the Ariane 6 through thick clouds on an arcing trajectory north from the spaceport on South America's northeastern coast.</p>\n<p>The rocket shed its strap-on boosters a little more than two minutes into the flight, then jettisoned its core stage nearly eight minutes after liftoff. The spent rocket parts fell into the Atlantic Ocean. The upper stage's Vinci engine ignited two times to reach a nearly circular polar orbit about 500 miles (800 kilometers) above the Earth. A little more than an hour after launch, the Ariane 6 upper stage deployed CSO-3, a sharp-eyed French military spy satellite, to begin a mission providing optical surveillance imagery to French intelligence agencies and military forces.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/03/when-europe-needed-it-most-the-ariane-6-rocket-finally-delivered/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/03/when-europe-needed-it-most-the-ariane-6-rocket-finally-delivered/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"958093409d8c054495e713fe55bcf9d34f4328c3ef35d9e074774d2ae26c3c3f","category":"Tech"}
