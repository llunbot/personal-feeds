And now, fine-tuning the Kitsuma is even more intuitive, so you spend less time fiddling, and more time riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cane Creek Kitsuma Gen 2 air &amp; coil shocks updated</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Cane-Creek-Kitsuma-G2-gravity-mountain-bike-air-or-coil-shock-upgrade_riding-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Cane-Creek-Kitsuma-G2-gravity-mountain-bike-air-or-coil-shock-upgrade_riding-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Cane Creek Kitsuma G2 gravity mountain bike air &amp; coil shocks upgraded, riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Cane-Creek-Kitsuma-G2-gravity-mountain-bike-air-or-coil-shock-upgrade_riding-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Cane-Creek-Kitsuma-G2-gravity-mountain-bike-air-or-coil-shock-upgrade_riding-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Cane-Creek-Kitsuma-G2-gravity-mountain-bike-air-or-coil-shock-upgrade_riding-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Cane-Creek-Kitsuma-G2-gravity-mountain-bike-air-or-coil-shock-upgrade_riding-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Cane-Creek-Kitsuma-G2-gravity-mountain-bike-air-or-coil-shock-upgrade_riding-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(Photos/Cane Creek)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Fine-tuning your suspension setup is undeniably one of the most important steps to getting the most out of a mountain bike, and to simply going faster downhill. But ultimately shock tuning is a fiddly process and can be time consuming to get it dialed. And many times, stock shocks get custom tunes just for a particular bike’s suspension that can even limit how much the end-user can adjust it to their individual rider preference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is essentially Cane Creek’s rationale for the wide range of adjustability in all of its twin-tube Double Barrel dampers. And comparing it to the rest of their shocks, the “<em>Kitsuma’s twin tube damper moves the most oil through the external adjusters, giving the rider the most freedom to select the ride that they need to suit their environment, ride style, and personal preferences.</em>“</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That easy, wide-ranging adjustability is also why Cane Creek gave the Kitsuma shocks separate tool-free high- &amp; low-speed damping and compression dials <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/cane-creek-db-kitsuma-shocks-get-easy-tool-free-tuning-increased-damping-range-more/\" target=\"_blank\">from their 1st generation debut</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now they’ve made personalizing your tune even simpler, again.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Cane-Creek-Kitsuma-G2-gravity-mountain-bike-air-or-coil-shock-upgrade_flip-to-climb-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Cane-Creek-Kitsuma-G2-gravity-mountain-bike-air-or-coil-shock-upgrade_flip-to-climb-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Cane Creek Kitsuma G2 gravity mountain bike air &amp;

And yet, Cane Creek decided to lower the price point of their gravity-leaning, US-made Kitsuma G2 shocks by more than 10% across the board to improve their affordability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their first generation DB Kitsuma sold for $780/730 (Air/Coil). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, the newly updated Cane Creek Kitsuma Air G2 retails for $700. And the new Cane Creek Kitsuma Coil G2 is just $650. Standard Valt coil springs add $80, or $99 for progressive rate Valt coil springs.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Cane-Creek-Kitsuma-G2-2nd-gen-gravity-mountain-bike-rear-shock-upgrades_coil-metric-or-Trunnion-mount-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Cane-Creek-Kitsuma-G2-2nd-gen-gravity-mountain-bike-rear-shock-upgrades_coil-metric-or-Trunnion-mount-scaled.webp\" alt=\"2024 Cane Creek Kitsuma G2 2nd gen gravity mountain bike coil shocks get upgraded at lower price, \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Cane-Creek-Kitsuma-G2-2nd-gen-gravity-mountain-bike-rear-shock-upgrades_coil-metric-or-Trunnion-mount-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Cane-Creek-Kitsuma-G2-2nd-gen-gravity-mountain-bike-rear-shock-upgrades_coil-metric-or-Trunnion-mount-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Cane-Creek-Kitsuma-G2-2nd-gen-gravity-mountain-bike-rear-shock-upgrades_coil-metric-or-Trunnion-mount-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Cane-Creek-Kitsuma-G2-2nd-gen-gravity-mountain-bike-rear-shock-upgrades_coil-metric-or-Trunnion-mount-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Cane-Creek-Kitsuma-G2-2nd-gen-gravity-mountain-bike-rear-shock-upgrades_coil-metric-or-Trunnion-mount-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Cane-Creek-Kitsuma-G2-2nd-gen-gravity-mountain-bike-rear-shock-upgrades_coil-metric-or-Trunnion-mount-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Cane-Creek-Kitsuma-G2-2nd-gen-gravity-mountain-bike-rear-shock-upgrades_coil-metric-or-Trunnion-mount-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Cane-Creek-Kitsuma-G2-2nd-gen-gravity-mountain-bike-rear-shock-upgrades_coil-metric-or-Trunnion-mount-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Kitsuma Coil G2, with or without Valt spring (<em>sold separately</em>)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Cane Creek offers factory-direct shock servicing, or you can send it every year to one of their 50+ certified service centers around the world to make sure you keep getting the best out of your mountain bike’s suspension</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Cane-Creek-Kitsuma-G2-2nd-gen-gravity-mountain-bike-air-or-coil-shock-upgrades_riding-new-air-shock-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Cane-Creek-Kitsuma-G2-2nd-gen-gravity-mountain-bike-air-or-coil-shock-upgrades_riding-new-air-shock-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Cane Creek Kitsuma G2 gravity mountain bike air or coil shock upgrade, riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Cane-Creek-Kitsuma-G2-2nd-gen-gravity-mountain-bike-air-or-coil-shock-upgrades_riding-new-air-shock-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Cane-Creek-Kitsuma-G2-2nd-gen-gravity-mountain-bike-air-or-coil-shock-upgrades_riding-new-air-shock-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Cane-Creek-Kitsuma-G2-2nd-gen-gravity-mountain-bike-air-or-coil-shock-upgrades_riding-new-air-shock-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Cane-Creek-Kitsuma-G2-2nd-gen-gravity-mountain-bike-air-or-coil-shock-upgrades_riding-new-air-shock-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Cane-Creek-Kitsuma-G2-2nd-gen-gravity-mountain-bike-air-or-coil-shock-upgrades_riding-new-air-shock-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Get your new Kitsuma direct from Cane Creek or select dealers starting today.
