And now the company is working on fusing this fast-moving, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/ai-powered-bing-chat-loses-its-mind-when-fed-ars-technica-article/\">sometimes unsettling</a> new technology with some old headaches: ads.</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://blogs.bing.com/search/march_2023/Driving-more-traffic-and-value-to-publishers-from-the-new-Bing\">a blog post earlier this week</a>, Microsoft VP Yusuf Mehdi said the company was \"exploring placing ads in the chat experience,\" one of several things the company is doing \"to share the ad revenue with partners whose content contributed to the chat response.\" The company is also looking into ways to let Bing Chat show sources for its work, sort of like the ways Google, Bing, and other search engines display a source link below snippets of information they think might answer the question you asked.</p>\n<div><img alt=\"One of Microsoft's experimental formats for highlighting information sources in Bing Chat. \" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/bing-chat-sources.png\" /><p>One of Microsoft's experimental formats for highlighting information sources in Bing Chat.
