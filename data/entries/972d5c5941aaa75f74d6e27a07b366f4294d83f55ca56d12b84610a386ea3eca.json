{"title":"★ Holy Hell, Trump Did Use Twitter Direct Messages, There Were ‘Many’ of Them, and the Special Counsel Now Has Them","link":"https://daringfireball.net/2023/08/holy_hell_trump_did_use_dms","date":1692156625000,"content":"\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/15/politics/special-counsel-twitter-messages-trump/index.html\">Katelyn Polantz, reporting for CNN</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The special counsel’s investigation into Donald Trump and the\naftermath of the 2020 election sought the former president’s\nTwitter direct messages, of which there were many, federal\nprosecutors and lawyers for Twitter revealed in newly unsealed\ntranscripts from February court hearings about the search\nwarrant. [...]</p>\n\n<p>A lawyer representing Twitter, now called “X,” similarly confirmed\nin court that Trump’s account had several private messages between\nusers on the platform. “X” was able to find both the sent direct\nmessages and deleted messages for prosecutors, according to the\ntranscripts.</p>\n\n<p>“We were able to determine that there was some volume in that for\nthis account. There are confidential communications,” a lawyer for\nTwitter said about @realDonaldTrump’s direct messages.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/15/us/politics/trump-twitter-direct-messages-warrant.html\">Alan Feuer and Maggie Haberman, reporting for The New York Times</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>While it remained unclear what sorts of information the messages\ncontained and who exactly may have written them, it was a\nrevelation that there were private messages associated with the\nTwitter account of Mr. Trump, who has famously been cautious about\nusing written forms of communications in his dealings with aides\nand allies.</p>\n\n<p>The papers included transcripts of hearings in Federal District\nCourt in Washington in February during which Judge Beryl A. Howell\nasserted that Mr. Smith’s office had sought Mr. Trump’s direct\nmessages — or DMs — from Twitter as part of a search warrant it\nexecuted on the account in January.</p>\n\n<p>In one of the transcripts, a lawyer for Twitter, answering\nquestions from Judge Howell, confirmed that the company had turned\nover to the special counsel’s office “all direct messages, the\nDMs” from Mr. Trump’s Twitter account, including those sent,\nreceived and “stored in draft form.”</p>\n\n<p>The lawyer for Twitter told Judge Howell that the company had\nfound both “deleted” and “nondeleted” direct messages associated\nwith Mr. Trump’s account.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I am not at all surprised that “deleted” DMs are not in fact deleted, but rather hidden. I am slightly surprised that Trump — famously averse not just to using email and text messages, but <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/25/us/politics/trump-texting.html\">even to his own lawyers taking written notes in meetings</a>, so as not to leave a chain of evidence for his lifelong criminal activity — would use, of all things, the <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/after-weeks-hack-it-past-time-twitter-end-end-encrypt-direct-messages\">infamously unencrypted</a> direct messaging feature on Twitter. To be clear, this is a pleasant surprise.</p>\n\n<p>Kyle Cheney, reporting for Politico, “<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/15/special-counsel-obtained-trump-twitter-howell-00111410\">Special Counsel Obtained Trump DMs Despite ‘Momentous’ Bid by Twitter to Delay, Unsealed Filings Show</a>”:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Among the data the search warrant commanded Twitter to produce:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Accounts associated with @realdonaldtrump that the former\npresident might have used in the same device.</li>\n<li>Devices used to log into the @realdonaldtrump account.</li>\n<li>IP addresses used to log into the account between October 2020\nand January 2021.</li>\n<li>Privacy settings and history.</li>\n<li>All tweets “created, drafted, favorited/liked, or retweeted” by\n@realdonaldtrump, including any subsequently deleted.</li>\n<li>All direct messages “sent from, received by, stored in draft\nform in, or otherwise associated with” @realdonaldtrump.</li>\n<li>All records of searches from October 2020 to January 2021.</li>\n<li>Location information for the user of @realdonaldtrump from\nOctober 2020 to January 2021.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2023/08/trump_dms\">As I speculated last week</a>, nothing you do on Twitter is private. Not your DMs, not your “deleted” DMs, not your searches, not your location (if you’re foolish enough to grant Twitter/X access to it), not your draft posts.</p>\n\n<p>Elon Musk comes out of this looking like he’d happily fellate Trump:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Ultimately, U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell held Twitter in\ncontempt of court in February, fining the company $350,000 for\nmissing a court-ordered deadline to comply with Smith’s search\nwarrant. But the newly unsealed transcripts of the proceedings in\nher courtroom show that the fine was the least of the punishment.\nHowell lit into Twitter for taking “extraordinary” and apparently\nunprecedented steps to give Trump advance notice about the search\nwarrant — despite prosecutors’ warnings, backed by unspecified\nevidence, that notifying Trump could cause grave damage to their\ninvestigation.</p>\n\n<p>“Is this to make Donald Trump feel like he is a particularly\nwelcomed new renewed user of Twitter?” Howell asked.</p>\n\n<p>“Twitter has no interest other than litigation its constitutional\nrights,” replied attorney George Varghese of WilmerHale, the firm\nTwitter deploys for much of its litigation.</p>\n\n<p>But Howell returned to the theme repeatedly during the\nproceedings, wondering why the company was taking “momentous”\nsteps to protect Trump that it had never taken for other users. In\nthe hearing on Feb. 7, 2023, Howell referenced Musk, asking: “Is\nit because the new CEO wants to cozy up with the former\npresident?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dcd.uscourts.gov/sites/dcd/files/23sc31%20Attachment%20A%20-%20Documents%20unsealed%20with%20redactions.pdf\">The unsealed court filing (PDF) is here</a>, for your reading enjoyment.
