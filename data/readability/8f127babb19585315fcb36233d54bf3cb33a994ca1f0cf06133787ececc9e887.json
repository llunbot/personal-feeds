It’s specifically designed to be used as a tubeless tire, which means, thankfully, it’s relatively easy to set up…which shouldn’t come as a surprise.</p><p>Schwalbe was one of the first to offer a high-performance, low-weight tubeless road bike tire years before others. And, they claim it’s their best performing road bike tire, bar none, even outperforming the tubular tires their pros were riding.</p><p>These tires rate highly in every department – grip, durability, low rolling resistance, and low weight. They even add a 14mm wide puncture protection belt under the tread cap to protect against cuts and pokes.

AW3</a> (“All Weather”) is designed to be more flat resistant than other road tires, especially when the going gets rough. They also come in the widest size range out of any tire we have on this list, and the inclusion of a 38mm wide option makes them ‘gravel adjacent’.</p><p>Meaning, it’s a great tire if your rides sometimes include a few dirt roads or crushed-stone bike paths…or just a lot of rainy days. It has more texture to it than other road tires, with channels to wick water and dimples to improve traction in corners.</p><p>Independent testing by Wheel Energy in Finland found these tires were 78% stronger in terms of puncture protection compared to previous iterations, thanks to an aramid/nylon weave under the rubber tread.</p><ul><li>Size: 700c x 25, 28, 32, 38mm</li><li>Weight: 305g (700×28)</li><li>Tubeless ready: No</li><li>MSRP: $60</li></ul><p><strong>PROS</strong>: Impressively flat-resistant, great traction in adverse conditions<br><strong>CONS</strong>: Heavy<br></p><h2>Road Tire Buyer’s Guide</h2><p><strong>Know the tire size.</strong> Tires are usually listed as diameter x width. For example, a “700×28” tire will fit a 700c wheel (which is what most road bikes use) and the tire will measure about 28mm wide once mounted. The actual tire width will vary slightly by manufacturer and by the width of the rim it’s mounted on.</p><p><strong>Know your wheel size.</strong> Most road bikes will use standard 700c (or 28-inch) tires, but double check what size tires are on your bike right now, just to be sure.</p><p><strong>Know how wide you can go.</strong> Your bike will have a certain tire clearance. Most road bikes can fit up to a 28mm tire. Road riders often use between 23mm and 25mm, though more are shifting to the slightly wider 28mm for more comfort, since wider tires provide a cushier ride and, counterintuitively, can be faster and more efficient, too.</p><p>Bikes with rim brakes typically max out at 28mm, but many modern disc brake road bikes can comfortably fit a 32mm tire. Just check with your bike’s manufacturer to confirm before ordering, this spec is usually listed on their websites for each model. Or just Google it.</p><p><strong>Know what type of tire you want</strong>. There are three types of road tires:</p><ul><li>Clincher: The most common road tires, these tires require a tube. They’re the easiest to install and change out for different conditions, and often the cheapest option.</li><li>Tubeless: As the name implies, these tires use a strip of tape on your wheel’s rim plus an ultra-snug fit and some sealant rather than a tube. Originally a mountain bike staple, they made their way to cyclocross and road in recent years. (Tires that are tubeless-compatible can also be used with a tube if necessary, but rarely is the reverse true).</li><li>Tubular: Some racers still swear by tubulars, tires that are all-in-one with tubes, the tire, plus a casing that is glued to the rim of the wheel. It’s a messy process, and very old-school. Unless you have a compelling reason to use tubulars, stick to clinchers or tubeless.</li></ul><p><strong>Consider the roads you ride.</strong> If you tend to ride bumpy roads, consider a wider, burlier tire that’s designed with comfort and flat protection in mind. If you do a lot of smooth, fast group riding, you can likely get away with a more narrow tire in a lighter-weight, racier style.</p><p><strong>Consider your goals.</strong> Do you care about going faster in training, or do you prefer to avoid flats? This isn’t to say that every racy tire will wear out fast or immediately puncture, but the more lightweight and speedy a tire, the less longevity it tends to have.</p><p><strong>Check the size twice before you hit Buy.</strong> Sometimes sales are too good to be true, and a certain tire might only be on clearance in a size that won’t fit your bike.</p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Road Tires</h2><p><strong>How much do road tires cost?</strong><br>You can spend anywhere from $20 to $150 on road tires. As with most things, the best value lies somewhere in the middle: Tires in the $50-80 range will typically have the benefits of a pricier tire without the hefty price tag. You may end up with slightly heavier, less supple tires, but they’ll also likely be more durable and longer-lasting.</p><p><strong>Are road tires directional?</strong><br>Some are, some aren’t. If it clearly has a tread pattern, it likely has a direction. Look for the way the arrows or chevrons on the tread are oriented to help you figure out which way to mount your tire -they usually point forward on the top of the tire- but also check the sidewall for an actual directional arrow to confirm.</p><figure id=\"attachment_242048\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-242048\"><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Goodyear-Eagle-F1-Vector-4-season-tubeless-ready-road-bike-tires-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Goodyear-Eagle-F1-Vector-4-season-tubeless-ready-road-bike-tires-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Goodyear-Eagle-F1-Vector-4-season-tubeless-ready-road-bike-tires-1.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Goodyear-Eagle-F1-Vector-4-season-tubeless-ready-road-bike-tires-1-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Goodyear-Eagle-F1-Vector-4-season-tubeless-ready-road-bike-tires-1-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Goodyear-Eagle-F1-Vector-4-season-tubeless-ready-road-bike-tires-1-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Goodyear-Eagle-F1-Vector-4-season-tubeless-ready-road-bike-tires-1-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Goodyear-Eagle-F1-Vector-4-season-tubeless-ready-road-bike-tires-1-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Goodyear-Eagle-F1-Vector-4-season-tubeless-ready-road-bike-tires-1-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Goodyear-Eagle-F1-Vector-4-season-tubeless-ready-road-bike-tires-1-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Goodyear-Eagle-F1-Vector-4-season-tubeless-ready-road-bike-tires-1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Goodyear-Eagle-F1-Vector-4-season-tubeless-ready-road-bike-tires-1.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Goodyear-Eagle-F1-Vector-4-season-tubeless-ready-road-bike-tires-1-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Goodyear-Eagle-F1-Vector-4-season-tubeless-ready-road-bike-tires-1-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Goodyear-Eagle-F1-Vector-4-season-tubeless-ready-road-bike-tires-1-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Goodyear-Eagle-F1-Vector-4-season-tubeless-ready-road-bike-tires-1-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Goodyear-Eagle-F1-Vector-4-season-tubeless-ready-road-bike-tires-1-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Goodyear-Eagle-F1-Vector-4-season-tubeless-ready-road-bike-tires-1-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Goodyear-Eagle-F1-Vector-4-season-tubeless-ready-road-bike-tires-1-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-242048\">Showing French and ETRTO measurements on the Goodyear tires.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>What do the numbers on the tire mean?<br></strong>We explained the tire sizing above, but some tires list their sizes differently. Important to note: Most tires list sizing in French or Inch style, and most road tires will be 700c and 28-inch.</p><ul><li>French size specification: What you see on most road tires. This is listed as the approximate <em><span>outer</span></em> diameter of the tire as well as the width. Example: 700-33c</li><li>European Tyre and Rim Technical Organization (ETRTO): Sizing is by tire width in millimeters and the <em><span>inner</span></em> diameter of the tire in millimeters. Example: 33-622</li><li>Inch classification: Similar to the French specification, but in inches, which can make it much less precise. Example: 28×1.3</li></ul><p><strong>Can I run different tires for my front and rear?</strong><br>For sure. Some racers and gear enthusiasts might prefer to stick to a matching set, but in general, mixing and matching won’t be a problem. Though unlike in mountain biking where there are potential benefits to a specific front tire and specific rear tire for traction, road riders will not notice a major difference.</p><p><strong>What tire pressure should I run?</strong><br>Tires will have a range of PSI (pounds per square inch) that indicates how much air you can pump into them. The lower you go, the more rubber will connect with the ground, which will give you more traction, comfort, and control. And tubeless tires let you safely run lower tire pressures without fear of pinch flatting a tube.</p><p>The higher you go, the firmer your ride will be. While this may feel faster, research has proven that lower tire pressures actually improve efficiency and decrease rolling resistance because the tire can absorb tiny vibrations and imperfections in the road, rolling faster and more smoothly.</p><figure id=\"attachment_239072\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-239072\"><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Topeak-Joe-Blow-2-stage-pump-d-flash-fenders-8.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Topeak-Joe-Blow-2-stage-pump-d-flash-fenders-8.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Topeak-Joe-Blow-2-stage-pump-d-flash-fenders-8.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Topeak-Joe-Blow-2-stage-pump-d-flash-fenders-8-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Topeak-Joe-Blow-2-stage-pump-d-flash-fenders-8-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Topeak-Joe-Blow-2-stage-pump-d-flash-fenders-8-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Topeak-Joe-Blow-2-stage-pump-d-flash-fenders-8-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Topeak-Joe-Blow-2-stage-pump-d-flash-fenders-8-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Topeak-Joe-Blow-2-stage-pump-d-flash-fenders-8-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Topeak-Joe-Blow-2-stage-pump-d-flash-fenders-8-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Topeak-Joe-Blow-2-stage-pump-d-flash-fenders-8.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Topeak-Joe-Blow-2-stage-pump-d-flash-fenders-8.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Topeak-Joe-Blow-2-stage-pump-d-flash-fenders-8-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Topeak-Joe-Blow-2-stage-pump-d-flash-fenders-8-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Topeak-Joe-Blow-2-stage-pump-d-flash-fenders-8-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Topeak-Joe-Blow-2-stage-pump-d-flash-fenders-8-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Topeak-Joe-Blow-2-stage-pump-d-flash-fenders-8-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Topeak-Joe-Blow-2-stage-pump-d-flash-fenders-8-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Topeak-Joe-Blow-2-stage-pump-d-flash-fenders-8-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-239072\">Check your tire pressure before rides.</figcaption></figure><p>There’s a sweet spot between squirmy and firm, so experiment to see what works best for you.

Tubeless tires don’t require tubes and instead use a tape around the wheel’s inner rim to seal off the spokes, then sealant is poured into the tire and the tire is seated, usually using an air compressor or a bike pump with a second chamber in order to add enough air quickly to get the tires to ‘sit’ on the rim of the wheel.</p><figure id=\"attachment_265655\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-265655\"><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/16162036/Sealant-prize-pack-1200x800-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/16162036/Sealant-prize-pack-1200x800-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/16162036/Sealant-prize-pack-1200x800-1.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/16162036/Sealant-prize-pack-1200x800-1-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/16162036/Sealant-prize-pack-1200x800-1-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/16162036/Sealant-prize-pack-1200x800-1-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/16162036/Sealant-prize-pack-1200x800-1-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/16162036/Sealant-prize-pack-1200x800-1-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/16162036/Sealant-prize-pack-1200x800-1-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/16162036/Sealant-prize-pack-1200x800-1-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/16162036/Sealant-prize-pack-1200x800-1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/16162036/Sealant-prize-pack-1200x800-1.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/16162036/Sealant-prize-pack-1200x800-1-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/16162036/Sealant-prize-pack-1200x800-1-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/16162036/Sealant-prize-pack-1200x800-1-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/16162036/Sealant-prize-pack-1200x800-1-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/16162036/Sealant-prize-pack-1200x800-1-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/16162036/Sealant-prize-pack-1200x800-1-1068x712.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/16162036/Sealant-prize-pack-1200x800-1-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-265655\">Setting up tubeless tires.</figcaption></figure><p>The sealant does exactly what you’d assume it would: Keeps the air sealed into your tire, even if you get a small puncture or you hit an obstacle hard and pinch your tire. They’re less prone to flats because of that, despite the fact that they can be run at lower pressures.</p><p>Modern road tubeless wheels and tires are now mostly standardized for fit, making them easier to mount and remove. And most of our recommended tires set up tubeless quite easily. However, there are outliers, and it can be messy, so if you’re not much of a mechanic, you may want to stick to regular tubes while you build your skills. Or have your local bike shop set it up for you.</p><p>One caveat: Tubeless tires typically need to be reinflated more often than tubes, possibly before every ride.

Where standard clincher rims have a small hook at the top that helps trap the tire’s bead, hookless rims don’t.</p><p>While they originated on mountain bike tires where we run lower tire pressures, hookless designs are moving into gravel and road, and that’s a good thing. The rims can be made simultaneously stronger <em>and</em> lighter, and they generally improve the tire’s mounted profile and performance, too.</p><p>That said, there are two caveats: First, your tire must be approved for TSS use, and not every tubeless tire is. We listed that spec in our tire choices above, but you should look for that on your tire’s packaging or website to confirm.</p><p>You can also check your wheel’s website for lists. <a href=\"https://support.sram.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050355593-What-tubeless-tires-are-compatible-with-Zipp-s-hookless-rims-\">Zipp lists the hookless-compatible options here</a>, and <a href=\"https://support.enve.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039510011-Hookless-Tire-Compatibility-List\">ENVE has a list here</a>.</p><p>Tire brands like <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2015/01/29/why-isnt-road-tubeless-more-popular-part-two-current-options-challenges-whats-coming-down-the-road/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hutchinson have lists of specific rims</a> that are compatible with their tires, while companies like Schwalbe <a href=\"https://www.schwalbe.com/en/tubeless-laufradanforderungen\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">are a bit more open-ended about it</a>,&nbsp;saying that while the Pro One tires are designed to meet hookless requirements, they’re still only “basically compatible”. And Specialized told us their S-WorksTurbo RapidAir was designed to be universally hookless compatible, but has only <em>officially</em> been tested and approved with Zipp’s latest TSS rims, and then <a href=\"https://support.sram.com/hc/de/articles/360050355593-Welche-Tubeless-Reifen-sind-mit-den-Zipp-Hookless-Felgen-kompatibel-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">only for some combinations</a>.</p><p>Second, TSS rims are <em>ONLY</em> for tubeless use…never install or ride a tube-type clincher tire on these rims. That said, you <em>can</em> install a tube on these rims if you end up flatting and your sealant isn’t doing its job, but <em>ONLY</em> with a TSS-approved tubeless tire.

Each tire company will have their own unique synthetic or natural rubber compounds and blends, some designed to be lighter and faster, others designed to be longer lasting.</p><p>Two popular ingredients are silica and graphene, both of which help improve grip and durability. Most mid-level and high-performance tires have at least one if not both of these, albeit sometimes with fancy names…but they’re essentially the same base ingredients across all brands.</p><p>All tires wrap the rubber around an inner casing, usually a woven nylon fabric. Many tires also have reinforcements using protective materials like Kevlar to help protect you from flats. (Want more? <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2018/08/07/tire-tech-designing-an-xc-tire-from-the-ground-up/\">We have&nbsp;a deep dive on tire construction right here.</a>)</p><p><strong>What does a tire’s TPI rating mean?</strong><br>TPI—threads per inch—is used to notate what type of casing a tire has. Most “performance” tires will start at 60tpi, which is great for most riders and has a good balance between suppleness and durability.</p><p>Lighter-weight “race” tires can get 120tpi+ casings, which use thinner fibers to increase the thread count. They are very flexible and help the tire deform to match the terrain, so they feel amazing, but they’re expensive and not nearly as cut resistant.</p><p><strong>What about tire beads?</strong><br>Some tires come neatly folded up in a cardboard wrap, while others are open to full size. That’s because some tires have wire beads around the rims that make them rigid, while others have folding beads, typically made of Kevlar or a similar material.</p><p>Wire bead tires are cheaper, and heavier…you won’t find any on this list, and likely not on any bike costing more than $450 these days. Folding bead tires are lighter and higher end, but also more expensive. Tubeless tires will always be folded.</p><p><strong>How do I know it’s time to replace my road tires?</strong><br>Most of the time, road tires need to be replaced simply because you have a flat that isn’t fixable. Frequent fixable flats are another telltale sign that the rubber is getting a bit thin, which sometimes reveals itself as a visibly flatter center section. But another way to tell if they’re worn out is if you can see any wire or threads poking out of the rubber. Once you spot that fraying, it’s past time to replace them.</p></div></div>","author":"Molly Hurford","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"8f127babb19585315fcb36233d54bf3cb33a994ca1f0cf06133787ececc9e887","category":"Cycling"}
