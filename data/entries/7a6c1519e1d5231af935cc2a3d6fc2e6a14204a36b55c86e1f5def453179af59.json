The move will lead to significant improvements to the performance and experience of using the Music app, but no significant UI or interface changes.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to <em>9to5Mac</em>, the Music app is currently using JET, a technology to turn web content into native apps. The current Music app, which replaced iTunes but uses the same back-end, is heavily reliant on loaded-in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a> web content, which some users have criticised for having sluggish responsiveness and usability issues.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhile some parts of the Music app, such as the library, were already native, Mac users will notice that searching for media in ‌Apple Music‌ is faster, displaying rebuilt native interfaces. As a result, scrolling, gestures, and animations are also more responsive.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple is likely still improving the new native parts of the app, so some interface elements or effects may currently be missing. Apple already rebuilt parts of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> app using JET in ‌macOS Monterey‌ 12.1.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">macOS Monterey</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-monterey.234\">macOS Monterey</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/17/native-apple-music-for-macos-music-app/\">Apple Bringing Native Apple Music Experience to Music App for macOS</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-bringing-native-apple-music-experience-to-music-app-for-macos.2328010/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=l0bFGHZhG50:6YQ-MFWeEVM:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=l0bFGHZhG50:6YQ-MFWeEVM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7a6c1519e1d5231af935cc2a3d6fc2e6a14204a36b55c86e1f5def453179af59","category":"Apple"}
