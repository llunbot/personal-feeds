{"title":"Bikes of the Bunch: A Miami-fade Bombtrack Hook EXT-C","link":"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/11/bikes-of-the-bunch-a-miami-fade-bombtrack-hook-ext-c/","date":1636074711000,"content":"<div><div><p><em>This week’s <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/tag/bikes-of-the-bunch/\" target=\"_blank\">Bikes of the Bunch</a> comes from the sunny Central Coast of Sydney. Here <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jimmy_naylor/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">James ‘Jimmy’ Naylor</a> shares his unique Bombtrack Hook EXT-C that’s been built as a do-it-all ride.</em></p><hr><p>The inspiration for the build first came during a conversation with my grandma. She recalled that she often walked past the local primary school and found it really disheartening that the kids’ bikes lined up in the racks were all dark colours with matte finishes and lots of plastic parts. She explained that the bikes she grew up around (and to an extent even <em>I </em>grew up around) had bright, glossy paint jobs, lots of chrome, and looked as if they were built with more care and permanence in mind.</p><p>This reflection inspired me to create what I consider to be a modern performance bike incorporating the latest technology yet including nods to the aesthetic and feel of the bikes of a bygone era.</p><p>The majority of my cycling is road riding, but I thought the carbon fibre <a href=\"https://bombtrack.com/2021-hook-ext-c/\" target=\"_blank\">Bombtrack Hook</a> presented the opportunity to build one bike that’s truly capable of conquering all the different terrain I ride. As I only like to keep one bike at a time it also needed to be capable of doing roadie duties and bunchies during the week but equally ready to head out into the wilderness on the weekend and get lost in the nearby national parks of the Central Coast of New South Wales where I live and work.</p><p>I chose the Bombtrack and in particular the Hook EXT-C because, for me, the geometry has found the sweet spot where you can adapt the bike to be truly versatile with only small changes and without major compromises in handling or functionality. With the types of riding I do that’s really important to me.</p><p>The bike will have two wheelsets to accomplish the double duty – a 700c deep-section carbon wheelset and a 27.5″ wheelset by Halo to run fat, knobby rubber on. On the road it rolls on 700 x 26 mm Panaracer Gravelking slicks and 650 x 48 mm Gravelking SKs for bush-bashing. I swap to Shimano SPDs for the off-road stuff.</p><p>I went with a fork from Whisky as it has a cleaner, less chunky look and doesn’t have quite so many mounting points on it, giving an overall much cleaner look. It has a slightly shorter axle to crown measurement which helped drop the front end and bottom bracket height to a more road-focused geometry while still being able to take a 650 x 50 tyre for bush-bashing.</p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Bikes-of-the-bunch-bombtrack-hook-ext-c-James-naylor-16.jpg\"><figcaption>Two sets of wheels give the bike a dual purpose.</figcaption></figure><p>The bike features a bunch of <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2018/08/masterclass-series-polishing-aluminium-parts-with-cycloretro/\" target=\"_blank\">hand-polished parts</a> like the Chris King hubs, and Wolf Tooth headset, chainring, bottle cages, and the seatpost clamp. And I settled on running a SRAM Force AXS  / X01 Eagle 1×12 grouppo with an Easton carbon crankset.</p><p>I also chose Easton for its aero road handlebars, but the brand’s garish logos were stripped off before the bar was then polished to a high gloss clear / carbon finish. The Enve aero stem and Enve seatpost have been painted to match the frame. For those playing at home, I’m 171 cm tall (short) and use a ‘small’ (52 cm seat tube) frame size. I run a 729 mm seat height, -7º 100 mm stem, 400 mm C-C bars with an 80 mm reach and 125 mm drop. I have long legs, a short torso, and a spinal injury.</p><p>Paint was hanlded by <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/09/how-to-polish-gloss-paint-and-remove-scratches/\" target=\"_blank\">Steve from Velocraft</a>. He took the ideas and concept I had and really ran with it. The resulting paint job and graphics suit the bike perfectly. He branded the paint job “Miami fade” which I feel is pretty fitting as the pastels and chrome of the Miami art deco era were certainly an influence as I planned the build in my head. Steve also suggested I pay homage to my sidekick Monty the Pug and we arrived at the little cartoon on the top tube which I adore.</p><div><div><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Bikes-of-the-bunch-bombtrack-hook-ext-c-James-naylor-1-3.jpg\"><figcaption>Meet Monty.</figcaption></figure></div><div><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Bikes-of-the-bunch-bombtrack-hook-ext-c-James-naylor-1-4.jpg\"><figcaption>Cartoon Monty</figcaption></figure></div></div><p>I’m very pleased with how the bike came together and I look forward to spending many hours on board.
