The primary key still works for passive entry, the people said.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe issue does not appear to be fixed in the iOS 18.0.1 update released last week, or in the latest iOS 18.1 beta. The underlying cause is unclear.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe will share any new information about this issue as it becomes available.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bmw/\">BMW</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/11/ios-18-bmw-apple-wallet-car-key-issue/\">Some BMW Owners Experiencing Issues With Shared Car Keys on iOS 18</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/some-bmw-owners-experiencing-issues-with-shared-car-keys-on-ios-18.2439812/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8d41053323e05886dc0592d6fff757579a2bac1d5a95e0e15ed28cd04f7b6547","category":"Apple"}
