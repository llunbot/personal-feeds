Back in November, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/02/former-apple-employee-17-million-theft/\">Prasad pled guilty</a> to conspiracy to commit fraud and conspiracy to defraud the United States <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/pr/former-apple-employee-admits-defrauding-apple-more-17-million\">after stealing millions of dollars</a> from Apple.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/Apple-Logo-Cash-Orange.jpg\" alt width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nPrasad was part of Apple's Global Service Supply Chain department between 2008 and 2018, and his job was to buy parts and services from vendors for servicing older devices. In 2011, Prasad started accepting kickbacks, inflating invoices, and stealing parts, causing Apple to pay for components and services that it did not receive.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTwo vendors worked with Prasad to steal money from Apple. His schemes included funneling illicit payments from the vendors to his creditors, tricking Apple into paying for components twice, and stealing components purchased by Apple and reselling them to Apple through his co-conspirators. In total, he was found guilty of stealing $17 million through mail and wire fraud.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHe will forfeit nearly $5.5 million in assets that the government has already seized, and will need to pay an additional $8 million in forfeiture money. The $13.5 million forfeiture is on top of the $17 million that he must pay to Apple and the $1.8 million he owes to the IRS for not paying taxes on the money he received from Apple.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAfter serving three years in prison, he will have another three years of supervised release.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/27/former-apple-employee-fines-prison/\">Former Employee Who Defrauded Apple Sentenced to 3 Years in Prison and $19 Million in Fines</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/former-employee-who-defrauded-apple-sentenced-to-3-years-in-prison-and-19-million-in-fines.2388009/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5c1521110a022bc6a58351b3925ba87210650b51f7fe50937ae14201690d9f10","category":"Apple"}
