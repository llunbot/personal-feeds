Last year’s winner Jonas Vingegaard (Visma-Lease a Bike) will be back to defend his title but still has question marks surrounding his current form. However, after a sensational Giro d'Italia last month, two-time Tour winner Tadej Pogačar (UAE Team Emirates) is looking like the rider to beat this year. Completing one of the most star-studded Grand Tour line-ups we've seen in years, battling it for the converted yellow jersey is also Primož Roglič (Bora-Hansgrohe) and Remco Evenepoel (Soudal–Quick-Step) – the first time the big four will go head-to-head this season.</p>\n<p>However, there are also other riders looking to make their own Tour history, namely Mark Cavendish (Astana Qazaqstan), <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/inside-project-35-how-mark-cavendish-has-prepared-for-his-tour-de-france-swansong\">who is hunting a stage win</a>.
