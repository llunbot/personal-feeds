Seven years ago, 150,000 people paid us $15\nto protect a pristine parcel of land on the US-Mexico border from\nracist billionaire Donald Trump’s very stupid wall.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, an even richer, more racist billionaire — Elon\nMusk — snuck up on us from behind and completely fucked that land\nwith gravel, tractors, and space garbage.</p>\n\n<p>Just look at it! He fucked it.</p>\n\n<p>How did this happen? Elon Musk’s SpaceX was building some space\nthing nearby, and he figured he could just dump his shit all over\nour gorgeous plot of land without asking. After we caught him,\nSpaceX gave us a 12-hour ultimatum to accept a lowball offer for\nless than half our land’s value. We said, “Go fuck yourself, Elon\nMusk. We’ll see you in court.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/20/cah-spacex-lawsuit\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"7a90355215d0c52dc08ba8b5d50486febbc067e5cd48153368dc155ab5057a4d","category":"Tech"}
