The CMA now says it \"has provisionally concluded\" that this sale \"should address these [previously identified] issues.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1970437#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1970437&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"86da70884e25857d9e6f24de5d91c003c73ee79c5829a4ded7efa4cd135d4666","category":"Tech"}
