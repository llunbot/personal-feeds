Prior to the integration of Google Account support, all codes in the Google Authenticator app were stored on device, which is problematic when a device is lost.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGoogle says with one-time passwords available in a Google Account, users are \"better protected from lockout,\" increasing convenience and security. Google Account integration for Google Authenticator is available on both iOS and Android devices. Adding Google Account support will require signing into the account in the Google Authenticator app, and once that is done, codes will be automatically backed up and restored on any new device where you sign in to your Google Account.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe latest version of the app is required, and on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, it can be downloaded from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> for free.
