{"title":"First '45mm' Apple Watch Bands Spotted Ahead of Series 7 Unveiling [Updated]","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/26/first-45mm-apple-watch-band-spotted/","date":1629978953000,"content":"An image purporting to show a \"45mm\" Apple Watch band has surfaced online ahead of the expected unveiling of Apple Watch Series 7 models next month.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/apple-watch-45mm-band-saddle-brown.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe small, low-resolution image, shared by \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/duanrui1205/status/1430698847450189824?s=21\">DuanRui</a>\" on Twitter, originated from the Chinese social media network Weibo and appears to show the underside of an Apple Watch band, which could be a Saddle Brown Leather Link band. While it is not clear how reliable this image may be, the 45mm sizing lines up with a number of previous rumors around the Apple Watch Series 7.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/17/apple-watch-series7-cad-larger-display/\">Alleged CAD renders</a> of the larger Apple Watch Series 7 suggested that it would sport a 45mm display, a 1mm increase from the current 44mm display on the larger <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 6</a> model. This is expected to be achieved by making the casing's edges flat, which would slightly increase the top surface area of the device for the display, and by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/14/apple-watch-7-thinner-display-borders/\">reducing the size of the display's bezels</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/24/apple-watch-series-7-case-sizes-increase/\">Another report</a> from the Chinese leaker known as \"UnclePan\" suggested that the Apple Watch Series 7 will come in larger 41mm and 45mm case sizes, replacing the current 40mm and 44mm options.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nDespite these previous leaks, this image is the first time that a potential 45mm Apple Watch sizing has been seen in the wild and the first time that the larger size has been referred to specifically with regards to Apple Watch bands.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n41 and 45mm Apple Watch Series 7 models are expected to continue to be compatible with bands from previous generations, in the same way that 38mm Apple Watch bands continued to be functionally compatible with 40mm Apple Watches, and 42mm Apple Watch bands continued to be functionally compatible with 44mm Apple Watches.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/17/apple-watch-series7-cad-larger-display/\">CAD renders</a> and renders supposedly <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/19/prosser-apple-watch-series-7-design/\">based on leaked images</a> have also indicated that the Apple Watch Series 7 will carry over the same mechanical band system. Though the device's display is expected to increase in size by 1mm and the edges are expected to be flat like the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> lineup, the height and width of the new models are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/17/apple-watch-series7-cad-larger-display/\">expected to be the same</a> as previous models, allowing for compatibility with the same Apple Watch bands. The only dimension anticipated to change significantly is the thickness, with new models purportedly set to be 1.7mm thinner than the current Series 6.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Apple Watch Series 7, featuring a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/14/apple-watch-7-thinner-display-borders/\">number of improvements</a> such as slimmer bezels, upgraded Ultra Wideband connectivity, and a faster chip, is likely to arrive alongside the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a> lineup at a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/12/2021-fall-apple-event-rumor-roundup/\">digital event next month</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n<hr />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Update</strong>: An image of a second alleged Apple Watch Series 7 band has now been shared online. This blue Braided Solo Loop, seemingly with an identical design to previous versions, is for a 41mm Apple Watch model, indicating that previous rumors around the smaller devices also getting a 1mm display size increase may have been correct.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>According to my source, Apple has started mass production of the new Apple Watch Series 7 bands.
