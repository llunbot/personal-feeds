This new helmet offers big mountain protection with all-day comfort. Weighing in at 800 grams in a size medium, the Coalition looks like a great option for riders wanting advanced protection without the weight. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Giro-Coalition-Full-Face-Helmet-Launch-braaap.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"853\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Giro-Coalition-Full-Face-Helmet-Launch-braaap.jpeg\" alt=\"Giro Coalition Full-Face Helmet Launch braaap\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Giro-Coalition-Full-Face-Helmet-Launch-braaap.jpeg 853w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Giro-Coalition-Full-Face-Helmet-Launch-braaap-200x300.jpeg 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Giro-Coalition-Full-Face-Helmet-Launch-braaap-800x1200.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Giro-Coalition-Full-Face-Helmet-Launch-braaap-80x120.jpeg 80w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Giro-Coalition-Full-Face-Helmet-Launch-braaap-768x1152.jpeg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Giro)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Giro-Coalition-Full-Face-Helmet-Launch-black-going-fast.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"854\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Giro-Coalition-Full-Face-Helmet-Launch-black-going-fast.jpeg\" alt=\"Giro Coalition Full-Face Helmet Launch black going fast\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Giro-Coalition-Full-Face-Helmet-Launch-black-going-fast.jpeg 854w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Giro-Coalition-Full-Face-Helmet-Launch-black-going-fast-200x300.jpeg 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Giro-Coalition-Full-Face-Helmet-Launch-black-going-fast-800x1200.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Giro-Coalition-Full-Face-Helmet-Launch-black-going-fast-80x120.jpeg 80w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Giro-Coalition-Full-Face-Helmet-Launch-black-going-fast-768x1151.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Coalition Spherical is an ASTM-DH/NTA-certified MTB helmet that uses Spherical Technology powered by Mips. This tech sandwiches a low-friction slip-plane between independent EPP and EPS foam layers. This is designed to optimize both high-speed and low-speed impacts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This new helmet also debuts the new Halo System chin bar, an innovative new tech to better manage chin bar impacts. It also provides 11% better cooling than the category-leading Insurgent Spherical. Sporting 25 vents, paired with “massive” front intake ports and efficient rear exhaust that uses deep internal channeling, Giro says that the Coalition Spherical “<em>manages to rival the ventilation and cooling power of some competitor’s road helmets</em>“.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Coalition’s Halo System</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Giro-Coalition-Full-Face-Helmet-Launch-Halo-System-Chinbar.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1229\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Giro-Coalition-Full-Face-Helmet-Launch-Halo-System-Chinbar.jpg\" alt=\"Giro Coalition Full-Face Helmet Launch Halo System Chinbar\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Giro-Coalition-Full-Face-Helmet-Launch-Halo-System-Chinbar.jpg 1229w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Giro-Coalition-Full-Face-Helmet-Launch-Halo-System-Chinbar-297x272.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Giro-Coalition-Full-Face-Helmet-Launch-Halo-System-Chinbar-800x732.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Giro-Coalition-Full-Face-Helmet-Launch-Halo-System-Chinbar-120x110.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Giro-Coalition-Full-Face-Helmet-Launch-Halo-System-Chinbar-768x703.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Giro is proud of what they call the Coalition’s “most impressive innovation”, the Halo System that combines a chin bar with Pebax (a material that’s engineered to provide the perfect range of flex and rigidity) and elastomeric bushings. The bushings are integrated into the EPS to absorb and dissipate kinetic forces. This system helps the Coalition to exceed the standard chin bar selection certification testing by almost 2x.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>Trail riding means something different today, with more aggressive terrain, more capable bikes, and the wider use of e-MTBs creating demand for full-face helmet protection with all-day comfort when you need to pedal</em>, ” said Giro Product Designer and former enduro racer Garrett Tollett. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>While our riders at Rampage and the most demanding DH courses will continue to rely on the Insurgent, we designed Coalition to meet these demands for a lightweight, comfortable full-face helmet with advanced protection that allows riders to push bigger, farther, and faster in the continued evolution of trail riding.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Else is New on the Coalition?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Giro-Coalition-Full-Face-Helmet-Launch-on-the-rocks-fast.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Giro-Coalition-Full-Face-Helmet-Launch-on-the-rocks-fast.jpeg\" alt=\"Giro Coalition Full-Face Helmet Launch on the rocks fast\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Giro-Coalition-Full-Face-Helmet-Launch-on-the-rocks-fast.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Giro-Coalition-Full-Face-Helmet-Launch-on-the-rocks-fast-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Giro-Coalition-Full-Face-Helmet-Launch-on-the-rocks-fast-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Giro-Coalition-Full-Face-Helmet-Launch-on-the-rocks-fast-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Giro-Coalition-Full-Face-Helmet-Launch-on-the-rocks-fast-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Giro-Coalition-Full-Face-Helmet-Launch-on-the-rocks-fast-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, beyond great protection and cooling power, there are a few other improvements to rider comfort. Like the new sweat management of a DryCore brow pad, and the odor control of Ionic+ treatments. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Giro-Coalition-Full-Face-Helmet-Launch-on-the-rocks-e1707851117588.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"851\" height=\"910\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Giro-Coalition-Full-Face-Helmet-Launch-on-the-rocks-e1707851117588.jpeg\" alt=\"Giro Coalition Full-Face Helmet Launch on the rocks\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Giro-Coalition-Full-Face-Helmet-Launch-on-the-rocks-e1707851117588.jpeg 851w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Giro-Coalition-Full-Face-Helmet-Launch-on-the-rocks-e1707851117588-281x300.jpeg 281w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Giro-Coalition-Full-Face-Helmet-Launch-on-the-rocks-e1707851117588-800x855.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Giro-Coalition-Full-Face-Helmet-Launch-on-the-rocks-e1707851117588-112x120.jpeg 112w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Giro-Coalition-Full-Face-Helmet-Launch-on-the-rocks-e1707851117588-768x821.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The rider can also choose from two removable cheek pads of different thicknesses to fine-tune the fit. And lastly, there’s the initiative Fidlock buckle to round out a lightweight and comfortable new full-face helmet.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Giro Coalition Retail, Sizes, Colors, and Features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail: $325</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sizes: XS/S, M/L, and XL/XXL</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Colors: Matte Dark Shark Dune, Matte Black, Matte Metallic Coal/Mineral, and Matte White/Ano Blue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>800 grams size M</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Spherical Technology powered by MIPS</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Halo Chinbar System</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Fidlock Buckle</li>\n\n\n\n<li>DryCore sweat managing brow pad</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Two sets of different-thickness cheek pads</li>\n\n\n\n<li>25 vents connected by deep internal channeling</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Certifications: CPSC, NTA, ASTM-1952-DH, ASTM-2032-BMX, CE EN1078</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Check it out at the link below. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.giro.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Giro.com</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/giro-coalition-spherical-lightweight-full-face-helmet/\">Giro Launches the New Coalition Spherical Lightweight Full-Face Helmet</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"5f0fe4938665e7cd18912a3066854c223e021e5968fe0af9692253e4f6632514","category":"Cycling"}
