But there are some good news stories too, and Sigma Sports’ development is one of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since it was founded in 1992, Sigma Sports has gone from strength to strength to become one of the UK’s biggest road, gravel and triathlon retailers and a vital hub for the cycling community around its stores in Hampton Wick and Oakham.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now the British retailer has added a third store in Letchworth Garden City. Located in the north of Hertfordshire, it’s easily reachable from the likes of St Albans and Luton in the south, Milton Keynes in the west and Cambridge in the northeast, and it’s surrounded by great places for riding bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘There was a business here before called Tri Sports, and when the two gentlemen that were running it retired, the space came up for grabs,’ says new store manager Sam Fuller, who used to be the head mechanic at the company’s Lincolnshire warehouse.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/sigma-sports-letchworth-2-970x647.webp\" alt=\"Sigma Sports Letchworth\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/sigma-sports-letchworth-2-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/sigma-sports-letchworth-2-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/sigma-sports-letchworth-2-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/sigma-sports-letchworth-2-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/sigma-sports-letchworth-2-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/sigma-sports-letchworth-2-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/sigma-sports-letchworth-2-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/sigma-sports-letchworth-2-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/sigma-sports-letchworth-2.webp 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘We’re right in the middle of a massive cycling community that we not only want to tap into, but that we also want to support. In this area in particular there seems to be a lack of high-end or mid-to-high-end brick and mortar shops, places where you can go and actually look at stuff and touch stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We’re now that local bike shop but we’re also supported by a bigger infrastructure, which means we have plenty of stock and we have that reach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Our customer service is our USP, and we can do that best in store.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s on offer?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the new Letchworth store you can find road and gravel bikes from leading brands including Pinarello, Specialized, Trek, Cannondale and Colnago. And that’s just the bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We’ve got absolutely everything, from degreaser all the way through to bikepacking gear and a full range of helmets, shoes and clothing,’ Fuller says. ‘We carry products from some brands you wouldn’t normally see in physical stores, such as Universal Colours, Maap and Pas Normal Studios, along with all the big ones like Castelli, Rapha and Assos, with loads of sizes,’ says Fuller.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"672\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/sigma-sports-letchworth-3-970x672.webp\" alt=\"Sigma Sports Letchworth\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/sigma-sports-letchworth-3-970x672.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/sigma-sports-letchworth-3-300x208.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/sigma-sports-letchworth-3-768x532.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/sigma-sports-letchworth-3-750x519.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/sigma-sports-letchworth-3-1140x789.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/sigma-sports-letchworth-3.webp 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The shop isn’t all about selling you bikes and kit, however. ‘We primarily sell road, gravel and triathlon bikes, but from a workshop perspective we can service anything, including e-bikes and mountain bikes. We’re fairly booked out already, which shows how high the demand is,’ Fuller says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘And we have a bike-fit studio in the works too. We’re in the process of fully renovating the building. We started with the customer facing stuff downstairs but we’re going to add a bike-fit studio to that within the next couple of months. That will be a full, proper Retül-based system, and we’ll be offering prospective customers a free in-store consultation in bike sizing to make sure we get the right size and the right bike for every customer.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Building the community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A key part of every Sigma Sports store is the community that surrounds it. On opening day the Letchworth Garden City branch saw 500 people turn up to see a talk and Q&amp;A session with Sigma Sports ambassador Dame Laura Kenny, hosted by Rebecca Charlton. And that’s just the start.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/sigma-sports-letchworth-4-970x647.webp\" alt=\"Sigma Sports Letchworth\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/sigma-sports-letchworth-4-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/sigma-sports-letchworth-4-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/sigma-sports-letchworth-4-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/sigma-sports-letchworth-4-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/sigma-sports-letchworth-4-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/sigma-sports-letchworth-4-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/sigma-sports-letchworth-4-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/sigma-sports-letchworth-4-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/sigma-sports-letchworth-4.webp 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘We’re going to have a ride-out probably every second Saturday starting from late June,’ Fuller says. ‘We’re also going to host some of the local clubs who are going to do some ride-outs, and we also have special promotions that go out for the local clubs from time to time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We do demo days too. Sigma Sports has a full demo fleet, and prospective customers can go out on a 45-minute ride on everything from high-end road bikes to the latest gravel bikes.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will also be regular run clubs and triathlon-focussed events including wetsuit demo days, because apparently cycling isn’t the only sport in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>• <strong>Cyclist readers can also get 10% off both in store <a href=\"https://www.sigmasports.com\" target=\"_blank\">and online</a> when quoting code CYCLIST10 at checkout.
