There are several cyclocross skills you’ll need to get the most out of races, and many of these are also handy on the road.</p>\n<p>Practising getting on and off your bike, as well as running with it, will make your initiation to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/cyclocross-racing/\">cyclocross racing</a> less daunting.</p>\n<p>Although you only do it once, getting out of the blocks quickly is one of the most important parts of the race. As you progress, you’ll learn how to scythe through corners by not touching the brakes and scale steep banks without getting off the bike.</p>\n<p>The most advanced racers will also bunny hop to good effect to maintain speed and avoid punctures.</p>\n<h1>Key cyclocross skills and how to practise them</h1>\n<h2>Cyclocross starts</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"BENIDORM, SPAIN - 2023/01/22: Start women's elite in action during the UCI Cyclo-cross World Cup.
