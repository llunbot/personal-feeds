Fix Manufacturing’s compact wearable EveryDay Carry multi-tools are already a great option for folks like me who love to be able to work on stuff – anytime, anywhere. And now, this standard bottle cage-spaced mount just means one more easy way to make sure you are always prepared to fix what goes wrong on a bike ride. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Fix Mfg Payload Pocket on-bike mount for EDC multi-tools</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Fix Payload Pocket is a simple 64mm mount for their wide array of compact multi-tools. There are 4 different bike-specific tools, plus snow &amp; surf tools that all fit into the new carrier. In fact, ‘Payload Pocket’ had previously just been the name for all of their different mounts that would hold these small rectangular mini-tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Fix-Wheelie-Wrench-X-Dynaplug-EDC-mini-tool-in-a-belt-buckle.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Fix-Wheelie-Wrench-X-Dynaplug-EDC-mini-tool-in-a-belt-buckle-800x400.jpg\" alt=\"Fix Wheelie Wrench X Dynaplug everyday carry EDC multi-tool in a belt buckle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Fix-Wheelie-Wrench-X-Dynaplug-EDC-mini-tool-in-a-belt-buckle-800x400.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Fix-Wheelie-Wrench-X-Dynaplug-EDC-mini-tool-in-a-belt-buckle-297x149.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Fix-Wheelie-Wrench-X-Dynaplug-EDC-mini-tool-in-a-belt-buckle-120x60.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Fix-Wheelie-Wrench-X-Dynaplug-EDC-mini-tool-in-a-belt-buckle-768x384.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Fix-Wheelie-Wrench-X-Dynaplug-EDC-mini-tool-in-a-belt-buckle-1536x768.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Fix-Wheelie-Wrench-X-Dynaplug-EDC-mini-tool-in-a-belt-buckle.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As a bike tech nerd, I’m partial to Fix’s $50 <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/fix-wheelie-wrench-x-dynaplug-multi-tool/\" target=\"_blank\">Wheelie Wrench X Dynaplug</a> tucked inside an All Time Belt. That means whenever I am wearing a belt – and whenever I travel – I have a multi-tool tucked into my belt buckle. That specific multi-tool has all the bike fix basics, plus a Dynaplug tubeless tire plug pre-loaded and ready to go. I also have a $55 <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/fix-mfg-wheelie-wrench-pro-adds-hans-rey-dynaplug-edition-adventure-terminal-more/\" target=\"_blank\">Wheelie Wrench Pro</a> that includes a 8mm hex to remove pedals and a chain breaker. (<em>But it doesn’t fit in my belt buckle.</em>) That one I have attached to a backpack strap with the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/fix-mfgs-new-strap-on-is-here-dont-worry-its-just-a-mini-tool-holder/\" target=\"_blank\">Strap-On</a> Tool Holster. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oddly, until now, there wasn’t a way to carry either on the bike. But now, Fix fixed that, too!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Details, Pricing &amp; Options</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Fix-Mfg-Payload-Pocket-on-bike-mount-for-EDC-multi-tools_empty.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"620\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Fix-Mfg-Payload-Pocket-on-bike-mount-for-EDC-multi-tools_empty.jpg\" alt=\"Fix Mfg Payload Pocket on-bike mount for EDC multi-tools\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Fix-Mfg-Payload-Pocket-on-bike-mount-for-EDC-multi-tools_empty.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Fix-Mfg-Payload-Pocket-on-bike-mount-for-EDC-multi-tools_empty-297x153.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Fix-Mfg-Payload-Pocket-on-bike-mount-for-EDC-multi-tools_empty-120x62.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Fix-Mfg-Payload-Pocket-on-bike-mount-for-EDC-multi-tools_empty-768x397.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Fix Payload Pocket is a simple black bracket that direct mounts to your bike. It is drilled with two holes 64mm apart to fit on standard bottle carrier bosses or the extra tool mounts on more and more mountain bikes. It uses the exact same alloy &amp; composite clip as Fix’s other holsters to securely hold tools in place. The <a href=\"https://fixmfg.com/product/payload-pocket-64mm/\" target=\"_blank\">Payload Pocket</a> itself sells for $33, including black titanium bolts from Better Bolts.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Fix-Mfg-Payload-Pocket-on-bike-mount-for-EDC-multi-tools_with-wheelie-wrench-sold-separately.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"650\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Fix-Mfg-Payload-Pocket-on-bike-mount-for-EDC-multi-tools_with-wheelie-wrench-sold-separately.jpg\" alt=\"Fix Mfg Payload Pocket on-bike mount for EDC multi-tools, with Wheelie Wrench tool sold separately\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Fix-Mfg-Payload-Pocket-on-bike-mount-for-EDC-multi-tools_with-wheelie-wrench-sold-separately.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Fix-Mfg-Payload-Pocket-on-bike-mount-for-EDC-multi-tools_with-wheelie-wrench-sold-separately-297x161.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Fix-Mfg-Payload-Pocket-on-bike-mount-for-EDC-multi-tools_with-wheelie-wrench-sold-separately-120x65.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Fix-Mfg-Payload-Pocket-on-bike-mount-for-EDC-multi-tools_with-wheelie-wrench-sold-separately-768x416.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Compatible Fix Manufacturing tools start at $35 more for the basic Wheelie Wrench.
