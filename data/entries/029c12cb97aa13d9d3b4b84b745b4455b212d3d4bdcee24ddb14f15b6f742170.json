This model has begun to see low prices as Apple just launched the newest AirPods with the AirPods 3, but if you're okay not owning the latest version, the AirPods 2 are still a great purchase.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07PXGQC1Q%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$44 OFF</div>AirPods w/ Wired Charging Case for $114.99</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSecondly, you can get the AirPods 2 with Wireless Charging Case at Walmart, priced at <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/153062/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021\"><strong>$129.98</strong></a>, down from $199.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the AirPods 2, and right now only Walmart has the sale.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/153062/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$70 OFF</div>AirPods w/ Wireless Charging Case for $129.98</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nNext, Apple's new AirPods Pro with MagSafe Charging Case are available for <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09JQMJHXY%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\"><strong>$189.99</strong></a> at Amazon, down from $249.00, which continues to be the best price we've seen on this model.
