They are joined by 1984 Tour de France polka dot jersey winner Pippa York, formerly known as Robert Millar, who is now working in the worlds of journalism and human rights. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode she discusses personal highlights from her racing career, the 1985 ‘Stolen Vuelta’, and compares the current cycling scene to her racing days. York, who transitioned privately after her retirement in 1995 and came back into public life in 2017, also talks us through the story of her transition, her exponentially growing happiness, and about trans people in sport.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>York is profoundly honest in her expertise and reflection in a brilliant and thought-provoking episode. </p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Listen to <a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/618e52740da782001471efbe/episodes/76-polka-dot-jersey-winner-pippa-york-on-finding-happiness\" target=\"_blank\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 76 now on Acast</a></strong></li><li><strong>Check out </strong><a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/618e52740da782001471efbe/episodes\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>all episodes</strong></a></li><li><strong>Also available wherever you get your podcasts</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/will-butler-adams-brompton-podcast\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 75: Brompton CEO, Will Butler-Adams</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/cyclist-s-31-inspirational-women-no19-philippa-york\">Cyclist’s 31 Inspirational Women No19: Philippa York</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/pippa-york-calls-for-inclusion-of-lgbtq-community-in-sport\">Pippa York calls for inclusion of LGBTQ community in sport</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/pippa-york-podcast\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 76: Polka dot jersey winner Pippa York on finding happiness</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Emma Cole &#124; Features Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"22a1c3213f1638e34dfac9e3db28c75145b7a74b79f3824e2345673f7a60831e","category":"Cycling"}
