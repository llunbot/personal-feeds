Far from the first company to build <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/is-the-dirtysixer-36er-ebike-the-worlds-largest-electric-bicycle/\" target=\"_blank\">a bike with 36″ wheels</a>, Curve has a unique approach in creating a titanium gravel bike with the monster wheels. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are just looking for 20 people to commit to the project and it’s a go. The funds paid will serve as the deposit for your very own Titanosaur. If the crowdfunding project is successful, the final payment will be due upon delivery in 9-12 months. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Curve’s Jesse Carlsson Tells Us Why</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Curve-Cycling-Titanosaur-36-inch-gravel-bike2.jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"819\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Curve-Cycling-Titanosaur-36-inch-gravel-bike2.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Curve Cycling Titanosaur 36 inch gravel bike3\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Curve-Cycling-Titanosaur-36-inch-gravel-bike2.jpg.webp 819w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Curve-Cycling-Titanosaur-36-inch-gravel-bike2.jpg-240x300.webp 240w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Curve-Cycling-Titanosaur-36-inch-gravel-bike2.jpg-800x1000.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Curve-Cycling-Titanosaur-36-inch-gravel-bike2.jpg-96x120.webp 96w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Curve-Cycling-Titanosaur-36-inch-gravel-bike2.jpg-768x960.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Curve Cycling)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Why are we crowdfunding this? Time and time again we’ve asked ourselves, should we hit go? Should we launch the Titanosaur into the wild? It’s a risky and costly move. We have no idea whether any of you out there in the real world are truly interested in buying a Titanosaur – it’s a super niche product within a niche within a niche. We need your help</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Getting financial commitments from 20 riders will confirm there is sufficient interest to push forward with this awesome project and bring stunning titanium bikes to the tall people of the world. The early financial commitments will fund the costly final stages of development which includes producing a custom fork mold as well as lab testing the final rounds of prototype forks and frames.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>If we don’t secure commitments from 20 people by the FPOI (fist pump</em> of interest) date, we will refund the money to those who made commitments, cancel the project,<em> and quietly sob to ourselves for a few weeks or years.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The final product will look a little different – the frame silhouette will not change materially but the fork will be carbon, not titanium as pictured here. The artwork on the final frame, wheels, and fork will align with Curve’s branding at the time of delivery. You’re going to have to trust us on this, but the final product will look sharp. We will keep you updated along the way as we tick off the key project milestones.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Read more <a href=\"https://www.curvecycling.com/blogs/news/titanosaur-crowdfunding-project\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</em></strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Details</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Curve-Cycling-Titanosaur-36-inch-gravel-bike4.jpg-scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2049\" height=\"2560\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Curve-Cycling-Titanosaur-36-inch-gravel-bike4.jpg-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Curve Cycling Titanosaur 36 inch gravel bike3\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Curve-Cycling-Titanosaur-36-inch-gravel-bike4.jpg-scaled.webp 2049w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Curve-Cycling-Titanosaur-36-inch-gravel-bike4.jpg-240x300.webp 240w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Curve-Cycling-Titanosaur-36-inch-gravel-bike4.jpg-800x1000.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Curve-Cycling-Titanosaur-36-inch-gravel-bike4.jpg-96x120.webp 96w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Curve-Cycling-Titanosaur-36-inch-gravel-bike4.jpg-768x960.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Curve-Cycling-Titanosaur-36-inch-gravel-bike4.jpg-1229x1536.webp 1229w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Curve-Cycling-Titanosaur-36-inch-gravel-bike4.jpg-1639x2048.webp 1639w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Commitment Required:</strong> AUD 5000 ($3255 USD) initial deposit, the balance based on the build selected is due on Delivery</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>FPOI Date: </strong>March 21, 2024 (funds to be received by this date)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Number of Commitments Needed to Proceed: </strong>20</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Latest Delivery Date:</strong> March 21, 2025</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Full Price</strong>: Force AXS build AUD 13,999 ($9113 USD) (AUD price includes 10% Australian GST) or the Rival AXS build for AUD 12,999 ($8462 USD).
