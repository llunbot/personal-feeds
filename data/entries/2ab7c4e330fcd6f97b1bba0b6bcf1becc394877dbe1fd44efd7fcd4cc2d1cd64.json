WTB says the hole is located “behind the sit bone contact area to make it completely unnoticeable while pedaling”.</p>\n<p>Whether it provides a clear line of fire for water and mud ejected from the back wheel remains to be seen.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Devo arrives as an ebike-specific saddle from WTB.</span></figcaption><span> <i>George Scott / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>WTB claims to have reduced the amount of nylon fibres in the Devo’s shell to increase flex and improve damping. The saddle is said to offer a “medium” level of thickness.</p>\n<p>In terms of shape, the Devo is 260mm long, and WTB says the saddle is designed to stay narrow before quickly widening at the sit bone area, to avoid thigh rub.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The “pick-up handle” is designed to help the rider lift or carry the bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>George Scott / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The wide nose is designed to encourage the rider forward on the saddle, “to keep the front wheel down on steep, technical climbs that are only conquerable on an ebike”, according to WTB.</p>\n<p>WTB will offer the saddle in a 142mm width, with stainless steel or chromoly rails, and with the brand’s “plusher” HLX padding. The premium, titanium-railed Devo has WTB’s DNA padding, said to improve support by retaining its shape better.</p>\n<ul><li>WTB Devo with titanium rails – $142.95, claimed weight 215g</li>\n<li>WTB Devo with stainless steel rails – $119.95, claimed weight 249g</li>\n<li>WTB Devo with chromoly rails – $95.95, claimed weight 264g</li>\n</ul><h2>WTB Gravelier saddle designed for long gravel efforts</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Gravelier is WTB’s new gravel saddle.</span></figcaption><span> <i>George Scott / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Moving on and WTB now also has, for the first time, a gravel-specific saddle in the form of the Gravelier.</p>\n<p>While Wangbichler says the Gravelier can, of course, be used beyond <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/what-is-gravel-riding/\">gravel riding</a>, the saddle’s shape, which curves from tip-to-tail, is designed to support the forward-leaning position that, according to WTB, many gravel riders adopt for extended periods.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Gravelier has a perennial relief cut-out.</span></figcaption><span> <i>George Scott / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>It’s a saddle “for gravel riders who put in big miles at an expeditious pace”, according to WTB.
