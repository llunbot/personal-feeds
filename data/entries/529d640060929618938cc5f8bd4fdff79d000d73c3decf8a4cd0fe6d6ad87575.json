The decision appears to halt in its tracks a $5 billion program designed to fund state projects to install electric vehicle charging stations across the United States.</p>\n<p>Officials at the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), which manages the program, ordered state transportation directors to “decertify” the <a href=\"https://driveelectric.gov/state-plans\">plans that all 50 states</a> have used to outline where and how they will build their charging stations, and with what companies they’ll contract to do so. States have followed those plans to build more than 30 charging stations across the US, with hundreds more on the way.</p>\n<p>Surveys show prospective car buyers cite the country’s lagging electric vehicle charging infrastructure as a major reason they won’t buy electric. The NEVI program, established by <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/02/four-fast-chargers-every-50-miles-us-unveils-ev-infrastructure-plan/\">2021’s Infrastructure Law</a>, was the government’s answer to those concerns. It attempts to build chargers along thousands of miles of federal highway, with a focus on places that might not otherwise be able to financially support a charger.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2025/02/feds-putting-the-kibosh-on-national-ev-charging-program/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2025/02/feds-putting-the-kibosh-on-national-ev-charging-program/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Aarian Marshall, wired.com","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"529d640060929618938cc5f8bd4fdff79d000d73c3decf8a4cd0fe6d6ad87575","category":"Tech"}
