Designed for users with physical disabilities, Eye Tracking uses the front-facing camera to set up and calibrate in seconds, and with on-device machine learning, all data used to set up and control this feature is kept securely on device, and isn't shared with Apple.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEye Tracking works across iPadOS and iOS apps, and doesn't require additional hardware or accessories. With Eye Tracking, users can navigate through the elements of an app and use Dwell Control to activate each element, accessing additional functions such as physical buttons, swipes, and other gestures solely with their eyes.</blockquote>\r<br />\n<h2>Music Haptics</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iOS-18-Music-Haptics.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nWhen this feature is turned on, the iPhone's Taptic Engine will play \"taps, textures, and refined vibrations\" that correspond with the audio of the music: \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<blockquote>Music Haptics is a new way for users who are deaf or hard of hearing to experience music on iPhone. With this accessibility feature turned on, the Taptic Engine in iPhone plays taps, textures, and refined vibrations to the audio of the music. Music Haptics works across millions of songs in the Apple Music catalog, and will be available as an API for developers to make music more accessible in their apps.</blockquote>\r<br />\n<h2>Vocal Shortcuts</h2>\r<br />\nVocal Shortcuts will allow iPhone and iPad users to assign \"custom utterances\" that Siri can understand to \"launch shortcuts and complete complex tasks.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iOS-18-Vocal-Shortcuts.jpeg\" width=\"2612\" height=\"1828\" />\r<br />\n<h2>Vehicle Motion Cues</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/vehicle-motion-cues.jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nThis feature is designed to reduce motion sickness while looking at an iPhone or iPad's screen in a moving vehicle:<blockquote>With Vehicle Motion Cues, animated dots on the edges of the screen represent changes in vehicle motion to help reduce sensory conflict without interfering with the main content. Using sensors built into iPhone and iPad, Vehicle Motion Cues recognizes when a user is in a moving vehicle and responds accordingly. The feature can be set to show automatically on iPhone, or can be turned on and off in Control Center.</blockquote>Read our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/15/apple-reduce-motion-sickness-feature/\">standalone coverage of this feature</a> to learn more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>CarPlay</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/CarPlay-Sound-Recognition.jpg\" width=\"1306\" height=\"718\" />\r<br />\nCarPlay will be gaining Voice Control, Color Filters, and Sound Recognition.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSound Recognition on CarPlay will allow drivers or passengers who are deaf or hard of hearing to turn on alerts to be notified of car horns and sirens.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Live Captions on Vision Pro</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/Vision-Pro-Live-Captions.jpg\" width=\"1960\" height=\"1102\" />\r<br />\nvisionOS 2 will support Live Captions, allowing users who are deaf or hard of hearing to follow along with spoken dialogue in live conversations and in audio from apps.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>More Features</h2>\r<br />\n<div><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iOS-18-Hover-Typing.jpg\" width=\"1960\" height=\"1306\" /><em>Hover Typing will show larger text when typing in a text field</em></div>\r<br />\nApple outlined many more accessibility features coming to its platforms later this year:<blockquote>- For users who are blind or have low vision, VoiceOver will include new voices, a flexible Voice Rotor, custom volume control, and the ability to customize VoiceOver keyboard shortcuts on Mac.\r<br />\n- Magnifier will offer a new Reader Mode and the option to easily launch Detection Mode with the Action button.\r<br />\n- Braille users will get a new way to start and stay in Braille Screen Input for faster control and text editing; Japanese language availability for Braille Screen Input; support for multi-line braille with Dot Pad; and the option to choose different input and output tables.\r<br />\n- For users with low vision, Hover Typing shows larger text when typing in a text field, and in a user’s preferred font and color.\r<br />\n- For users at risk of losing their ability to speak, Personal Voice will be available in Mandarin Chinese.
