This is something that was first introduced on the incredibly expensive <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670776/apple-pro-display-xdr-release-date-price-specs.html\">Pro Display XDR</a>, before coming to other Apple products beginning with the now-discontinued 27-inch iMac. So, what is it, and should you spend hundreds more to have it adorn your screen?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What is Nano-texture glass?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Glare is often a problem in brightly lit offices and homes, which can render the large, glossy displays little more than hugely elaborate mirrors. One way to combat this is through matte displays. Opting for the new nano-texture glass will drastically reduce glare while avoiding the frostiness and washed-out colors that are often the compromise made when opting for a matte finish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s all thanks to some clever design and a meticulous process that results in displays that can happily cope with bright light sources, albeit at a rather costly addition to the price tag.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How does nano-texture glass work?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the main causes of glare is light from lamps, windows, and other sources reflecting back at you due to the smooth surfaces of modern displays. Matte finishes combat this by having some kind of coating on the display which diffuses or breaks down the light due to its more angular surface. Sadly, this works both ways, so the light emanating from the display itself is also altered, resulting in the murkier results that usually accompany the technique.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has taken things to the next level by foregoing a coating and instead physically altering the surface itself through tiny (nano) etchings. The pattern of the etchings means that light rays hitting the display are reflected off at a range of angles, eradicating most of the glare in the process.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3794587/what-is-nano-texture-and-do-i-need-it-reflect_thumb.png\" alt=\"What is nano texture and do i need it: Nano-texture Glass\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"What is nano texture and do i need it: Nano-texture Glass\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"What is nano texture and do i need it: Nano-texture Glass\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The very clever part is that this somehow doesn’t seem to have much of an effect on the onscreen display. Of course, making all those microscopic etches in the glass is a precision job, which is why it costs more. Over the years the price has come down, however, and the additional cost of the M4 iPad Pro is just $100 more than the standard glass (though you’ll need to get at least 1TB of storage).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How can I clean nano-texture glass?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the quirks of Apple’s new Nano-texture glass display is that the company insists it can only be cleaned using a specific Apple cloth. One is included with every display, but we’re not entirely sure what magic ingredients make it such a special piece of fabric.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Needless to say, if you’ve just forked out half a grand for a special display technology, it’s probably a good idea to follow the manufacturer’s instructions and not buy a £5/$5 knockoff cloth from eBay.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How durable is the nano-texture glass?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nano-texture is as durable as standard glass. Since it doesn’t have a coating, there shouldn’t be any noticeable wear.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Should I get nano-texture glass on my Apple device?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The main reason for adding on the costly Nano-texture glass feature is if you are struggling with glare, for example, if you use your Studio Display in a room with bright overhead lights or work outside on your iPad Pro. </p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\nApple Inc, Mac</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"f0af9f16e94b740f47bfa7507b620d85ac4a6801e6e0a6fbb56d9227a5a8bae9","category":"Apple"}
