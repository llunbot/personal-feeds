{"title":"Meta’s Plans for E2EE Messaging Interop for WhatsApp and Messenger","link":"https://engineering.fb.com/2024/03/06/security/whatsapp-messenger-messaging-interoperability-eu/","date":1709767223000,"content":"\n<p>Engineering at Meta:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>To comply with a new EU law, the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which \ncomes into force on March 7th, we’ve made major changes to \nWhatsApp and Messenger to enable interoperability with third-party \nmessaging services. [...] </p>\n\n<p>To interoperate, third-party providers will sign an agreement with \nMessenger and/or WhatsApp and we’ll work together to enable \ninteroperability. Today we’ll publish the WhatsApp Reference Offer \nfor third-party providers which will outline what will be required \nto interoperate with the service. The Reference Offer for \nMessenger will follow in due course. [...] </p>\n\n<p>In order to maximize user security, we would prefer third-party \nproviders to use the Signal Protocol. Since this has to work for \neveryone however, we will allow third-party providers to use a \ncompatible protocol if they are able to demonstrate it offers the \nsame security guarantees as Signal. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Unclear to me whether these third-party providers will, somehow, only function in the EU, or if Meta is opening this up worldwide. Also unclear to me is who benefits from this?</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/06/meta-messaging-interop\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"aeb781a88426ecf9318048b903f82ef1d8087c4374d6cae23ee482c77b81bc80","category":"Tech"}
