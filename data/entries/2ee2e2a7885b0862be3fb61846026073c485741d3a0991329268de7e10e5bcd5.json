Before January's end, major science agencies had <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/science-at-risk-the-funding-pause-is-more-damaging-than-you-might-think/\">instituted pauses</a> on research funding, and grant funding has not been <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/report-us-scientists-lost-3-billion-in-nih-grants-since-trump-took-office/\">restored to previous levels</a> since. Many individual grants have been targeted on ideological grounds, and agencies like the National Science Foundation are <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/white-house-budget-proposal-could-shatter-the-national-science-foundation/\">expected to see significant cuts</a>. Since then, individual universities have been targeted, starting with an ongoing fight <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/nyregion/columbia-response-trump-demands.html\">with Columbia University</a> over $400 million in research funding.</p>\n<p>This week, however, it appears that the targeting of university research has entered overdrive, with multiple announcements of funding freezes targeting several universities. Should these last for any considerable amount of time, they will likely cripple research at the targeted universities.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, Science learned that the National Institutes of Health <a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/nih-freezes-all-research-grants-columbia-university\">has frozen</a> all of its research funding to Columbia, despite the university agreeing to steps previously demanded by the administration and the resignation of its acting president.
