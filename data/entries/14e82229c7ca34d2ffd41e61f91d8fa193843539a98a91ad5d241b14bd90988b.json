Early MS-DOS apps and games worked fine, and the very first Windows versions ran… technically. Just not the later ones that could actually run Windows software.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/the-ultimate-windows-3-1-laptop-sellers-behind-book-8088-are-back-with-pocket-386/\">Pocket 386 laptop</a> is a lot like the Book 8088, but fast-forwarded to the next huge evolution in the PC’s development. Intel’s 80386 processors not only jumped from 16-bit operation to 32-bit, but they implemented different memory modes that could take advantage of many megabytes of memory while maintaining compatibility with apps that only recognized the first 640KB.</p>\n<p>Expanded software compatibility makes this one more appealing to retro-computing enthusiasts since (like a vintage 386) it will do just about everything an 8088 can do, with the added benefit of a whole lot more speed and much better compatibility with seminal versions of Windows. It’s much more convenient to have all this hardware squeezed into a little laptop than in a big, clunky vintage desktop with slowly dying capacitors in it.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034561#p3\">Read 53 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2034561&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"14e82229c7ca34d2ffd41e61f91d8fa193843539a98a91ad5d241b14bd90988b","category":"Tech"}
