Essentially, by tucking both the original L-wrench body AND all of the new tools into a single beefed-up tire lever, the new Daysaver Coworking5 multitool doesn’t even take up much more space in your bag or pocket. And again, it’s modular and surprisingly lightweight…</p><h2>Daysaver Coworking5 light, compact 14-function multi-tool</h2><p>Developed as an extension for the 9-function original <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2020/09/21/a-45-gram-nine-function-multi-tool-the-pb-swiss-made-daysaver-is-super-light-compact/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">45g Daysaver multi-tool</a>, the new Coworking5 adds 5 more functions and just 30g, raising it from the realm of minimalist mini-tool to full-featured ride-saving multitool.

And using the tire lever as a long supportive handle that also includes molded-in supports for the chain’s links, it actually looks like an actually usable chain breaker vs. the tiny solutions in some multi-tools. The 3mm from the Daysaver Multitool drives the pin to remove damaged links from 9-12-speed chains, including SRAM flattop (and in all likelihood Campy &amp; Rotor 13sp too.)</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15101841/Daysaver-Coworking5-lightweight-compact-14-function-multi-tool_exploded.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15101841/Daysaver-Coworking5-lightweight-compact-14-function-multi-tool_exploded.jpg\" alt=\"Daysaver Coworking5 lightweight compact 14-function multi-tool,&nbsp;exploded\" width=\"1200\" height=\"620\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15101841/Daysaver-Coworking5-lightweight-compact-14-function-multi-tool_exploded.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15101841/Daysaver-Coworking5-lightweight-compact-14-function-multi-tool_exploded-297x153.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15101841/Daysaver-Coworking5-lightweight-compact-14-function-multi-tool_exploded-800x413.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15101841/Daysaver-Coworking5-lightweight-compact-14-function-multi-tool_exploded-120x62.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/15101841/Daysaver-Coworking5-lightweight-compact-14-function-multi-tool_exploded-768x397.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p>The carefully refined Coworking5 design is based on a glass fiber reinforced plastic tire lever as a body, into which a machined &amp; hardened stainless steel chainbreaker head nests.
