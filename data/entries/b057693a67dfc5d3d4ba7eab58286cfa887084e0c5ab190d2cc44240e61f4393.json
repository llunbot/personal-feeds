While Naoe uses stealth skills, Yasuke excels at combat.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe game has a vast open world to explore, and players will experience a variety of landscapes with evolving weather and seasons. There are castle towns, bustling ports, pastoral landscapes, and peaceful shrines.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUbisoft executive producer Marc-Alexis Côté said that Assassin's Creed Shadows is his team's \"most ambitious\" game to date.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPlaying Assassin's Creed Shadows on an Apple device requires a Mac with an Apple silicon chip, with real-time ray tracing available on M3 and M4 Macs.
