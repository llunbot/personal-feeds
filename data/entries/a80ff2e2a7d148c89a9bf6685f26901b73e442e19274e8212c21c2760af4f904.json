But then, Dom Mason of Mason Cycles is not most people. Since launching 10 years ago, Mason Cycles has become known for pushing the boundaries of what is possible with metals-based frame design, blending classic aesthetics and materials with progressive riding components and technologies. They’ve amassed a cult-like following among their customer base (full disclosure: I own two Masons) and fostered a Supported Rider group who have racked up an impressive list of racing/FKT wins on their bikes. With the 10-year anniversary this year and celebratory release of their 10th frame edition – a racey aluminum bikepacking hardtail dubbed the Macro – I  paid a visit to the barn to catch up with Dom about the journey so far, his design philosophies and inspirations, and what’s coming in the future.</p>\n<p><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-2.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-2.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-2.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-2.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-26.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-26.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-26.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-26.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-26.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>The Barn: A Maker’s Space</h3>\n<p>Arriving at the Mason barn, you’d be forgiven for questioning if you are in the right place. It’s literally in the middle of a working farm, and from the outside at least, feels as if you have been teleported back in time a couple of centuries. The rolling hills of the South Downs are on the doorstep – the ideal testing ground for Mason’s array of on- and off-road bikes. The barn itself is a beautiful example of timeless heritage, design, and craft, which feels significant in the context of the Mason Cycles story. It is a maker’s space, functioning for centuries in different guises. It’s repurposing as a bike designer’s workshop is just a blip in the context of the barn’s long history.</p>\n<p>Dom arrives in his 1972 baby blue VW campervan. Recurrent themes of form and function will punctuate our conversations throughout the day, and so it is fitting that he drives around in such a beautifully designed and iconic vehicle. Indeed, he would later mention that a soft spot for classic cars (and retro agricultural vehicles) is a significant inspiration for bike colorway schemes.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-31.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-31.jpg?w=1999&amp;quality=75 1999w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-31.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-31.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-31.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Inside Dom’s design studio, up in the eaves of an old grain store, it’s an aesthete’s paradise. Think <em>architect’s studio</em> rather than <em>classic bike workshop</em>, with light from the Velux windows flooding an array of artwork and skating memorabilia adorning the walls. It’s all very specific, and it’s clear that Dom’s attention to aesthetic detail extends beyond bike design. A titanium headless guitar Dom designed in collaboration with legendary designer Ola Strandberg sits on the side next to a titanium bike frame prototype.</p>\n<p>We start talking about the skate stuff before getting onto bikes. Dom says, “Ever since being a kid, it’s always been about riding, whether that’s on two wheels with bikes or four wheels on a skateboard. But I’ve been into skating since the beginning. Skating is rooted in counterculture and is all about not being constrained by rules or other’s expectations. I suppose I have taken some of that ethos into the bike design”.</p>\n<p>We take a tour around the rest of the Barn, and I’m struck by the juxtaposition (or perhaps more the symbiosis) of the old and new, the tradition and innovation, the conformity and rebelliousness pervading the physical space. Which, I suppose, also sits at the heart of the Mason brand.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-11.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-11.jpg?w=1999&amp;quality=75 1999w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-11.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-11.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-11.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-20.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-20.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-20.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-20.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-20.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-16.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-16.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-16.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-16.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-16.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>The Story: 10 Years of Mason Cycles</h3>\n<p>After spending a decade designing frames for Kinesis, Dom founded Mason Cycles back in 2014 with a vision to do things a little differently. “The aim was to show what could be achieved by combining progressive frame design and component technologies with traditional making techniques, working with metals and custom tubing. Our officially registered company name is Mason Progressive Cycles, which gives you an indication as to how I think about the design process”.</p>\n<p>Before moving to the Barn, Dom and his wife Julie (who remains the logistical brains behind the operation) set up shop from their living room. The first bikes to be released (the alloy <a href=\"https://masoncycles.cc/shop/categories/definition-bikes\" target=\"_blank\">Definition</a> and steel <a href=\"https://masoncycles.cc/shop/categories/definition-bikes\" target=\"_blank\">Resolution</a> road bikes) were disc brake-only and offered wide tire clearances. “It sounds a bit silly to say it now looking back at it, because now it’s the norm, but that really raised some eyebrows at the time. We definitely lost some sales by telling customers they couldn’t have rim brakes.” A key moment in the early days of the brand came in when <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/joshibbett/\" target=\"_blank\">Josh Ibbett</a> won the 2nd edition of the now iconic Trans-Continental on a Mason Definition in 2015. “That put us on the map. I remember doing this new thing called ‘dot-watching’ and thinking, ‘This could be pretty cool for us if he wins!’”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-12.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-12.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-12.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-12.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-12.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>This marked the first (but by no means the last) impressive feat achieved on a Mason bike. “Early on we realized how valuable the insights from people like Josh could be, who are pushing the bikes to the absolute limits of what is possible out on these ultra races. And as the scene evolved over the last decade and became more off-road focused, we took the feedback from these riders and made it central to our design process for new models.” Such was the genesis of Mason’s small group of more elite-supported riders, who have since achieved some big wins and FKTs on some of the biggest races/routes out there.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://masoncycles.cc/shop/categories/bokeh-bikes\" target=\"_blank\">Bokeh</a> was released in 2016 and became an instant classic, winning numerous awards just as “gravel” was really taking off as a concept, offering wider tire clearances and bikepacking mounting points whilst retaining a racey, performance feel. “I was pretty nervous unveiling the original Bokeh at the Made Bike trade show that year, ” Dom says. “I felt like people would like it, but I didn’t really know. I spotted the guys from Open Cycles, who were showcasing their new bike, the Up, which also proved to be a huge success, and I thought, ‘Maybe I am doing something right after all,’ and then it kind of just took off from there!”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-33.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-33.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-33.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-33.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-33.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-18.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-18.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-18.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-18.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-18.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-36.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-36.jpg?w=1999&amp;quality=75 1999w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-36.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-36.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-36.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>In the intervening years, Mason has since released seven new frame models (to take their total offering up to 10) by continuously responding to the evolution of riders’ needs and increasing the popularity of more extreme off-road ultra racing and touring by incorporating new technologies. The <a href=\"https://masoncycles.cc/shop/categories/insearchof-bikes\" target=\"_blank\">InSearchOf</a>, for example, combines a drop bar with suspension-corrected geometry and a proprietary load-bearing front mudguard for the most gnarly of fast travel. In more recent releases, the flat bar <a href=\"https://masoncycles.cc/shop/categories/raw-bikes\" target=\"_blank\">RAW</a> (steel) and Macro (alloy) hardtails have been designed to both climb and descend fast, as well as to accommodate loaded bikepacking bags on more technical terrain.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2003\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-7.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-7.jpg?w=2003&amp;quality=75 2003w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-7.jpg?resize=1200,799&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-7.jpg?resize=2000,1331&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-7.jpg?resize=768,511&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-7.jpg?resize=1536,1022&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>The Design:  A Philosophical Approach</h3>\n<p>Throughout our conversations, it becomes clear that Dom’s approach to bike design transcends the physicality of the metalwork or the statistics of frame geometry. It borders on the philosophical; it’s about the feel or emotion of the ride, a concept or idea behind each bike.</p>\n<p>Take, for example, the naming conventions of the different frames, which all reference something to do with photography (Bokeh, RAW, Exposure, Aspect, etc). “There is a technicality and a precision required to compose a photograph, as well as to design a bike. But the end product is about the essence of the journey or a moment in time. Bikes and cameras are both tools for creating something memorable.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-20.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-20.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-20.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-20.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-20.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Another concept of something that Dom calls <em>Ride Driven Design</em> keeps popping up.  “It’s kind of a north star I follow for all design decisions. Progressive technology is what we are all about here at Mason, but it must add value to the riding experience. We aren’t going to incorporate something just because the marketers at the bigger brands are pushing it as that year’s new fad.” For that reason, the original bikes like the Resolution or the Bokeh have received some minor tweaks over the years but remain pretty close to the originals and retain a sense of timelessness. If it doesn’t need fixing, and all that.</p>\n<p>It all goes back to the idea of function and form. For Dom, the form can only be driven by the function. But as I wander through the barn complex and get to peruse all the prototypes and general paraphernalia knocking around, it’s clear the final form is not overlooked either. The bikes are genuinely beautiful, in both the detailing as well as the colors, which are particularly striking. I was amazed to learn that the very specific ‘filter yellow’ on Dom’s own <a href=\"https://masoncycles.cc/shop/categories/exposure-bikes\" target=\"_blank\">Exposure</a> gravel bike (and my own Raw hardtail) came from a 1973 Mercedes Unimog farm vehicle!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-33.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-33.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-33.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-33.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-33.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-34.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-34.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-34.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-34.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-34.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-35.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-35.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-35.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-35.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-35.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>The Making: Traditional Craftmanship, Small Batches, Custom Components</h3>\n<p>Downstairs in the barn is the engine room of the operation, where bikes are assembled in the workshop. Low ceilings, exposed beams, raw brickwork… you really feel the heritage of the space here. It’s an appropriate environment for the final step of the making journey, given Mason’s choice to work with traditional small-batch framebuilders in the manufacturing process. “I had done the whole Taiwan thing with Kinesis, but I wanted to return to the original home of metal bike manufacturing, which is Italy. Some of those guys have 65+ years of metal frame-making experience. The idea was to combine their traditional craftsmanship with cutting-edge design and technology.”</p>\n<p>In total, Mason works with 5 frame fabricators, working closely with Italian tubing maestros Columbus and Dedacciai to provide custom tubesets just for Mason.  The idea is that they are not constrained by one provider in the pursuit of excellence in the final product. “I wanted the titanium bikes to be made by the best guys for titanium, whose workshop might not necessarily be the best for steel or aluminum. Getting my hands on the tubing, and having close personal relationships with these guys, is really important for me – especially when I drive them all crazy by insisting that everything is custom!”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-49.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-49.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-49.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-49.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mason_Cycles_Shop_Visit-49.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>The Future: What’s Next for Mason?</h3>\n<p>Asking Dom about what the future holds, he is naturally pretty coy. One thing unequivocally not on the cards will be updating or releasing new bikes unless there is a genuinely good reason, driven by the <em>Ride Driven Design</em> philosophy. “I have literally had nights staring at my bedroom ceiling, wondering whether I should offer fully integrated routing or not, so I’ll probably continue to sweat the small stuff.”</p>\n<p>Dom continues, “A big inspiration for me to keep going in this business, which can be a tough industry to be in at times, is seeing the amazing things that people go out and achieve on Mason bikes. It’s super motivating. It would be cool to engage even more with this amazing community we have built.”</p>\n<p>Amen to that. Happy 10th anniversary, Dom and team Mason. We look forward to seeing what the next decade brings!</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/mason-cycles-shop-visit/\">A Visit to the Mason Cycles Barn: Celebrating 10 Years of Progress</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"spencer harding","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"a80ff2e2a7d148c89a9bf6685f26901b73e442e19274e8212c21c2760af4f904","category":"Cycling"}
