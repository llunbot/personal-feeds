The prototype has a production date of March 2017, a key period in the development of Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpower/\">AirPower</a> wireless charging mat. This version of ‌MagSafe‌ was apparently developed directly alongside ‌AirPower‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe earlier version of ‌MagSafe‌ for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> features a rubberized outer shell that feels similar to the base of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a>, rounded edges, a different array of magnets with opposite magnetism, and a large Apple logo. It is apparently the same approximate size as the final version, but noticeably thinner. The design language distinctively harks back to an earlier period in Apple's history that more generously used white rubberized plastics and featured its logo more prominently.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>Unreleased prototype of MagSafe Charger. It’s super rare yet interesting. Featured different design, magnetic placement, and materials used.<br />Produced around Mar. 2017, which same the AirPower does.

It ultimately launched with the design we know today alongside the ‌iPhone‌ 12 in October 2020, seeming to taking direct inspiration from the Apple Watch's charger with a thicker silver aluminum outer shell, flat sides, and no Apple logo.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/magsafecasedangle.jpg\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" /><em>The ultimately released version of ‌MagSafe‌ for ‌iPhone‌ (2020).</em></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKosutami previously shared images of various Apple charger prototypes, including a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/19/prototype-shows-why-apple-abandoned-airpower/\">functional AirPower charging mat</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/30/apple-planned-magsafe-charger-color-options/\">different color options</a> tested for the ‌MagSafe‌ charger, and an unreleased <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/14/collectors-discover-unreleased-apple-accessory/\">\"Magic Charger\" accessory</a>. <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/prototypes/\">Prototypes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kosutami/\">Kosutami</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/10/magsafe-charger-prototype-reveals-abandoned-design/\">MagSafe Charger Prototype Reveals Abandoned 2010s Design</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/magsafe-charger-prototype-reveals-abandoned-2010s-design.2415974/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"436641938d5fb457923fc07702507b3626d20909cfae19599214e79049046fdd","category":"Apple"}
