Musk claims this is “the only realistic way to address” an otherwise “hopeless losing battle” with “advanced AI bot swarms taking over” the platform.</p>\n<p>These changes will apparently take effect two weeks after Musk said Twitter will <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/03/twitter-to-un-verify-people-who-dont-pay-8-month-starting-on-april-fools-day/\">begin “un-verifying” legacy blue checked accounts</a>. That makes it likely that soon some of Twitter’s most beloved and trusted accounts will no longer be promoted widely to users via the “For You” tab if they refuse to pay $8 a month to get access to subscriber benefits.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1927341#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1927341&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e38c97f350a1ba39343c72e0ead1acdae462a5d7953e7b02a28a3c0dbb44f4be","category":"Tech"}
