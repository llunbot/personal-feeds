Just be warned that finding your FTP generally involves a 20-minute all-out effort or a ramp test, so it’s no walk in the park.</p>\n<h3>Zwift</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Zwift Z Fondo Series\" title=\"Zwift Z Fondo Series\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Zwift has been a game-changer for indoor cycling.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Zwift</i></span></div>\n<p><span>Founded by gamers with a love of cycling (and some good investment), <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/zwift-your-complete-guide/\">Zwift</a> has undoubtedly transformed the indoor riding experience.</span></p>\n<p><span>Zwift didn’t invent virtual riding.
