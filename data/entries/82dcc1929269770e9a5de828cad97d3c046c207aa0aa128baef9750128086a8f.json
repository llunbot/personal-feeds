{"title":"The Wedge-Shaped M1 MacBook Air Lives On: At Walmart, Starting at $700","link":"https://corporate.walmart.com/news/2024/03/15/walmart-brings-the-popular-macbook-air-with-the-m1-chip-to-its-shelves","date":1710536665000,"content":"\n<p>Walmart:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Walmart will begin selling MacBook Air with the M1 chip — continuing to deliver premium quality and unmatched affordability \nfor customers. MacBook Air features amazing performance and a long \nbattery life in its thin and light design. This is the first time \ncustomers can purchase a Mac directly from Walmart. The MacBook \nAir with the M1 chip is <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-MacBook-Air-13-3-inch-Laptop-Silver-M1-Chip-8GB-RAM-256GB-storage/609040889\">now available on Walmart.com</a> and will \nsoon be available in select Walmart stores for only $699. </p>\n\n<p>“Our mission at Walmart is to help customers save money so they \ncan live better — it’s not an either/or proposition. The very \nheart of that mission is the belief that customers should not have \nto sacrifice quality because of price,” said Julie Barber, \nexecutive vice president of Merchandising at Walmart U.S. “We’re \nworking hard to bring premium brands to our physical and virtual \nshelves, and we’re excited to work with Apple to do just that.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is a big deal. When the M3 MacBook Airs <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/03/m3-macbook-air-review-more-of-a-good-thing/\">arrived last week</a>, Apple dropped the M1 Air from its lineup and moved the M2 Air to the magic $999 spot in the lineup. But it looks like Apple is going to keep producing the M1 MacBook Air for this deal with Walmart. These aren’t refurbs, or leftover stock (Apple hasn’t kept excess stock in inventory for bestselling products for decades — keeping inventory low is one of the hallmarks of Apple’s operations in the Cook era).</p>\n\n<p>And while, yes, these machines are now over three years old, for $700 this is a great deal. I’d bet serious money that a base M1 MacBook Air outperforms any other $700 laptop on the market. Fascinating example of pricing-as-branding that Apple won’t sell this machine in its own stores, but will through Walmart — which doesn’t sell any other Macs.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/15/macbook-air-walmart\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"82dcc1929269770e9a5de828cad97d3c046c207aa0aa128baef9750128086a8f","category":"Tech"}
