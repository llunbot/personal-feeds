stiffness and speed to make it the “fastest bike [it has] ever produced”.</p>\n<p>Specialized has largely stuck with the winning ingredients of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2021-specialized-tarmac/\">Tarmac SL7</a> but set out to increase compliance and improve aerodynamics, primarily through the use of its elongated Speed Sniffer head tube and a new integrated bar-stem.</p>\n<p>The brand has also trimmed the fat, resulting in a feathery 685g claimed frame weight for a size 56cm.</p>\n<p>The second-tier FACT 10r frames have undergone a revamp too, with a 780g claimed frame weight (also in a size 56cm), 20g lighter than the SL7.</p>\n<h2>Tarmac SL7 meets Aethos?</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n
