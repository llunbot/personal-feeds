Could brands be holding back their best new cycling swag for the Olympics?</p>\n<p>Back to the Tour and highlights have included a number of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/new-bikes-2021-tour-de-france/\">new pro bikes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/tour-de-france-2020-tech-round-up/\">lots of unbranded wheels and new time-trial equipment</a>, and the extraordinary sideshow that has been <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/lachlan-morton-podcast/\">Lachlan Morton’s Alt Tour</a>.</p>\n<p>Back at BikeRadar HQ, we had tech writer Simon Bromley giving his verdict on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/aero-bike-test-notes/\">the state of the aero road bike</a> market following his recent group test. We also had mountain bike tech editor Alex Evans sharing <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/alexs-ancient-and-favourite-tools/\">his all-time favourite tools</a> for “hitting, being hit and hitting harder” in our latest edition of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/tags/high-mileage-heroes/\">High Mileage Heroes</a>.</p>\n<h2>ControlTech TiMania stem, seatpost and handlebar</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> In addition to alloy and carbon finishing kit, ControlTech also produces a line of cast titanium parts.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>ControlTech started out producing bar ends in 1989 before expanding into other finishing kit (with the odd dabble in <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-suspension-forks/\" target=\"_blank\">suspension forks</a> and other components along the way).</p>\n<p>Following a relaunch in 2017, the brand now produces a wide range of finishing kit across all disciplines in an interesting variety of materials, including <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Controltech-Timania-Titanium-Carbon-Handlebar/dp/B07T977WVC?tag=bikrad-21&amp;ascsubtag=bikeradar-0\" target=\"_blank\">a wild titanium/carbon hybrid drop bar</a>.</p>\n<p>ControlTech’s TiMania titanium finishing kit range is a particular highlight, and I have a selection of it in for testing.</p>\n<p>Whether or not titanium is necessarily a better material for finishing kit than carbon or alloy is debatable, but that’s hardly the point.</p>\n<p>It looks cool, feels a bit exotic (and is priced as such!) and will match your brushed <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-titanium-road-bikes/\">titanium road bike</a> nicely. This will be justification enough for the true ti-vangelists out there.</p>\n<h3>Controltech TiMania stem</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The stem weighs 148g.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Like most conventional alloy stems, the TiMania stem is forged.</p>\n<p>Many titanium stems are welded together from separate components. This is a less complex process because stem lengths and angles can also be easily accommodated by mitering the central ‘extension’ to suit.</p>\n<p>Forging the stem is claimed to improve strength and allows Controltech to more accurately remove excess material from certain areas compared to machining.</p>\n<p>The stem is available in sizes 70 to 120mm. My 120mm sample weighs 148g.</p>\n<ul><li>$485</li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Controltech TiMania riser bar</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Titanium bars are claimed to have a buzz-taming ride quality.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Matching the stem is this Controltech TiMania riser bar. It is a fairly conventional bar with 20mm of rise, 6 degrees of upsweep and 9 degrees of backsweep.</p>\n<p>It is available in 720 or 760mm widths, weighs 266g in the wider size and has a brushed finish. A flat top and true flat bar are also available.</p>\n<p>Like titanium frames, titanium bars are claimed to provide a degree of pleasing vibration damping on rough terrain (I’m dubious but will withhold final judgement until I have tested it).</p>\n<p>That aside – to quote ControlTech – the “natural metal finish adds a subtle hint of exotica to any bike”, which no one can argue with.</p>\n<ul><li>$445</li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Controltech TiMania SB0 seatpost</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The titanium seatpost is a lovely bit of kit.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Finally, we have the Timania SB0 seatpost. This is the zero setback version of Controltech’s titanium post. A post with 12mm setback is also available.</p>\n<p>It uses a familiar clamp arrangement that sees a cylindrical tube running through the post. This is then attached to a matching free-floating clamp. The saddle rails sit in a carbon fibre cradle. A similar setup is used on many lightweight seatposts.</p>\n<p>The brand has indulged in a cheeky bit of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/this-is-drillium-done-so-so-wrong/\" target=\"_blank\">drillium</a> at the base of the post in the name of weight savings, with the uncut post coming in at 225g.</p>\n<ul><li>$455</li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Deda Piega handlebar</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> At the other end of the price spectrum, we have Deda’s Piega bar.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Deda’s Piega bar is nothing new or particularly extraordinary, so what has earned it a spot in First Look Friday?</p>\n<p>Put simply, this is a public service announcement for the retrogrouches among us – if you are looking for a black <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/road-bike-handlebars-guide-how-to-choose-the-right-ones/\" target=\"_blank\">road handlebar</a> with a 26mm clamp for a retro build, don’t mess around waiting for some new old stock option, just buy these.</p>\n<p>I toiled over eBay for hours prior to buying these and can almost guarantee you’ll struggle to find anything better for the price.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The bar has a modern profile that works well with integrated shifters.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Available in sizes 38cm through 46cm in 2cm steps, the Deda Piega handlebar has a perfectly inoffensive modern semi-compact shape that works well with modern integrated shifters.</p>\n<p>You’ll probably have to do the ever-terrifying ‘<a href=\"https://velo-orange.blogspot.com/2014/10/bike-tips-and-tricks.html#:~:text=penny%20%2B%20quill%20stem\" target=\"_blank\">penny trick</a>’ to pry open the clamp on a typical quill stem when fitting it, but that’s not unusual for this type of bar.</p>\n<p>Better still, it can be regularly found from most online retailers for ~£25. What’s not to like?</p>\n<p>These have been fitted to an upcoming ‘neo-retro’ (I hate myself for calling it that too) build I’m working on. Full details to follow once the last of the parts arrive.
