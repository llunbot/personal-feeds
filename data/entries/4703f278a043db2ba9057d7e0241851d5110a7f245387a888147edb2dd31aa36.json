It details how the technology would use a set of pressure-sensitive resistors built into the fabric of the glove, to wirelessly actuate derailleur shifting in a highly programmable way. Flicking or extending a finger, or compression of the fingertip against the grip, or even the thumb tip, could signal to the derailleur to perform a shift.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such technology would allow a rider to shift through gears no matter their hand positioning, with the potential to make shifting quicker, easier, and possibly even safer in some scenarios, if of course it can be well executed. It could also shave some grams for those looking for marginal gains, with potential for front and rear derailleur shifting to be actuated by a single shifter worn on just one hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s a closer look at the proposition.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig5.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig5.jpg\" alt=\"sram patent glove axs shifter wearable actuator\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig5.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig5-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig5-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig5-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig5-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig5-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>It has not escaped our attention that the SRAM patent in question was filed on April 1st. We’ll allow readers decide whether that is of any relevance here.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>SRAM’s Wearable AXS Shifter</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The patent in question (US11703118B2) shows several drawings wherein a glove is furnished with one or more pressure-sensitive resistors or accelerometers (<em>green</em>), positioned on the pad of each finger, or on the tip of each finger – <em>seen in Fig. 5, above</em>. Each one is wired up to an electronic control unit (<em>orange</em>) that is affixed in a tool-free fashion to the backhand region of the glove via some kind of mount (<em>red</em>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SRAM describes how the electronic control unit is able to wirelessly communicate with an electronic derailleur (front or rear), or an electronic suspension adjuster, to shift gears or switch between damping modes on demand. Nothing special there… it’s the proposed <em>method of signalling</em> to the control unit to actuate shifting that is somewhat futuristic. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig12.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig12.jpg\" alt=\"sram glove axs shifter remote wearable technology bicycle drivetrain accelerometer in fingertip\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig12.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig12-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig12-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig12-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig12-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig12-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig12-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig12-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>In reference to the use of an accelerometer to actuate a shift, the patent reads, “<em>Such devices have many advantages as shift control sensors. They are low power, very durable and do not require contact with any other object to work. The sensor simply senses its relative position in space as a function of gravity and change of position as a function of acceleration. For example, the orientation of the device relative to the ground can be used to indicate a shift signal</em>“.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The patent outlines a number of ways in which this wearable shifter could trigger a shift:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Flicking of the index finger</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Touching the thumb and any of the other fingers together, perhaps with some threshold force</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hyper-extension of any of the 5 digits beyond the normal operating range</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Compression of the tips of the fingers rather than the pads</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Any combination of the above actions</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If SRAM had the appetite, they could make this system very customizable, such that individual riders could program the control unit to respond to unique triggers that they find most intuitive, or easy and safe to execute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An excerpt from the patent document details one way in which the inventors foresee it in use:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“A right-hand actuator would cause a shift of the rear derailleur in one direction, a left-hand actuator would cause a shift of the rear derailleur in the other direction and activating both actuators simultaneously would toggle the front derailleur to the other of its current inboard or outboard position”.</em> Sounds like the normal thinking behind eTap shift logics, just without the need for shift levers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The patent document goes on to state that any movement used to trigger a shift should certainly not be encountered in the normal course of riding, in order to avoid unintended shifts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It strikes us that the wide variety of hand and finger shapes seen throughout the population would certainly need to be accounted for in any application of this technology – probably with a wide range of adjustability options to accurately fit the riding population. Ensuring those pressure-sensitive resistors or accelerometers are positioned as intended would be fundamental to its success, so it seems reasonable to suggest that SRAM may need to offer many sizes or even fully-custom gloves (aka shifters) to roll this out.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Glove-Mounted AXS Shifters for Road Cycling</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig6.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig6.jpg\" alt=\"sram glove integrated axs shifter pressure sensors wearable technology for drivetrain operation\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig6.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig6-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig6-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig6-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig6-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig6-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig6-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig8.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig8.jpg\" alt=\"pressure sensitive resistor sram glove axs shifter\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig8.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig8-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig8-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig8-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig8-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig8-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig8-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This wearable shifter concept described by SRAM seems most applicable to road riding, and most of the images seen throughout the patent document do indeed depict a road bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Hmm… but how many roadies do you know that regularly wear full-finger gloves? Will you need to wear full-finger gloves on those hottest summer road rides? And what happens when winter comes and you need thicker gloves?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>On a drop handlebar, there are at least three different hand positions that a rider might be pedalling along in at any given moment; they could be in a low aero position in the drops, they could be in a more relaxed position with their hands on the tops, or they could be in between those extremes with their hands positioned on the hoods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It would conceivably be most convenient, and safe, to perform a shift from any of those three positions, <em>without</em> having to move one’s hand to a new position on the bar – or to let go of your grip on the bar. You can of course run SRAM eTap AXS Wireless Blips in any location, within reason, and you can have several if you wish, so that you have multiple locations on the bar from which to trigger a shift. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, there are downsides to that: adding more shifters means adding more wires and thus, weight, and it will also clutter the cockpit, reducing the aesthetic value.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m not much of a road cyclist myself, but I imagine that neither of those are overly palatable to anyone counting grams. SRAM’s glove-integrated shifter technology gets around all of this by putting the shifter on the rider, rather than on the bar, where it is almost ubiquitously mounted. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another advantage of this technology is that it could allow a rider to more easily, and safely, brake and change gears simultaneously. We wonder if that could actually present an advantage to a rider during a descent of a big Col in the Alps. Descending on the drops, the rider might be braking hard before a corner. Meanwhile, they could send a single finger into full extension, changing to an easier gear such that they’re subsequently in a better gear for getting back up to speed once they’re through the corner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Tom Pidcock demonstrated beautifully, not every mountainous stage of the Tour de France has to be won on the climbs. So, if there is another marginal gain to be had here, you can be sure riders and teams will want to check it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Wearable Wireless Shifters and Remotes for Mountain Biking</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Though the advantages are perhaps less obvious, it’s possible that a glove-integrated actuator could be implemented off-road, too. The technology could be be used as described above, but with mountain biking being a little less predictable than road riding, and at least on social rides a lot more of a stop-start (faff) affair, it seems there’d be greater scope for accidental triggering of a shift.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a more controlled, competition environment, however, it could be advantageous in other ways. While the patent focuses on gear changing, it also mentions potential use as a remote for suspension adjustment. It’s not alluded to in the patent, but why not for your AXS dropper post, too?</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig9-10.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig9-10.jpg\" alt=\"sram wearable axs shifter glove integrated pressure sensors trigger derailleur shifting suspension adjustment dropper post position\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig9-10.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig9-10-297x149.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig9-10-800x400.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig9-10-120x60.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig9-10-768x384.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig9-10-1536x768.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption>Images annotated by Cory Benson – Bikerumor</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine being able to switch your suspension from lock to open mode merely by applying pressure to the tip of your finger against the grip, or by pressing the tip of your index finger into the tip of your thumb? Or even, dropping or popping your dropper seat post by doing the same? To my mind, that seems like it could offer an ergonomic advantage over a more traditional handlebar-mounted remote, requiring the rider to move their hand less, and allowing them to maintain a more consistent grip.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Certainly, there are arguments to be made both ways as to whether the wearable solution would be safer and easier, or more clumsy and therefore dangerous, than the handlebar-mounted remote method. But, we trust that a company like SRAM has the financial capacity and expertise to collect the necessary data to learn more either way. And we already know their top-sponsored MTB athletes have been <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/prototype-120mm-rockshox-sid-xc-fork/\" target=\"_blank\">customizing AXS buttons</a> for years, first spotted on Kate Courtney’s and now Nino Schurter’s bikes, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>So why not Voice-Activated Shifting, too?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig15.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig15.jpg\" alt=\"sram voice activate axs shifter wearable device helmet mounted patent\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig15.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig15-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig15-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig15-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig15-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig15-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/SRAM-wearable-shifter-remote-glove-pressure-sensors_Fig15-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A final method, that seems to have been thrown in almost as an afterthought, is the possibility that shifting could be voice-activated. Fig. 15 shows a wireless control device (<em>orange</em>) and microphone (<em>84</em>) rigged up to a rider’s helmet. Seeing as how we are all able to operate our smartphones and smart televisions by speaking to them, it is certainly not outwith the realm of possibility that we could trigger a gear shift or suspension adjustment via the same method. This one is entirely hands-free, and arguably the safest method, if not the sexiest, of the lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Hey Siri, make it easier for me to get up that next climb!</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.sram.com/en/sram\" target=\"_blank\">SRAM.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/will-we-wear-the-next-generation-sram-axs-shifters/\">Will We Wear the Next-Generation SRAM AXS Shifters?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jessie-May Morgan","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"4703f278a043db2ba9057d7e0241851d5110a7f245387a888147edb2dd31aa36","category":"Cycling"}
