But wide adoption of EVs depends on more than just the availability of the cars themselves; we also need good charging infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Building new charging stations is not an overnight job, as it's a project fraught with red tape. But on <em><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/04/check-out-batmans-and-marty-mcflys-rides-at-the-petersen-museum/\">Back to the Future</a></em> day, Porsche released a whimsical video to celebrate the fact that, between <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/05/inside-electrify-americas-plan-to-simplify-electric-car-charging/\">the Electrify America network</a> and Ionity (its European equivalent), there is now at least 1.21 GW of DC fast-charging capacity available for its <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/08/the-porsche-taycan-4s-better-than-a-911-believe-it/\">Taycan electric cars</a>. (And any other EV that can fast-charge via CCS or CHAdeMO chargers, of course.)</p>\n<p>The relationship of charging infrastructure to EV adoption seems intuitive, and history confirms it. In <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/05/a-brief-look-at-electric-vehicles-from-the-dawn-of-the-automobile-age/\">the earliest days of motoring</a>, electric cars had a far higher market share than their <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/04/are-electric-vehicles-doomed-we-dont-think-so-despite-poor-sales/\">current 2–3 percent</a> and were vying for dominance with cars powered by internal combustion engines or even steam.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1805947#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1805947&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
