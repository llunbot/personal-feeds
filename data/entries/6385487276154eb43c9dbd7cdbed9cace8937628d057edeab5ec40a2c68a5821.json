The race will run for six stages from the Borders all the way down to Suffolk for the final stage to Felixstowe on Sunday 8th September. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-of-britain-favourites\" target=\"_blank\">Remco Evenepoel, Tom Pidcock and Julian Alaphilippe</a> lead a strong startlist hunting the overall title.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In total, the 2024 Tour of Britain will tackle 9,456m of elevation gain. Stage 3 from Sheffield to Barnsley offers the largest amount of uphill roads with 2,282m of climbing. In the fight for the GC, these climbing metres will prove decisive in the fight for the leader’s teal-coloured jersey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/tour-of-britain-route-riders-live-tv-guide-all-you-need-to-know\" target=\"_blank\">The <em>parcours </em>of this year’s race</a> includes three Category 1 climbs, six Category 2 tests and four Category 3 hills. The majority of these come during the first three stages through the Scottish Borders and Yorkshire.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Dingleton Road (Stage 1)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-1166765446-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"kelso tour of britain\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-1166765446-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-1166765446-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-1166765446-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-1166765446-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-1166765446-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-1166765446-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-1166765446-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-1166765446-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-1166765446-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-1166765446-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Ewan Bootman/NurPhoto via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The climbs come as soon as Stage 1 on this year’s race. During this undulating day through the Scottish Borders, the Dingleton [Road] climb will be tackled on two occasions. The race director Rod Ellingworth earmarked the climb saying: ‘for those riders who believe, the final climb at Dingleton can be a launchpad to victory in Kelso’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ascent has been granted Category 2 status at the 2024 Tour of Britain. The inclines begin in Melrose and last for around 2.6km averaging out at a 6% gradient. The climb will see 150m of elevation gain, adding to the 1,855m on offer during the opening stage. The riders will crest the climb for the second time at 20km to go. From there, they will dive down into Kelso for an arrival in the town’s cobbled square. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pavel Sivakov of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/ineos-grenadiers\" target=\"_blank\">Ineos Grenadiers</a> currently holds the KOM on Strava. He tackled the climb in 4:39 during the 2019 Tour of Britain. On that day, a similar approach to Kelso was negotiated. Back then, Matteo Trentin took the stage win ahead of Jasper de Buyst and Mike Teunissen.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n

Ugglebarnby Moor is 3km at a 6% gradient. Close to Whitby, the Yorkshire climb will open the hilly proceedings on Stage 2 from Darlington to Redcar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The climb has been warranted Category 1 status, like three of the climbs on Stage 2. The climb peaks with 80km to go, so don’t expect it to be a crucial point for riders in the GC. That said, it is within the long-range Evenepoel attack zone. We’ve seen him be ambitious before, and with few hilltop finishes and no time-trials at the 2024 Tour of Britain,<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/mens-olympic-road-race-paris-2024-gallery\" target=\"_blank\"> the Olympic champion</a> might see this as an opportunity to break free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The current Strava KOM is held by Julen Irizar, a former rider of the Euskaltel team. He tackled the climb during Stage 3 of the 2019 Tour de Yorkshire won by Alexander Kamp.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Lythe Bank (Stage 2)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-1146884516-970x533.jpg\" alt=\"lythe bank tour of britain\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-1146884516-970x533.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-1146884516-300x165.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-1146884516-768x422.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-1146884516-1536x844.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-1146884516-2048x1125.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-1146884516-750x412.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-1146884516-1140x626.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption>Ian Forsyth/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The 1.7km-long Lythe Bank, averaging 7.7%, will be one of the toughest challenges on Stage 2’s voyage through North Yorkshire. The climb comes as the riders exit the seaside town of Whitby towards Sandsend. The slopes will also give the riders a glimpse of the sea if they dare to look behind them on the steep incline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lythe Bank is one of the three first-category climbs in the 2024 race. Therefore, it will be pivotal in the fight for the mountains classification. Its slopes are hardest during its hairpinned opening phase through Sandsend. A measured effort will be necessary to claim the KOM points atop the Bank.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lythe Bank has been used before in the men’s and women’s Tour de Yorkshire. It hasn’t been used in a pro race since 2019, so it will make a welcome return to racing at the Tour of Britain.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Saltburn Bank (Stage 2)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-2158852055-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"saltburn bank\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-2158852055-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-2158852055-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-2158852055-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-2158852055-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-2158852055-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-2158852055-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-2158852055-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-2158852055-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-2158852055-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/GettyImages-2158852055-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Ian Forsyth/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Saltburn Bank hasn’t been classified as a climb by the organisers. Instead, the ramp will be rewarded with bonus seconds for the first three riders over the summit. The climb isn’t too long, but its average gradient of around 14% will make this a tough obstacle towards the end of Stage 2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For followers of British racing, Saltburn Bank will be familiar. It was used in the <em>parcours </em>of the past two editions of the British National Road Championships. During those races, the hill proved decisive in the wins of Ethan Hayter, Fred Wright and Pfeiffer Georgi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To celebrate the arrival of the Tour of Britain, the popular ‘Beefeater Bend’ is set to be on the Bank during the stage. These royally costumed fans went viral on social media a couple of years back for cheering on British riders around the Tour de France and other European races. If you’re in the area, make Saltburn Bank your spectator spot of choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hound Hill (Stage 3)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/08/07094915/tour_of_britain_peloton_the_rake_2019-970x647.jpeg\" alt=\"tour_of_britain_peloton_the_rake_2019\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A new addition to the Tour of Britain, Hound Hill will be the final categorised climb in Stage 3’s rolling stage through South Yorkshire. The climb comes in the final 10km of the day, so it could prove to be a pivotal launchpad for punchers like Julian Alaphilippe or Stevie Williams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The climb is narrow and peppered with a number of sharp 90-degree corners. It’s very British in its appearance with high-rising shrubbery on both sides of the road. To add, it also passes over the disused Blackburn Valley railway line. In total, the climb will last just 1.5km at an average gradient of nearly 7%. The hill crests at 4km to go before a final dash into Barnsley up Old Mill Lane – an uphill drag in itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hound Hill is named after a Grade II listed Tudor farmhouse found at the top of the climb. The house dates back to the late 16th century and was originally built by the Elmhirst family.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Read our <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/tour-of-britain-route-riders-live-tv-guide-all-you-need-to-know\" target=\"_blank\">full Tour of Britain preview</a> including the start list, TV timings and stage profiles.</em></p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-of-britain-best-moments\">5 standout Tour of Britain moments from the last ten years</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/hardknott-pass-cycling\">Classic climb: Hardknott Pass, the hardest climb in England</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bealach-na-ba-cycling\">Classic climb: Bealach na Bà, the climb that goes to 11</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-of-britain-favourites\">Tour of Britain 2024 favourites and riders to watch</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/tour-of-britain-route-riders-live-tv-guide-all-you-need-to-know\">Tour of Britain 2024: Route, start list, how to watch and all you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-of-britain-climbs\">The 5 climbs that will decide the Tour of Britain 2024</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Ewan Wilson &#124; Staff Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"6385487276154eb43c9dbd7cdbed9cace8937628d057edeab5ec40a2c68a5821","category":"Cycling"}
