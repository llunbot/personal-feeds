{"title":"Gurman: Tim Cook Has Put Mike Rockwell in Charge of Siri, Reporting to Craig Federighi","link":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-20/apple-vision-pro-chief-mike-rockwell-named-siri-head-giannandrea-keeps-ai-role","date":1742488002000,"content":"\n<p>Mark Gurman, with a blockbuster scoop for Bloomberg:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple Inc. is undergoing a rare shake-up of its executive ranks,\naiming to get its artificial intelligence efforts back on track\nafter months of delays and stumbles, according to people familiar\nwith the situation.</p>\n\n<p>Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has lost confidence in the\nability of AI head John Giannandrea to execute on product\ndevelopment, so he’s moving over another top executive to help:\nVision Pro creator Mike Rockwell. In a new role, Rockwell will be\nin charge of the Siri virtual assistant, according to the people,\nwho asked not to be identified because the moves haven’t been\nannounced.</p>\n\n<p>Rockwell will report to software chief Craig Federighi, removing\nSiri completely from Giannandrea’s command. Apple is poised to\nannounce the changes to employees this week. The iPhone maker’s\nsenior leaders — a group known as the Top 100 — just met at a\nsecretive, annual offsite gathering to discuss the future of the\ncompany. Its AI efforts were a key talking point at the summit,\nBloomberg News has reported. [...]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My quick take on this is that it’s a turf battle that Craig Federighi just won. It’s not just putting a new executive in charge of Siri, it’s moving Siri under Federighi’s group.</p>\n\n<p>How Gurman got this scoop before Apple had announced the changes — even internally — is rather unbelievable. It’s not “Bloomberg” that got this scoop. It’s Mark Gurman. And trust me, Apple PR did not leak this to him deliberately. I’m sure they’re now accelerating an announcement, at least internally, framing it on their own terms. I can only guess that Gurman hinted at his sourcing in the passage above: Tim Cook must have announced these changes at the Top 100 retreat this week, and at least two of those attendees leaked the news to Gurman. Unprecedented.</p>\n\n<p>Also:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rockwell is currently the vice president in charge of the Vision\nProducts Group, or VPG, the division that developed Apple’s\nheadset. As part of the changes, he’ll be leaving that team and\nhanding the reins to Paul Meade, an executive who has run hardware\nengineering for the Vision Pro under Rockwell.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don’t find it surprising at all that Rockwell was given this task.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Giannandrea will remain at the company, even with Rockwell taking\nover Siri. An abrupt departure would signal publicly that the AI\nefforts have been tumultuous — something Apple is reluctant to\nacknowledge. Giannandrea’s other responsibilities include\noversight of research, testing and technologies related to AI. The\ncompany also has a team reporting to Giannandrea investigating\nrobotics.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This I find a little surprising.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/20/gurman-rockwell-siri\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"57668f9f67ef1c88861a7087b9dd2aa1f67b90efe37de5ed7c4d3e4f0f22a436","category":"Tech"}
