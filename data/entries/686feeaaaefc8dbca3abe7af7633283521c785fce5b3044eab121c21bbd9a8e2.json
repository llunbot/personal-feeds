Together, we’ve fixed many issues with the platform’s backend, updated it to a new infrastructure, and paved the way for multiple website improvements.</p>\n<p>While this initial launch might not seem like a big change, allow me to walk you through it.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1668\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/NYE-Camp-6.jpg?fit=1200,1668&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/NYE-Camp-6.jpg?w=2500&amp;quality=75 2500w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/NYE-Camp-6.jpg?resize=1200,801&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/NYE-Camp-6.jpg?resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/NYE-Camp-6.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/NYE-Camp-6.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/NYE-Camp-6.jpg?resize=2048,1366&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p><em>Photo: Kyle Klain</em></p>\n<p>Our Radar column has shifted back to the left column. This is how the website was pre-2016 refresh. Now, we’ll be slow-dripping products and videos on the left throughout the day. <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/radar/\" target=\"_blank\">Radar</a> = news blips.</p>\n<p>The middle column is our endemic content. This is content we produce ourselves. All <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/reportage/\" target=\"_blank\">Reportage</a> galleries; Shop Visits, Beautiful Bicycles, Events, and Reviews will be in the middle column. The center feed will also contain Radar reviews or reviews that don’t include a gallery.</p>\n<p><em>On the far right is our ad columns; these ads, along with your <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/the-radavist-group-ride-subscription-plan-and-rad-bazaar/\" target=\"_blank\">Group Ride subscription</a>, <a href=\"https://shop.theradavist.com/\" target=\"_blank\">merch sales</a>, sponsored content (when noted), and affiliate links (we’re working on a page to explain how we use all of these – thanks for your patience!) keep this website and its staff funded. Thanks for your support!</em></p>\n<p>As with every refresh, there will be formatting issues or bugs that pop up from time to time. We have a checklist that’s running but if you spot anything awry, please note it here in the comments!</p>\n<p>Happy New Year!</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"686feeaaaefc8dbca3abe7af7633283521c785fce5b3044eab121c21bbd9a8e2","category":"Cycling"}
