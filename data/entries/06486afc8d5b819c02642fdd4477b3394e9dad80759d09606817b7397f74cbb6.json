Taken two ways, it’s a bike that lets you push your own limits, but it also pushed their engineering team to design it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two main goals were “How much weight could we save out of this frame?” and “How can we make the suspension more playful without giving up efficiency?”. After all, it still needs to ride like a Pivot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Founder Chris Cocalis said that while other brands had saving weight as a top priority on the newest bikes, Pivot’s focus was on suspension performance. So while other bikes dropped travel to 90mm or even as low as 60mm, and/or moved to a pivot-free rear dropout area by using a flexible seatstay, Pivot stuck with their DW-link design and looked at ways to refine it and the frame to improve performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-pivot-mach-4SL-XC-full-susp-race-mountain-bike-4.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-pivot-mach-4SL-XC-full-susp-race-mountain-bike-4-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of 2023 pivot mach 4sl xc mountain bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-pivot-mach-4SL-XC-full-susp-race-mountain-bike-4-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-pivot-mach-4SL-XC-full-susp-race-mountain-bike-4-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-pivot-mach-4SL-XC-full-susp-race-mountain-bike-4-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-pivot-mach-4SL-XC-full-susp-race-mountain-bike-4-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-pivot-mach-4SL-XC-full-susp-race-mountain-bike-4-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-pivot-mach-4SL-XC-full-susp-race-mountain-bike-4.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Their rear triangle, by the way, does <em>not</em> have a pivot near the rear axle, but does use a lower rocker arm connecting the one-piece rear triangle to the frame, and the top of the triangle pushes a rocker arm forward, which pushes the vertically-positioned shock downward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fun fact, the prior Mach 4SL was the first of their modern bikes to have a vertical shock layout, which allowed for a lower top tube and standover, lower center of gravity, and still allow for a water bottle inside the front triangle. This new bike keeps that design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, yes, shave a few grams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Actually, more than a few.

Pivot wanted to make it more <em>capable</em>, so shortening travel was definitely not a way to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they (mostly) went longer. By swapping rear shocks, you can get 95-103mm of rear travel with a 40mm stroke shock, or 106-115mm with a 45mm stroke shock. Both shocks use the same eye-to-eye length, so geometry doesn’t change when changing the shock, nor when changing modes (the Forks do, though, as the shorter stroke bikes get 100mm Fox 32 SC forks, the longer stroke ones get Fox 34 SC forks and will be slacker).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-pivot-mach-4SL-XC-full-susp-race-mountain-bike-7.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-pivot-mach-4SL-XC-full-susp-race-mountain-bike-7-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of 2023 pivot mach 4sl xc mountain bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-pivot-mach-4SL-XC-full-susp-race-mountain-bike-7-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-pivot-mach-4SL-XC-full-susp-race-mountain-bike-7-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-pivot-mach-4SL-XC-full-susp-race-mountain-bike-7-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-pivot-mach-4SL-XC-full-susp-race-mountain-bike-7-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-pivot-mach-4SL-XC-full-susp-race-mountain-bike-7-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-pivot-mach-4SL-XC-full-susp-race-mountain-bike-7.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The prior model had a fixed 100mm rear travel, a new flip chip at the upper shock mount lets you switch between two different travel settings for a given shock. But it changes more than just travel, it completely changes the bike’s personality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the shock in the rearward position, it has more travel and the rocker has more leverage over it, making for a plusher, more playful bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Move to the forward position and there’s less leverage, so it’s firmer and more efficient.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-pivot-mach-4SL-XC-full-susp-race-mountain-bike-17.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-pivot-mach-4SL-XC-full-susp-race-mountain-bike-17-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"pivot mach 4 sl suspension flip chip closeup detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-pivot-mach-4SL-XC-full-susp-race-mountain-bike-17-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-pivot-mach-4SL-XC-full-susp-race-mountain-bike-17-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-pivot-mach-4SL-XC-full-susp-race-mountain-bike-17-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-pivot-mach-4SL-XC-full-susp-race-mountain-bike-17-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-pivot-mach-4SL-XC-full-susp-race-mountain-bike-17-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-pivot-mach-4SL-XC-full-susp-race-mountain-bike-17.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The switch only moves the upper shock mount by 5.2mm, but it feels like a world of difference. The bike goes from squishy and fun to firm and fast (but still pretty fun).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the kinematics, the suspension has a rising rate until the rocker hits 90º to the shock, and then it’s a falling rate, which helps it push through the last bit of travel as the shock ramps up. The combination gives them a constant progression, preventing you from blowing through the travel but still letting you use all of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the longer-travel builds, which Pivot anticipates being 97% of their sales, the specific (average throughout the travel) numbers are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>106mm mode – 2.35:1 leverage ratio</li>\n\n\n\n<li>115mm mode – 2.55:1 leverage ratio</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-pivot-mach-4SL-XC-full-susp-race-mountain-bike-15.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-pivot-mach-4SL-XC-full-susp-race-mountain-bike-15-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of 2023 pivot mach 4sl xc mountain bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-pivot-mach-4SL-XC-full-susp-race-mountain-bike-15-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-pivot-mach-4SL-XC-full-susp-race-mountain-bike-15-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-pivot-mach-4SL-XC-full-susp-race-mountain-bike-15-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-pivot-mach-4SL-XC-full-susp-race-mountain-bike-15-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-pivot-mach-4SL-XC-full-susp-race-mountain-bike-15-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-pivot-mach-4SL-XC-full-susp-race-mountain-bike-15.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The longer travel setup is designed specifically around the air spring curve of <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2024-fox-float-sl-shocks-air-trail-xc-mtb/\">the new Float rear shock</a>. Despite the extra travel, Pivot says the longer travel version pedals even better than the prior Mach 4SL, which was already a really good, fast bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the shorter travel World Cup bikes, however, the existing Fox DPS shock worked well but begs the question, why not spec <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2024-fox-float-sl-shocks-air-trail-xc-mtb/\" target=\"_blank\">the new Float SL</a> for the lightest bikes?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cocalis says the DPS weighs about the same as the Float SL, there’s still a lot of inventory of the DPS while the Float SL isn’t really available yet, and they did all the testing with the DPS since this bike was in development 2.5 years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the Float SL will likely sub in after they’ve done all of the tuning and testing with it. But also, only about 3% of their sales will be the short travel model, so…NBD?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of tuning, they spec lighter shock valving for XS/Small frames.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-pivot-mach-4SL-XC-full-susp-race-mountain-bike-11.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-pivot-mach-4SL-XC-full-susp-race-mountain-bike-11-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of 2023 pivot mach 4sl xc mountain bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-pivot-mach-4SL-XC-full-susp-race-mountain-bike-11-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-pivot-mach-4SL-XC-full-susp-race-mountain-bike-11-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-pivot-mach-4SL-XC-full-susp-race-mountain-bike-11-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-pivot-mach-4SL-XC-full-susp-race-mountain-bike-11-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-pivot-mach-4SL-XC-full-susp-race-mountain-bike-11-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2023-pivot-mach-4SL-XC-full-susp-race-mountain-bike-11.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, you won’t find Live Valve suspension on it, only manual lockouts. Which, for a brand like Pivot that’s been a big fan of Live Valve since its inception, may seem odd. But, let’s be real, Live Valve has been out for a while, and <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/patent-patrol-fox-live-valve-is-about-to-get-a-lot-more-active/\">if patent filings are viewed as reading the future</a>, chances are something new is coming soon enough that it didn’t make sense to build all of the extra mounts and wire ports into this bike if they’d be outdated soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read into that what you will, but Pivot added that putting those holes and ports and mounts into the frame didn’t fit well with their stiffness and weight goals for this frame either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also added that the they designed this bike to perform extremely efficiently under pedaling, minimizing the difference between the old bikes with Live Valve and these bikes without them.
