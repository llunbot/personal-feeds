{"title":"Apple Sues Former Employee for Leaking to Reporters From The Wall Street Journal and The Information","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/28/apple-sues-former-employee-for-alleged-leaking/","date":1711656786000,"content":"\n<p>Joe Rossignol, reporting for MacRumors:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple this month sued its former employee Andrew Aude in \nCalifornia state court, alleging that he breached the company’s \nconfidentiality agreement and violated labor laws by leaking \nsensitive information to the media and employees at other tech \ncompanies. Apple has demanded a jury trial, and it is seeking \ndamages in excess of $25,000. [...] </p>\n\n<p>In April 2023, for example, Apple alleges that Aude leaked a list \nof finalized features for the iPhone’s Journal app to a journalist \nat The Wall Street Journal on a phone call. That same month, The \nWall Street Journal’s Aaron Tilley published a report titled \n“<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-plans-iphone-journaling-app-in-expansion-of-health-initiatives-690b2c8b\">Apple Plans iPhone Journaling App in Expansion of Health \nInitiatives</a>.” </p>\n\n<p>Using the encrypted messaging app Signal, Aude is said to have \nsent “over 1,400” messages to the same journalist, who Aude \nreferred to as “Homeboy.” He is also accused of sending “over \n10,000 text messages” to another journalist at the website The \nInformation, and he allegedly traveled “across the continent” to \nmeet with her. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>10,000 text messages seems like ... a lot? Makes me wonder if there was a personal aspect to that relationship, beyond leaking. <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/718014193/Apple-Inc-v-Andrew-Aude\">MacRumors has posted a copy of Apple’s lawsuit</a>, which includes this gem:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple learned of Mr. Aude’s misconduct in the fall of 2023. When \nApple met with him to discuss his improper disclosures, Mr. Aude \npromptly confirmed his guilt through his actions, if not his \nwords. At the start of his November 7, 2023 interview, Mr. Aude \nrepeatedly denied that he had leaked any information to anyone. He \nalso claimed that he did not have his Apple-issued work iPhone \nwith him. Feigning the need to visit the bathroom mid-interview, \nMr. Aude then extracted his iPhone from his pocket during the \nbreak and permanently deleted significant amounts of evidence from \nhis device. This included the Signal app, which memorialized his \nhistory of leaking information to “Homeboy” (and likely others) \nvia encrypted communications. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Part of the evidence Aude left behind were screenshots he kept of otherwise secure messages:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In connection with one leak, Mr. Aude admitted that he violated \nhis obligations to Apple so he could “kill” products and features \nwith which he took issue. As his frequent Google searches, article \nshares, and screenshots saved to his Apple-issued work iPhone \nreveal, vanity and personal enjoyment of the media’s attention \nalso played a significant role in his malfeasance. In Mr. Aude’s \nscreenshot below memorializing his exchange with the WSJ \njournalist, Mr. Aude exclaimed that he could not “wait for chaos \nto break out” in reaction to a forthcoming article reflecting his \nleaked information. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Worth noting that Aaron “Homeboy” Tilley <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/u/aarontilley\">was a reporter for The Information</a> until September 2019, when he left to join the WSJ. Anyway, I’m sure the WSJ will help Aude out with his legal bills.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/28/apple-sues-leaker-andrew-aude\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"ea008f561061cdf0618d10c7f83909b20bfe3d437a28d39f2a239b8a36f7815b","category":"Tech"}
