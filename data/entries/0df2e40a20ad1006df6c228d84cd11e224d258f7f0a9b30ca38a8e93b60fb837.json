This buying guide will help you decide which Apple laptop is best for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple makes two types of laptops, the MacBook Air and the MacBook Pro. Within those two categories of Mac is a wide range of capabilities, the gap between the entry-level MacBook Air and the high-end 16-inch MacBook Pro is vast, but even within the MacBook Pro category you will find huge differences. We have more information on the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/667144/macbook-air-or-macbook-pro.html\">differences between the MacBook Air and Pro</a> in another article.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While there are seven MacBook Air models and ten MacBook Pro models sold as standard configurations, in reality, there are multiple combinations if you factor in all the build-to-order options that you can add such as extra RAM, more storage, or a faster processor, with which you can build an even more powerful Mac, should you need to. Choosing which MacBook to buy can be a tough decision, fortunately, we are here to help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re not sure yet if you want a laptop or desktop Mac, you should also read our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/219909/best-mac.html\" target=\"_blank\">Mac buying guide</a>, which covers both MacBooks and Apple’s desktop Macs. We also compare all the MacBook Pro models here: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/545699/macbook-pro-13-vs-14-16-inch-comparison-difference.html\">Which MacBook Pro</a>? We also offer advice about how much storage, RAM and cores in <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2308505/how-much-macbook-do-you-really-need.html\">How much MacBook do you really need?</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are various sections in this article. If you aren’t sure which Mac laptop you want then read on, if you have a vague idea but are choosing between two similar models, or if your needs are more professional than personal, then you might find the models further down this article more relevant. In that case, we suggest that you jump to the section about the MacBook that is most relevant to your needs. See the Table of Contents above. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>MacBook release dates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One consideration to make when shopping for a MacBook is how recently Apple updated the laptop and whether it is likely to be updating it again. Here is a quick look at when the laptops Apple sells were released.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>13-inch MacBook Air (M2): July 2022</li>\n\n\n\n<li>14-inch MacBook Pro (M4, M4 Pro &amp; M4 Max): November 2024</li>\n\n\n\n<li>16-inch MacBook Pro (M4 Pro &amp; M4 Max): November 2024</li>\n\n\n\n<li>13-inch MacBook Air (M3): March 2024</li>\n\n\n\n<li>15-inch MacBook Air (M3): March 2024</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>MacBook Air RAM upgrade</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing we should call out about the MacBook Air is that in October 2024, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2505858/apple-just-gave-the-macbook-air-a-huge-upgrade-you-probably-didnt-notice.html\">Apple upgraded the MacBook Air to come standard with 16GB of RAM</a>, like the new M4 MacBook Pros. The company didn’t raise the prices, they added more RAM and kept the prices the same. This includes the $999/£999 M2 MacBook Air. The additional RAM will help the Air run more efficiently and probably improve performance for Apple Intelligence features. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>MacBook buyers guide </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll start by running through the different MacBooks Apple sells, giving an overview of the pros and cons of each model, and reasons why each might be ideally suited to your needs. You’ll also be able to see the best prices right now, so that you don’t spend more than you need to. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will also look at different components and features for each model, so you can make an informed decision about how much RAM, which chip, how big the SSD should be and the best price, so you don’t spend more than necessary. </p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApple 13-inch MacBook Air (M3, 2024)\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure><img alt=\"Apple 13-inch MacBook Air (M3, 2024)\" src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/reviews/3817062/review-macbook-air-m2-2022.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$1,099\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today: \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLHY19N3?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\">$899 at  Amazon</a><a href=\"https://api.bestbuy.com/click/-/6602766/pdp\" target=\"_blank\">$899 at  Best Buy</a><a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1860125-REG/apple_mc8j4ll_a_13_macbook_air_m3.html/BI/21318/KBID/22251/DFF/d10-v21-t1-x1651123/SID/pocketlint-squirrel\" target=\"_blank\">$1099 at  B&amp;H</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p></p>\n\n<p>The MacBook Air is the cheapest way to get a Mac laptop. Starting at $999/£999 for the M2 model, there are seven standard MacBook Air models to consider: one 13-inch model with an M2 chip, three 13-inch models with an M3 chip, and three 15-inch MacBook Airs with an M3 chip. As of October 28, 2024, all MacBook Air models have 16GB of unified memory, just like the M4 MacBook Pro.</p>\n\n<p>It’s easy to think that the cheapest Mac laptop will be the one that has the best value, but that’s not necessarily the case. The M2 MacBook Air (see our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/807892/m2-macbook-air-review.html\">M2 MacBook Air</a> review) is the cheapest Mac laptop you can buy right now, but for another $100/£100 you can get the newest machine with an M3 chip. Both models offer the same 16GB RAM as standard (since the end of October 2024, prior to that 8GB RAM was offered as standard). </p>\n\n<p>With both models, you get Apple’s newest Air design and the 13.6-inch screen, 500 nits, and Midnight, Starlight, Space Gray, and Silver color choices. One difference is in the storage: in the newer M3 MacBook Air, the 256GB SSD is made up of two 128GB NAND chips, rather than a single 256GB chip as in the M2 and older models. This means the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2262059/ssd-brings-a-surprise-upgrade-over-the-m2speeds-faster-nand-chip.html\">storage in the M3 can be faster</a> because the two drives can process data simultaneously.</p>\n\n<p>There are several performance differences between the M3 Air and the 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro. Besides the Pro having a faster CPU, the Pro’s chip has a 10-core GPU standard compared to 8-core GPU in the Air, but the lack of a fan in the MacBook Air may mean it slows down to avoid overheating when performing more strenuous tasks. The 14-inch MacBook Pro, on the other hand, has active cooling, so it doesn’t need to slow down to stop overheating in processor-intensive applications. It’s probably the key difference between these Mac laptops and the reason why the Pro is better suited to more demanding applications.</p>\n\n<p>Another benefit of the 14-inch MacBook Pro over the Air is longer battery life. The 14-inch MacBook Pro with M3 offers up to 22 hours compared to 18 hours for the 13-inch MacBook Air.</p>\n\n<p>However, the MacBook Air is a good choice, especially now that the entry-level MacBook Pro costs $1,599/£1,599. For $999/£999, the M2 Air is a fantastic budget option with many of the same features as the M3 model. But for just $100/£100 more, the M3 models bring even more performance.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApple 15-inch MacBook Air (M3, 2024)\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure><img alt=\"Apple 15-inch MacBook Air (M3, 2024)\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/m3-macbook-air-profile-magsafe.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$1,299\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today: \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLJ4J78G?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\">$1,099 at  Amazon</a><a href=\"https://api.bestbuy.com/click/-/6602775/pdp\" target=\"_blank\">$1099 at  Best Buy</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p></p>\n\n<p>When Apple first introduced the 15-inch MacBook Air in July 2023 it answered a need for anyone who wanted a larger screen without having to pay hundreds more for a 14-inch MacBook Pro. The 15-inch M3 MacBook Air starts at $1,299/£1,299. The 14-inch MacBook Pro starts at $1,599/£1,599, which is still much more expensive than the Air. But even compared to a cheaper Pro, the 15-inch Air is still a fantastic option for buyers looking for a large-screen laptop for less. As of October 28, 2024, all MacBook Air models have 16GB of unified memory, just like the MacBook Pro. </p>\n\n<p>If the choice is between the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air, other than the bigger screen there are a few other differences to consider. Most notably, the larger model has better audio with a six-speaker sound system with force-cancelling woofers. Also, the entry-level 13-inch M3 MacBook Air for $1,099/£1,099 offers an eight-core GPU, while the entry-level 15-inch Air, which is $200/£200 more at $1,299/£1,299, offers a 10-core GPU. To get the same GPU option in the 13-inch Air you’d need to pay an extra $100/£100. The price gap is so small that we think it’s worth getting the 15-inch model unless you really want a smaller screen.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApple 14-inch MacBook Pro (M4, 2024)\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure><img width=\"3840\" height=\"2743\" alt=\"Apple 14-inch MacBook Pro (M4, 2024)\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/14inch-m4-macbook-pro-front.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$1,599 | $1,799 | $1,999\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today: \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLHWM5FB?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\">$1,474 at  Amazon</a><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/14-inch\" target=\"_blank\">$1599 at  Apple</a><a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1859560-REG/apple_mw2u3ll_a_14_macbook_pro_m4.html/BI/21318/KBID/22251/DFF/d10-v21-t1-x1648584/SID/pocketlint-squirrel\" target=\"_blank\">$1599 at  B&amp;H</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p></p>\n\n<p>Back in 2023, Apple discontinued the 13-inch MacBook Pro and replaced it in the lineup with a base M-series version of the 14-inch MacBook Pro (you can’t get the base M-series chip in the 16-inch MacBook Pro). This move brings many benefits: the 14-inch MacBook’s HDR ProMotion display is significantly better than the 13-inch model’s was. It also offers twice the storage, HDMI, SDXC slot, better battery life, and a newer design. Mind you, the price of the 14-inch model, $1,599/£1,599 (down from £1,699 in 2023), is quite a bit higher than the $1,299/£1,349 price that the 13-inch model sold for. </p>\n\n<p>The higher starting price for the M4 MacBook Pro also means the difference between the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro is wider than it was. Apple did sell two almost identically spec’d machines for a very similar price, but now the 14-inch MacBook Pro ($1,599/£1,599) costs an astonishing $600/£600 more than the entry-level 13-inch M2 MacBook Air ($999/£999) and $500/£500 more than the M3 MacBook Air ($1,099/£1,099). So if budget is what is important to you, save your money and buy a MacBook Air.</p>\n\n<p>If your choice is between a 15-inch MacBook Air with 16GB Unified Memory, 512GB SSD and 10-core GPU ($1,499/£1,499) and the 14-inch MacBook Pro with the same 16GB Unified Memory, 512GB SSD and 10-core GPU ($1,599/£1,599), it might look like the MacBook Air is be the best option in terms of price, but the Air uses an older M3, while the Pro has the new M4 and better performance.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2510333/14-inch-m4-macbook-pro-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tApple 14-inch MacBook Pro (M4) review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApple 14-inch MacBook Pro (M4 Pro, 2024)\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure><img width=\"3840\" height=\"2560\" alt=\"Apple 14-inch MacBook Pro (M4 Pro, 2024)\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Macbook-Pro-14-M3_2273.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$1,999 | $2,399\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today: \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-14-inch-MacBook-Pro-M4-Pro-nbsp-chip-with-12C-CPU-16C-GPU-512GB-SSD-24GB-Memory-Space-Black-MX2H3LL-A-Fall24/13713468011\" target=\"_blank\">$1849 at  Walmart Electronics</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLHY2BJ6?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\">$1,944.79 at  Amazon</a><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro\" target=\"_blank\">$1999 at  Apple</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p></p>\n\n<p>At the same time that it introduced the M4 14-inch MacBook Pro, Apple also introduced the M4 Pro and M4 Max. Both the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro can be bought with various configurations of those two chips.</p>\n\n<p>For those deciding between the 14-inch MacBook Pro and 16-inch model the best place to start is to compare like-for-like. The 14-core CPU, 20-core GPU M4 Pro with 24GB unified memory and 1TB SSD 14-inch MacBook Pro costs $2,399/£2,399 compared to the almost identically spec’d 16-inch model with 14-core CPU, 20-core GPU M4 Pro with 24GB unified memory and 512GB SSD for $2,499/£2,499. So you are paying $100/£100 more to get a larger screen, but also forfeiting half the SSD. If you want an equivalent 1TB SSD in the 16-inch that’s an extra $200/£200.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, if you are considering spending more to get the M4 Pro rather than the M4 in a MacBook Pro, the price difference is much greater. The 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro with 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU, 16GB unified memory, and 512GB SSD costs $1,599/£1,599, while the 14-inch M3 Pro MacBook Pro with 12-core CPU and 16-core GPU, 24GB unified memory, and 512GB SSD costs $400/£400 more at $1,999/£1,999. The jump from M4 to M4 Pro is an expensive one, but you are getting a lot for your money: more memory, more cores, and essentially a more powerful machine in every way.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApple 16-inch MacBook Pro (M4 Pro)\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure><img width=\"3840\" height=\"2743\" alt=\"Apple 16-inch MacBook Pro (M4 Pro)\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/16inch-m4-macbook-pro-left-angle.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$2,499 | $2,899\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today: \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-16-inch-MacBook-Pro-M4-Pro-chip-with-14C-CPU-20C-GPU-512GB-SSD-24GB-Memory-Silver-MX2T3LL-A-Fall24/13708452389\" target=\"_blank\">$2314 at  Walmart Electronics</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLHDCN6P?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\">$2,449.99 at  Amazon</a><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/us/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/16-inch-m4-pro\" target=\"_blank\">$2499 at  Apple</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p></p>\n\n<p>The entry-level 16-inch MacBook Pro essentially offers the same specs (14-core CPU, 20-core GPU, 24GB memory) as the top-of-the-range 14-inch M4 Pro MacBook Pro for just £100/$100 more, $2,399/£2,399 vs $2,499/£2,499 which to be fair doesn’t seem like a bad deal given the larger screen and increased battery life.</p>\n\n<p>The other big difference though is that the 14-inch MacBook in question comes with a 1TB SSD, while the 16-inch model only offers 512GB.

The leap from M4 Pro to M4 Max if you look at the standard options is $600/£600, If you need the M4 Max Apple is making the upgrade worthwhile, but it’s still a high price to pay. The high-end 16-inch M4 Pro MacBook Pro comes with 48GB of RAM and has not RAM upgrades available. You have to upgrade to an M4 Max to get more RAM.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<h2>Best MacBook 2025: Verdict</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The choice is pretty clear in terms of what you get for your money:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Buying an entry-level M2 MacBook Air for $999/£999 will get you an excellent Mac laptop for less than a grand, but it only costs $100/£100 more to get an M3 MacBook Air with a newer chip.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 15-inch MacBook Air shook up the range when that option arrived in July 2023 (the M3 version was introduced in March 2024). With it, Apple lowered the price of getting a larger screen on a Mac laptop. Even with the 14-inch MacBook Pro, the 15-inch MacBook Air is still an attractive proposition, but remember that the 14-inch MacBook Pro has a newer M4 chip.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The price of the M4 Pro and Max MacBook Pro models is high, but these models offer the kind of specs professional users, especially creatives, need, including support for more RAM, and more CPU and GPU cores. If you can afford to stretch to the M4 Max you will get the ultimate Mac without a doubt, but you need to be willing to make a significant investment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The choice between the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro is all down to the screen size. The 16-inch models are more expensive, but once you spec them out in such a way to be comparable the price difference is minor. The bigger difference is between the Pro and Max processors. Other than speed, MacBooks with Max processors can <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668700/best-mac-monitors-displays.html\">connect up to four external displays</a> (three over Thunderbolt and one over HDMI), while the Pro models allow two displays. The M3 MacBook Air models allow two external displays when the lid is closed and a single display when it’s open, as does the MacBook Pro M4. (<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/675869/how-to-connect-two-or-more-external-displays-to-apple-silicon-m1-macs.html\">There are workarounds if you need to connect more screens)</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the latest MacBook Pro and MacBook Air discounts, including discontinued models, check out our round-up of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672811/best-macbook-pro-deals.html\">Best MacBook Pro deals</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673333/best-macbook-air-deals.html\">Best MacBook Air deals</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What happened to the 13-inch MacBook Pro?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s address one model you might be wondering about. The 13-inch MacBook Pro is no longer sold by Apple, but it will no doubt be available from resellers and Apple’s refurbished store for a while. There were two standard 13-inch MacBook Pro to consider. The only real difference is storage:</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>Apple 13-inch MacBook Air (M2, 256GB/16GB RAM)</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$999\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DLHCWH55?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\">$799 at  Amazon</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://api.bestbuy.com/click/-/6602762/pdp\" target=\"_blank\">$799 at  Best Buy</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/us/shop/go/product/MC7V4\" target=\"_blank\">$999 at  Apple United States</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>M2, 8-Core CPU, 10-Core GPU, 8GB Unified Memory, 256GB SSD Storage: Was $1,299 / £1,349</li>\n\n\n\n<li>M2, 8-Core CPU, 10-Core GPU, 8GB Unified Memory, 512GB SSD Storage: Was $1,499 / £1,549</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The 13-inch MacBook Pro was replaced by the base M-series 14-inch MacBook Pro, which is the cheapest MacBook Pro but costs more than the 13-inch model.
