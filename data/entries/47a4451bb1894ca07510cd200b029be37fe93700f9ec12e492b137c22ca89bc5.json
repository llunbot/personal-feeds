The transition to \"Apple Account\" will likely be completed by time iOS 18 and the other software updates are publicly released later this year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"Apple Account\" is certainly a more straightforward name, but \"Apple ID\" had been used for over two decades and had a lot of sentimental value.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/\">Apple ID</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-account/\">Apple Account</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/11/apple-id-renamed-to-apple-account/\">'Apple ID' Renamed to 'Apple Account' Across iOS 18 and Other Updates</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-id-renamed-to-apple-account-across-ios-18-and-other-updates.2428857/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"47a4451bb1894ca07510cd200b029be37fe93700f9ec12e492b137c22ca89bc5","category":"Apple"}
