Yang describes it as a celebration of how people around the world ride bikes in many different ways, for all different reasons. But ultimately there is a single shared ‘essence’ that brings all cyclists together – “<em>the unity found in movement</em>“. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>100Copies #56 – <em>One Ride</em></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/100copies_No56_One-Ride_art-print_brushed-details-scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1255\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/100copies_No56_One-Ride_art-print_brushed-details-scaled.webp\" alt=\"100Copies #56 – One Ride, cycling themed artwork by Thomas Yang, bush details\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/100copies_No56_One-Ride_art-print_brushed-details-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/100copies_No56_One-Ride_art-print_brushed-details-297x146.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/100copies_No56_One-Ride_art-print_brushed-details-1536x753.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/100copies_No56_One-Ride_art-print_brushed-details-120x59.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/100copies_No56_One-Ride_art-print_brushed-details-768x377.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/100copies_No56_One-Ride_art-print_brushed-details-2048x1004.webp 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Thomas Yang)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At first glance, it looks like a jumble of squiggles. But a closer look reveals the unique brush strokes that sketch out each individual cyclist in this peloton.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“One Ride embodies the rhythm of motion and the harmony of a shared journey. The riders, though distinct in their individuality, converge in the same direction—an expression of collective purpose and the unspoken bond among those who ride.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/100copies_No56_One-Ride_art-print_stamp-details-scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1255\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/100copies_No56_One-Ride_art-print_stamp-details-scaled.webp\" alt=\"100Copies #56 – One Ride, cycling themed artwork by Thomas Yang, stamp detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/100copies_No56_One-Ride_art-print_stamp-details-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/100copies_No56_One-Ride_art-print_stamp-details-297x146.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/100copies_No56_One-Ride_art-print_stamp-details-1536x753.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/100copies_No56_One-Ride_art-print_stamp-details-120x59.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/100copies_No56_One-Ride_art-print_stamp-details-768x377.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/100copies_No56_One-Ride_art-print_stamp-details-2048x1004.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Yang created the original design for these new prints, with hand-brushed with traditional Chinese inking, where “<em>every stroke reflects the energy, grace, and fleeting yet eternal nature of the ride</em>“. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“This piece is a tribute to the unity found in movement, a celebration of the road that brings us together.”</p>\n<cite><em>–  Thomas Yang of 100Copies</em></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/100copies_No56_One-Ride_art-print_.on-the-wall.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/100copies_No56_One-Ride_art-print_.on-the-wall.webp\" alt=\"100Copies #56 – One Ride, cycling themed artwork by Thomas Yang, on the wall\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/100copies_No56_One-Ride_art-print_.on-the-wall.webp 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/100copies_No56_One-Ride_art-print_.on-the-wall-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/100copies_No56_One-Ride_art-print_.on-the-wall-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/100copies_No56_One-Ride_art-print_.on-the-wall-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/100copies_No56_One-Ride_art-print_.on-the-wall-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As usual, just one hundred 840 x 594mm offset lithographic prints of <a href=\"https://www.100copies.net/product/56-one-ride\" target=\"_blank\">#55 – <em>Wheels of Change</em></a> have been made.
