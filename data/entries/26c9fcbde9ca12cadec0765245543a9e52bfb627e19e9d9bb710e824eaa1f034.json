The partnership marks STRAUSS’ first league-wide deal in the\nUnited States. STRAUSS entered the U.S. market in late 2023, and\nAmerican brand awareness is the cornerstone of its marketing\nefforts. The new partnership also affords STRAUSS marketing rights\nwith MLB across Canada, Mexico and Europe. As part of the deal,\nSTRAUSS’ name and logo will adorn MLB batting helmets during the\nPostseason and regular season games in Europe, as well as MiLB\nbatting helmets all season long, beginning in 2025.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But I <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@gruber/post/DAr0_lSRkmg\">couldn’t miss it</a> watching postseason games on TV this week: there’s a ridiculous-looking “Strauss” on both sides of every player’s batting helmet now, as prominent as the team logo on the front. It looks even more desperate and obsequious on the helmets than it does printed in all-caps in MLB’s bootlicking press release. This is the sort of gimmick you expect from a struggling independent minor league team, not Major League Baseball.</p>\n\n<p>They should’ve put the rights to these on-helmet ads up for public auction. I’d have chipped in for a fan-backed initiative to buy that on-helmet ad space to affix this slogan: “<strong>FIRE ROB MANFRED</strong>”.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/04/mlb-batting-helmet-ads\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"26c9fcbde9ca12cadec0765245543a9e52bfb627e19e9d9bb710e824eaa1f034","category":"Tech"}
