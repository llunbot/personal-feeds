Somewhere, somehow, it’s dropped out of your pocket, never to be seen again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But here, as so often, Apple turns up to make life easier. The company’s Find My service has always been an excellent way to find lost iPhones and MacBooks, but the launch of the AirTag in 2021 and the new Items tab in the Find My app meant wallets, keyrings, luggage and even pets could be located with ease.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s just one hitch: the AirTag itself. Aside from having to buy AirTags for your wallet and other valuables, you also need to keep track of battery levels and replace them when necessary. AirTags can be easily found and removed from stolen items. And because of their chubby shape, they don’t fit comfortably in wallet pockets. If only there were a way to get the benefits of AirTags and Find My without having to use an AirTag.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Introducing the ESR Geo Wallet</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, now there is: the <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/esrgear/worlds-1st-wallet-with-built-in-find-my?ref=ddphuf\" target=\"_blank\">ESR Geo Wallet</a>! It’s the world’s first wallet with built-in Find My functionality, from an innovative company with more than 400,000 five-star reviews on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/C481BD72-9AE2-4927-B290-BC543AD7B0DA?maas=maas_adg_B86B1A751711D2D2FAAF7CCD63A1971C_afap_abs&amp;ref_=aa_maas&amp;tag=maas\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than having to add your own (bulky and easily removable) AirTag, it contains an Apple-certified module that enables you to track the wallet’s location in real time, so it’s amazingly easy to find. Open the Find My app on your iPhone, Mac or iPad, select the Items tab, and you’ll be shown where your wallet is on the live map. Whether it’s lost, stolen, or just forgotten in a drawer, you’ll find your money, ID cards and bank cards quickly with this great product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Better still, the Geo Wallet features a speaker, which you can use to pinpoint its exact location. This is a timesaver, because narrowing down the search to “somewhere in this house”, while reassuring in many ways, can still leave you with a lengthy search–frustrating if you’re in a hurry and want to leave for work. Instead, make the wallet ping and follow the sound. And the 110mAh battery can simply be recharged (taking just two hours to reach a full charge) when it starts to run low. There’s no need to buy and install a replacement.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The slim design (just 15mm thick) and low weight (86g) means the wallet fits easily into your pocket or bag. Despite this slimline form factor, it can store up to 10 bills, 7 cards, and 15 coins. There are two handy ID windows, too. The wallet is made of top-quality faux leather and combines looks with practicality. It comes in seven color options so you’re sure to find a version that matches your style.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, and crucially, this is a cost-effective choice. Other Find My wallets require you to buy an AirTag separately, adding to the overall cost; that’s not the case here. And even before you factor in the price of the AirTag ($24.99), the Geo Wallet undercuts many rival products. This is the most budget-friendly option out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Don’t miss out!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The ESR Geo Wallet hits Kickstarter on July 23, ahead of a worldwide launch in early September. If you want to get involved, it makes sense to do so right away, since <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3Sa72mP\" target=\"_blank\">ESR</a> is offering large discounts to early-bird customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Classic Geo Wallet has an MSRP of $55, but early birds will pay just $41, a discount of more than 25%.
