While some of these channels are simply authored by camera-shy humans, many more are <a href=\"https://medium.com/@hazelparadise/how-i-created-a-faceless-youtube-channel-only-using-ai-ca9a60d200f7\">fully automated through AI-powered tools</a> to craft everything from the scripts and voiceovers to the imagery and music.

But one YouTuber is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEDFUjqA1s8\">trying to fight back</a>, seeding her transcripts with junk data that is invisible to humans but poisonous to any AI that dares to try to work from a poached transcript file.</p>\n<h2>The power of the .ass</h2>\n<p>YouTuber <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@f4micom\">F4mi</a>, who creates <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZV0cJnIZTY\">some excellent deep dives</a> on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2G9n0vJiKXw\">obscure technology</a>, recently <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEDFUjqA1s8\">detailed her efforts</a> \"to poison any AI summarizers that were trying to steal my content to make slop.\" The key to F4mi's method is <a href=\"http://www.tcax.org/docs/ass-specs.htm\">the .ass subtitle format</a>, created decades ago as part of fansubbing software Advanced SubStation Alpha. Unlike simpler and more popular subtitle formats, .ass supports fancy features like fonts, colors, positioning, bold, italic, underline, and more.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/how-one-youtuber-is-trying-to-poison-the-ai-bots-stealing-her-content/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/how-one-youtuber-is-trying-to-poison-the-ai-bots-stealing-her-content/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f5c5378c4ddcf1f7a29bb28172410065309955e280ca921de0ae122cdd72da25","category":"Tech"}
