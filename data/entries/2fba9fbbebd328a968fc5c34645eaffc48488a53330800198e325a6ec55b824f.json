It was another rider testing the same wheels. You see, the teeth on these 90T DEG ratchets are quite small – about the same size as DT’s original smaller-diameter 54T high-engagement ratchet rings. And so they are a bit susceptible to over-greasing. Even using DT’s red “Special Grease”, covering the teeth with too much grease makes it possible to slip under load. If that happens, it’s not the end of the world. Just pop the cassette off tool-free, wipe the excess grease away with a clean, lint-free rag, and reinstall to ride. But too little, and you’ll shorten the lifespan of those ratchets, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Specialized-carbon-Roval-Traverse-HD-240-DEG-wheelset-Review_super-strong-with-fast-DT-Swiss-engagement_needs-more-red-DT-Special-Grease.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Specialized-carbon-Roval-Traverse-HD-240-DEG-wheelset-Review_super-strong-with-fast-DT-Swiss-engagement_needs-more-red-DT-Special-Grease.webp\" alt=\"Review: Specialized lightweight, strong carbon Roval Traverse HD 240 DEG wheelset with fast 90 POE DT Swiss engagement, needs more Special grease\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Specialized-carbon-Roval-Traverse-HD-240-DEG-wheelset-Review_super-strong-with-fast-DT-Swiss-engagement_needs-more-red-DT-Special-Grease.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Specialized-carbon-Roval-Traverse-HD-240-DEG-wheelset-Review_super-strong-with-fast-DT-Swiss-engagement_needs-more-red-DT-Special-Grease-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Specialized-carbon-Roval-Traverse-HD-240-DEG-wheelset-Review_super-strong-with-fast-DT-Swiss-engagement_needs-more-red-DT-Special-Grease-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Specialized-carbon-Roval-Traverse-HD-240-DEG-wheelset-Review_super-strong-with-fast-DT-Swiss-engagement_needs-more-red-DT-Special-Grease-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Specialized-carbon-Roval-Traverse-HD-240-DEG-wheelset-Review_super-strong-with-fast-DT-Swiss-engagement_needs-more-red-DT-Special-Grease-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, these are premium wheels, so you should take care of them, especially the hubs. That doesn’t mean you need to go gently while you’re riding. Just at the end of the season, clean &amp; regrease the internals, wipe the seals and check the bearings.

They officially rate them for Aggressive Trail, Enduro &amp; full-power eMTB use, but then go on to say they will guide you to improving as a rider “<em>in the bike park, on a trail ride, or on an Enduro World Cup trac</em>k”.

And that’s included plenty of big bikepark-style jumps (everything is a bikepark with an eMTB that shuttles you back-and-forth to the top of the mountain!) Plus, sketchy rock gardens, and even a dodgy e-Enduro power stage through an abandoned factory. But as light as they are, I wouldn’t mind swapping out the heavier aluminum wheels I have on my all-mountain trail bike. Or even those on my bikepark enduro bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Specialized-carbon-Roval-Traverse-HD-240-DEG-wheelset-Review_super-strong-with-fast-DT-Swiss-engagement_dirty-DT-hub-still-spins-smoothly.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Specialized-carbon-Roval-Traverse-HD-240-DEG-wheelset-Review_super-strong-with-fast-DT-Swiss-engagement_dirty-DT-hub-still-spins-smoothly.webp\" alt=\"Review: Specialized lightweight, strong carbon Roval Traverse HD 240 DEG wheelset with fast 90 POE DT Swiss engagement, a dirty DT MTB hub is a happy hub\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Specialized-carbon-Roval-Traverse-HD-240-DEG-wheelset-Review_super-strong-with-fast-DT-Swiss-engagement_dirty-DT-hub-still-spins-smoothly.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Specialized-carbon-Roval-Traverse-HD-240-DEG-wheelset-Review_super-strong-with-fast-DT-Swiss-engagement_dirty-DT-hub-still-spins-smoothly-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Specialized-carbon-Roval-Traverse-HD-240-DEG-wheelset-Review_super-strong-with-fast-DT-Swiss-engagement_dirty-DT-hub-still-spins-smoothly-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Specialized-carbon-Roval-Traverse-HD-240-DEG-wheelset-Review_super-strong-with-fast-DT-Swiss-engagement_dirty-DT-hub-still-spins-smoothly-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Specialized-carbon-Roval-Traverse-HD-240-DEG-wheelset-Review_super-strong-with-fast-DT-Swiss-engagement_dirty-DT-hub-still-spins-smoothly-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Specialized-carbon-Roval-Traverse-HD-240-DEG-wheelset-Review_super-strong-with-fast-DT-Swiss-engagement_dirty-DT-hub-still-spins-smoothly-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s hard to find another mullet mountain bike wheelset that weighs as little as these do, yet instills such confidence that you can charge full-speed into any terrain.
