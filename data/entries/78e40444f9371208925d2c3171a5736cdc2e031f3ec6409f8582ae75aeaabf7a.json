Of note, the change doesn’t apply to existing memberships, only new sign-ups. It goes into effect beginning November 1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help with the transition and offer creators a way to offset costs, Patreon has created an optional tool that can automatically increase prices by 30 percent within the iOS app so they won’t lose revenue. The price increase will be enabled by default unless creators disable it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s unclear why Patreon was previously exempt from the App Store terms or why Apple is enforcing them now. The post says the Patreon team will be available on its <a href=\"https://discord.gg/patreon\" target=\"_blank\">Discord</a> community form from August 12 to August 16 to answer any questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"78e40444f9371208925d2c3171a5736cdc2e031f3ec6409f8582ae75aeaabf7a","category":"Apple"}
