The combined app will be provided first to subscribers who have the Disney+ and Hulu bundle, so rather than swapping back and forth, users can access all of their content in a single app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"The integrated app experience that we announced today is for consumers that have subscribed to both services for now,\" said Iger. He explained that Disney is taking the two-app bundle and combining it into one experience that will have \"basically more content than it offered before.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith the merging of the services, Disney plans to increase pricing. \"We plan to set a higher price for our ad-free tier later this year,\" Iger said.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDisney's announcement came as the Disney+ service lost four million subscribers during the quarter.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/disney/\">Disney</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/hulu/\">Hulu</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/disney-plus/\">Disney Plus</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/11/disney-plus-hulu-combo-app/\">Disney+ and Hulu to Be Combined Into One App</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/disney-and-hulu-to-be-combined-into-one-app.2389275/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"cac9324a699b15b7714ab1cbd685a537be10793e91f07c73b487c5ed6e02cdc3","category":"Apple"}
