But if you've heard of Recall, it's probably because of the problems that surfaced in preview builds of Windows before the feature could launch: It <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/06/windows-recall-demands-an-extraordinary-level-of-trust-that-microsoft-hasnt-earned/\">stored all of its data in plaintext</a>, and it was relatively trivial for other users on the PC (or for malicious software) to access the database and screenshots, potentially exposing huge amounts of user data.</p>\n<p>Microsoft was supposed to launch Recall over the summer but delayed the feature to rework it. The company <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/microsoft-details-security-privacy-overhaul-for-windows-recall-ahead-of-relaunch/\">went into detail</a> on the new version of Recall's security protections in late September, declaring that a preview would be ready in time for Windows Insider Program testers <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/microsoft-will-try-the-data-scraping-windows-recall-feature-again-in-october/\">in October</a>. Now that we're past October, Microsoft has officially announced that the Recall preview is being delayed yet again and that it will begin rolling out to testers in December.</p>\n<p>“We are committed to delivering a secure and trusted experience with Recall. To ensure we deliver on these important updates, we’re taking additional time to refine the experience before previewing it with Windows Insiders,” said Microsoft Windows Insider Senior Program Manager Brandon LeBlanc in <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284572/microsoft-recall-delay-december-windows-insider-testing\">a statement provided to The Verge</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/microsoft-delays-rollout-of-the-windows-11-recall-feature-yet-again/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/microsoft-delays-rollout-of-the-windows-11-recall-feature-yet-again/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8999911447a0ed9fd4230c65ee3014f9b4da51b7afae8e539a2911b5becaa5cd","category":"Tech"}
