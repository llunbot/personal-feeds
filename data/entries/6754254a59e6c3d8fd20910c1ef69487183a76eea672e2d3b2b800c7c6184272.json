The ‌iPhone‌'s recovery in China is part of a broader resurgence in the smartphone market, which saw overall sales rise by 25.5% to 22.7 million units in April. The CAICT data revealed that ‌iPhone‌ sales contributed significantly to this growth.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis change comes after a challenging start to the year for Apple in China, where the company experienced a 37% slump in sales during the first two months of 2024. The recovery began in March with a 12% increase in shipments, continuing into April.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's comeback strategy in China involved substantial discounts on iPhones, with price cuts reaching up to 2,300 yuan (approximately $318) on its official Tmall site. These discounts, which are double those initially offered in February, were part of an aggressive campaign to compete with local companies like Huawei. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>Bloomberg</em> noted that Apple's market share in China may soon stabilize, as consumer interest in upgrading to new ‌iPhone‌ is increasing. A recent survey indicated that more than half of Chinese consumers are willing to spend over 4,000 yuan (approximately $550) on their next phone, a significant rise from the 33% who currently use premium handsets. This trend toward \"premiumization\" is expected to benefit Apple just four months away from the debut of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> lineup.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/\">China</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/28/iphone-sales-recover-in-china/\">iPhone Sales Recover in China Amid Surge in Smartphone Demand</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-sales-recover-in-china-amid-surge-in-smartphone-demand.2427556/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6754254a59e6c3d8fd20910c1ef69487183a76eea672e2d3b2b800c7c6184272","category":"Apple"}
