There were things to like about the A770 and A750, but buggy drivers, poor performance in older games, and relatively high power use made them difficult to recommend. They were more notable as curiosities than as consumer graphics cards.</p>\n<p>The result, after more than two years on the market, is that Arc GPUs remain a statistical nonentity in the GPU market, according to <a href=\"https://www.jonpeddie.com/news/shipments-of-graphics-aibs-see-significant-surge-in-q2-2024/\">analysts</a> and the <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/directx/\">Steam Hardware Survey</a>.
