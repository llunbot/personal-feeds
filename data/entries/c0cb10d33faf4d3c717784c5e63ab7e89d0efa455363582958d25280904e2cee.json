Following an opening block of stages spread across Albania, southern Italy and Tuscany, the peloton has now managed to shake out its early nerves as the race begins to take shape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A week in, Isaac del Toro leads the overall classification with a gap of 1min 13sec over teammate Juan Ayuso, with Antonio Tiberi 1min 30sec back in third. Outside of the GC standings, Mads Pedersen has a comfortable lead in the points classification and Lorenzo Fortunato has an early lead in the climbers’ standings. Although not jersey wearers, Josh Tarling, Casper van Uden, Kaden Groves and Luke Plapp have all taken stage victories since the race started in Albania over a week ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the riders enjoy a well-earned rest day, let’s praise those who’ll be heading into the next phase of the Giro with their heads held high, and run through those with work to do next week.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Winner: Isaac del Toro</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215187605-scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215187605-scaled.webp 2560w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215187605-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215187605-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215187605-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215187605-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215187605-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215187605-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215187605-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215187605-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215187605-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215187605-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Marco Alpozzi/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>By definition, Del Toro is the most comfortable inclusion in our winners section. After a week of racing, the Mexican youngster leads the general classification with a minute’s advantage over his teammate Ayuso. This was no fluke breakaway success either – Del Toro also finished on the podium of the two most decisive GC stages last week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Del Toro was a force to be reckoned with on the gravel of Stage 9. He went on the offensive first and pushed on at the front, dropping closest rival Egan Bernal after a lot of hard work by the latter’s Ineos team to bring the gap out to around one minute. In the post-race interview, he confessed to misidentifying Bernal as Ayuso, who was wearing a similar white-coloured jersey, during his initial attack. Although the move stemmed from a mistake, it gives some hope to a potential GC bid. Judging from his performances in the opening week, and bearing in mind that he’s a decent time-triallist, Del Toro could be in the <em>maglia rosa </em>for most of the second week, with some feeling bullish enough to project a podium finish for the 21-year-old on Giro debut.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s unclear just how well Del Toro can go in the final week of this Giro, however. There’s plenty of climbing on the agenda, with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-watch-live-stages-route-riders-teams-start-list\">some days featuring close to 5,000m of elevation gain</a>. We should get a sense of how Del Toro will fare at the end of this week on Stage 15, but there’s a growing confidence in his potential GC prospects, with bookmakers now having him as third favourite to win the whole race.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+4\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-4-970x300.webp\" alt=\"Cyclist banner saying 'the world's best cycling magazine, delivered to your door, click here to subscribe'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-4-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-4-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-4-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-4-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-4-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-4-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-4-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Winner: Mads Pedersen</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214883680-min-scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214883680-min-scaled.webp 2560w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214883680-min-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214883680-min-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214883680-min-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214883680-min-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214883680-min-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214883680-min-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214883680-min-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214883680-min-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214883680-min-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214883680-min-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Tim de Waele/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Mads Pedersen hasn’t spent a day away from the podium so far in this Giro d’Italia. With three stage victories, five days in the pink jersey and an unbroken nine-day reign in the <em>maglia ciclamino</em>, the Dane has been an obvious stand-out from week one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although all three of his wins were memorable in their own way, his most impressive came on Stage 5 to Matera. Despite falling back through the group on the final climb and perhaps looking out of the equation going into the approach to the line, Pedersen managed to spring back into life to cross the line first, and in the pink jersey too no less.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such is his points lead that only illness or injury now realistically separates Pedersen from a final <em>maglia</em> <em>ciclamino</em> in Rome. His advantage over his nearest rival, breakaway staple Alessandro Tonelli, is an impressive 94 points. No other rider has even scored 94 points total in the standings so far in this Giro, so consider this one a done deal.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n

nine stages, UAE Team Emirates XRG riders sit first and second in both the general and youth classifications, and unsurprisingly the team are leadinig the way in the team classification too. Looking past Del Toro and Ayuso in the top two spots, Emirates also have another two riders slotted inside the top ten with Brandon McNulty and Adam Yates. And looking at the bigger GC picture, Ayuso gained an important mental advantage over his chief rivals in the mountains by winning the only summit finish of the week in Tagliacozzo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite being the clear winners of week one, UAE need to make a decision going forward: do they work for Ayuso or Del Toro? The Mexican may be wearing the pink jersey but is unproven in Grand Tours, having never competed for GC at a three-week race before. However, after this week’s display, he appears every bit like an overall contender. Even before the gravel stage, he was fixed inside the top five of the overall standings, ahead of some crucial rivals. Now with a hefty buffer to not only Ayuso but Primož Roglič, the 21-year-old could have the legs for an historic GC run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, it would be fair to say that this is UAE Team Emirates’ race to lose at this point, regardless of whether they go with Ayuso or Del Toro. They’ve got a convincing race lead, four riders clearly in form and at least a minute’s advantage on race favourite Roglič. Although the Slovenian can never be ruled out, a UAE Team Emirates victory is looking more likely by the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Winner: The old guard</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214944654-min-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214944654-min-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214944654-min-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214944654-min-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214944654-min-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214944654-min-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214944654-min-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214944654-min-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214944654-min-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214944654-min-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214944654-min-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Luca Bettini/AFP</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s give flowers where they’re due, Bernal was fantastic during the opening week of this Giro d’Italia. Turning up in a new Colombian champion’s jersey, the 2021 Giro winner has been chipping away at his GC rivals. Consistently at the front of affairs, he secured a third place to Tagliacozzo, bagging his best Grand Tour stage result since his almost career-ending crash in 2022. However, an even more convincing performance came on Stage 9 when he was rattling the pack on the gravel, showing glimpses of his old self. Even if it ultimately came to nothing in the GC fight, it was good to see him back to his best.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bernal isn’t the only Latin American to make a strong impression during this first week. Currently EF’s Richard Carapaz is positioned in fourth with a 1min 40sec deficit to Del Toro, who was just 15 years old when the Ecuadorian won the Giro back in 2019. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carapaz has been relatively quiet this week, despite his solid position in GC. I can only think that he’s holding something back for the tough stages to come in the final week. Given that he barely shed any time this week, he might be someone to keep your eye out for in the final week. Just remember, when he goes for GC, he rarely finishes outside the top five.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Winner: Mathias Vacek</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1705\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214882041-min-scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214882041-min-scaled.webp 2560w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214882041-min-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214882041-min-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214882041-min-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214882041-min-1536x1023.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214882041-min-2048x1364.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214882041-min-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214882041-min-1140x759.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214882041-min-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214882041-min-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214882041-min-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Tim de Waele/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At the Tour de France, a prize is handed out after every rest day for the best domestique that week. If the Giro were to copy that prize, which they really should, then Mathias Vacek would win by unanimous decision. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Czech rider has been visible throughout the opening week across all terrains, supporting Lidl-Trek’s interests in both the sprints and mountains. From being Pedersen’s lead-out man in Albania to a contender on Stage 7’s summit finish and at the head of affairs on the gravel, Vacek has done it all. If he weren’t working for others, it’s likely he’d have bagged a stage or two himself this week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In truth he’s been a revelation for the past 12 months, having been up there in the Classics, early-season stage races and now the Giro d’Italia. Now proven to be one of the strongest all-rounders and selfless domestiques in the game, he’s expected to extend his contract with Lidl-Trek. </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-climbs-2025\">The key climbs of the Giro d’Italia 2025</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/vuelta-a-burgos-feminas-preview\">Vuelta a Burgos Féminas 2025 preview: Route, favourites, how to watch and start list</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-favourites\">Who are the favourites for the Giro d’Italia 2025?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-watch-live-stages-route-riders-teams-start-list\">Giro d’Italia 2025 preview: Route, favourites, how to watch and start list</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Loser: Primož Roglič</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"652\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215691040-970x652.webp\" alt=\"GUBBIO, ITALY - MAY 18: Primoz Roglic of Slovenia and Team Red Bull - BORA - hansgrohe prior to the 108th Giro d'Italia 2025, Stage 9 a 181km stage from Gubbio to Siena / #UCIWT / on May 18, 2025 in Gubbio, Italy.

He spent two days in the <em>maglia rosa </em>during week one and held his place as the top-ranked GC contender consistently through the opening week. However the Slovenian’s week ended on a much different note, after two disappointing results on Stages 7 and 9.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The gravel stage was particularly disappointing, though not exactly surprising. The 2023 winner’s characteristic clumsiness and bad luck came back to bite him on the gravel, suffering a heavy blow in the GC that would see him shed a minute to Juan Ayuso. Having started the race as the favourite for overall victory, he now sits 2min 25sec behind Del Toro in the GC standings. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roglič has some clear ground to make up during weeks two and three of this year’s Giro. It all starts with a time-trial on Stage 10 tomorrow, but with Jai Hindley now out of the race, the chance of clawing back time in the mountains is looking slimmer by the day. The betting markets reflect that too, with his odds widening and Ayuso now the bookies’ pick for pink.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Hindley had to abandon, several of his Red Bull teammates have looked seriously off the mark since the start of this Giro, notably Dani Martínez. If this continues, it’ll be down to Guilio Pelizzari to put out any fires in the mountains. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Loser: French chances in the GC</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"715\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215242843-970x715.webp\" alt=\"NAPOLI  ITALY - MAY 15: (L-R) David Gaudu of France and Team Groupama - FDJ and Romain Bardet of France and Team Picnic PostNL while the race is neutralized due to a crash in the peloton during the 108th Giro d'Italia 2025, Stage 6 a 227km stage from Potenza to Napoli / #UCIWT / on May 15, 2025 in Potenza, Italy.

Both were caught up in tumbles on Stage 7 to Tagliacozzo, ultimately resulting in the pair dropping off earlier than expected on the final climb.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a bandaged hand, Gaudu’s woes continued on the gravel stage, where he’d lose more time to the bulk of his rivals. Despite being a former podium finisher at Strade Bianche, compatriot Bardet’s final skirmish on the gravel was less than ideal. He was off the back early, extending his deficit in the GC to almost half an hour. Unless there’s an Óscar Pereiro-like reversal, I don’t suspect Bardet will get the fairytale ending to Grand Tour life that many hoped for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for Gaudu, he’s fallen down to 26th place in the standings, seven minutes behind Del Toro. In theory, this may pave the way for later breakaways, but for now Groupama-FDJ are on track to leave the race disappointed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Loser: Olav Kooij</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215196526-min-scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215196526-min-scaled.webp 2560w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215196526-min-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215196526-min-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215196526-min-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215196526-min-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215196526-min-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215196526-min-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215196526-min-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215196526-min-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215196526-min-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215196526-min-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Dario Belingheri/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This may hurt <em>Cyclist’s </em>web editor Will Strickson and production editor Martin James, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-predictions-2025\">who both predicted a points jersey win for him</a>, but Kooij clearly underdelivered in the opening week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Dutch fastman was out of the frame during the first two bunch sprints on Albania’s hilly stages and was defeated by surprise victor Casper van Uden of Picnic-PostNL on Stage 4. After sitting out another sprint finish, he was forced against the barriers on Stage 6’s chaotic run into Naples, stunting any chance at victory. It leaves Kooij well off the pace in the points classification, with a deficit of more than 100 points to leader Pedersen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He’d better stay vigilant as there aren’t too many potential sprints left over, with the chance of a lucky breakaway surviving only increasing the longer the race goes on. There’s a strong possibility Kooij leaves this Giro with nothing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the Giro unravels, so does his contract battle too. According to reports, Decathlon-AG2R have been closing in on Kooij’s signature, with Visma-Lease a Bike set to lose their main sprinter (it’s Matthew Brennan season). Perhaps this will be the biggest story to come from Kooij’s Giro.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Loser: Young Brits in GC</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215573586-min-970x647.webp\" alt=\"tom pidcock tom pidcock giro \" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215573586-min-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215573586-min-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215573586-min-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215573586-min-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215573586-min-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215573586-min-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215573586-min-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215573586-min-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215573586-min-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215573586-min-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Dario Belingheri/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Sorry to lump another nation together, but while this week was surprisingly steady for the Yates twins, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/british-riders-giro-ditalia\">the younger British climbers</a> will go into the rest day with some sense of disappointment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Picnic-PostNL’s Max Poole previously stated that he wanted to go for GC in this year’s Giro d’Italia. For most of week one, all was going to plan and coming into Stage 9, he was comfortably sat inside the top ten. After shedding five minutes on the gravel, however, Poole is almost certainly out of the mix for GC and the white jersey. His focus will likely have to turn to stages and fighting for the breakaway instead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, what is Tom Pidcock going to get out of this Giro d’Italia? In terms of GC, a poor TT in Albania saw the Yorkshireman cede 42 seconds while an overexcited ascent to Tagliacozzo cost him an extra 30 seconds in the GC. He’s currently down in 16th place, over three minutes in arrears to Del Toro. On the stage-hunting front, Stage 9 over the gravel roads of Lombardy looked tailor-made for Pidcock but a crash put paid to his chances. His best result came on a hectic sprint in Matera on Stage 5, where he bagged third place. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps he’s hoping to be allowed to go in the breakaway later on, but in his current GC position he’s too close to be allowed up the road. He’s in the twilight zone to some extent. He either needs to intentionally lose time to go in the break or make some serious moves in the mountains – especially as he’ll likely lose more time in Tuesday’s time-trial.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclist newsletter banner saying 'tasty morsels sent straight to your inbox, click here to sign up'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-2025-week-one\">The winners and losers of the first week of the Giro d’Italia 2025</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Ewan Wilson &#124; Staff Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"c0cb10d33faf4d3c717784c5e63ab7e89d0efa455363582958d25280904e2cee","category":"Cycling"}
