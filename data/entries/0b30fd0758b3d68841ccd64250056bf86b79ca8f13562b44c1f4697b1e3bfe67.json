That’s true in System Preferences/Settings in macOS and individual apps, and in <em>Settings &gt; account name &gt; Sign Out</em> and <em>Settings &gt; Media &amp; Purchases</em> in iOS and iPadOS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The simple solution can be a little difficult to find because there’s no prompt or information about why it’s grayed out. It’s unavailable to prevent a device locked down by Screen Time restrictions from evading them by signing out of the associated Apple ID.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This may seem non-obvious if you are trying to change the account associated with media and purchases–as many people use a secondary account for that–instead of the Apple ID used for iCloud that’s associated with a Family Sharing group or for which you’ve set controls that are synced among a kid’s devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In either case, or if there’s a single Apple ID, disable Screen Time for the person in question. For instance, with Family Sharing and an iPhone, go to <em>Settings &gt; account name &gt; Family Sharing &gt; Screen Time &gt; child’s name</em> and tap Turn Off Screen Time. Then Sign Out of the Apple ID, make any changes, and sign back in or with a different account. Now, re-enable Screen Time for that person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an annoying way to solve the problem because it disables all the Screen Time settings, which have to be re-created when it’s re-enabled. It would be nice if Apple allowed you to store a template of Screen Time settings or create a profile that could be loaded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This Mac 911 article is in response to a question submitted by Macworld reader Benjamin.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671717/how-to-unlock-an-apple-id-thats-locked-or-disabled.htm\">How to unlock an Apple ID that’s locked or disabled</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ask Mac 911</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve compiled a list of the questions we get asked most frequently along with answers and links to columns: \n<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/491539/day_17_uploading_folders_of_data_to_google_docs.html\">read our super FAQ</a> to see if your question is covered.
