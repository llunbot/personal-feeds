Cyberattacks have increased 300% and the risk of losing important data or being compromised is much greater at home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Five recommendations for securing your home office:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Use a VPN</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you’re connecting to company resources or a Zoom call, use a virtual private network (VPN). VPNs encrypt all of your online traffic to prevent hackers from capturing data in transit. Be sure to use a well-known VPN – they are widely available in software marketplaces or directly from vendors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Be wary of phishing attempts</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Attackers want people to click on malicious links, which is why phishing attempts now account for more than <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.csoonline.com/article/3153707/top-cybersecurity-facts-figures-and-statistics.html&amp;xcust=1-1-540421-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">80%</a> of reported security incidents. Always be wary of clicking unknown links or files you were not expecting, and install a cyber protection solution like <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.acronis.com/en-us/products/true-image/?utm_source=macworld&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=fy21-q3-macworld-cyber_protect_home_office-sp-remote_work_space&amp;xcust=1-1-540421-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Acronis Cyber Protect Home Office (formerly Acronis True Image)</a>, which can block malicious URLs from loading in the first place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Be sure to have good anti-malware up and running properly</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a quality <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.acronis.com/en-us/articles/anti-malware-software/?utm_source=macworld&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=fy21-q3-macworld-cyber_protect_home_office-sp-remote_work_space&amp;xcust=1-1-540421-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">anti-malware solution</a> installed is a must, but it should be configured properly to be effective:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Performing a full scan at least once a day</li></ul><ul><li>Running on-demand and real-time scans for every new software installed or executed</li></ul><p>In addition, pay attention to messages coming from your anti-malware solution and make sure your licenses are active.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>4. Patch your OS and apps</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many attacks succeed because of <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities-threats/acronis-pandemic-hastened-cloud-migration-prompting-new-security-issues&amp;xcust=1-1-540421-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">unpatched vulnerabilities</a>. Keeping your operating system (OS) updated is crucial to ensure security gaps are closed. Acronis Cyber Protect Home Office (formerly Acronis True Image) provides vulnerability assessments so you know if your system has gaps that can be exploited and rates the severity level so you can prioritize your patching efforts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For home users, it’s best to ensure your devices and applications receive all needed updates quickly. Selecting auto-updates for popular software vendors like Adobe can help minimize the risk of attack.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>5. Keep your passwords and workspace to yourself</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do not share passwords with anyone and use different passwords for every service you use. Remember, the old eight-character passwords are easily cracked by today’s attacks. Use long phrases you can remember if you choose not to use a password manager.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even when working from home, lock your computer and limit access to it. It is possible for someone to access information on an unlocked computer from a distance. Don’t assume you are protected simply because people are not physically in your home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a lot to digest when it comes to securing remote work.
