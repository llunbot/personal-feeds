When I got my paws on the latest iteration of the Vault, my experiences from the previous bike were still fresh in my head. While the previous Pivot Vault straddled the lines between road, gravel, and its cyclocross roots, the new Vault is undeniably a gravel bike. What does that even mean? I’ll do my best to parse out why I believe the Vault has leapt into the muddy, figuratively and literally, world of gravel.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-6.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-6.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>2024 Pivot Vault Quick Hits:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Sizes XXS-XL (~50-62cm effective TT)</li>\n<li>Colors: Mossy Forest (pictured) and Stealth</li>\n<li>Tire Clearance: 700 x 50 without front derailleur, 650 x 2.0 or 700 x 47 with front derailleur</li>\n<li>Frame: Ultra-Light Hollow Core Carbon Frame</li>\n<li>Frame weight: 995 grams</li>\n<li>Complete bike weight (XL): 20 lb 11 oz (as reviewed), 19 lbs (stock)</li>\n<li>Team Force/X0 Wide Range AXS w/ Carbon Wheels build as reviewed: $6,149 USD</li>\n<li>Frame Price: $2900</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-39.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-39.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-39.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-39.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>What’s New?</h3>\n<p>With the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/pivot-cycles-vault-review/\" target=\"_blank\">old Pivot Vault review less than a year in the past</a>, I want to focus mainly on the updates to the newest Vault. Many of these details are simply in the frame so I’ll skip my usual frame details section for a <em>What’s New</em> section. For some more in depth info on the ISOflex system and BB386 EVO, please check out my previous <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/pivot-cycles-vault-review/\" target=\"_blank\">review</a>.</p>\n<p>To no one’s surprise, the new Vault includes SRAM’s nearly ubiquitous UDH standard for its dropout and derailleur hanger. With a few of the builds utilizing SRAM Transmission derailleurs, this is a no-brainer. Almost any new bike released will adopt the UDH standard to utilize Transmission products.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-25.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-25.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-25.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-25.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>We also see the addition of Pivot’s Toolshed downtube storage to the new Vault. This move is more or less keeping up with the times as we see many bikes incorporating downtube storage. This type of storage can be handy for tubes, tools, pumps, extra sealant, or whatever item you rarely need but want to have in an emergency. The latching mechanism is well crafted and does not rattle or make any noise. On the other hand, the size of the downtube leaves something to be desired.</p>\n<p>Pivot includes bags designed to work with their Toolshed system, but I found out that these are generic bags for all of Pivot’s bikes equipped with Toolshed storage. I tried to put a standard butyl tube in the included bag and there was no way it would ever fit in the Vault’s downtube. I swapped to a TPU tube, which was still a tight squeeze. The bags are bulky and take up more space than what they contain.  While the downtube storage can still be utilized, some other less bulky bags should be used – if at all.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-20.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-20.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-20.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-20.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-22.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-22.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-22.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-22.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-23.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-23.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-23.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-23.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The last Vault was flush with mounts, and the new Vault is no different. The top tube now sports a 3-pack mount near the seat cluster as well as a top tube bag mount near the stem.  The down tube sports a bottle cage mount on the Toolshed door, an additional set of mounts above that, as well as a set of mounts on the bottom of the down tube.</p>\n<p>All in all, there are accommodations for five bottles to be mounted in and around the main triangle. While I would recommend a frame bag over five bottles/cages, I do like the flexibility of mounting in so many places, especially getting two bottles on the downtube.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-43.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-43.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-43.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-43.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-24.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-24.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-24.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-24.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-42.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-42.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-42.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-42.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Pivot made a few updates to the ISOflex insert, mainly in relation to user serviceability. To service or replace the new insert, you only need to loosen two M4 bolts instead of the lockring used on the previous year’s model. The new version also gets a small rubber cover to keep the whole system out of the elements.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-19.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-19.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-19.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-19.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-10.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-10.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-10.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-10.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The updated Vault allows a choice of full internal (headset routed), or mostly internal, routing for hoses and housing. The mostly internal routing would have your rear brake/derailleur housing leave the bars and use a small port on the downtube to be routed internally to their respective terminuses, while the front brake hose would route externally down the fork leg.</p>\n<p>The fork leg has one discreet cutout for a small zip-tie to facilitate this. I like the external option for the fork routing as I find partially internal routing on forks to be frustrating and needless. Pivot’s Silent Cable Port System holds tension on the hose/housing at either end of the internal routing, keeping them quiet and well-managed.</p>\n<p>The Toolshed™ has cable clamps to keep routing well-managed around the internal storage as well. The option to allow for partially external or fully internal was conceived to allow bike fitters more flexibility during the initial setup before hoses are cut. Run the hoses accessible for the initial fit, and once everything is dialed, make your final length adjustments.</p>\n<p>I’d suggest setting the bike up so that you or your mechanic would most want to work on it.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-12.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-12.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-12.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-12.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-28.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-28.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-28.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-28.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Pivot claims that the new Vault has a tire clearance of 700 x 50 mm. While that is a bit larger than the previous generation, it’s not the whole story. The chainstay clearance for the rear tire easily swallows a 50 mm tire, while the fork has heaps of clearance over 50 mm. With the Vault being able to accommodate both 1x and 2x cranks with a narrow Q factor, I doubt we will see larger clearances for the rear end of this bike, which is fine, as the clearance is already ample, considering how much this BB cluster already accommodates.  I’m going to dive into this more in a later section, but I easily fit a 29 x 2.4″ tire in the new Pivot Vault fork, and that is impressive.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-13.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-13.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-13.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-13.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-14.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-14.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-14.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-14.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Speaking of the fork, the new Vault has a 52 mm offset “suspension corrected” fork. This larger offset (52mm up from 45mm) moves the Vault toward mid-trail handling characteristics while falling short of the randonneuring holy grail of low trail. The long top tube and steep (compared to MTBs) head tube angle, combined with a high volume/low-pressure tire, gave me the feeling of a lower trail handling bike.</p>\n<p>I had this same feeling on the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/mondraker-arid-carbon-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Mondraker Arid</a> recently. The new fork’s handling strikes a balance between stability and twitchiness that I found to be confidence-inspiring at speed. The fork is also now “suspension” corrected (415 mm axle to crown, up from 395 mm), which I put in quotes due to only allowing 30-40 mm of travel. I expect that we will see some leaps toward longer travel in the gravel sphere soon, but for now, the suspension fork options are in this range.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-23.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-23.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-23.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-23.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The new Vault is limited to 27.2 seatposts – somebody call <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/dust-up-27-2-gravel-bike-dropper-seatposts/\" target=\"_blank\">Travis</a>. The previous generation allowed for the use of either 30.9 or 27.2 ISOflex inserts for a greater range of seatposts or dropper post options. This will be a bit of a disappointment for anyone hoping to run a longer than ~70 mm dropper post on their Vault, but other than that, this is a fine change. The stock Pivot seat post is 27.2 and designed specifically to work with the ISOflex and the Vault frame to provide the best compliance.</p>\n<p>Finally, Pivot has increased the size range of the Vault to include an XXS size in their range.  A boon for the smaller humans out there that want to get one of these sweet bikes under their legs.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-5.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-5.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-5.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-5.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>What Stayed the Same?</h3>\n<p>While there were a ton of updates to the new Vault, a few great features from the past generation have carried over.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-34.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-34.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-34.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-34.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>For those in stormy climates, the Vault retains its hidden fender mounts for winter training rides in the rain.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-26.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-26.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-26.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-26.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>If you are a staunch 2x drivetrain enjoyer, you will be pleased to know that you can still run a front derailleur on the Pivot Vault. Pivot no longer offers a stock option with a 2x drivetrain, but the frame has accommodations for a front derailleur. You will need to run an electronic derailleur nonetheless – AXS wireless being the simplest, but Di2 wiring is accommodated.</p>\n<p>Pivot and their owner Chris Cocalis continue to stand behind the BB386EVO bottom bracket standard. This allows the Vault to run low Q factor cranks and still provide a robust bottom bracket cluster.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-33.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-33.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-33.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-33.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-35.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-35.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-35.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-35.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Parts Spec</h3>\n<p>Pivot is always on point for their parts spec, but <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/why-pivot-bikes-are-so-expensive/\" target=\"_blank\">as Pivot does not dabble in anything “budget”</a> this should come as no surprise. The cheapest build offered in the new Vault is specced with GRX ($4000). My personal review bike came with a mix of SRAM Force and X01.</p>\n<p>The X01 rear derailleur and cassette allow for a larger cassette and gear range compared to the typical Force gravel offerings. Since all the Sram AXS parts simply talk to each other wirelessly, this allows for a mix and match of parts and groups. If you prefer more nuance between your cogs, there is a Force AXS XPLR build that is also available with a 10-44 cassette instead of the 10-52 wide range cassette.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-7.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-7.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>In the cockpit, we see a mix of Zipp drop bars and a Pivot stem. My XL review bike came with 46 cm Zipp XPLR 70 SL Carbon bars, which I personally consider to be the minimum width for personal comfort. On the other sizes, we see bars at 40 cm width on the XXS-XS, 42 cm on the S, and 44 cm on Medium and Large. With the gravel world leaning into marginal aero gains, these bar widths might be perceived as wide these days. I’m approaching the Vault from a mountain biking perspective – if you are coming from the road world, these bars may seem wide. Try them out and enjoy the stability and comfort. I can’t afford the shoulder and neck pain, personally.</p>\n<p>Pivot specs its own seatpost designed to work specifically with the ISOflex insert. The stock seatpost is setback and I prefer to run a zero setback post, so I swapped to an SRAM XPLR dropper post I had in my parts bin. If one wanted to use a zero setback Pivot post, there is one available that is typically specced on the LES SL. I wanted to try a dropper post on the new Vault, as I did not get a chance to try one on the previous model. The ISOflex insert allows for compliance with any 27.2 seatpost, including droppers, but a dropper will not be as compliant as the provided Pivot carbon post.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-16.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-16.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-16.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-16.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-37.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-37.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-37.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-37.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>My review bike came with the stock WTB Vulpine 40 mm tires, which I swapped for a set more appropriate for my terrain and the bike’s clearance. The stock Vulpines looked comically small in the fork, which can accommodate a 29 x 2.4″ (more on that later). I do <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/spencers-summer-2024-product-picks/\" target=\"_blank\">enjoy the WTB Vulpine tires</a> and run them on my personal road bike, but I feel they are undergunned for Southern Arizona gravel. I would have preferred a set of stock tires closer to the 50 mm ,considering the clearances allowed with the new frame and fork. With the new Vault moving away from its heritage in cross and road, I think a larger gravel tire could have been specced.</p>\n<p>My review bike came with a slightly different option for the wheelset. The review bike was equipped with a Reynolds ATR aero gravel wheelset, while the actual spec will be a set of G700 wheels. in theory, the G700 wheels would be more compliant than the ATR wheels, but I ran such large tires, this wouldn’t be much of a concern for my experience.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-6.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-6.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Properly Gravel</h3>\n<p>The new Vault’s geometry, build spec, and frame/fork tire clearance establish it solidly as a gravel bike. Gone are the semblances of using the Vault as a competitive road bike or cross bike on the side. While I would totally ride the Vault as a road bike, I feel like proper roadies would disagree, and they are probably right.</p>\n<p>Mirroring the geometry of mountain bikes, we see a longer top tube and shorter stem on the Vault. Sizes XXS- XS get a 60 mm stem, while all sizes larger than that get a 70 mm stem. This shift to a longer TT and shorter stem plays a part in the calm and stable feeling of the steering I mentioned before when discussing the new fork’s offset. On my XL review bike, the top tube is 30 mm longer, while the seat tube is almost 50 mm shorter than the previous year’s Vault. The shorter seat tube allows for a lower standover and longer dropper posts when necessary.</p>\n<p>While not as large of a change as the top tube numbers from the previous generation, we see an update to the head tube angles on the new Vault.  The head tube angles transition smoothly across sizes from 69 degrees to 71 degrees from XXS to XL. While not “slack” by any means, the head tube is now 1 degree slacker than the previous generation, while the seat tube angle remains unchanged at 73 degrees on the XL.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-32.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-32.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-32.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-32.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-13.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-13.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-13.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-13.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Big Tires = More Betterer</h3>\n<p>I hinted at this previously in the spec overview, but I stuffed significantly larger tires into the Vault instead of the stock tire offering. My previous review of the Vault was really about meeting the bike where it was: a great road bike with big enough tire clearance to work as a gravel bike. Now that pretense is gone, and I looked at the fork on my review bike and thought, <em>what about bigger tires?</em> I initially swapped over to WTB’s 700 x 50 Resolute tires, a fitting choice for some gravel chunk. I was rounding the final corner of my review time with the Vault and thought I should try a 29 x 2.1″ in the front. After installing that, I realized I still have plenty of room to spare. Could a 2.4″ fit? Hell yes it could, and with plenty of room for mud and debris.</p>\n<p>I ended up with a 700 x 50 WTB Resolute in the rear and a 29×2.4″ WTB Macro up front. Does anybody remember Monster Cross bikes? Can we call this monster gravel? I think so. Some aesthetically minded folks might not like the mismatched sizes and treads. I’m sorry, I at least tried to match the brands and sidewall colors.</p>\n<p>Swapping the tires out on the Vault, especially the front tire, was revelatory. The Vault was already going to be a great bike with the matching 700 x 50 tires I initially had set up, but a proper 29er XC tire on the front assuaged the main irk I had on both versions of the Vault: an imbalance in the ride feel between the fork and ISOflex.</p>\n<p>In the previous generation, the ISOflex worked marvelously, but the small front tire clearance and stiff fork led to an imbalanced ride quality. With the Vault’s larger tires and more compliant fork, my swapping to a dropper post equaled the ride quality front to back. Running a 2.4″ tire up front only improved this experience for me.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-22.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-22.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-22.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-22.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>There is a local ride where two-thirds of the route is smooth gravel that I’d be happy to run a 40 mm tire on. The last third is chunky enough to want a hardtail or at least proper MTB tires. I took the previous Vault on said ride and found myself hanging back on the chunky descents, trying to keep from pushing the small tires too much. On that same ride with larger tires and a dropper post, I found myself bombing into the gullies without hesitation. Riding such a light and comfortable bike with as large tires was a game changer for my opinion of the Vault. In the 11th hour, some choice tinkering really made the bike click for me.</p>\n<p>Maybe you live somewhere where a 2.4″ tire on a gravel bike seems silly, and that’s fair. Southern Arizona is chunky and I usually ride the same WTB Macros on my rigid 29er for many gravel rides. While I wish I could get a 2.4″ on the back, there is just no way that will happen with 142mm spacing, room for two chainrings, and a road spaced crankset.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-30.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-30.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-30.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-30.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>What It Could Be</h3>\n<p>While my last Vault review met the bike where it was, with this review, I really wanted to see what the Vault could be. Even with stock spec, the Vault is a great bike by many measures, but with larger tires and a dropper post, it really caught my attention. If you are a conservative gravel rider and just want a comfortable ride with a more classic 2x gearing, the Vault is great. If you want to ride more chunky terrain, squeeze an MTB tire on the front of the bike, and run a dropper for the rowdy sections, the Vault is likewise a great option. With so much flexibility one has many choices: for cable routing, tire clearance, drivetrains, and accessory mounting. There is a lot of clever engineering to allow for so many options in a sleek package.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2024_Pivot_Vault_Review-26-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2024_Pivot_Vault_Review-26-1.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2024_Pivot_Vault_Review-26-1.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/2024_Pivot_Vault_Review-26-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-39.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-39.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-39.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/2025_Pivot_Vualt_Review-39.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>It was truly a pleasure to be able to have almost a back to back test of the two generations of the Pivot Vault. So many of the ride qualities I admired in the past generation have been carried over to the newest iteration and improved upon. It’s hard to find faults in the Vault, and in doing so I had to be rather granular. That aside, riding the Vault is such a fun experience. The frame is so supportive when you need to put weight into the pedals, while the ISOflex keeps every bump from being too jarring. Southern Arizona riding can make most gravel bikes feel inadequate, but I can safely say the Vault was up for the challenge. The Vault is a masterpiece of balance between comfort, weight, and power transfer. Add in all the meticulous work of the engineers to make it such a versatile frame and you have a truly impressive bike.</p>\n<p>In the end, the large tire clearance was what really won me over about the new Vault.
