{"title":"‘The Hardest Working Font in Manhattan’","link":"https://aresluna.org/the-hardest-working-font-in-manhattan/","date":1739742757000,"content":"\n<p>Extraordinary illustrated essay by Marcin Wichary, documenting a typeface — and its long, fascinating, splintered history — that exemplifies the difference between <em>beautiful</em> and <em>pretty</em>. The beauty in Gorton isn’t just in its plainness and hardworking mechanical roots — it’s in the history of the 20th century itself. Gorton became such a part of the world that the bygone world of the previous century imbues how this font makes me feel. </p>\n\n<p>Do yourself a favor and read this one in a comfortable chair, with a tasty slow-sipping beverage, on a screen bigger than a phone. Everything about this piece is exemplary and astounding — the writing, the photography, the depths of research. But most of all, Wichary’s clear passion and appreciation. It’s a love letter.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/16/the-hardest-working-font-in-manhattan\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"869a694801874824c1acaa181e4162669c6c2ea0789e8a5ef571efdad9317c52","category":"Tech"}
