He'll work closely with a Weyland-Yutani Android named Thia (Elle Fanning) to take down \"the ultimate adversary,\" which the trailer dubs a creature that \"can't be killed.\" The adversary looks like a very large monster we haven't seen before, judging from a few shots in the trailer.</p>\n<p>Some or all of the film is rumored to take place on the Predator home world, and the movie intends to greatly expand on the mythology around the Predators' culture, language, and customs. It's intended as a standalone movie in the Predator/Alien universe.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/04/elle-fanning-teams-up-with-a-predator-in-first-predator-badlands-trailer/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/04/elle-fanning-teams-up-with-a-predator-in-first-predator-badlands-trailer/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1de1e2ea2569fc712c0cbbf6df715eba59afb5e7f93119fc1304a452861ef6cd","category":"Tech"}
