Gjovik was fired from Apple in September for allegedly leaking confidential information. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nGjovik, who has been vocal on Twitter, complained about ongoing harassment and unsafe working conditions at Apple, and she believes that she was fired under a false pretext.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple told <em>Financial Times</em> that it is \"deeply committed to creating and maintaining a positive and inclusive workplace.\" The company said that it takes \"all concerns seriously\" and investigates thoroughly when a complaint is raised. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn recent weeks, Apple employees have been critical of workplace misconduct and have shared their frustrations, which has led to the creation of an \"AppleToo\" <a href=\"https://appletoo.us/letter/\">initiative</a> calling on Apple executives to address the abuse, discrimination, and harassment that employees have reported. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nBack in September, Apple retail and people chief Deirdre O'Brien encouraged employees <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/06/apple-executive-addresses-employee-concerns/\">who are experiencing issues</a> to talk to their managers and their \"business relations partner.\" Apple, she said, has a \"confidential process\" to investigate complaints in a way that \"treats everyone with dignity and respect.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple is also <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-national-labor-relations-board-investigating-two-complaints-apple-workers-2021-09-02/\">facing an investigation</a> from the National Labor Relations Board.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/13/us-labor-department-apple-investigation/\">U.S. Labor Department Opens Investigation Into Apple</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/u-s-labor-department-opens-investigation-into-apple.2327395/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=pBypGQfs6zE:yJfPvg0T5lk:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=pBypGQfs6zE:yJfPvg0T5lk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"141f1652acce43556e452b7d0a5dafcaad346e7f90f127ceeeb55bd7a518b887","category":"Apple"}
