So this summer, after four years of research and development, Raleigh is offering fans the chance to relive their youth by releasing a replica of the original Chopper in its classic colours – infrared and ultraviolet. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Distinctive design</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Raleigh Chopper was like no other bike in its time. Fondly remembered by many for its distinctive shape and that big rear wheel, the Raleigh Chopper made an instant impact everyone who rode it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The high ape-hanger handlebars, the red-trimmed tyres, the original car-style gear stick and, of course, the elongated seat meant the Chopper stood out from other typical children’s bikes, and even today there’s no other bike quite like it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Even as Raleigh continues to move forward into the future of bicycles – embracing electric bikes, cargo bikes and more – the brand keeps one foot firmly in its glorious past,’ says Edward Pegram, head of brand and marketing at Raleigh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Being Raleigh’s most iconic design to date, the Chopper is still seen by the Raleigh team as the jewel in the brand’s crown – a legacy to be admired, protected, and never forgotten. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\"

character, the likes of which had never been seen before – or since, for that matter,’ Pegram adds. ‘This keeps the Chopper firmly set in a specific period of time, forever a representation of the 1970s and forever a reminder of playing outside with friends.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Chopper’s unique and playful design was inspired by the ‘chopping’ of motorbikes in post-war America to create dragsters, beach buggies, even chariots. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was the late Alan Oakley of Raleigh who came up with the Chopper design following a visit to the US where he watched the American film <em>Easy Rider</em>, which is famous for its Harley Davidson Choppers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On his flight back home, he sketched out his idea on the back of an airmail envelope, and soon the Raleigh Chopper was born, and the style of the <em>Easy Rider</em> film was brought to the backstreets of Britain, taking the UK youth bike market by storm.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Making of an icon</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ever since its launch in 1969, the Raleigh Chopper has been highly sought after. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With over 1.5 million Choppers sold during the bike’s heyday, the Chopper became the UK’s bestselling children’s bicycle and even today no bike can claim to have such a cult following, or such a collectors’ market, in the UK.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\"

present for every kid of the 70s to featuring in Hollywood films, TV shows and music videos, the Chopper is no stranger to the limelight. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The original 1995 <em>Jumanji</em> film features a bike chase scene with a Raleigh Chopper, TV shows and movies of the 70s and 80s such as <em>The Goonies</em> and <em>Back to the Future</em> also had Chopper cameos as did the more recent hit TV show <em>Stranger Things</em>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elsewhere, Britpop band Supergrass rode Choppers in their breakthrough 90s single ‘Alright’, while Lily Allen also rode a Chopper in her smash hit ‘LDN’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it doesn’t stop there. The Chopper has an abundance of famous fans, from David Beckham allegedly having bought a MKII Chopper to Blur’s Damon Albarn, ex England goalkeeper David James, and Lady Gaga all rumoured to own one. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>MKII remake</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Raleigh Chopper is an identical remake of the 1972 MKII version, albeit with a few legally required minor tweaks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The MKII was the superior Chopper, having rectified some “quirks” of the MKI,’ says Pegram. ‘It was subsequently produced for a much longer period of time, selling in its millions worldwide.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\"

have been asking for a new Chopper release for quite some time so we knew we had to deliver – we just had to make sure we could get it right, and that’s exactly what we ‘ve been able to do with this release of the MKII.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We used 3D modelling of original MKII bikes to produce CAD designs for the new frame and spent many hours spent agonising over the details that make this new bike special: the decals, the CNC head tube, working sprung one piece saddle, one-piece handlebar and stem, as well as the UK-made working three-speed shifter unit.’ </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The limited-edition Chopper will be launched in the two original colours; infrared and ultraviolet and will be available to <a href=\"https://www.raleigh.co.uk/gb/en/\" target=\"_blank\">buy online from Raleigh</a> on 20th June at 12pm. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t miss out on the ultimate collector’s item this summer. <strong>Head over to <a href=\"https://retro.raleigh.co.uk/\"
