There are so many cool gadgets and devices that will go on sale for fantastic prices on Prime Day, both from Apple and other big brands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether this is your first “Prime Day” rodeo or you’ve taken advantage of fantastic discounts before, it’s always a good idea to find out more about the upcoming event. So, let’s jump to it since we know you’re busy. If you want to check out some early deals, you can just go do that instead.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is Prime Day?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Prime Day is the annual shopping event that gets us about as excited for Apple deals as Black Friday. The first year Prime Day was held was in 2015 when Amazon wanted to celebrate its 20th anniversary with a bang. The sale was so successful that it stuck around and we’re happy it did because the discounts are impressive and many brands use Prime Day as the chance to lower the price more than they usually would.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of the single-day event from back in the day, nowadays, we get a full 48 hours to shop for deals and decide what we need and what we simply “want.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When is Prime Day 2024?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon is pretty secretive about the actual dates of Prime Day, so it won’t share much info before we get closer to the event. However, we’ve been through this a bunch of times at this point, and we can make educated guesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing we can say about Prime Day 2024 is that it will be on a Tuesday and Wednesday in July. Why? Because these are the days that Prime Day took place in pretty much all previous years. In 2023, Amazon chose July 11 and 12 for Prime Day, while in 2022, the event was scheduled for July 12 and 13.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By doing a bit of Sherlock work, we can estimate that in 2024, there will be two options for Prime Day. It could either take place on the Tuesday-Wednesday duo of July 9 and 10 or a week later on July 16 and 17. Of course, our estimates hang exclusively on Amazon’s tendency to stick to tradition. If they decide to change things up by picking other days of the week or shooting for later in the month, we’re going to be off the mark. We’ll update the article as soon as Amazon confirms the timing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, another detail you should know is that deals usually start at midnight EST on the day of the event, so if you’re having issues sleeping because of the heat, you can start shopping straight away. In the days leading up to Prime Day, we’ll be seeing more discounts reserved for Prime members, and you’ll see plenty of them covered at MacWorld, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Will we get another Prime Day in October?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon has been pretty consistent about its big sale events, so when it introduced the October event a couple of years ago, we figured it was here to stay. Well, we can’t predict the future with certainty, but Amazon seems like the type to stick to tradition. While we don’t have any official info on an October event, we’re going to guess that yes, we will get a new fall Prime Day event.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Do I need to subscribe to Prime to shop on Prime Day?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You do, and you don’t. Let us explain. As the name suggests, Prime Day was designed as a special sale event to reward Prime members with special prices. So, you’d need to have a subscription to the service ($14.99/month or $139/year) or sign up at just the right time for the 30-day free trial to cover the Prime Day deals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there are loads and loads of deals available during the event when a subscription to Prime is not necessary. They will just be straight-up discounts that anyone can enjoy. Whether or not your favorite products from Apple and other big brands will fall into this category remains to be seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Where to find the best Prime Day deals?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Right here! We’ll be covering Prime Day this year (again) and scouring Amazon for the best Apple deals. So just head over to Macworld, and we’ll tell you which deals are worth your time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What products do we expect to go on sale?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We expect to get great discounts on pretty much all products from Apple. Devices such as the MacBook Pro and Air and Apple Watch Series 9 that have been on shelves for a while usually see their best discounts on Prime Day, but even newer devices like the iPad Air and Pro and so do iPads, but we’ll have to wait and see for the others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, we’re also expecting to see tons of good deals on various Apple accessories that you may need for your devices, including Apple Pencils, keyboards, and mice, as well as stands, chargers, and cables from third-party accessory makers such as Anker and Logitech.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Do other retailers run sales during Prime Day?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>During Prime Day, other retailers will certainly try to bring in some shoppers, including Best Buy, Target, and Walmart. While we’re sure many deals will be exclusive to Amazon, many brands will run similar sales in other shops, too. You could end up getting a product you want for the same price as it is at Amazon without needing to subscribe to Prime.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What are the best deals right now?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are always great deals available at Amazon, so we’ll be updating this list regularly until Prime Day drops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple devices</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZHYWJS?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">AirPods Max</a> – <strong>$449 (18% off)</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2369381/these-airpods-are-down-to-a-budget-friendly-80-just-in-time-for-summer.html\">AirPods (2nd-gen)</a> – <strong>$80 ($40 off)</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Smartwatch-Midnight-Aluminum-Resistant/dp/B0CSTJ2Y5F/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple Watch Series 8</a> – <strong>$299 (25% off)</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2024-MacBook-13-inch-Laptop/dp/B0CX22ZW1T/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">13-inch MacBook Air M3</a> – <strong>$899 ($200 off)</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-iPad-Mini-Wi-Fi/dp/B09G9FW785?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">iPad mini</a> – <strong>$400 ($100 off)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Minimalist-Illuminated-Bluetooth-Compatible/dp/B098JPSVKY?th=1&amp;tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Logitech MX Keys Mini</a> <strong>– $80 (20% off)</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Docking-Station-Monitor-Ethernet/dp/B0CJBSS7Z9?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Baseus Docking Station</a> <strong>– $52 (35% off)</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Lightning-Connector-Certified-Compatible/dp/B0BV66XQ66?th=1&amp;tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Anker Nano Portable Charger for iPhone</a> – <strong>$18 (31% off)</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-Foldable-iPhone-Included/dp/B0B2MM1W65?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Anker 30W USB-C GaN Charger</a> – <strong>$13 (43% off)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\nAccessories, Apple Inc, Apple Watch, Smartwatches</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"cf82505c7fabcbd817c7585d2c500e2285ec4a7ec7faeb31ed3feafba6207426","category":"Apple"}
