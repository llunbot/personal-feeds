{"title":"Gurman: Apple Planning Multiple Events for the Fall, M1X MacBook Pros to be Available in November","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/15/gurman-multiple-fall-events-m1x-macbook-pros/","date":1629054448000,"content":"Apple is planning to hold multiple events this fall, which will collectively include the launch of new iPhones, Apple Watches, updated <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a>, revamped <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a>, and the redesigned MacBook Pros, according to respected <em>Bloomberg</em> journalist Mark Gurman. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/tim-cook-spring-loaded-event.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nIn his <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-08-15/what-s-new-about-the-next-apple-aapl-iphone-airpods-and-macs-ksdike4t\">latest weekly Power On newsletter</a>, Gurman says that much like last year, Apple will hold multiple events this coming fall, with the first likely being in September for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a>. Last year, due to the global health crisis and production constraints, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> lineup was not announced until October. The 2020 September event, rather than focusing on new iPhones, showcased new Apple Watches, iPads, and services. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThis year, Apple is expected to return to its tradition of announcing its flagship yearly <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> update in September, according to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/12/iphone-13-release-date-and-features/\">multiple reports</a>. In today's newsletter, Gurman reiterated his <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/10/iphone-13-pro-res-video-portait-mode/\">reporting from earlier last week</a>, setting expectations for the ‌iPhone 13‌ to include updates to the camera focused towards professional users, more advanced displays, and a smaller notch. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAlongside the new iPhones, Gurman, as previously reported, says that Apple can <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/28/airpods-pro-2-with-sensors-and-fitness-coming-2022/\">be expected to launch the third-generation AirPods</a> featuring an updated design, an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/04/ipad-mini-redesign-coming-2021/\">updated iPad mini</a> with a larger display, thinner borders, and improved performance, as well as the Apple Watch Series 7 with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/14/apple-watch-7-thinner-display-borders/\">flatter and improved displays, and performance</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs for the highly anticipated MacBook Pros featuring mini-LED displays, updated designs, and the M1X Apple silicon chip, Gurman says they will be available at the same time the current 16-inch MacBook Pro, powered by Intel, will celebrate its second anniversary. The 16-inch MacBook Pro was last updated in November of 2019.\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>I bought my MacBook Pro in 2019, and it's still the latest model. I realized while writing this that the 16-inch MacBook Pro launched in November 2019 is Apple’s newest high-end MacBook Pro. Unfortunately, some hiccups have led to production delays for the revamped 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros with M1X chips. But they should still go on sale by the time the current MacBook Pro hits its two-year anniversary.</blockquote>The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/12/2021-fall-apple-event-rumor-roundup/\">first event of the fall</a> in September will likely include the new iPhones, Apple Watches, and ‌AirPods‌, while the new iPads and possible updates to some of the company's services could be reserved for a second event, with the final event of the season being focused on Apple silicon Macs. <div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro-13/\">MacBook Pro 13\"</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro 16\"</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-event/\">Apple event</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_13\">13\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">16\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/15/gurman-multiple-fall-events-m1x-macbook-pros/\">Gurman: Apple Planning Multiple Events for the Fall, M1X MacBook Pros to be Available in November</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-apple-planning-multiple-events-for-the-fall-m1x-macbook-pros-to-be-available-in-november.2307632/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=0ZvkgNcPILo:trhKKnXoKpc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=0ZvkgNcPILo:trhKKnXoKpc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/0ZvkgNcPILo\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a4b3dafc3a39fac47de89b1f2ae2698bc5b470b75cf2bc9c90bd8b567aeed953","category":"Apple"}
