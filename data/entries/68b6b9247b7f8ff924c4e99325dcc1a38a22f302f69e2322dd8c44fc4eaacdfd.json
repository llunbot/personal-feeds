collaboration, Rapha has again teamed up with Gore to release three new styles of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/4611/buyers-guide-best-waterproof-cycling-jackets\" target=\"_blank\">waterproof jackets</a> for road and all-round city riding.</p>\n<p>The new Pro Team Gore-Tex Rain Jacket and Insulated Gore-Tex Rain Jacket bolster Rapha's Pro Team range, which in addition to the City collection's Insulated Gore-Tex Field Coat will be available from December 2021.</p>\n<h2>Rapha Pro Team Gore-Tex Rain Jacket</h2>\n<div>\n<div>    <img

Rain Jacket uses the waterproof specialists' most breathable three-layer fabric.</p>\n<p>Its newly developed lightweight and waterproof membrane apparently meets the Gore-Tex 'guaranteed to keep you dry' promise while keeping it at just 84gsm.</p>\n<p>A two-way zip allows for extra ventilation as the mesh-lined collar is raised for high protection against the elements on your ride.</p>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Waterproof and breathable</li>\n<li>Highly packable thanks to minimal trims throughout</li>\n<li>Designed to fit in an aggressive riding position, with other layers</li>\n<li>Two-way zip for extra ventilation and easy access to jersey pockets</li>\n<li>Available in Dark Navy/White and Teal/Peach</li>\n<li><strong> £195 / €230</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Rapha Pro Team Insulated Gore-Tex Rain Jacket</h2>\n<div>\n<div>    <img

similar looking Pro Team Insulated Gore-Tex Rain Jacket pairs a Gore-Tex Paclite Plus fabric with a synthetic insulated liner for protection in cold, wet weather.</p>\n<p>The jacket's 65gsm synthetic insulation is said to provide warmth while being highly breathable to ensure you don't overheat during training. </p>\n<p>The 3-layered fabric combines with a wide elasticated gripper at the waist, zipped cuffs and a raised collar for protection.</p>\n<p>For low-light conditions, there are reflective Pro Team bars on the sleeves in addition to the larger reflective tab between the pockets.</p>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Much the same as Pro Team Gore-Tex Rain Jacket but with added insulation</li>\n<li>Available in Blue/Orange and Dark Navy/White</li>\n<li><strong>

Insulated Gore-Tex Field Coat is a detachable t-shirt liner with 60gsm sheet insulation to keep you warm on colder days.</p>\n<p>Rapha has labelled it as being a performance-driven take on the iconic military field jacket, for use both on and off the bike.</p>\n<p>The short-sleeved, quilted liner can lock in warmth but also doubles up by being able to be buttoned out and warm separately.</p>\n<p>On the outside is a three-layer Gore-Tex fabric with a Gore C-Knit backer and a fully recycled face fabric for waterproof protection.</p>\n<p>The adjustable and lightweight packaway hood additionally provides a further barrier from wet weather.</p>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Three-layered Gore-Tex laminate with face fabric being 100% recycled</li>\n<li>Quilted t-shirt liner with 60gsm sheet insulation </li>\n<li>Adjustable packaway hood made with 100% recycled 2.5L GORE-Tex Paclite Plus that stows away in the collar</li>\n<li>Three cargo flap pockets, two zipped
