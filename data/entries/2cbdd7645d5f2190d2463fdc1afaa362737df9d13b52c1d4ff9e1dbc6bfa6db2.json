{"title":"The Old Last-Minute Hardware Design Switcheroo","link":"https://www.cultofmac.com/752777/apple-watch-7-last-minute-substitution/","date":1631724715000,"content":"\n<p>Killian Bell, writing at Cult of Mac:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple Watch Series 7 is not the upgrade most of us expected to see\nfrom Tuesday’s Apple event. The new model doesn’t sport the big\ndesign refresh multiple sources said was coming. It doesn’t even\npack a new chip.</p>\n\n<p>Is this the upgrade Apple wanted to deliver this year? Or is it\na last-minute substitution that Cupertino had to settle on\nbecause the refresh it really wanted to deliver just wasn’t\nready to roll out?</p>\n\n<p>Based on the evidence, we’re going to say it’s the latter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The only way this could be funnier is if Bell included the theory that perhaps Apple changed the hardware at the last minute <em>because</em> the flat-edge designs leaked.</p>\n\n<p>This is not how hardware works. These designs are set <em>long</em> in advance. In fact, from what I’ve heard, the flat-edge watch designs might be legitimate leaks, but they’re <em>next</em> year’s designs. That’s how far in advance Apple works on hardware — they were already in the advanced stages of designing the 2022 Apple Watches months ago. (Aesthetically, I am not sold on a flat-edge design for the watch. The round edges are iconic and organic.)</p>\n\n<p>You can argue that Series 7 is a marginal upgrade over Series 6, but with an all-new screen (brighter and bigger), all-new crystal (more durable), and 33 percent faster charging, there <em>are</em> upgrades, and none of them could be slapped together.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/15/old-last-minute-hardware-switcheroo\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"2cbdd7645d5f2190d2463fdc1afaa362737df9d13b52c1d4ff9e1dbc6bfa6db2","category":"Tech"}
