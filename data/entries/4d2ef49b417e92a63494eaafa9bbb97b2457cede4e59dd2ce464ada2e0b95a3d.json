As such, they offer a cheaper alternative if you’re just getting into gravel and aren’t sure if it’s for you or what you want.</p>\n<p>That also means they tend to offer lower-priced specs, which is an advantage when it comes time for parts replacement – components wear quickly in off-road conditions.</p>\n<p>As with the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-aluminium-road-bikes/\">best aluminium road bikes</a>, you may find you get more for your money from an aluminium gravel bike.</p>\n<h3>Are aluminium gravel bikes heavy?</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Male cyclist riding the Cannondale Topstone Alloy 2 gravel bike\" title=\"Cannondale Topstone Alloy 2 gravel bike_13\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Some aluminium gravel bikes are lighter than similarly priced carbon gravel bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Not necessarily, it depends on how they’re constructed. Hydroforming changes the shape and wall thickness of aluminium tubing and can dramatically decrease the weight of the bike’s frame. You’ll see frames referred to as triple-butted when the tubing has been made thinner in its middle than at its ends.</p>\n<p>In some cases, aluminium frames can be lighter than similarly priced carbon frames, so don’t discount aluminium gravel bikes because of their weight.</p>\n<p>A few choice component upgrades, such as a swap to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-wheels/\">best gravel wheels</a>, could also dramatically decrease the bike’s weight and change its performance.</p>\n<h3>Aluminium gravel bikes vs carbon gravel bikes</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"SRAM Rival eTap AXS / GX Eagle AXS mullet drivetrain on Giant Revolt X\" title=\"SRAM Rival eTap AXS / GX Eagle AXS mullet drivetrain on Giant Revolt X\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> You’re more likely to find costlier components, such as electronic SRAM drivetrains, on carbon gravel bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>As mentioned above, brands tend to offer their carbon gravel bikes with higher specs. Combined with a lower frame weight that can appreciably decrease the mass of a carbon gravel bike over an aluminium one, particularly if you’re prepared to pay more.</p>\n<p>You’re also more likely to find items such as SRAM’s 12-speed wireless AXS groupset on carbon gravel bikes than on aluminium gravel bikes.</p>\n<p>As entry-level models, aluminium gravel bikes tend to be generalist machines designed for all-round gravel riding.</p>\n<p>However, gravel bikes are becoming more specialist, so if you’re looking for a gravel race bike or a gravel bike to tackle steeper, more technical terrain, you’re more likely to find such a bike with a carbon frame.</p>","author":"Paul Norman","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"4d2ef49b417e92a63494eaafa9bbb97b2457cede4e59dd2ce464ada2e0b95a3d","category":"Cycling"}
