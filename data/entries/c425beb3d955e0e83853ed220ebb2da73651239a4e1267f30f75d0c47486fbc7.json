The National Advertising Division (NAD), part of \nthe advertising industry’s self-regulatory system run by BBB \nNational Programs, ruled against Comcast after a challenge lodged \nby T-Mobile. </p>\n\n<p>In its decision <a href=\"https://bbbprograms.org/media-center/dd/comcast-10g\">announced</a> Thursday, the NAD \nrecommended that Comcast “discontinue its ‘10G’ claims” or “modify \nits advertising to (a) make clear that it is implementing \nimprovements that will enable it to achieve ‘10G’ and that it is \naspirational or (b) use ‘10G’ in a manner that is not false or \nmisleading, consistent with this decision.” </p>\n\n<p>Comcast plans to appeal the decision, so it won’t make any changes \nto marketing immediately. If Comcast loses the appeal and agrees \nto change its practices, it would affect more than just a few ads \nbecause Comcast now calls its entire broadband network “10G.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is absolutely hilarious. Just making up the name “10G” is Comcast’s take on the classic “<a href=\"https://www.theonion.com/fuck-everything-were-doing-five-blades-1819584036\">Fuck Everything, We’re Doing Five Blades</a>” approach</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/20/comcast-10g\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"c425beb3d955e0e83853ed220ebb2da73651239a4e1267f30f75d0c47486fbc7","category":"Tech"}
