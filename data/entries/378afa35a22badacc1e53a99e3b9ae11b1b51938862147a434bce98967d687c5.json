Its September 12 <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2023/09/everyone-should-get-a-covid-booster-this-fall-cdc-says/\">recommendation that all Americans ages 6 months and up get an updated COVID-19 vaccine</a> was a blanket recommendation for any updated shots authorized or approved by the FDA, which now includes Novavax. The vaccine will be available to everyone ages 12 and up.</p>\n<p>The Novavax vaccine uses a traditional protein subunit-based design; it directly introduces the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to our cells along with an established adjuvant that enhances immune responses. The spike protein is a key outer protein the virus uses to enter human cells. The mRNA vaccines, by contrast, are a newer design that introduces the genetic code for the spike protein, which the cells then translate into protein on their own. In either case, with a disembodied spike protein, the immune system gets a chance to identify and train defensive responses against the pandemic pathogen before a live SARS-CoV-2 virus comes knocking.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1973117#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1973117&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"378afa35a22badacc1e53a99e3b9ae11b1b51938862147a434bce98967d687c5","category":"Tech"}
