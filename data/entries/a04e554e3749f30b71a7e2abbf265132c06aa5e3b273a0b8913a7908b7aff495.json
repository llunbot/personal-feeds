It is unclear exactly when availability will begin, but this is a routine step that Apple takes shortly before selling new refurbished models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/Refurbished-Ultra-2-and-Series-9.jpg\" width=\"374\" height=\"189\" /><div><em>The refurbished Ultra 2 and Series 9 search filters (since removed)</em></div>\r<br />\nLike new Ultra 2 and Series 9 models sold directly by Apple in the U.S. currently, it is expected that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/18/apple-website-apple-watch-blood-oxygen-removal/\">Blood Oxygen app would be deactivated</a> on the refurbished models, due to a legal battle with medical technology company Masimo. Last year, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/10/itc-opposes-apple-watch-sales-ban-pause/\">banned Apple</a> from importing and selling Apple Watch models with blood oxygen sensing after it ruled that the feature infringed on Masimo's patents.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple stopped selling refurbished Apple Watch Series 7 and Series 8 models in the U.S. after the ban took effect, as those also offer the Blood Oxygen app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is also possible that Apple and Masimo could reach a settlement before Apple starts selling refurbished Ultra 2 and Series 9 models, allowing for the Blood Oxygen app to be activated on the devices. If not, the feature could still be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/12/apple-watch-blood-oxygen-sensor-software/\">re-enabled with a watchOS software update in the future</a>, if and when the legal battle is resolved.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOn a related note, the first-generation Apple Watch Ultra has never been offered on Apple's refurbished store in the U.S., but it is <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/refurbished/watch/apple-watch-ultra\">available in the U.K.</a>, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/ie/shop/refurbished/watch/apple-watch-ultra\">Ireland</a>, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/cn/shop/refurbished/watch/apple-watch-ultra\">China</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/jp/shop/refurbished/watch/apple-watch-ultra\">Japan</a>. Since the ITC's ruling applies to the U.S. only, the Blood Oxygen app is still functional on Apple Watch models sold in all other countries.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nU.S. customers who want an Ultra 2 or Series 9 with the Blood Oxygen app activated can still <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/19/apple-watch-9-low-prices/\">purchase one from Best Buy for now</a>. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>Thanks, Stewart Dunford!</em>\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<strong>Update:</strong> Apple removed the grayed-out Ultra 2 and Series 9 search filters on its refurbished Apple Watch page following our report.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 9</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-refurbished/\">Apple Refurbished Products</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra\">Apple Watch Ultra (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/19/refurbished-apple-watch-ultra-2-series-9-coming/\">Apple Preparing to Sell Refurbished Ultra 2 and Series 9 Watches in U.S.</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-preparing-to-sell-refurbished-ultra-2-and-series-9-watches-in-u-s.2422300/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a04e554e3749f30b71a7e2abbf265132c06aa5e3b273a0b8913a7908b7aff495","category":"Apple"}
