Those of you with an old Windows 3.1 or Windows 95 PC can breathe easy, though, because the same developer who created the Windows 3.1 version ofÂ <em>Wordle</em> has returned with a Windows 3.1 ChatGPT client called <a href=\"https://www.dialup.net/wingpt/\">WinGPT</a>.</p>\n<p>WinGPT supports any 16- or 32-bit version of Windows 3.1 or newer but won't run natively on 64-bit versions of Windows. You can download it from the bottom of <a href=\"https://www.dialup.net/wingpt/\">this Dialup.net page</a>, which also doubles as a development blog detailing how it was built and how its icon was designed. You'll need to provide your own OpenAI API key.</p>\n<p>Running ChatGPT on ancient systems is possible mostly because most processing happens on OpenAI's servers rather than locally, so you don't need a modern 16-core battle station to make it work. The main limitation on old hardware is memory rather than processing power. Windows 3.1 generally won't boot with more than 256MB, and a period-appropriate 386 or 486 PC would be more likely to use between 4MB and 8MB (for reference, here's <a href=\"http://www.1000bit.it/ad/bro/compaq/CompaqDeskPro-M-WindowsEdition.pdf\">a 1992 Compaq Deskpro ad</a> for 386 and 486 PCs). The OS would install and run on systems with as little as 1MB.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1949948#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1949948&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4e6af2c0ba38987338ad447bafa2732da7bc9018f13d01de57408cc2b441fb8d","category":"Tech"}
