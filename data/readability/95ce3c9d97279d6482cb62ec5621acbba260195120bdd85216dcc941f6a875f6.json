Based on the specs, it looks like they’ve done it, with the highlight being twice the framerate at the highest resolutions.</p><p>That means 5.3K60, 4K120fps and 2.7K240. That’s typically the realm of top-level DLSRs, now in a camera that fits in your pocket. And, if you have a HERO 9, you’ll appreciate that they’ve made the touchscreen more responsive!</p><p>Here’s everything you need to know about the all-new GoPro HERO 10 action camera…</p><p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jGmiYzCPnSE?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe></p><h3>New Lens, Same Features &amp; Accessories</h3><p>First, the basics: The HERO 10 Black keeps the same dimensions as the HERO 9, meaning it’ll work with all of the same accessories, including the Media Mod, Light Mod, and Max Lens Mod.</p><p>Internally, it gets some refreshes that make it 3% lighter, too. Externally, and more importantly, it gets a new hydrophobic lens cover. Like the H9, it’s a removable/replaceable lens, but it’s upgraded with a water-shedding treatment that’s also more scratch resistant and reduces ghosting.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/15171830/gopro-hero-10-black-action-camera-mounting-fingers.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/15171830/gopro-hero-10-black-action-camera-mounting-fingers.jpg\" alt=\"gopro hero10 black action camera\" width=\"1600\" height=\"998\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/15171830/gopro-hero-10-black-action-camera-mounting-fingers.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/15171830/gopro-hero-10-black-action-camera-mounting-fingers-297x185.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/15171830/gopro-hero-10-black-action-camera-mounting-fingers-800x499.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/15171830/gopro-hero-10-black-action-camera-mounting-fingers-120x75.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/15171830/gopro-hero-10-black-action-camera-mounting-fingers-768x479.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/15171830/gopro-hero-10-black-action-camera-mounting-fingers-1536x958.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>The front screen is there, which was one of the best upgrades from the H9.

Nice.</p><h3>HERO 10 Battery Life &amp; Memory Card Requirements</h3><p>The new GP2 processor does draw more power at the new, higher frame rates…the tradeoff for quality is slightly reduced run time. So, if you’re running 5K60 or 4K120, the battery will drain a bit faster. Otherwise, they say its comparable to HERO 9 battery performance.</p><p>It uses the same size and speed MicroSD memory cards, with a minimum recommended rating of V30 or UHS-3 to take advantage of the highest frame rates.</p><h3>Higher Frame Rates &amp; HyperSmooth 4.0</h3><p>Those improved frame rates also get improved stabilization across the board, with HyperSmooth 4.0 able to prevent shaking up to 5K30. Above that, at 5K60, you still get standard HyperSmooth…so, it’s kind of like the HyperSmooth “Boost” mode from the HERO 9 if you want even more stabilization, you’ll just have to drop down a setting for frames-per-second.</p><p>Horizon Leveling also improves on the camera, increasing its range from 27º up to 45º without the Max Lens Mod. And, it works with standard and “boosted” HyperSmooth for footage up to 5K60. Here’s the chart:</p><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><strong>HyperSmooth 4.0</strong></td><td><strong>Horizon Leveling</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>5.3K</strong></td><td>30fps</td><td>60fps</td></tr><tr><td><strong>4K</strong></td><td>60fps</td><td>60fps</td></tr><tr><td><strong>2.7K</strong></td><td>120fps</td><td>120fps</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Horizon Leveling also works in 1080/120 if you need to shoot lower res. Essentially, you also get true gimbal-like performance, without a gimbal. Yes, these modes will crop the footage, but you’ll see what you’re getting on the front and rear screens, so there won’t be any surprises.</p><p>It’s worth adding that you can shoot in higher resolution, but switching to, say, 5K60 (meaning 5.3K resolution at 60 frames per second) or 2.7K240 will simply turn HyperSmooth off. So, you won’t get the boosted stabilization, but you’ll get smoother footage that you can slow down in post production or within the Quik app.</p><p><a

24fps</td><td>5.3K 16:9 24fps</td><td>4K 4:3 30/25/24fps</td><td>1080 24fps</td></tr></tbody></table><p>With the Max Lens Mod attached, you can turn on Horizon Lock, which keeps the footage level no

with that faster GP2 processor to better manage details in low light situations.</p><p>Even if you don’t shoot a ton at night, you’ll still get better indoor footage and more detail under dense tree cover, or when going in and out of shaded areas.</p><p><a

pull 19.6MP stills out of the 5K 4:3 footage…or 15.3MP from 5K 16:9 footage.

With 30% faster WiFi speeds (and wired offloads up to 50% faster), it shouldn’t take long, and then you’ll be able to see every clip within their Quik app.</p><p>If you typically edit your action shots from your phone, that gives you easy access to the files so you only need to download the ones you actually want to use. Or, you can now plug the camera directly into your phone and download them directly from the device, too.</p><p>For desktop users, all of the media will be available from the Cloud Media Library when you log in through the Plus portal on any browser.</p><h3>Live Streaming &amp; Web Cam Options</h3><p>The GoPro HERO 10 Black can livestream in 1080p HD with a 132º wide angle, and the front screen helps you frame the shot.</p><p>For live streamers, the HERO 10 will now stabilize your footage with HyperSmooth 4.0 in real time to ensure smooth video even as you walk around and move the camera from hand to hand (or get your kids or friends to help you, even if they don’t know what they’re doing).</p><h3>GoPro HERO 10 versus HERO 9 Comparison</h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/15173949/Gopro-HERO-10-versus-HERO-9-comparison-chart.gif\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/15173949/Gopro-HERO-10-versus-HERO-9-comparison-chart.gif\" alt=\"feature comparison of gopro hero 10 versus hero 9 shows it is worth the upgrade\" width=\"1080\" height=\"525\"></a></p><h3>HERO 10 Black Pricing &amp; Availability</h3><p>Pricing increases slightly.
