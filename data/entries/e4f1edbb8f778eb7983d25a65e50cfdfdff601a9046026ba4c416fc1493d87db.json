The <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/creating-fully-immersive-experiences\">documentation</a> reads:</p>\n<blockquote><p>When you start a fully immersive experience, visionOS defines a system boundary that extends 1.5 meters from the initial position of the person’s head. If their head moves outside of that zone, the system automatically stops the immersive experience and turns on the external video again. This feature is an assistant to help prevent someone from colliding with objects.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Around the same time, people discovered that Apple also <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2023/06/22/apple-vision-pro-high-speeds/\">yanks you out</a> of any immersive environment if you start moving too quickly in any direction. visionOS will show users a message stating that they are \"moving at an unsafe speed\" and that \"virtual content has been temporarily hidden until you return to a safe speed.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1950366#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1950366&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e4f1edbb8f778eb7983d25a65e50cfdfdff601a9046026ba4c416fc1493d87db","category":"Tech"}
