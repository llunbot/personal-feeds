{"title":"U.S. Considers Breaking Up Google as Antitrust Remedy","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/technology/google-monopoly-antitrust-justice-department.html","date":1723655772000,"content":"\n<p>David McCabe and Nico Grant, reporting for The New York Times:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Justice Department officials are considering what remedies to ask\na federal judge to order against the search giant, said three\npeople with knowledge of the deliberations involving the agency\nand state attorneys general who helped to bring the case. They are\ndiscussing various proposals, including breaking off parts of\nGoogle, such as its Chrome browser or Android smartphone operating\nsystem, two of the people said.</p>\n\n<p>Other scenarios under consideration include forcing Google to make\nits data available to rivals, or mandating that it abandon deals\nthat made its search engine the default option on devices like the\niPhone, said the people, who declined to be identified because the\nprocess is confidential. The government is meeting with other\ncompanies and experts to discuss their proposals for limiting\nGoogle’s power, the people said.</p>\n\n<p>The deliberations are in their early stages. Judge Amit P. Mehta\nof U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, who is\noverseeing the case, has asked the Justice Department and Google\nto come up with a process for determining a fix by Sept. 4. He has\nscheduled a hearing on Sept. 6 to discuss next steps.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>After winning the U.S.-v.-Microsoft case in 2001, the U.S. pursued breaking up Microsoft. It didn’t happen. But at least that made some sort of business sense — the idea at the time was to break the OS business (Windows) off from the app business (Office). Windows was profitable on its own. Office was profitable on its own. In theory they could have been separated and operated as independent businesses.</p>\n\n<p>At a product level, you can see why it might be tempting to say Chrome and/or Android ought to be broken off from Google. But at a business level it doesn’t make any sense at all. Chrome makes no money at all on its own. It’s just a funnel for Google Search. Android maybe sort of kind of makes a little money for Google on its own, through the sale of Pixel devices, but it’s negligible. Like Chrome, Android really only exists as a funnel to keep users using Google search and within the broader Google digital ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p>I mean, let’s say Google was forced to spin Chrome off. How would Chrome Inc. make money? Clearly, they’d make money through TAC fee payments from Google search. Also, if they split off Chrome they’d almost have to split off Android. If Google is disallowed from making its own web browser how in the world can they make an OS? I mean in theory they could make an OS that only offered third-party browsers but that would mean no system-level webview for apps to embed. Some people laughed at Microsoft’s late-1990s argument that Windows needed a built-in browser but that’s obviously true today. It’s no different than including a TCP/IP networking stack or printer drivers.</p>\n\n<p>I don’t know what the remedy ought to be for this case, but I don’t think a breakup is it.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/08/14/us-google-breakup\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"a54990d2871d917c2f72f9237d4bba03a7485f8e80381c8e0d53b8b1eac9e2c1","category":"Tech"}
