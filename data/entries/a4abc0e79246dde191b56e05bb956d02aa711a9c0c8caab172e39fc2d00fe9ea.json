Apple considers a device to be vintage once five years have passed since the company stopped distributing it for sale. Apple and Apple Authorized Service Providers may offer repairs for vintage devices if parts remain available.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple Watch Series 4 models launched in 2018, ushering in a major new design with a thinner case and a 30% larger display than before.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe latest watchOS 11 update <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/watchos-11-compatible-apple-watch-models/\">dropped support for the Apple Watch Series 4</a>, as well as the Apple Watch Series 5 and the original Apple Watch SE.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple also added the final 15-inch MacBook Pro model to the vintage products list today. This particular model launched in May 2019, and it was pretty quickly succeeded by the first 16-inch MacBook Pro in November of that year.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/vintage-and-obsolete/\">Vintage and Obsolete Apple Products</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/02/apple-watch-series-4-now-vintage/\">RIP, Apple Watch Series 4</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/rip-apple-watch-series-4.2446579/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a4abc0e79246dde191b56e05bb956d02aa711a9c0c8caab172e39fc2d00fe9ea","category":"Apple"}
