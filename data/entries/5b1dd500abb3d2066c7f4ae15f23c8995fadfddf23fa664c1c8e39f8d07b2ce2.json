Now, it has emerged that this will be achieved by tethering the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a> to a specific <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/\">Apple ID</a>, with an unusual system of covering the ‌AirPods Pro‌'s speaker holes to remove the linked account.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/Find-My-AirPods-Feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nFirst spotted by <em><a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/10/ios-15-to-link-airpods-with-your-apple-id-as-part-of-find-my-network/\">9to5Mac</a></em>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/10/apple-seeds-ios-15-beta-5-to-developers/\">iOS 15 developer beta five</a> code has confirmed that, to work with Apple's ‌Find My‌ Network, ‌AirPods Pro‌ and ‌AirPods Max‌ will need to be tethered to an ‌Apple ID‌. This means that even if a user connects someone else's ‌AirPods‌ to their device, they will remain tethered to the owner's ‌Apple ID‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nTo remove the configured ‌Apple ID‌ and disable connection to the ‌Find My‌ Network, such as when passing the ‌AirPods‌ to a new user, owners will have to follow a number of manual steps similar to the process for untethering an AirTag.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFor ‌AirPods Max‌, users need to hold down the Active Noise Cancelation button at the same time as the Digital Crown for 12 seconds. For ‌AirPods Pro‌, users have to cover the interior and exterior grilles with their fingers while pressing the button on the stem three times in sequence.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSupport for the ‌Find My‌ Network will likely come via an ‌AirPods Pro‌ and ‌AirPods Max‌ firmware update alongside ‌iOS 15‌ and ‌iPadOS 15‌ later in the fall. First and second-generation ‌AirPods‌ will not support the ‌Find My‌ Network.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nPreviously, all ‌AirPods‌ devices appeared in the ‌Find My‌ app, but were not remotely locatable using the ‌Find My‌ Network like an AirTag, which uses low-energy Bluetooth to feed a device's location back to the owner via nearby <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/\">AirPods Max</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/\">Find My</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro\">AirPods Pro (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Max\">AirPods Max (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/11/airpods-find-my-support-apple-id-and-process/\">AirPods Find My Network Support Includes Tethering to Apple ID and New Manual Unpairing Process</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airpods-find-my-network-support-includes-tethering-to-apple-id-and-new-manual-unpairing-process.2307206/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=frN-v1uwMVE:q89ohfr2CTk:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=frN-v1uwMVE:q89ohfr2CTk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/frN-v1uwMVE\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5b1dd500abb3d2066c7f4ae15f23c8995fadfddf23fa664c1c8e39f8d07b2ce2","category":"Apple"}
