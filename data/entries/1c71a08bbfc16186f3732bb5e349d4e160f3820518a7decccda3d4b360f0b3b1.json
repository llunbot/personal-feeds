alt=\"Commencal 365\" title=\"Commencal 365\" />                                            <p>Commencal has launched the 365, featuring a full-aluminium frameset and integrated front mudguard.</p>\n<p>The new gravel bike is a first for the Andorran brand, which is best known for its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike/\">mountain bikes</a>, and is only available with a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/1x-drivetrains/\">1x drivetrain</a>.</p>\n<p>Commencal says it has designed the bike to cope with the demands of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/what-is-gravel-riding/\">gravel riding</a>, with versatility aimed at making it suitable for touring and commuting.</p>\n<p>The bike is available in three builds: the lowest-priced 365 Ride, the mid-spec 365 Race and the range-topping 365 Signature.</p>\n<p>The bikes are available to order now, with pricing to be confirmed.</p>\n<h2>Full-aluminium construction</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Commencal 365\" title=\"Commencal 365\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The bike is named 365 after the number of days per year Commencal says you can ride it – that’s one rest day every four years.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Commencal</i></span></div>\n<p>The Commencal 365 is made from triple-butted 6069 T4/T6 aluminium, including the fork.</p>\n<p>Many <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bikes/\">gravel bikes</a> have a carbon fibre fork in their framesets due to carbon’s light weight and low-frequency vibration-damping qualities.</p>\n<p>Commencal says it has decided on a full-aluminium construction because the brand sees this as its speciality and cites sustainability reasons such as the ability to recycle the material.</p>\n<p>The thin, round dropped seatstays on the rear triangle are said to give the frame high levels of torsional strength, while allowing for vertical compliance.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Commencal 365\" title=\"Commencal 365\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The down tube features a cage holder for bottles or cargo.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Commencal</i></span></div>\n<p>The down tube of the 365 is concave, which is said to add to the bike’s lateral stiffness and fend off wheel spray.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Commencal 365\" title=\"Commencal 365\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The mudguard is reminiscent of those found on mountain bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Commencal</i></span></div>\n<p>It also features a frame protector that continues over the bottom bracket, while the front fork has mounts for a specific mudguard.</p>\n<h2>Commencal 365 geometry</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Commencal 365\" title=\"Commencal 365\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The 365 Signature is the range-topping model.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Commencal</i></span></div>\n<p>The Commencal 365 is available in five sizes, ranging from XS to XL, with all head angles hovering around the 74-degree mark.</p>\n<p>The brand says it has chosen to spec a 70mm stem to aid manoeuvrability on tight and twisty trails.</p>\n<p>Reach measurements are on-trend, with a medium-sized bike measuring 400mm.</p>","author":"Nick
