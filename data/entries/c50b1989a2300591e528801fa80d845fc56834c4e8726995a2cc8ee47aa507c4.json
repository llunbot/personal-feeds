Mux Video is an API to powerful video streaming (think of it like Stripe for video), built by the founders of Zencoder and creators of Video.js, and a team of ex-YouTube and Twitch engineers. Take any video file or live stream and make it play beautifully, at scale, on any device, powered by magical-feeling features like automatic thumbnails, animated GIFs, and data-driven encoding decisions.</p>\n\n<p>Spend your time building what people want, not drudging through <code>ffmpeg</code> documentation.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/08/22/mux-video\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"c50b1989a2300591e528801fa80d845fc56834c4e8726995a2cc8ee47aa507c4","category":"Tech"}
