During software installation, the wizard produces a clickable link to the location where the software will be installed. Clicking that link opens a File Explorer window to the proposed location—but that File Explorer spawns with <code>SYSTEM</code> process ID, not with the user's.</p>\n<h2>Have mouse, will root</h2>\n      <ul><li>\n        <div>  \n        <div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/razer-install-location-link-980x552.png\" /></div>\n        <p>\n          The \"Install Location\" at the lower right is a clickable link that opens a File Explorer window to browse for non-standard locations.

Unfortunately, Synapse is a part of the <a href=\"https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=Razer%2016495\">Windows Catalog</a>—which means that an unprivileged user can just plug in a Razer mouse, and Windows Update will cheerfully download and run the exploitable installer automatically.</p>\n<p>Jonhat isn't the only—or even the first—researcher to discover and publicly disclose this bug. Lee Christensen publicly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tifkin_/status/1420822088877846536\">disclosed</a> the same bug in July, and according to security researcher <code>_MG_</code>, who <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_MG_/status/1429293225181814784\">demonstrated</a> it using an <a href=\"https://o.mg.lol/\">OMG cable</a> to mimic the <a href=\"https://pci-ids.ucw.cz/\">PCI Device ID</a> of a Razer mouse and exploit the same vulnerability, researchers have been reporting it fruitlessly for more than a year.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1789961#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1789961&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"465f07d5d6df9247945a81a7fd2371d06ec532f3f4cbc9c792724680b454654c","category":"Tech"}
