The third betas come two weeks after Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/28/apple-seeds-ios-18-1-beta-3/\">seeded the third</a> iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and ‌macOS Sequoia‌ 15.1 betas. Apple has also seeded the first betas of upcoming watchOS 11.1, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/\">visionOS</a> 2.1, and tvOS 18.1 updates to developers. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/Apple-Intelligence-Feature-2.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThe updates can be downloaded from the Settings app on a compatible device. Prior iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and ‌macOS Sequoia‌ 15.1 updates required a device that supports Apple Intelligence, but the updates are now available for all devices following the launch of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a>, and ‌macOS Sequoia‌ 15. Note that Apple Intelligence features still require an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> Pro or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> on iOS, and a Mac or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> with Apple silicon on ‌iPad‌ and Mac.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple Intelligence includes Writing Tools that are available wherever text can be selected and edited, and it can be used for spell checking, fixing grammar, rewriting with a new tone, and summarizing text.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> has a new design with a subtle glow around the display, and there is a Type to ‌Siri‌ feature so you don't have to speak to ‌Siri‌. ‌Siri‌ can follow along if you stumble over your words, and can maintain context between requests. Safari can summarize articles, and there's a new Reduce Interruptions Focus Mode.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSmart replies are available in Messages and Mail, plus the Mail app surfaces time sensitive messages and puts them at the top of your inbox. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a> has a Memory Movie feature for creating slideshows based on text descriptions, and you can record, transcribe, and summarize phone calls. Transcription and summarization are also available for any audio recording.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMore on all of the features that are available in the betas right now can be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/ios-18-1-apple-intelligence-features/\">found in our Apple Intelligence guide</a>. Image Playground, Genmoji, and other new ‌Siri‌ features <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/ios-18-1-apple-intelligence-unavailable-features/\">have not yet been implemented</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has split Apple Intelligence into a separate set of betas because these features are not available in the initial launch versions of ‌iOS 18‌, ‌iPadOS 18‌, and ‌macOS Sequoia‌. Apple Intelligence will be available to the public later in October after a developer testing period.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/\">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246\">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/17/apple-fourth-beta-ios-18-1/\">Apple Seeds Fourth Developer Betas of iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1 and macOS Sequoia 15.1 With Apple Intelligence</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-fourth-developer-betas-of-ios-18-1-ipados-18-1-and-macos-sequoia-15-1-with-apple-intelligence.2436707/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4e24022059b51b0ef9b1093d627588398bc5aa212948e8af7d0d0a73caff8f71","category":"Apple"}
