{"title":"Reuters Reports European Commission Will Decline to Fine Apple Over Browser Choice Screen, But Hints It Will Over Anti-Steering Provisions","link":"https://www.reuters.com/technology/eu-set-close-investigation-into-apples-browser-options-sources-say-2025-03-25/","date":1742931734000,"content":"\n<p>Foo Yun Chee, reporting for Reuters under the headline “Exclusive: Apple Set to Stave Off EU Fine Into Browser Options, Sources Say”:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple is set to stave off a possible fine and an EU order over its\nbrowser options on iPhones after it made changes to comply with\nlandmark EU rules aimed at reining in Big Tech, people with direct\nknowledge of the matter said on Tuesday. The European Commission,\nwhich launched an investigation in March last year under the\nDigital Markets Act (DMA), is expected to close its investigation\nearly next week, the people said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A win’s a win and a closed investigation’s a close investigation, but the browser choice screen never seemed like a problem for Apple. I follow this stuff closely, and have even written (<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2024/09/the_ios_continental_drift_widens\">at times extensively</a>) about how <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/19/firefox-ios-doubling-france-and-germany\">dumb and ineffective</a> these mandatory browser choice screens are, and I didn’t realize this investigation was still open, because it seemed so clear Apple had done what they needed to for compliance.</p>\n\n<p>So, more interesting to me is this bit buried lower in the article, suggesting the EC is going fine Apple next week over non-compliance with the DMA’s anti-steering provisions:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Commission’s decision to close the investigation early next\nweek will come at the same time as it hands out fines to Apple and\nMeta Platforms for DMA violations and orders to comply with the\nlegislation, the people said.</p>\n\n<p>In this second Apple case, the issue is whether the company\nimposes restrictions that hinder app developers from informing\nusers about offers outside its App Store free of charge.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/25/reuters-eu-apple-browser-choice-investigation\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"3b4c7e410b17867444493ef63b0ee87a3ce07e92b2041150398b086776655719","category":"Tech"}
