{"title":"Tenways CGO800S review: More utility than bike, but maybe thatâ€™s okay","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028674","date":1718215944000,"content":"<div>\n<figure>\n  <img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/4-800x608.png\" alt=\"Slightly angled view of the Tenways CGO300s\" />\n      <p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/4.png\">Enlarge</a> (credit: Tenways)</p>  </figure>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>I enjoyed riding the <a href=\"https://us.tenways.com/products/cgo800s?utm_source=tenways_country_redirect&amp;utm_medium=auto&amp;utm_campaign=europe2usa\">Tenways CGO800S</a> far more once I stopped thinking of it as a bike, and more like the e-bike version of a reasonable four-door sedan.</p>\n<p>It is a bike, to be sure. It has two wheels, handlebars, pedals, and a drivetrain between feet and rear cog. It's just not the kind of bike I'm used to. There are no gears to shift between, just a belt drive and five power modes. The ride is intentionally \"Dutch-style\" (from a Dutch company, no less), with a wide saddle and upright posture, and kept fairly smooth by suspension on the front fork. It ships with puncture-proof tires, sensible mud guards, and integrated lights. And its 350 W motor is just enough to make pedaling feel effortless, but you'll never quite feel like you're winning a race.</p>\n<p>I also didn't feel like I was conquering the road when I was on the CGO800S so much as borrowing my aunt's car for an errand. The \"Sky Blue\" color helped cement the image of a modern-day Mercury Sable in my head. It's not meant for no-power riding, and its battery isn't a long-hauler, with a stated 53-mile range. It's comfortable, it's capable, and maybe we've long since reached the stage of the e-bike market where some bikes are just capital-F Fine, instead of them all being quirky experiments.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028674#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028674&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"962f0af242918295bd1ab4251f35f7d05c4d531294c39678f51b221543b66c4d","category":"Tech"}
