The policy was originally meant to go into immediate effect earlier this month, until authorities granted affected companies a three-month reprieve for them to obtain the required licensing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nU.S. industry groups including the Information Technology Industry Council, the National Association of Manufacturers, and the Semiconductor Industry Association have objected to the planned licensing rules, which they say could impact the shipment of American-made computers and electronics into India, inhibit the free flow of goods, and complicate business operations for all countries involved.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"This potential will only be achieved if businesses have assurance about a predictable regulatory climate,\" said the letter, which was signed by Apple, Intel, and other U.S. companies involved in technology and manufacturing.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/india/\">India</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/18/apple-decries-india-pc-import-restrictions/\">Apple, Other US Tech Firms Sign Letter Protesting India's PC Import Restrictions</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-other-us-tech-firms-sign-letter-protesting-indias-pc-import-restrictions.2398986/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"cceced6c9d9c46d1fb70581c985fda0213469a7d8da0cf0351cdacdf0465ea95","category":"Apple"}
