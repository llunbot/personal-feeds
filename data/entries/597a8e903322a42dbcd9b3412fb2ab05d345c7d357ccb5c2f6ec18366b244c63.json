The ‘best’ bike is the one that fits into your life and works day to day, not the one that theoretically offers the most performance.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just spent a few days in my erstwhile home city of Edinburgh. This wasn’t a cycling holiday, but my wife and I wanted to relive our carefree youth and ride everywhere, because it’s by far the best way to get around and revisit old haunts.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We intended to take bikes with us, but they had to be suitable for locking outdoors (ie, not too valuable) and, while we had a lot of stuff to transport, I was determined to fit the bikes inside the car. I once drove from Gloucestershire to Edinburgh with two bikes on the roof, and the fuel consumption penalty alone would have bought me a third bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/folding-bikes-in-car-970x728.jpg\" alt=\"Car boot full of stuff including two folding bikes\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/folding-bikes-in-car-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/folding-bikes-in-car-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/folding-bikes-in-car-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/folding-bikes-in-car-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/folding-bikes-in-car-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/folding-bikes-in-car-1140x855.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/folding-bikes-in-car.jpg 1800w\" /><figcaption>There are two whole bikes in there, honest.

In the car they went, along with all our belongings.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Folding bikes are pretty rubbish but also excellent </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Folders come in various flavours, from relatively capable large-wheel designs to those that focus on absolute portability, such as the classic Brompton. To varying degrees, they’re all fundamentally compromised, but that’s really not the point.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/dahon-folding-bike-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Dahon folding bike ready to ride\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/dahon-folding-bike-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/dahon-folding-bike-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/dahon-folding-bike-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/dahon-folding-bike-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/dahon-folding-bike-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/dahon-folding-bike-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/dahon-folding-bike-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/dahon-folding-bike-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/dahon-folding-bike-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/dahon-folding-bike.jpg 1800w\" /><figcaption>Matthew Loveridge</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For this trip I was riding a tired Dahon Vitesse D8 with 20-inch wheels, while my wife was on the quirky Big Fish Carnielli, a fascinatingly odd thing with 16-inch rims that I recently bought on eBay in never-used condition (look out for a future <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/what-we-ride\" target=\"_blank\">What We Ride</a> piece on this – it’s really weird and I love it).  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Neither is the last word in sporting prowess, but the fact is they work. They’re thoroughly usable bikes that are eminently suited to whizzing across town.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Edinburgh has some pretty gnarly cobbled streets as well as potholes you could live in, so the bikes weren’t always the most comfortable, but they coped well enough and let us do far more over the course of a few days than we’d have managed if we’d been relying on walking and taking the bus. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This might all sound blindingly obvious but I’m keenly aware how easy it is to get hung up on cycling perfectionism.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We bike tech nerds love to fret about the optimum setup for a given application, and this can lead to some needlessly black-and-white thinking, eg, ‘I <em>must </em>have a gravel bike that accepts 50mm tyres in case I suddenly need to go bikepacking in Chile’ or ‘this road bike is <em>unrideable</em> because <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/road-gravel-bike-rim-width\" target=\"_blank\">its rims only measure 17mm internally</a> and I won’t achieve ideal tyre volume from my 28s’.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Never mind that these tiny details are completely irrelevant to the bigger picture, or that cyclists have made do with whatever bike they had since the dawn of the dandy horse.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/Brompton_CHPT3_1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Riding a Brompton through the city at night\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/Brompton_CHPT3_1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/Brompton_CHPT3_1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/Brompton_CHPT3_1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/Brompton_CHPT3_1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/Brompton_CHPT3_1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/Brompton_CHPT3_1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/Brompton_CHPT3_1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/Brompton_CHPT3_1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/Brompton_CHPT3_1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/Brompton_CHPT3_1-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Brompton</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Folding bikes are objectively terrible when viewed solely through a performance lens. They’re often quite flexible since their frame design prioritises small size over rigidity, and their geometry typically leans towards the short, upright and twitchy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an alternative to not cycling at all, however, they’re utterly fabulous, and that’s why you need to buy a folding bike right now. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Folding bikes deals</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Btwin 500: The budget option</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"969\" height=\"784\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/btwin-500-folding-bike.jpg\" alt=\"Orange folding bike\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/btwin-500-folding-bike.jpg 969w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/btwin-500-folding-bike-300x243.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/btwin-500-folding-bike-768x621.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/btwin-500-folding-bike-750x607.jpg 750w\" /><figcaption>Decathlon</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>RRP £379.99</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Btwin 500 is one of the cheapest folding bikes on the market from a reputable brand, but it checks a lot of boxes.
