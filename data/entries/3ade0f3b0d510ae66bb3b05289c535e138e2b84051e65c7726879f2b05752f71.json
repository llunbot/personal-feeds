So we will have our drone teams out there starting tonight, all the way into Monday morning.\"</p>\n<p>Daughtry spoke near the end of a press conference (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/NYPDnews/status/1697294901925523683\">see video</a>) about safety and security measures for <a href=\"https://www.nyc.gov/nyc-resources/jouvert.page\">J'Ouvert</a>, a \"traditional street festival honoring the vast heritage and culture of the Caribbean diaspora,\" and the West Indian Day Parade.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1965087#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1965087&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3ade0f3b0d510ae66bb3b05289c535e138e2b84051e65c7726879f2b05752f71","category":"Tech"}
