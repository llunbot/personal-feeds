{"title":"While CTO at Pandora, Tom Conrad Had Them Building Their iPhone App Before the iPhone SDK Was Released","link":"https://www.vice.com/en/article/how-pandora-won-its-royalty-battle-but-lost-the-war-to-spotify/","date":1736901492000,"content":"\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/14/wingfield-sonos\">Speaking of</a> new (“interim”) Sonos CEO Tom Conrad and Scott Forstall, here’s an interesting anecdote from Tyler Hall’s terrific piece for Motherboard in 2021, “<a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/how-pandora-won-its-royalty-battle-but-lost-the-war-to-spotify/\">How Pandora Won Its Royalty Battle but Lost the War to Spotify</a>”:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>After pushback on only allowing web apps for the iPhone, Steve\nJobs announced that native apps would be coming to the iPhone. In\nthe interim, Apple Senior Vice President Scott Forstall invited\nTim Westergren and his CTO, Tom Conrad, over to a local Cupertino\nlunch spot. The trio talked for hours about what Pandora had\nlearned about streaming audio from putting apps on flip phones,\nlike Motorola’s RAZR, for wireless carriers. The meeting ended\nwith a question for Forstall.</p>\n\n<p>“What, if anything, can we do at Pandora to get ready for the next\ngeneration of iPhone that includes an app store and native APIs?”\nasked Conrad. “Forstall said, it wouldn’t be a waste of your time\nto jailbreak some iPhones and use the kind of back door toolkits\nthat were being distributed by other people to build a native\nPandora app while we get our act together at Apple on something\nmore formal.”</p>\n\n<p>So, Conrad, designer Dan Lythcott-Haines, and many others on the\nteam got to work jailbreaking iPhones and working on a Pandora\niPhone app ahead of the official APK release. Then, on day one of\nthe App Store launch, Pandora was the first internet radio app\navailable. Nine months later the Pandora app was installed on 21\npercent of iPhones.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I first linked to this article <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/03/09/forstall-pandora\">back in 2021</a>, when it was published, but it seemed perfect for a re-link now in light of Conrad’s new role at Sonos. The more I learn about Conrad, the more he sounds like the right man for the job there.</p>\n\n<p>(<a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/tylerh.social/post/3lfpiumnpr224\">Via Tyler Hall himself, on Bluesky</a>, which you should join if you haven’t already.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/14/conrad-forstall-pandora\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"74787bc51492a41483fb0aad74470ac86d8c6e418ea6576b5218bf5e79c9065f","category":"Tech"}
