More than just copying what other brands are doing and machining shit with zero engineering practices applied, I have worked tirelessly to design, engineer, and manufacture parts I would feel confident bolting on and riding anywhere in the world on. Many of my customers have done just that!</em></p>\n<p><em>Thank you all for your support and business these last 5 years. Ignite was more successful than I could have ever imagined. That 14yr old kid would be proud to have thousands of cranks out in the world on every type of bike, from BMX to commuter rigs, Olympic athletes, Iditarod racers, countless junior athletes, and just the peeps chillin’ at the local trailhead. It has been a dream riding with ya’ll but the creative juice is flowing down a different river and I’m pumped on what the future holds.</em></p>\n<p><em>Happy trails!”</em></p></blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Best of luck on your next adventure!</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/ignite-components-closed-up-shop/\">Ignite Components Closed Up Shop</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"e361cf1e9b30ed857129302be3ed185654bfe6641f6ea28ea3ea4307fc0d09de","category":"Cycling"}
