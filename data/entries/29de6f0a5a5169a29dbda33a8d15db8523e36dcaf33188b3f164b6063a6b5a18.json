The second tier Teammachine previously had external cabling from the cockpit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To contrast the two bikes, the pro level Teammachine SLR 01 has a claimed frame weight of 820g, a 345g fork and a slightly lighter seatpost, for a frameset weight of 1,350g. In comparison, BMC says the Teammachine SLR’s frame weighs 997g and its fork 388g for a frameset weight of 1,585g. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That leads to complete bike weights for the Teammachine SLR starting at around 8kg, whereas we weighed the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/bmc-teammachine-slr01-one-review\">Teammachine SLR 01 One</a> at 6.8kg when we reviewed it in 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Teammachine SLR could actually be considered the third tier in BMC’s Teammachine range, as BMC also sells the<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/bmc-teammachine-r-01-one-road-bike-review\"> Teammachine R </a>aero road bike, which was developed with assistance from Formula 1 engineering consultancy Red Bull Advanced Technologies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To make things even more confusing, BMC also sells <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/bmc-teammachine-r-mpc\">Mpc versions</a> (a truncation of Masterpiece) of both the Teammachine SLR and Teammachine R. They’re the bikes ridden by the<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tudor-pro-cycling-giro-ditalia\"> Tudor Pro Cycling team</a> and drop the frameset weight to 1,197g from the Teammachine SLR Mpc and 1,350g for the Teammachine R Mpc.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+3\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-3-970x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-3-970x300.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-3-300x93.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-3-768x238.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-3-1536x476.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-3-2048x634.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-3-750x232.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-3-1140x353.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Now added cockpit compatibility</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"622\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/BMC-2026-Teammachine-SLR-THREE-red-blk-blk-glam-key-11-970x622.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/BMC-2026-Teammachine-SLR-THREE-red-blk-blk-glam-key-11-970x622.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/BMC-2026-Teammachine-SLR-THREE-red-blk-blk-glam-key-11-300x192.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/BMC-2026-Teammachine-SLR-THREE-red-blk-blk-glam-key-11-768x492.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/BMC-2026-Teammachine-SLR-THREE-red-blk-blk-glam-key-11-1536x984.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/BMC-2026-Teammachine-SLR-THREE-red-blk-blk-glam-key-11-2048x1312.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/BMC-2026-Teammachine-SLR-THREE-red-blk-blk-glam-key-11-750x481.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/BMC-2026-Teammachine-SLR-THREE-red-blk-blk-glam-key-11-1140x731.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption>BMC </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we’ve got that all cleared up, the update to the Teammachine SLR provides compatibility with BMC’s range of Integrated Cockpit System bars and stems, as used on its other road bikes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These include the ICS Carbon Aero, the ICS Carbon and the ICS Carbon Evo. You can also fit a two-piece cockpit with cable integration via the ICS2 stem. All three specs of the updated Teammachine SLR at launch are fitted with a two-piece cockpit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other features of the new Teammachine SLR are carried over from the Gen 4 bike, so the frame has the same geometry and clearance for 30mm tyres, although it’s optimised for tyres of 26mm to 28mm width. There’s a D-shaped seatpost, claimed to improve ride comfort, which comes stock in 15mm setback, but is available in 0mm and 25mm setback too, to fine-tune your fit on the six available frame sizes.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n

Whereas the Teammachine SLR Two was previously priced at €5,699, the new bike costs €4,999.
