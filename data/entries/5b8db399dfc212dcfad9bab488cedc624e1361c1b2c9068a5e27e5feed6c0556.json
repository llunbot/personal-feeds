{"title":"Polygon Gutted by Large-Scale Layoffs After Sale to Sweatshop Aggregator Valnet","link":"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/gaming-news-site-polygon-gutted-by-massive-layoffs-amid-sale-to-valnet/","date":1746635883000,"content":"\n<p>Kyle Orland, reporting for Ars Technica last week:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Vox Media has sold video game specialist website Polygon to\n<a href=\"https://www.valnetinc.com/our-brands\">Internet brand aggregator Valnet</a>, the publisher of\ncontent-churning sites including Game Rant, OpenCritic, Android\nPolice, and Comic Book Resources. The move comes alongside\nsignificant layoffs for veteran journalists at the 13-year-old\noutlet, including <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/plante.bsky.social/post/3lo4mn4noqc26\">co-founder and editor-in-chief Chris\nPlante</a> and <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/mmcwhertor.bsky.social/post/3lo4lsc3pqk2c\">Senior Writer Michael McWhertor</a>. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Polygon was <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/polygon-com-its-a-website.1185405/\">founded in 2012</a> when Vox Media <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/briansolomon/2012/10/24/the-inside-story-of-polygon-the-verges-new-gaming-sister-site/\">spent\nsignificant money</a> to poach top journalists from popular\ngaming blogs like Kotaku, Joystiq, and The Escapist. After\ninitially publishing as the Gaming section of Vox.com for a few\nmonths, the Polygon domain <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2012/10/24/3547938/welcome-to-polygon\">launched</a> alongside <a href=\"https://botherer.org/2012/08/23/polygon-and-the-documentary-that-cured-cancer/\">a series\nof flashy videos</a> hyping up the staff’s lofty goals for\nvideo game journalism. In the years since, Polygon has become a\nrespected source for news and views on the gaming and\nentertainment industries — one that Ars Technica has cited\nfrequently during my tenure as senior gaming editor. [...]</p>\n\n<p>According to publications like <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/valnet-labor-lawsuit-hassan-youssef-digital-media-sweat-shop/\">The Wrap</a> and\n<a href=\"https://aftermath.site/freelance-video-game-journalism-rates\">Aftermath</a>, numerous Valnet writers have claimed that they\nreceive low pay for long articles, but Valnet insists that working\nconditions are good. It even sued The Wrap in federal court,\nsaying that Valnet “relies on its reputation as a supporter of\nhigh-quality journalism and of talented writers and editors to\nstaff its ever-growing business and need for engaging and\nwell-written content.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Just brutal. I’m not huge into games, but Polygon has been one of my go-to sources for game-related news for years. If I wanted to catch up on something like, say, Nintendo’s Switch 2 announcements, I knew I could go to Polygon and they’d have the coverage nailed. Polygon was everything you could want: good writing, good design, no hype, trustworthy coverage and analysis.</p>\n\n<p>There’s very little good news in media these days. The only talented people I see launching new things are doing it on Substack, and <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2024/11/regarding_and_well_against_substack\">I think that’s going to end poorly</a> for all of them.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/07/polygon-sold-gutted-by-layoffs\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"5b8db399dfc212dcfad9bab488cedc624e1361c1b2c9068a5e27e5feed6c0556","category":"Tech"}
