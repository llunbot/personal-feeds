The smaller size will allow the bag to better fit inside a travel bag or backpack, but it is not as small as the <a href=\"https://www.sfbags.com/products/vision-pro-shield-case\">WaterField Designs travel case</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBelkin's Travel Bag has multiple compartments to house the Vision Pro and accessories like the battery, power adapter, and additional headbands like Belkin's Head Strap. It can be carried using a handle or a strap, and there is cushioning to keep the device safe. The bag comes in gray, so it will presumably stay cleaner than Apple's white case.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBelkin's Travel Bag is priced at $99.95, so it is $100 cheaper than Apple's Travel Case. It can be <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HRYV2ZM/A/belkin-travel-bag-for-apple-vision-pro\">purchased from the Apple website</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/Belkin-Head-Strap-for-Vision-Pro.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nApple is also selling the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HRYW2ZM/A/belkin-head-strap-for-apple-vision-pro\">Belkin Head Strap</a>, a $49.95 accessory that goes over the top of the head to make the Vision Pro more comfortable to wear by better distributing weight.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/belkin/\">Belkin</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/07/belkin-vision-pro-travel-bag/\">Belkin Launches New Travel Bag for Apple Vision Pro</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/belkin-launches-new-travel-bag-for-apple-vision-pro.2442262/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1ae05e756d441c07110784a80dab0867c5a1d65e156a89407c84aa900ffc05bb","category":"Apple"}
