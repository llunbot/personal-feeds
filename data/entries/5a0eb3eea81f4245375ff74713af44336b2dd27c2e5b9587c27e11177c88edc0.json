The accommodation and food are first class and it’s great to make new friends along the way too.

The Col de Covelo showcases the famous scenery of the Douro Valley, a UNESCO World Heritage Site unrivalled in its uniqueness, followed by a challenging descent to the Douro River, and then a 30km climb up Col de Lamego, which has a few sneaky 14% ramps to test the legs.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/volta-pro-tours-05-970x728.jpg\" alt=\"Volta Pro Tours\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/volta-pro-tours-05-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/volta-pro-tours-05-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/volta-pro-tours-05-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/volta-pro-tours-05-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/volta-pro-tours-05-1140x855.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/volta-pro-tours-05.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Volta Pro Tours</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Stage 2 winds its way through the villages and vineyards of the famous Dao wine-making region, encompassing sleepy hamlets and market gardens. The Col de Gois is the main event, boasting a 16km ascent through the mimosa woods, but there’s also a final climb out of the River Zezere gorge for a spectacular view over the Cabril Reservoir.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The shortest stage of the N2 Challenge but no less beautiful, the third riding day includes the Col de Geodesico, which leads out to flatter landscape as the route enters Alentejo and, most importantly, offers a swimming pool at the end of the day.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/volta-pro-tours-06-970x728.jpg\" alt=\"Volta Pro Tours\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/volta-pro-tours-06-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/volta-pro-tours-06-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/volta-pro-tours-06-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/volta-pro-tours-06-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/volta-pro-tours-06-1140x855.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/volta-pro-tours-06.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Volta Pro Tours</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Stage 4 features fast and smooth roads through the sparsely populated Alentejo region, which is known as the hidden gem of Portugal thanks to a stunning landscape unspoiled by the modern world. Feast your eyes on rolling plains dotted with ancient cork oak trees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final stage, and perhaps the most rewarding, includes 120km of smooth roads from Alentejo to Faro featuring a stunning winding climb up the Col de Cavalos as you make your way into the magnificent Algarve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Riders can take in their phenomenal achievement and enjoy a relaxing night in the heart of Faro before setting off for home the following day.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Train and prepare for the N2 Challenge with Volta Pro Tours</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"582\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/volta-pro-tours-07-970x582.jpg\" alt=\"Volta Pro Tours\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/volta-pro-tours-07-970x582.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/volta-pro-tours-07-300x180.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/volta-pro-tours-07-768x461.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/volta-pro-tours-07-750x450.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/volta-pro-tours-07-1140x684.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/volta-pro-tours-07.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Volta Pro Tours</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>To help riders feel fully prepared for the event, Volta Pro Tours has developed a dedicated training programme for the N2 Challenge in partnership with Storey Coaching, which is led by Britain’s most successful Paralympian Dame Sarah Storey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It includes 10 weeks of N2-specific training, with up to eight sessions per week to choose from, a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/n2club\" target=\"_blank\">dedicated Facebook group</a> and tips and advice from the pros.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Preparation is everything when it comes to a big event, and a challenge like the N2 is well worth preparing for,’ says Dame Sarah Storey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘That’s why we created the training programme, which will help your cycling improve week by week, enabling you to arrive in Portugal excited to ride the entire length of the country! Many of the sessions are ones that I ride myself so rest assured, they are tried and tested.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Are you ready for the ride of a lifetime?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dates for N2 Challenge 2024 are 9-15th June, 17-23rd June, 1-7th September and 9-15th September.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information on the Volta N2 Challenge and to sign up, <a href=\"https://voltaprotours.com/N2.html\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/volta-pro-tours-n2-challenge\">Ride the length of Portugal on the N2 Challenge with Volta Pro Tours</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Martin James","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"5a0eb3eea81f4245375ff74713af44336b2dd27c2e5b9587c27e11177c88edc0","category":"Cycling"}
