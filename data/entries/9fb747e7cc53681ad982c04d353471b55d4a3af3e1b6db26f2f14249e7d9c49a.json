title=\"Merida onesixty fr\" />                                            <p>Following the impressive launch of the new One-Sixty and One-Forty platforms a year ago, both of which won BikeRadar’s coveted Bike of the Year awards, Merida has unveiled the new One-Sixty FR family of bikes.</p>\n<p>As the FR moniker infers, these are hard-hitting bikes built for park laps and harder-hitting riders looking for a dependable machine to send big jumps and gnarly lines.</p>\n<p>The two models are based on the alloy <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/merida-one-sixty-6000-review/\">One-Sixty</a> frame, but rather than coming stock with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/what-is-a-29er/\">29in wheels</a> front and rear, these are supplied from the factory as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/what-is-faster-mullet-bike-29er/\">mullet bikes</a> (29in front, 27.5in rear wheels), giving 171mm of frame travel.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n

180mm forks for extra front-end bounce.</p>\n<p>The large front wheel is there to give roll-over speed and stability, while the rear is said to aid agility.</p>\n<p>Bikes are built with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/mtb-tyre-carcass-construction/\">tough-casing tyres</a>, four-piston brakes with 220mm rotors at the front and a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/coil-vs-air/\">coil shock</a> at the rear.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n

kit tends to be fit-and-forget.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Paul Box / Merida</i></span></div>\n<p>Merida has prioritised spending the money on key items, such as suspension and tyres, rather than fitting a fancy rear derailleur or shaving weight.</p>\n<p>While built on the successful platform of Merida’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-enduro-bikes/\">enduro bike</a>, the One-Sixty FR is shaped for fun, rather than flat-out speed.</p>\n<h2>Merida One-Sixty FR frame details</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Merida FAST suspension\" title=\"Merida onesixty fr FAST suspension\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Merida’s FAST suspension relies on flex-stays.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Paul Box / Merida</i></span></div>\n<p>Merida has targeted riders looking for a pocket-friendly deal, using the alloy version of the One-Sixty frame for this hard-hitting bike.</p>\n<p>The frame uses a flex-stay single-pivot suspension design to dole out the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/how-much-suspension-travel-do-i-need-on-my-mountain-bike/\">171mm of travel</a>. While the frame features a geometry flip chip to enable the use of a 29in wheel at the back (which shortens the travel a touch), Merida reckons the bike is best suited to the smaller wheel.</p>\n<p>If the thought of a 171mm-travel alloy bike relying on flex-stays to operate properly worries you, it shouldn’t. The bike has been tested to Category 5 certification, which is the standard for full-on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-downhill-mountain-bikes/\">downhill bikes</a>. To back it up, there’s a five-year warranty on the frame.</p>\n<p>While we found the One-Sixty in its enduro guise pedalled very well, Merida says the FR version isn’t built to be a racing snake.</p>\n<p>The coil shock, paired with the FAST suspension linkage, is built for performance in the park.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n

shock keeps things smooth out back.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Paul Box / Merida</i></span></div>\n<p>The suspension is designed to be very supple at the start of the stroke, thanks to the linkage and use of a coil shock, for maximum small-bump sensitivity.</p>\n<p>In the middle, the coil shock gives ample support, so lips can be boosted and berms railed without the bike collapsing in the middle.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"TRP Trail Evo

/ Merida</i></span></div>\n<p>When it comes to the bigger hits, the progressive nature of the suspension linkage means the One-Sixty FR shouldn’t struggle to cope.</p>\n<p>Short seat tubes are paired with longer reaches, so riders should have the pick of a range of frame sizes to suit their preference – longer for speed, shorter for tricks.</p>\n<p>The dropper post, with travel adjustable up to 230mm, means taller riders shouldn’t struggle to get the saddle out of the way.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n

near the bottom bracket to help guide cables through the frame, an integrated chain keeper, headset-routed cables and a heat-sink rear brake mount to keep things cool.</p>\n<h2>Merida One-Sixty FR geometry</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Bearing cover on

<i>Paul Box / Merida</i></span></div>\n<p>Merida went big with the launch of the One-Sixty last year, with geometry that is as modern as it comes – long reaches, slack head angles, super-steep seat angles and properly short seat tube lengths.</p>\n<p>This was dubbed ‘AGILOMETER’ sizing, enabling riders to pick handling characteristics via bike length, independent of how long their legs are.</p>\n<p>With the One-Sixty FR sharing the same alloy frame, it’s no surprise that the geometry figures are similar, though with an extra 10mm travel up front, the front end is a touch higher, the reaches slightly shorter and the head and seat angles marginally slacker.</p>\n<div>\n                <table>\n                <colgroup>\n                            <col></col>\n

For sure, on a race rig I’d go for big wheels front and rear, but I like how mullets corner, and there’s something comforting about a more compact-feeling rear end.</p>\n<p> </p>","author":"Tom Marvin","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"9fb747e7cc53681ad982c04d353471b55d4a3af3e1b6db26f2f14249e7d9c49a","category":"Cycling"}
