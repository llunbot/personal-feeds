My colleague and Google Analytics whizz Karen Haslam was able to interrogate the logs to glean further insights: namely, that the visitor was using a device with the resolution 390×844 (likely an iPhone 12/13/14 or 13 Pro), and that the visitor was based in Sunnyvale, which is where <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://apple.fandom.com/wiki/Wolfe_Campus&amp;xcust=1-1-2125513-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Campus 3</a> is located. Case closed!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>iOS 17.1.1 is likely to focus on bug fixes and security updates rather than new iPhone features. We can’t be sure which bugs Apple will try to tackle, though the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2104482/iphone-shutting-down-overnight-ios-17-0-3-update.html\">random shutdown issue</a>, which wasn’t fixed with iOS 17.1, may be high on the list. The update could arrive as early as next week alongside the new M3 MacBook Pros and iMac.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2117707/ios-17-2-beta-is-out-now-and-includes-the-journal-app.html\">iOS 17.2</a>, meanwhile, is slated to include the Journal app and other significant changes and new features. That version is already available in beta, but probably won’t come out until December.</p>\n\niOS</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"9830eb45f6af875888507826aa101a5c930a5fd229a0feeb6b010c76b3c054f1","category":"Apple"}
