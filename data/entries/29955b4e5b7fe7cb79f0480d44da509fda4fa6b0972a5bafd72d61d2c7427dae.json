Previously Wahoo has focussed its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/beginners-guide-to-indoor-training-all-you-need-to-get-started/\">indoor cycling</a> efforts on hardware, with the Kickr series.</p>\n<p>According to Wahoo, SYSTM is ‘the most comprehensive training app available’. The Sufferfest will migrate to Wahoo SYSTM, with existing Sufferfest subscribers being automatically enrolled with the new app.</p>\n<p>Rather than going down the virtual world route, and competing with the likes of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/zwift-your-complete-guide/\">Zwift</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/rgt-cycling-guide/\">RGT Cycling</a>, SYSTM focuses on helping you to build and follow a training plan, alongside a large library of workouts and content.</p>\n<p>Aimed at time-crunched athletes, SYSTM uses Wahoo’s proprietary <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/ftp-is-dead-the-sufferfest-claims-and-launches-4dp-training/\">Four Dimensional Power (4DP)</a> profile (a kind of advanced <a

Threshold Power</a> profile, more akin to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/critical-power/\">Critical Power</a>) to help tailor training plans and workouts to your individual fitness, strengths and weaknesses.</p>\n<div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img

workout library’.</p>\n<p>SYSTM also has an ‘intuitive training plan builder’, which enables users to customise training plans to suit their own goals and fitness level.</p>\n<p>Wahoo is also keen to stress that, ‘every workout and training plan has been designed by The Wahoo Sports Science Division’, led by professional coach Neal Henderson.</p>\n<p>On top of this, a key selling point of SYSTM is the wide variety of content types it brings together.</p>\n<p>Alongside content ported over from The Sufferfest, SYSTM’s library will also include the following content categories at launch:</p>\n<ul><li><strong>On Location:</strong> Sessions set to ride videos of iconic cycling routes.</li>\n<li><strong>ProRides:</strong> Race simulations that combine first-person camera footage and race data from elite riders, scaled to your fitness level using the 4DP profile.</li>\n<li><strong>A Week With:</strong> Users follow a Wahoo-sponsored professional athlete for a week, doing the same training sessions as them and getting a glimpse ‘behind the scenes’, to see how they live and train.</li>\n<li><strong>Inspiration:</strong> Endurance and recovery workouts set to classic cycling films and documentaries, such as A Sunday In Hell and Outskirts.</li>\n</ul><div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img
