There are three options to choose from, including \"It shows my personal info,\" \"I have a legal removal request,\" and \"It's outdated and I want to request a refresh.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe first option allows users to request the removal of information like phone number, email address, home address, credit card numbers, login credentials, and more, and if selected, Google will review the request and possibly remove the result.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe second option is for content that violates Google's product policies, while the third refreshes search results if a page has been updated.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGoogle has a dedicated \"Results about you\" feature that has been refreshed as well. It scans for search results that include information like phone number or address, and provides tools for removing those results.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/\">Google</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/26/google-remove-info-search-results/\">Google Makes It Easier to Remove Personal Info From Search Results</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-makes-it-easier-to-remove-personal-info-from-search-results.2450251/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d9eace35ee08e31cb160539ecc9655ec3f34d3ef2cbc8fb484108c827337785d","category":"Apple"}
