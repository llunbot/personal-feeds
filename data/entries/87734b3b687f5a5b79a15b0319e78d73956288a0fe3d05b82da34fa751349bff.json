Do they prefer long open roads instead of endless rock gardens? Well, our experts compiled a list of the coolest gear for the road cyclist on your holiday list this season. We have gifts ideas ranging from $25 stocking stuffers to the max — helping you dial in exactly the right gear for your budget and riders’ needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best Road Cycling Gifts Under $25</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/best-gifts-for-road-cyclists-under-25-dollars-2-copy.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/best-gifts-for-road-cyclists-under-25-dollars-2-copy-800x569.jpg\" alt=\"The Best Gifts for Road Cyclists\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/best-gifts-for-road-cyclists-under-25-dollars-2-copy-800x569.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/best-gifts-for-road-cyclists-under-25-dollars-2-copy-297x211.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/best-gifts-for-road-cyclists-under-25-dollars-2-copy-120x85.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/best-gifts-for-road-cyclists-under-25-dollars-2-copy-768x546.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/best-gifts-for-road-cyclists-under-25-dollars-2-copy.jpg 1212w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that tubeless tires are firmly in the road mainstream, there is no better time to start your switch over to a tubeless system (here’s <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021/08/12/best-road-bike-tires/\" target=\"_blank\">our favorite road tubeless tires</a>). To take the mess out of the job, check out the <strong>Park Tool TSI-1 Tubeless Sealant Injector </strong>($26, available at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikingroadiegg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fpark-tool-tsi-1-tubeless-sealant-injector\">Competitive Cyclist</a>). It will keep your floor free of goop, plus, when swapping tires, it’ll suck the sealant out so you can inject it into your new tires, saving time and money. It’s perfect for gravel and cyclocross, too, where you’re changing tires more often based on conditions!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seems like the colder it gets, the wetter it gets, but an <strong>Ass-Saver Mudguard </strong>($13, available at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09SBHHSHH/?tag=brbgoutdoorbikingroadiegg-20\">Amazon)</a> is a cheap fix for keeping your bum dry. These plastic easy-to-stow fenders are the perfect answer to surprise wet days and only take a second to install. Ass-Saver guards come in many sizes, graphics, and configurations — plus, they make off-road models, which are great for the mountain biker on your list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>Over the winter months, bikes take a beating. Whether that be outside in the mud or indoors on the trainer. Muc-Off has unique and effective solutions for both. The <strong>Muc-Off detail brush</strong> ($9.50 at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikingroadiegg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fmuc-off-detailing-brush\">Competitive Cyclist</a>) is perfect for getting in all the tight spaces for the outside base-miler. The simple design will make you feel like a World Tour wrench. For the cyclist spending more time on the trainer, we recommend Muc-Offs indoor line of cleaners and sweat protectants. The Sweat Protect spray is a personal favorite. It acts as a coating to remove sweat from top caps, bars, and tubes. It also doubles as an anti-mud spray for cyclocross racers. </span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>If you’re looking for stocking stuffers for you’re road cyclist, nothing is better than in-ride nutrition. Since they will be in the racing off-season (most likely), it’s the perfect time to mix up on the bike fueling. The team over at Maurten has fantastic solutions for the goal-driven and number-obsessed. The <strong>Maurten 160 drink</strong> ($2.50 at <a href=\"https://thefeed.com/products/maurten?variant=44976484168&amp;queryID=187ea76bdcc92861ed77f8a9eca6e8cb\">The Feed</a>) and <strong>160 gel</strong> ($5.40 at <a href=\"https://thefeed.com/products/maurten-gel-160?variant=40160118603839&amp;queryID=8e4e663fcfa5c4e282820c113318e9cf\">The Feed</a>) is one of our staples for race day. It is a hydrogel – a biopolymer matrix that holds carbohydrates. The hydrogel technology enables a smoother transportation of carbohydrates through the stomach to the intestine, where the carbohydrates are absorbed. The gel (and drink) have no flavor, just what you need to keep rolling. Plus — riders report nearly zero GI issues on the Maurten products. </span></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best Road Cycling Gifts Under $50</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2000\" height=\"875\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/best-gifts-for-road-cyclists-under-50-dollars-copy.jpg\" alt=\"The Best Gifts for Road Cyclists\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/best-gifts-for-road-cyclists-under-50-dollars-copy.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/best-gifts-for-road-cyclists-under-50-dollars-copy-297x130.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/best-gifts-for-road-cyclists-under-50-dollars-copy-800x350.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/best-gifts-for-road-cyclists-under-50-dollars-copy-120x53.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/best-gifts-for-road-cyclists-under-50-dollars-copy-768x336.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/best-gifts-for-road-cyclists-under-50-dollars-copy-1536x672.jpg 1536w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><span><strong>CADEX Race bar tape</strong> ($50 at <a href=\"https://www.cadex-cycling.com/us/cadex-race-handlebar-tape\">Cadex Cycling</a>) is an excellent stocking stuffer for the road cyclists on your list. The tacky tape has a slight (3mm) padding, rounding off-road chatter. We like it for the looks and the longevity. It’s a tremendous all-weather bar tape that keeps its tacky feel long after many washes. The CADEX alloy barends offer a touch of extra panache that’s subtle enough not to overpower your bike’s style. </span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>Whether rolling tubeless or not, cyclists can always use a tube. Bonus points if the tube is easy to pack and weighs nothing. That’s where the <strong>Tubolito S-Tubo Road Tube</strong> ($38 at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikingroadiegg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F158094%2Ftubolito-s-tubo-road-tube-700-x-18-28%3Fcolor%3DORANGE\">REI</a>) comes in. These groundbreaking, lightweight orange tubes are easy to stash in any pocket and weigh less than some gels. Though nearly triple the price of a conventional tube, they are highly convenient and super durable. So, if you’re looking for something practical and super technical for your roadie — this is it. </span></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone needs a dependable water bottle, not just cyclists, and we love this super cool metal bottle from <strong>BIVO </strong>($34-$39, available at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikingroadiegg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fbivo-bivo-one-21oz-non-insulated-bottle\">Competitive Cyclist</a>). Its made from metal and designed by a NASA scientist to get the most flow by simply tipping the bottle over, no squeezing needed. The metal construction keeps the inside smell and taste-free, plus it won’t warp in the dishwasher — perfect for anyone on your list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>Mutiltools are something every cyclist needs; indeed, we can never have enough. <strong>Craigs Tool</strong> $60 at <a href=\"https://www.fairwheelbikes.com/craigs-tool.html\">Fair Wheel Bikes</a>) is just the right mix of lightweight, portability, and functionality. The unique design lets users swap out bits in a multi-use hex-key package. The tool has a magnetic end to keep the bits in place and an Etra tire plug tool for fixing punctures. Plus, it works in tandem with the Wove bike saddles. </span></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a very particular rider to buy for, we suggest the <strong>Defeet Print-My-Sock </strong>($29, available at <a href=\"https://defeet.com/pages/printmysock\" target=\"_blank\">Defeet</a>) as a super cool custom gift that’s sure to make them smile. Super-sock-makers Defeet has a program where you can design your custom pattern sock, and they’ll make it and ship it to you all in about a week’s turnaround — sweet!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best Gifts for Road Cyclists Under $100</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BR-Holiday-Gift-Guide-for-the-Cyclist3-1-copy-scaled.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BR-Holiday-Gift-Guide-for-the-Cyclist3-1-copy-800x440.jpg\" alt=\"The Best Gifts for Road Cyclists\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BR-Holiday-Gift-Guide-for-the-Cyclist3-1-copy-800x440.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BR-Holiday-Gift-Guide-for-the-Cyclist3-1-copy-297x163.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BR-Holiday-Gift-Guide-for-the-Cyclist3-1-copy-120x66.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BR-Holiday-Gift-Guide-for-the-Cyclist3-1-copy-768x422.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BR-Holiday-Gift-Guide-for-the-Cyclist3-1-copy-1536x844.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BR-Holiday-Gift-Guide-for-the-Cyclist3-1-copy-2048x1126.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><span>If you watched any World Tour road racing this year, you’ve heard of Soduim-Bicarbinate and its “game changer” for ride fueling and lactate buffering. Using Bi-carb to fuel race effort is nothing new, but the vehicle the Maetun uses to transport the bi-carb is.<strong> Maurten Bicarb</strong> ($65 at <a href=\"https://thefeed.com/maurten-sodium-bicarb?variant=40097301790783&amp;queryID=9905bd3ddfa5456b68952fcd47e41bdc\">The Feed</a>) employs its Hydrogel formula to help keep the bicarb “captured” until it’s time to race or train. The idea is excellent, and lots of riders enjoy the benefit. We’re not telling you this will help you set a new PR, but it could give you the edge on race day. Plus — there is no better gift to a road cyclist than the possibility of marginal gains. </span></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Winter brings colder weather (duh) and less daylight, so if your rider frequents the dusk hours riding home, we suggest the <strong>K-EDGE Max XL Combo Mount </strong>($70). The mount works excellent as a stand-alone computer mount with Garmin (at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08ZLX728B/?tag=brbgoutdoorroadiegg-20\">Amazon</a>) and Wahoo (at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikingroadiegg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fk-edge-max-xl-handlebar-combo-mount-for-wahoo\">Competitive Cyclist</a>) versions available, which makes them compatible with most other computer brands, too). Its secret is its extra strength that supports the extra weight of a light (or action camera), providing rock-solid stability and putting the light further forward in a more visible (and aero) location.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dropping temperatures mean cold toes, and cold toes are no fun when riding. If you’re looking to keep those digits warm this winter and put in the big base miles, the<strong> Endura Freezing Point Overshoe</strong> ($75, available at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikingroadiegg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fendura-freezing-point-ii-overshoe\">Competitive Cyclist</a>) is a must-have. The construction is top-notch, and the seams won’t rip if you decide to take them off-road. The off-set rear zipper is clutch and keeps the stiff zipper material away from the flex point behind your ankle, reducing the chance of it digging in. Plus —it’s super easy to zip up with thick winter gloves.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best Road Cycling Gifts Under $250</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BR-Holiday-Gift-Guide-for-the-Cyclist9-copy-scaled.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"618\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BR-Holiday-Gift-Guide-for-the-Cyclist9-copy-800x618.jpg\" alt=\"The Best Gifts for Road Cyclists\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BR-Holiday-Gift-Guide-for-the-Cyclist9-copy-800x618.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BR-Holiday-Gift-Guide-for-the-Cyclist9-copy-297x230.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BR-Holiday-Gift-Guide-for-the-Cyclist9-copy-120x93.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BR-Holiday-Gift-Guide-for-the-Cyclist9-copy-768x593.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BR-Holiday-Gift-Guide-for-the-Cyclist9-copy-1536x1187.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BR-Holiday-Gift-Guide-for-the-Cyclist9-copy-2048x1583.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><span>If you’re training before the sun comes up or after it goes down, a good light can be your best riding partner. The <strong>Outbound Detour Road/Commuter Light</strong> ($185 at <a href=\"https://www.outboundlighting.com/products/detour\">Outbound Lighting</a>) is enough to alert cars that you’re on the road and excellent to see the road (or trail) ahead. The Detour is lightweight (150g for the light and 36g for the mount) and boasts a 1200-lumen output. So, if you want to brighten up your training this season, get a light you can depend on, like the Outbound Detour.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it gets cold, the first appendages to get walloped are the fingers and toes. An excellent way to ensure long comfortable rides in the winter is to start with quality gear. The <strong>45 NRTH Stermfist 4 gloves</strong> ($140, available at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikingroadiegg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2F45nrth-sturmfist-4-finger-glove-mens\">Competitive Cyclist</a>) are the warmest we’ve tested. Super durable construction, easily washable, and beyond all — mega-warm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re looking for a gift that keeps on giving but a cycling twist — check out the coffee subscriptions from <strong><a href=\"https://www.grimpeurbros.com/collections/subscription-plans\" target=\"_blank\">GRIMPEUR’S Coffee</a></strong>. If you buy a “supporters blend,” a portion of the sales goes directly to help specific athletes — like the <a href=\"https://amydfoundation.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Amy D Foundation</a>. Plus, the coffee is top-notch— a great way to keep warm and motivated during the winter months. (<em>Check our <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021/10/31/cycling-holiday-gift-guide/\" target=\"_blank\">other cycling gift guide</a> for a great </em>and quiet<em> way to grind those beans!</em>)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Who doesn’t appreciate recovery devices? Cyclists sure do, and what better than a recovery tool that’s portable? The <strong>Hyperice Hypervolt GO 2 Mini Percussion Massager</strong> ($129, available at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikingroadiegg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F215949%2Fhyperice-hypervolt-go-2-massager%3Fcolor%3DARCTIC%2520GRAY\">REI</a>) is just enough to loosen sore muscles before a ride or recover after. The super small size packs a punch and is excellent for on the go whether you’re riding or racing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll notice a trend of recovery on this list, and that’s because winter is a great time to recharge the batteries and prep for the next season. The <strong>Roll Recovery R8</strong> ($140, available at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikingroadiegg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Froll-recovery-r8-roller\">Backcountry</a>) is a great companion to start a daily recovery routine. No batteries are required and manually operated, this leg roller is one you have to experience to truly appreciate the benefits. A great pre/post-ride tool and will fit easily in your gear bag.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best Gifts for Road Cyclists at $250+</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/BR-Holiday-Gift-Guide-for-the-Cyclist4-e1669046814936.jpg\" alt=\"The Best Gifts for Road Cyclists\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"847\" height=\"481\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ZWIFT.png\" alt=\"The Best Gifts for Road Cyclists\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ZWIFT.png 847w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ZWIFT-297x169.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ZWIFT-800x454.png 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ZWIFT-120x68.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ZWIFT-768x436.png 768w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re looking to get something that your cyclist can use on and off the bike, the <strong>Patagonia Sweater Hoodie </strong>($329, available at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikingroadiegg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F208593%2Fpatagonia-down-sweater-hoodie-mens%3Fcm_mmc%3Daff_AL-_-5889-_-293233-_-NA%26avad%3D293233_b34a185fd\">REI</a>) is a fantastic option.

The combo is waterproof where it matters (front, with a splash pad on the rear) and supremely comfortable, this gear will last you many winters to come. The premium Thermo-Roubaix fabric is super soft and sets the standard for comfort and warmth in cycling clothing — highly recommended.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>Wahoo ELEMNT ROAM</strong> ($400, available at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikingroadiegg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F195825%2Fwahoo-fitness-elemnt-roam-gps-cycling-computer%3Fcolor%3DBLACK\">REI</a>) is perfect for the Roadie who loves the numbers and guidance of a larger screen.
