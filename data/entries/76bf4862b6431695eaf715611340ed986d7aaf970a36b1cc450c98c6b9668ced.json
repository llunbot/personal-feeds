It will allegedly take over these existing functions in addition to powering the solid-state buttons, including the \"action\" button that replaces the mute switch.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe source also claims that the feature is currently being tested with and without Taptic Engine feedback while powered off, but not while the battery is dead. \"Whether this tidbit makes it to production or not is highly uncertain but IS being tested,\" they added.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe source also claims that their \"man inside\" Apple has seen two functional versions of the rumored new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/20/iphone-15-volume-mute-buttons-cad/\">unified volume button</a> in testing, including one where the volume goes up/down faster depending on the amount of force used when pressed, and another where the volume can be adjusted by swiping up and down on the button with a finger. They do not know which method will be adopted for the final release, but they are enabled by software, so this functionality may well be user-customizable.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe anonymous tipster claims that their inside source is on the Apple development team, so they do not have additional information about the design of the new models unless the physical features require software development to complement them.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe rumored solid-state capacitive buttons are expected to be exclusive to the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ models, with the standard <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> models retaining the same traditional button mechanism as on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a> series. The ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ is also rumored to be gaining a software-customizable button in lieu of the mute switch, with a unified volume button or \"rocker\" replacing the separate up/down volume buttons.
