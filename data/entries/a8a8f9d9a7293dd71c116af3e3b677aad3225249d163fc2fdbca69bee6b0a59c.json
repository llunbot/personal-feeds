Apparently, those skeptics included some of the people at the Times itself.</p>\n<p>At a presentation at the Game Developers Conference Thursday, Times game producer and industry veteran Zoe Bell said the new owners expected <em>Wordle</em>'s daily users \"would just immediately decline\" after the acquisition. Partly that was out of fear that some players would recoil from the \"huge corporate behemoth\" that now owned the indie hit. But it was also a simple recognition of the usual cycle for viral \"zeitgeist\" games: \"How long can exponential growth go on?\"</p>\n<p>Just over a year after the acquisition, though, Bell said the company's efforts at \"preserving <em>Wordle</em> as an Internet treasure\" have paid off. That's thanks in large part to a patient, \"first do no harm\" strategy that didn't seek to directly monetize the game or introduce a lot of half-baked changes to the game's successful formula, she said.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1926522#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1926522&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a8a8f9d9a7293dd71c116af3e3b677aad3225249d163fc2fdbca69bee6b0a59c","category":"Tech"}
