Many include exact recreations of famous routes, which mimic everything from gradient to road signs, as well as offering drafting, cornering, varying road surface and even the prospect of collisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They allow us to train for specific events or experience iconic routes without having to get on a plane and several apps also host races, with prizes from upgrades to hard cash up for grabs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These apps can connect to the latest generation of smart trainers and work across multiple platforms, making the experience more authentic and enjoyable than ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there are now more to choose from than ever, so here’s <em>Cyclist</em>’s guide to ten digital destinations to help you find the kind of indoor-training environment you’re looking for.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apps in this guide: </h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Zwift</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Bkool</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wahoo X (SYSTM) </li>\n\n\n\n<li>TrainerRoad</li>\n\n\n\n<li>FulGaz</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Rouvy </li>\n\n\n\n<li>GoldenCheetah</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Kinomap</li>\n\n\n\n<li>VirtuPro</li>\n\n\n\n<li>MyWhoosh</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>10 of the best cycling training apps</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Zwift</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/virtual_training_apps_08_zwift-970x520.jpg\" alt /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Cross The Sims with cycling and you have Zwift, except instead of building cool houses your avatar rides bicycles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Created in 2014, Zwift is synonymous with the gamification of cycling and features avatars, racing, socialising and live events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The platform offers ten different virtual worlds, but only Zwift’s very own virtual world, Watopia, is always open. It includes its turn-by-turn modelling of the Alpe d’Huez climb. Zwift rotates what it calls ‘guest worlds’ on a monthly schedule, which is ideal for anyone who gets bored of riding similar routes. There are also two event-only world maps, Bologna and Crit City, which can only be accessed via races.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users can ‘just ride’, enter a scheduled group ride or follow their own workout programme. Zwift also offers a lot of racing opportunities for individuals, teams and elites, and there is the Zwift Academy for those who fancy turning pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/453167-tsoz_pr_group_workouts_02-3845f7-original-1670264675-970x546.jpg\" alt /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want something more structured, you can enter one of the many group rides scheduled daily, or follow your own workout programme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like Microsoft’s Flight Simulator, the graphics of Zwift aren’t quite Hollywood CGI, but they are very engaging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Saddle time is rewarded with XP points, which allow you to upgrade kit and equipment and adds an extra level of interest and possibly motivation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With thousands of riders Zwifting at any one time, you are unlikely to ever be on your own for a ride, further increasing engagement with the app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, Zwift offers a seamless and engaging virtual experience. And for anyone with a place in RideLondon, you can train on the slopes of a virtual Box Hill and hone your sprint finish down the Mall too!</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> iOS/Mac/Windows</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cost:</strong> £12.99/month, 14-day free trial </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Find out more:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.zwift.com\" target=\"_blank\">zwift.com</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. BKool </h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/virtual_training_apps_01_bkool-970x546.jpg\" alt /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A user-led app, Bkool is all about real-life routes rather than unique worlds. There are lots of classic routes to choose from, such as Mont Ventoux, parts of Paris-Roubaix and the Vuelta as well as the 2022 Giro d’Italia. Similar to FulGaz, users can also upload their own and explore other members’ favourite routes all around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are three different views of footage when riding, or you can switch from the real world (where you feel like you are riding in the outdoors with other riders) to a fictional world that plonks your avatar in the centre. There is also a map view for those who prefer zero distractions except for an arrow on a map.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wind and drafting also feature, affecting your turbo’s resistance to help mimic the real world and the app has a competitive angle too, with leagues and multiplayer challenges on offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The real-world rides are challenging and engaging, particularly in the 3D virtual renderings when fellow competitors keep you company and crowds cheer you on.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/giv-03-970x546.png\" alt /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The velodrome sessions add another extra element of fun, allowing you to compete against other riders in a pursuit or kilo <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/sa-calobra-time-trial\">time-trial</a>, with the only limitation being the number of other users online when you want to ride. There are also structured video workout classes with motivating instructors. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Platform:</strong> iOS/Android/Mac/Windows</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cost:</strong> £9/month, 30-day free trial</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Find out more:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.bkool.com\" target=\"_blank\">bkool.com</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Wahoo X</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/02165221/wahoo_systm_homepage_-970x534.png\" alt=\"wahoo_systm_homepage_\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Wahoo X is Wahoo’s membership program for Wahoo SYSTM. It used to include RGT Cycling, the brand’s virtual cycling platform but this got the kick in October 2023 so there is currently no virtual riding world, like in Zwift and Rouvy, on offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SYSTM, formerly known as The Sufferfest, offers plenty of workouts and plans to choose from, as well as options to watch cycling-focussed films and documentaries during recovery rides. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The platform is a cycling-centric, performance-driven fitness app which has an impressive choice of cycling workouts, as well as swimming, running, strength, yoga and mental training sessions.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/02165215/wahoo_systm_4dp-970x534.png\" alt=\"wahoo_systm_4dp\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Released in September 2021, one of the most notable features of the app is SYSTM’s unique fitness test called the 4DP, which really makes this training app stand out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 4DP (four-dimensional power) test uses four key performance metrics: Neuromuscular Power (NM), Maximal Aerobic Power (MAP), Functional Threshold Power (FTP) and Anaerobic Capacity (AC).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users are encouraged to do this test from the start. You can’t define progress until you know where you are starting from, and that is exactly what the 4DP test does. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"582\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/05200518/wahoo_systm_mac_plans_builder-970x582.png\" alt=\"wahoo_systm_mac_plans_builder\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/05200518/wahoo_systm_mac_plans_builder-970x582.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/05200518/wahoo_systm_mac_plans_builder-300x180.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/05200518/wahoo_systm_mac_plans_builder-768x461.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/05200518/wahoo_systm_mac_plans_builder-750x450.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/05200518/wahoo_systm_mac_plans_builder-1140x684.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/05200518/wahoo_systm_mac_plans_builder.png 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The training plans are easy to follow, customisable and cover all key areas. Workouts are split into channels, ranging from indoor sessions with GCN, workouts from The Sufferfest (which Wahoo incorporated in 2019) and Pro Rides, to name but a few.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can ‘spend a week with’ the legendary Ian Boswell and learn not just about grit and determination, but also what he has for breakfast.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/02165228/wahoo_systm_filters-970x534.png\" alt=\"wahoo_systm_filters\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Every workout is peppered with encouraging words, whether that be from the instructor willing you to push harder or words popping up on the screen telling you how great you are. SYSTM is also features running, yoga, strength, swimming and mindfulness sessions, that you can get an all-round workout.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Wahoo X details </h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/wahoo-systm-review\" target=\"_blank\">Wahoo SYSTM review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> iOS/Mac/Windows/Android</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cost:</strong> £13/month, £122/year</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Find out more:</strong> <a href=\"https://uk.wahoofitness.com/systm\" target=\"_blank\">Wahoo</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><span>4.

Don’t get us wrong, no-nonsense is not a euphemism for poor quality or lacking in features – quite the opposite.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TrainerRoad is a well thought-out and easy-to-use app with industry-leading features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It focusses on delivering high-quality training sessions and doesn’t require you to have a degree in sports science to use it – simply choose your discipline, development area and volume to arrive at your multi-week training plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The PowerMatch feature does an excellent job of working with your bike’s power meter to control the resistance of your smart trainer, making indoor sessions comparable with those completed outdoors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Built-in trainer and power meter calibration is another feature that shows the developers at TrainerRoad are serious about accuracy.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> iOS/Android/Mac/Windows</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cost:</strong> $19.95/month, $189/year, 30 day free trial </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Find out more:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.trainerroad.com\" target=\"_blank\">trainerroad.com</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. FulGaz</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/screen_shot_2022-05-05_at_12.38.53_pm-970x606.png\" alt /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>FulGaz is powered by user-generated content with the aim of offering a real-world feeling to riding. It features more than 1,500 real routes from over 40 countries and includes events such as Haute Route, Ironman and Chase the Sun. This makes the platform useful if you are training specifically for those events as you can ride the actual routes without having to make the trip there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of the rides are shot on a GoPro in 4K resolution, and you can trim a route to train for a specific part of it. Unlike competitors such as Rouvy and Zwift, FulGaz doesn’t have avatars and does not have a gamified feeling.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/virtual_training_apps_02_fulgaz-970x449.jpg\" alt /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>FulGaz offers a limited number of workouts, as well as specific programs built for core focus areas such as improving FTP and climbing. There aren’t as many workouts as on Rouvy for example, but the platform allows you to upload your own workouts from TrainingPeaks or elsewhere</p>\n\n\n\n<p>FulGaz has three riding modes. With ‘steady’, the footage plays at the same speed the ride was filmed at; with ‘reactive’, it plays dependent on the amount of power the user produces, and ‘challenge’ mode lets the rider race against a previous effort – theirs or someone else’s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>FulGaz doesn’t organise races but riders can arrange group rides. The app also features coaching and a virtual training partner that can be geared towards a specific event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The platform says it will be adding chat to the app soon, and also allows users to download rides to do offline which is another nice feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/fulgaz-indoor-training-app-review\" target=\"_blank\">full review of FulGaz</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> iOS/Android/Windows/Mac</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cost:</strong> £9.99/month, £85.99/year, 14-day free trial</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Find out more: </strong><a href=\"http://www.fulgaz.com\" target=\"_blank\">fulgaz.com</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>6. Rouvy</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/virtual_training_apps_05_rouvy-970x544.jpg\" alt /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the developers behind Rouvy, the name is enshrined in cycling legend, being the nickname of a wild sheep-like animal ridden by a court jester up the steep hills of Central Europe that was supposedly the inspiration for the first bicycle. Or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Legends aside, Rouvy combines the real and the virtual. Routes and workouts feature videos of roads around the world – think cycling over San Francisco’s Golden Gate Bridge, through Ha Long Bay in Vietnam or taking in the rolling Lavender fields of Provence. Rouvy augments this footage by adding a user’s avatar so that it feels like you are really riding these roads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The platform currently features more than 300 augmented reality routes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where Rouvy really excels are the real-world cycling routes on offer. There are plenty of heart-pumping climbs including the Passo Sella, Alpe d’Huez, the Tourmalet, the Passo Gavia – the list is rather extensive.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/kopie_souboru_kopie_souboru_svs_on_rouvy_7-970x544.png\" alt /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Rouvy also lets users add ghost riders (robot riders for company) to their ride so they don’t ever have to ride alone, and offers virtual training camps plus structured and custom workouts. You can add up to 10 ghost riders and also see other Rouvy users who are on the same course. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can download videos for working out offline and Rouvy has some gamified elements. Riders can collect virtual coins, upgrade equipment and compete for Strava Live segments. There are racing series and time-trials, and in principle prize money could be on offer. Currently Rouvy does not have any races with prize money but in some races or challenges, when participants finish, they are automatically included in a draw for Rouvy kit, or prizes from partner brands including the likes of Santini, Zycle and others. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re using TrainingPeaks, you can pull your workouts from there which is a nice touch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rouvy now offers subscription packages for multiple riders. The DUO package, for two riders, costs $19.99 (£16), and the Group subscription package, for up to five riders, costs $32.99 (£27). Both subscriptions offer substantial savings over an individual membership.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/rouvy-review\" target=\"_blank\">full review of Rouvy</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> iOS/Android/Windows/Mac</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cost:</strong> £10.50-13/month, Duo/Group subscriptions available, 14-day free trial </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Find out more:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.rouvy.com\" target=\"_blank\">rouvy.com</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Exclusive offer for Cyclist readers: Use code CYCLIST1PLUS! at checkout to get 50% off for two months.

GoldenCheetah</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/02165251/best_cycling_training_apps_7_goldencheetah-970x622.jpg\" alt=\"best_cycling_training_apps_7_goldencheetah\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The fastest land-based animal may not be a realistic target, but GoldenCheetah should help you become a faster cyclist without costing a penny. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A pioneer of open source ride data analysis, GoldenCheetah is freely available. It is similar to TrainerRoad in its aesthetics and approach. There is no virtual world. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It isn’t as polished as others nor as easy to use, but still offers analysis tools to satisfy even the geekiest rider.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is straightforward to make your own workouts, so if you have a selection of your own pre-made workouts these can be input and used in ERG mode with your smart trainer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not for the faint-hearted, but if you’re used to following paper training plans and already make use of the analysis tools, GoldenCheetah, could prove a very cost-effective solution. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Platforms:</strong> Mac/Windows/Linux</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cost:</strong> Free</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Find out more:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.goldencheetah.org\" target=\"_blank\">goldencheetah.org</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/best-turbo-trainer-workouts-to-improve-your-cycling\">Best turbo trainer workouts and sessions to improve your cycling</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/zwift-top-tips-on-how-to-make-the-most-of-the-virtual-app\">Zwift: How to get set up and how to make the most of the virtual app</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/the-best-turbo-trainers-a-buyers-guide\">Best smart turbo trainers: Top Zwift compatible indoor trainers</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h3>8. VirtuPro </h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/virtual_training_apps_06_virtupro-970x546.jpg\" alt /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>VirtuPro is a racing game that relies heavily on artificial intelligence (AI) to augment the experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In every race 150-180 riders take part, and in multiplayer mode users always have seven teammates, whether real or AI riders, so no one rides alone. These AI riders react to how other users ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone has their own avatar and riders can participate in multistage races, whereby they can ride for the yellow jersey and race to protect it with their teammates throughout the race.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/virtupro_img_025-970x546.png\" alt /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Drafting, collisions, steering functionality and natural environment simulation such as wind and cobblestones all feature, along with cheering spectators and a team communication function that lets users send commands to teammates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are currently 46 courses, with more on the way as well as a mobile app called Sidekick.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong> Platforms</strong>: iOS/Windows/Android</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong> Cost:</strong> Free or €6/month</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong> Find out more: </strong><a href=\"https://www.virtuprocycling.com/\" target=\"_blank\">virtuprocycling.com</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>9. Kinomap</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/virtual_training_apps_03_kinomap-970x677.jpg\" alt /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Paris-based Kinomap is powered by user-generated content and focusses on real-life videos from races and routes all over the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, users can ride Tour de France stages, international sportives and even the UCI Track Cycling World Championships.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The platform says it is in talks with other race organisers to expand this feature but if you prefer you can just ride the local routes of other Kinomap users and there are plenty of these to choose from. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/kinomap_scenic_cycling_02-970x678.png\" alt /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Kinomap doesn’t have gamified elements or avatars. It offers one race every Wednesday, and has multiplayer sessions where users can race other people by watching the same video.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Notably the app offers a reward programme for uploading content and, as with FulGaz, users can watch videos at different speeds to align with their riding pace. There are also coaching videos and structured workouts.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Platforms: </strong>iOS/Android/Windows</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong> Cost:</strong> €11.99/month, €89.99/year or €429.99/life, 14-day free trial</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong> Find out more: </strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/ribbles-new-live-in-store-platform-beams-the-store-direct-to-your-home\" target=\"_blank\">kinomap.com</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>10. MyWhoosh</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/virtual_training_apps_04_mywhoosh-970x483.jpg\" alt /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Used by UAE Team Emirates, MyWhoosh has four virtual worlds, two of which showcase routes in Gulf nations including Abu Dhabi and Dubai.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unsurprisingly the platform is mainly focussed on the Arabian Peninsula, but it does also offer routes in Colombia and Australia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The platform is gamified and race-focussed. Each user has their own avatar and can earn points from riding, and there’s real prize money for race winners – individuals and teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The app is also planning to hold race series throughout the year, which will involve the opportunity to earn cash.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/mywhoosh1-970x483.png\" alt /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There are also community features such as group rides and events, as well as training plans and workouts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MyWhoosh costs nothing to use, but there are ads interspersed along routes. Thankfully these are inobtrusive, and are mostly banners or flags attached to virtual streetlamps much in the same way as on a real WorldTour stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Platforms: </strong>iOS/Windows/Android/Mac</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong> Cost:</strong> Free</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong> Find out more: </strong><a href=\"https://mywhoosh.com/\" target=\"_blank\">mywhoosh.com</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Interested in more virtual cycling content?
