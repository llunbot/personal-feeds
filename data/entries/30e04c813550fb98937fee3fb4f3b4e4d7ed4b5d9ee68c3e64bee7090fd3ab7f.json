And soon, you’ll be able to get the same Tocsen tech integrated directly into your Smith helmets. Plus, Aleck also has new Punks that strap onto any helmet, a near-ear wireless audio and communication solution that lets you listen to music and/or talk to other connected riders without losing the ability to hear what’s going on around you…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Aleck Punks near-ear wireless audio and communication</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Aleck-Tocsen-Punks-wireless-near-ear-headphone-and-communication-device.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Aleck-Tocsen-Punks-wireless-near-ear-headphone-and-communication-device.jpg\" alt=\"Aleck Punks near-ear wireless headphones audio and rider-to-rider communication, detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Aleck-Tocsen-Punks-wireless-near-ear-headphone-and-communication-device.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Aleck-Tocsen-Punks-wireless-near-ear-headphone-and-communication-device-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Aleck-Tocsen-Punks-wireless-near-ear-headphone-and-communication-device-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Aleck-Tocsen-Punks-wireless-near-ear-headphone-and-communication-device-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Aleck-Tocsen-Punks-wireless-near-ear-headphone-and-communication-device-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Aleck-Tocsen-Punks-wireless-near-ear-headphone-and-communication-device-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Aleck-Tocsen-Punks-wireless-near-ear-headphone-and-communication-device-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption><em>photos by Cory Benson, c. Bikerumor.com</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The newest bit of tech from Aleck that we uncovered at Eurobike over the weekend are actually not the crash sensors, but these all-new Punks near-ear communicators. Essentially a set of wireless headphones that you attach to your helmet straps, the Punks let you listen to music while riding without blocking out the sounds of the environment around you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or you can use them as rider-to-rider communicators with other cyclists with a set of Punks, thanks to push-to-talk functionality over unlimited distance (they use your paired phone and data network for rider-to-rider communication via the Aleck app).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Aleck-Tocsen-Punks-wireless-near-ear-headphone-and-communication-device_in-detail.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Aleck-Tocsen-Punks-wireless-near-ear-headphone-and-communication-device_in-detail.jpg\" alt=\"Aleck Punks near-ear wireless headphones audio and rider-to-rider communication, detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Aleck-Tocsen-Punks-wireless-near-ear-headphone-and-communication-device_in-detail.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Aleck-Tocsen-Punks-wireless-near-ear-headphone-and-communication-device_in-detail-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Aleck-Tocsen-Punks-wireless-near-ear-headphone-and-communication-device_in-detail-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Aleck-Tocsen-Punks-wireless-near-ear-headphone-and-communication-device_in-detail-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Aleck-Tocsen-Punks-wireless-near-ear-headphone-and-communication-device_in-detail-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Aleck-Tocsen-Punks-wireless-near-ear-headphone-and-communication-device_in-detail-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Aleck-Tocsen-Punks-wireless-near-ear-headphone-and-communication-device_in-detail-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Aleck describes the Punks as the “first near-ear wireless audio and communication system dedicated to cyclists”. They promise “crystal-clear sound” in any outdoor conditions, thanks to “expertly tuned, near-ear drivers and dual wind-blocking mics”. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Punks are available for pre-order now for $150 / 150€ for a single pair (left &amp; right) or $280 / 280€ for two sets – left &amp; right pairs for you and your favorite riding buddy to keep in touch. Global shipping is free, and delivery for pre-orders is slated from early August. A pair of USB-C rechargeable Punks is said to have a 19-hour runtime, with each side weighing just 16g in the 5.7×2.7x1cm box attached to the strap of any open-face helmet.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Aleck Tocsen stick-on crash sensor</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Aleck-Tocsen-Crash-Sensor-on-SMITH-Forefront-2-MIPS-mountain-bike-helmet.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Aleck-Tocsen-Crash-Sensor-on-SMITH-Forefront-2-MIPS-mountain-bike-helmet.jpg\" alt=\"Aleck Tocsen stick-on crash sensor on a Smith Forefront 2 MIPS helmet\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Aleck-Tocsen-Crash-Sensor-on-SMITH-Forefront-2-MIPS-mountain-bike-helmet.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Aleck-Tocsen-Crash-Sensor-on-SMITH-Forefront-2-MIPS-mountain-bike-helmet-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Aleck-Tocsen-Crash-Sensor-on-SMITH-Forefront-2-MIPS-mountain-bike-helmet-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Aleck-Tocsen-Crash-Sensor-on-SMITH-Forefront-2-MIPS-mountain-bike-helmet-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Aleck-Tocsen-Crash-Sensor-on-SMITH-Forefront-2-MIPS-mountain-bike-helmet-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Aleck-Tocsen-Crash-Sensor-on-SMITH-Forefront-2-MIPS-mountain-bike-helmet-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Aleck-Tocsen-Crash-Sensor-on-SMITH-Forefront-2-MIPS-mountain-bike-helmet-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption><em>c. Aleck</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The stick-on $60 / 60€ Tocsen helmet crash sensor isn’t the first gadget of this type –  we covered a similar tiny low-cost solution from <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/cratoni-c-safe-adds-crash-sensor-to-any-helmet-madroc-pro-smart-convertible-full-face-more/\" target=\"_blank\">Cratoni</a> a couple of years back, not to mention the original but more expensive <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/first-aid-communication-devices-backcountry-emergencies/\">IceDot</a> or Specialized helmets with integrated <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wahooangi-helmet-crash-sensor-integration-makes-it-easier-to-get-help-on-a-ride/\">ANGi</a> crash sensors. Even this Tocsen sensor has actually been around on the German market since around 2019, having been bought by US-based outdoor gadgets company Aleck earlier this year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you crash, it first gives you a chance to verify that you are OK, before using your phone to send out your location to preset emergency contacts via SMS/TXT. It also pairs with Aleck/Tocsen’s own Heroes Nearby network, to alert any other user of their free mobile safety app within a 3km/1.8mi radius of the accident. So even if you aren’t riding with someone, if there’s another Tocsen user nearby, they could be your best &amp; fastest first responder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn’t require a subscription to work, and can stick-onto virtually any cycling or snowsports helmet. The tiny Aleck Tocsen crash sensor is also USB-micro rechargeable with 40hr battery life/1.5 month standby, and weighs just 10g.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Aleck + Smith development collaboration</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Aleck-Tocsen-Crash-Sensor-and-Punks-communicators-on-SMITH-helmets_mounts-to-any-helmet.jpg\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Aleck-Tocsen-Crash-Sensor-and-Punks-communicators-on-SMITH-helmets_mounts-to-any-helmet.jpg\" alt=\"Aleck Tocsen crash sensor integration with Smith helmets\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Aleck-Tocsen-Crash-Sensor-and-Punks-communicators-on-SMITH-helmets_mounts-to-any-helmet.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Aleck-Tocsen-Crash-Sensor-and-Punks-communicators-on-SMITH-helmets_mounts-to-any-helmet-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Aleck-Tocsen-Crash-Sensor-and-Punks-communicators-on-SMITH-helmets_mounts-to-any-helmet-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Aleck-Tocsen-Crash-Sensor-and-Punks-communicators-on-SMITH-helmets_mounts-to-any-helmet-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Aleck-Tocsen-Crash-Sensor-and-Punks-communicators-on-SMITH-helmets_mounts-to-any-helmet-768x461.jpg 768w\" /></a><figcaption><em>c.

They’ll be the first helmet brand in North America to include the Tocsen crash sensor tech in 2024. No word yet which helmets will get the new crash sensors, other than a reference to premium Smith helmets, suggesting it could likely include the Mainline full-face &amp; Forefront 2 half-shell mountain bike helmets, plus the all-rounder Trace &amp; aero Ignite aero road helmets?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aleck Tocsen crash sensors are already available in Europe on select Alpina, Ekoi &amp; Uvex helmets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.aleck.io/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Aleck.io</em></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/aleck-tocsen-crash-sensor-punks-make-every-helmet-safer-smith-coming-soon/\">Aleck Punks &amp; Tocsen Crash Sensor Make Every Helmet Safer, Coming Soon to Smith</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"30e04c813550fb98937fee3fb4f3b4e4d7ed4b5d9ee68c3e64bee7090fd3ab7f","category":"Cycling"}
