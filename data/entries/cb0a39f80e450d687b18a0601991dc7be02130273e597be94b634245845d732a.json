Last year, the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/introduction-of-plastic-packaging-tax-from-april-2022/introduction-of-plastic-packaging-tax-2021\">United Kingdom</a> introduced a tax on manufacturers that produce or import plastic packaging containing less than 30 percent recycled plastic. In 2024, <a href=\"https://www.nj.gov/dep/dshw/recycled-content/\">New Jersey</a> will begin enforcing similar rules, albeit with lower targets. <a href=\"https://calrecycle.ca.gov/bevcontainer/bevdistman/plasticcontent/%23:~:text=The%2525252525252520law%2525252525252520requires%2525252525252520a%2525252525252520postconsumer,and%252525252525252050%2525252525252520percent%2525252525252520on%25252525252525202030.\">California</a> now requires that beverage containers be made of 15 percent recycled materials, and <a href=\"https://ecology.wa.gov/Waste-Toxics/Reducing-recycling-waste/Waste-reduction-programs/Plastics/2021-plastic-pollution-laws\">Washington</a> will enact a similar requirement later this year. The <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/eu-propose-boosting-recycled-content-reuse-packaging-2022-11-28/\">European Commission</a>, <a href=\"https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/managing-reducing-waste/reduce-plastic-waste/recycle-content.html\">Canada</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.plasticsnews.com/news/mexican-legislature-endorses-recycled-content-requirements%23:~:text=Mexican%2525252525252520legislators%2525252525252520have%2525252525252520unanimously%2525252525252520endorsed,and%252525252525252030%2525252525252520percent%2525252525252520by%25252525252525202030.\">Mexico</a> are all considering comparable moves.</p>\n<p>Currently, most plastic products are <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/06/climate/plastics-climate-pollution.html\">derived</a> from freshly extracted fossil fuels, including crude oil and natural gas. Incorporating some recycled plastic could reduce emissions, and shrink pollution in <a href=\"https://undark.org/2019/07/03/nurdle-plastic-pollution/\">waterways</a> and landfills, experts say. But collecting, sorting, pulverizing, and melting post-consumer plastics for reuse is expensive. The new laws will potentially help recyclers find buyers for what would otherwise become waste.</p>\n<p>But regulators may need a better way to verify that the new laws are working. While companies can enlist a third-party to certify their use of recycled content, most certifiers take a bird’s-eye view, tracking the materials across a range of products and factories. As a result, an item with a “recycled content” label might be completely devoid of recycled content.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1926872#p3\">Read 32 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1926872&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Undark Magazine","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cb0a39f80e450d687b18a0601991dc7be02130273e597be94b634245845d732a","category":"Tech"}
