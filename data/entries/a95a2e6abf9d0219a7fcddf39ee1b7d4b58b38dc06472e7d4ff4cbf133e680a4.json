Likewise, they should be able to choose Google Translate, Microsoft Translator, or other options as their default translation app, instead of Apple's Translate app. These options will be added to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/23/ios-18-2-default-apps-section/\">new \"Default Apps\" section in the Settings app</a> on iPhones that was implemented in iOS 18.2.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>PayPal Balance in Apple Wallet</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/PayPal-Debit-Card-Apple-Wallet-Large.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"680\" />\r<br />\nApple previously announced that iPhone users in the U.S. will be able to see their PayPal balance when using their PayPal debit card in the Wallet app. Apple said this feature would launch in 2025, so it could arrive in a future iOS 18 update.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Robot Vacuum Support in Home App</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Roomba-and-HomeKit-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nApple's website continues to state that robot vacuum support will be added to the Home app in an unspecified iOS 18 update. When available, this feature will allow you to control key functions of your robot vacuum in the Home app, and with Siri voice commands.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHere is how Apple describes the feature:<blockquote>The Home app now supports the core functionality of robot vacuum cleaners, such as power control, cleaning mode, vacuum, mop, and charge status. They can also participate in automations and scenes, and respond to Siri requests. So you can add them to your cleaning routines â€” or tell Siri to do some spot cleaning in the living room.</blockquote>There are references to the feature <a href=\"https://x.com/aaronp613/status/1868737613659881823\">in iOS 18.3 code</a>, but the functionality is not yet live as of the second beta. iOS 18.3 will likely be released in late January.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/09/three-ios-18-features-coming-soon/\">Here Are Three iOS 18 Features Coming Soon Beyond Apple Intelligence</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/here-are-three-ios-18-features-coming-soon-beyond-apple-intelligence.2447062/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a95a2e6abf9d0219a7fcddf39ee1b7d4b58b38dc06472e7d4ff4cbf133e680a4","category":"Apple"}
