These new betas will be in testing alongside the current <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a>, and ‌macOS Sequoia‌ 15 betas. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-Intelligence-General-Feature.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nDevelopers can choose whether to opt into the new betas with Apple Intelligence, or stay on the standard ‌iOS 18‌/‌iPadOS 18‌/‌macOS Sequoia‌ 15 beta track. An <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a> or ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max, or an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> or Mac with an Apple silicon chip is required to use Apple Intelligence, and only eligible devices will see the updates. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAfter updating, turning on Apple Intelligence can be done in the Settings app. There is an Apple Intelligence Waitlist that developers must opt into, but access should be granted within a few hours.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSeveral Apple Intelligence features are available as of today, including Writing Tools, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>'s revamped design, the option to move between voice commands and typing to ‌Siri‌, summaries for transcripts and other content, the new Mail categories and smart replies, smart replies in Messages, and more. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nOther features like Image Playground, Genmoji, priority notifications, ‌Siri‌ personal context, and ChatGPT integration will be coming at a later date. New capabilities will be rolled out over time, with Apple making regular updates. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs of right now, the Apple Intelligence features are limited to the developer beta, and it is not clear if there will be a public beta for iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and ‌macOS Sequoia‌ 15.1. Apple plans to release Apple Intelligence in a beta capacity later this fall, and as these features are in a separate beta from the launch versions of ‌iOS 18‌, ‌iPadOS 18‌, and ‌macOS Sequoia‌ 15, Apple Intelligence will not be available right away when the new software updates first come out in September. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen Apple Intelligence does officially launch this fall, it will still be in beta. Developers who plan to install the new updates today should be aware that Apple Intelligence is still in the early stages of development.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/\">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246\">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/apple-releases-ios-18-1-apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence Now Available in New iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS Sequoia Developer Betas</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-intelligence-now-available-in-new-ios-18-1-ipados-18-1-and-macos-sequoia-developer-betas.2432474/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f4ddb9cc41b3186224da2218ecf8db0de00ccf7fd95bbaa443f3a45e2ef5e5df","category":"Apple"}
