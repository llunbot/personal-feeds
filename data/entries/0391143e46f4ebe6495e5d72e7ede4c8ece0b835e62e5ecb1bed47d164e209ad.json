The DOJ sent new subpoenas to Apple's business partners over the summer, and has assigned more staff to the probe.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSpecifics have yet to be nailed down, but <em>The Information</em>'s sources believe that the investigation will lead to a lawsuit. Apple has been under investigation by the DOJ <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/07/23/doj-tech-company-antitrust-review/\">for two years now</a>, and the probe is part of a broad investigation that has seen the Justice Department looking into Apple, Google, Facebook, and Amazon.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe DOJ has spoken with Apple critics that include Spotify, Match Group, Basecamp, and Tile, all companies unhappy with Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> policies and control.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAttorneys involved in the probe will eventually give the Department of Justice a recommendation on whether or not to file a lawsuit against Apple, but no formal recommendation has been made at this point in time, and there's still a possibility that no case will be filed as the investigation is ongoing.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple recently came out largely ahead in its lawsuit with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/\">Epic Games</a> and the judge decided that Apple had not violated U.S. antitrust law, but <em>The Information</em>'s sources say that the DOJ's investigation is broader because it is also examining issues like Sign in With Apple, App Tracking Transparency, and location tracking restrictions, so the Epic loss will not hinder a potential DOJ case.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/doj/\">DOJ</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/\">antitrust</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/25/apple-antitrust-lawsuit-likely/\">U.S. Department of Justice Likely to File Antitrust Lawsuit Against Apple</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/u-s-department-of-justice-likely-to-file-antitrust-lawsuit-against-apple.2319271/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=JGXIMwcyxwU:0V-CLhNEna8:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=JGXIMwcyxwU:0V-CLhNEna8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/JGXIMwcyxwU\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0391143e46f4ebe6495e5d72e7ede4c8ece0b835e62e5ecb1bed47d164e209ad","category":"Apple"}
