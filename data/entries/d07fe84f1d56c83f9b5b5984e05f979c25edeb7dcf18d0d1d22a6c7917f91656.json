Apple describes the update as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>When used with an iOS 18, iPadOS 18, macOS Sequoia, and watchOS 11-supported iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch, AirPods Pro 2 firmware update 7A294 makes the hands-free experience even more seamless by being able to nod your head “yes” or shake your head “no” to respond to Siri announcements like calls, messages, and notifications. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This update also adds Voice Isolation to calls with AirPods Pro 2 to help ensure you come across clearly by removing background noise around you for whoever you are speaking to. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gamers also now have the best wireless audio latency Apple has ever delivered for mobile gaming and can enjoy improved voice quality, including 16-bit, 48kHz audio, when chatting with teammates and other players. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, this update includes performance improvements to Personalized Volume with AirPods Pro 2.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, this is the firmware that adds all the p<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2221069/ios-18-ai-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">reviously announced new features</a> to AirPods Pro. At its September “Glowtime” event, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2452606/apple-never-wants-you-to-take-airpods-out-of-your-ears.html\">Apple unveiled other new features</a> including Hearing Protection, a clinical-grade hearing test, and a hearing aid function. These are coming in a software update later this year.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>AirPods Pro 2 USB-C</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"1218\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/61sRKTAfrhL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AirPods Pro 2 USB-C\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/61sRKTAfrhL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1218w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/61sRKTAfrhL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=244%2C300&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 244w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/61sRKTAfrhL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=768%2C946&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/61sRKTAfrhL._AC_SL1500_.jpg?resize=974%2C1200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 974w\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MW-Ed-Choice-90x90-1.png\" alt=\"Editors' Choice\" loading=\"lazy\" />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1207444/airpods-pro-2022-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$249\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/321564/633495/10014?prodsku=6447382&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.bestbuy.com%2Fclick%2F-%2F6447382%2Fpdp&amp;intsrc=CATF_4831\" target=\"_blank\">$189.99 at  Best Buy</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1787391-REG/apple_mtjv3am_a_airpods_pro_with_wireless.html/BI/21318/KBID/22251/DFF/d10-v21-t1-x1297784/SID/pocketlint-squirrel\" target=\"_blank\">$229 at  B&amp;H</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MTJV3AM/A/airpods-pro\" target=\"_blank\">$249 at  Apple</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>There isn’t a way to force an upgrade to the new firmware; it will automatically install when the AirPods are in their case and charging. It can take hours or even days to get the latest firmware. If you haven’t used your AirPods in a long time, taking them out of their case and using them for a few minutes before putting them back in and on the charger may help speed things up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To see what firmware version your AirPods are running, you can open the Settings app, select your connected AirPods (near the top), scroll down past all the options to the <em>About</em> section, and look at the <em>Version</em> line. You can also find this information in <em>General</em> &gt; <em>About</em> &gt; <em>AirPods Pro</em>.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"d07fe84f1d56c83f9b5b5984e05f979c25edeb7dcf18d0d1d22a6c7917f91656","category":"Apple"}
