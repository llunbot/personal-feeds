At the time of writing, the Podcasts app, which has faced a flurry of criticism, has a 2 out of 5-star rating out of 156 reviews, with other Apple apps varying.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAt the time of writing, no Apple app has a perfect five-star rating, with even the company's built-in Stocks app struggling to reach a 4 out of 5 grade. Notes has earned just 3.6 out of 5, while even Maps, which has received more attention from Apple over the years, has only a 3 out of 5 ratings.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nBy opening up its apps to ratings and reviews, Apple and its teams are now better able to receive more direct feedback for individual apps on ‌‌iPhone‌‌ and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>. This move also helps cover some potential concerns from Apple's competitors, who could have previously argued that by withholding ratings and reviews for pre-installed apps, Apple was being anti-competitive.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's pre-installed apps, such as Mail, Podcasts, and Maps, don't receive regular ‌App Store‌ feature updates as other apps; instead, their major updates are bundled with significant iOS releases.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple refines and tweaks all of its apps with each minor update for iOS and iPadOS, but significant changes, such as the ones that are likely to be requested through ratings and reviews, are not expected to come sporadically throughout the year, but instead, users will have to wait for the next major iOS release to see if their wishes have come true.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/30/app-store-rating-pre-installed-apps/\">Apple Now Lets Customers Rate and Review Pre-Installed Apps on the App Store</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-now-lets-customers-rate-and-review-pre-installed-apps-on-the-app-store.2314561/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=qyrjeEI7-ks:43DaNHMyN0U:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=qyrjeEI7-ks:43DaNHMyN0U:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/qyrjeEI7-ks\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9653515720cf0cadfc10b3db0fdc0eddea8bf8177c74a4b8fdf7d88745c67d15","category":"Apple"}
