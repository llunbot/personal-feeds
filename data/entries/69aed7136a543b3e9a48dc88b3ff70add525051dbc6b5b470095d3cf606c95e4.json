The most basic physics is well understood, but long-standing mysteries remain, most notably how different materials exchange positive and negative charges—sometimes ordering themselves into a predictable series, but sometimes appearing completely random.</p>\n<p>Now scientists at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA) have identified a critical factor explaining that inherent unpredictability: It's the contact history of given materials that controls how they exchange charges in contact electrification. They described their findings in a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08530-6\">new paper</a> published in the journal Nature.</p>\n<p>Johan Carl Wilcke published the first so-called \"triboelectric series\" in 1757 to describe the tendency of different materials to self-order based on how they develop a positive or negative charge. A material toward the bottom of the list, like hair, will acquire a more negative charge when it comes into contact with a material near the top of the list, like a rubber balloon.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/scientists-unlock-vital-clue-to-strange-quirk-of-static-electricity/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/scientists-unlock-vital-clue-to-strange-quirk-of-static-electricity/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"69aed7136a543b3e9a48dc88b3ff70add525051dbc6b5b470095d3cf606c95e4","category":"Tech"}
