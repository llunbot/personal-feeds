The repercussions would be felt everywhere from global supply chains and transportation to Internet and GPS access. Less examined until now, though, is the impact such a solar emission could have on Internet infrastructure specifically. New research shows that the failures could be catastrophic, particularly for the undersea cables that underpin the global Internet.</p>\n<p>At the <a href=\"https://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2021/\">SIGCOMM 2021</a> data communication conference on Thursday, Sangeetha Abdu Jyothi of the University of California, Irvine presented “Solar Superstorms: Planning for an Internet Apocalypse,” an examination of the damage a fast-moving cloud of magnetized solar particles could cause the global Internet. Abdu Jyothi's <a href=\"https://www.ics.uci.edu/~sabdujyo/papers/sigcomm21-cme.pdf\">research</a> points out an additional nuance to a blackout-causing solar storm: the scenario where even if power returns in hours or days, mass Internet outages persist.</p>\n<p></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1790321#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1790321&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e8231c8b3103ac410ba5dbaeb1ae17243c9883ac3601e5168328dd88dfcc9b4b","category":"Tech"}
