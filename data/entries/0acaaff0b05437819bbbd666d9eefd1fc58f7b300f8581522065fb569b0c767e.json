HDR has been improved with Smart HDR 5, so skin tones are able to look more lifelike while other colors remain vivid. This is particularly noticeable in situations with bright backgrounds where you might see some washout with prior ‌iPhone‌ models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iphone-15-pro-max-camera-1.jpg\" alt width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" />\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a> default to 24 megapixels instead of 12 megapixels, which means you're getting more detail and better quality with a still-reasonable file size, and with the A17 Pro, you can choose from different focal lengths, including 24mm, 28mm, and 35mm to better mimic what you can do with adjustable lens cameras.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iphone-15-pro-max-camera-2.jpg\" alt width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" />\r<br />\nNight mode is more impressive, and taking a Portrait image no longer requires swapping modes. With a person or pet in the photo (or if you tap to focus), depth information is automatically captured and you can choose to activate Portrait mode after the shot, which is super handy. It's much easier to just pop open the camera, snap a shot, and get exactly what you want.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iphone-15-pro-max-camera-3.jpg\" alt width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" />\r<br />\nThe biggest change on the 15 Pro Max is the 5x optical zoom lens that replaces the 3x optical zoom lens. The 5x optical zoom is equivalent to a 120mm telephoto lens, which is a great focal length for portraits and a lens that can be used in ways that just didn't work with 3x zoom. The 5x lens is much more of a go-to option for just everyday shots, especially when people and pets are involved. It has excellent background blur that pairs well with the portrait feature.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iphone-15-pro-max-camera-4.jpg\" alt width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" />\r<br />\nFor most people, video is about the same, but there are some bells and whistles for pros, including log color encoding when shooting ProRes video for better HDR and simpler post-production adjustments.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/iphone-15-pro-max-camera-5.jpg\" alt width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" />\r<br />\nWe'll have a much more in-depth look at the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max camera coming up, with a comparison to Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a> Pro Max, so make sure to stay tuned to <em>MacRumors</em> for that.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro\">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/06/iphone-15-pro-max-camera/\">A Deeper Look at the iPhone 15 Pro Max Camera</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/a-deeper-look-at-the-iphone-15-pro-max-camera.2406648/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0acaaff0b05437819bbbd666d9eefd1fc58f7b300f8581522065fb569b0c767e","category":"Apple"}
