That's usually called \"Google Workspace,\" and today it offers email, calendar, docs, storage, and video chat. Soon, it sounds like Google is gearing up to offer an AI chatbot for businesses. Google's latest chatbot is <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/12/google-launches-gemini-a-powerful-ai-model-it-says-can-surpass-gpt-4/\">called \"Gemini\"</a> (it used to be \"Bard\"), and the latest early patch notes spotted by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/evowizz/status/1759690336845037869\">Dylan Roussei of 9to5Google</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/testingcatalog/status/1759685618034978852/\">TestingCatalog.eth</a> show descriptions for new \"Gemini Business\" and \"Gemini Enterprise\" products.</p>\n<p>The patch notes say that Workspace customers will get \"enterprise-grade data protections\" and Gemini settings in the Google Workspace Admin console and that Workspace users can \"use Gemini confidently at work\" while \"trusting that your conversations aren't used to train Gemini models.\"</p>\n<p>These \"early patch notes\" for Bard/Gemini have been <em>a thing </em>for a while now. Apparently, some people have ways of making the site spit out early patch notes, and in this case, they were independently confirmed by two different people. I'm not sure the date (scheduled for February 21) is trustworthy, though.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2004615#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2004615&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4508ac629f26e3f2aa86deeb2029dafb28c7954539fc7413ae63824e588f8880","category":"Tech"}
