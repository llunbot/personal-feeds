Abus claims that the new GameChanger 2.0 helmet’s new forehead entry ports and redesigned exit ports improve airflow through the helmet. It also says that the redesigned tail is more aero and that the redesigned strap junction is more comfortable. Finally, the new helmet can be fitted with Abus’s QUIN crash detection system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>UK price for the non-MIPS helmet is £239.99, while the MIPS version retails for £279.99. There are 16 non-MIPS colours and four MIPS colour options.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Abus’s first high-end MIPS road helmet</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The headline change is that Abus will offer a MIPS option in the GameChanger 2.0, implementing the lower profile MIPS AIr Node system, which integrates MIPS into the helmet’s padding, rather than the original MIPS, which requires a separate layer within the helmet shell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abus has been one of the few helmet makers not to offer MIPS sliding plane tech in its high-end road helmets, although its Powerdome road helmet and some of its MTB, urban and children’s helmets already incorporate the tech. Other helmet makers like Kask and Lazer have their own alternatives to MIPS which they implement in some of their helmets.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Improved airflow</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"643\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/GameChanger-2-6-970x643.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/GameChanger-2-6-970x643.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/GameChanger-2-6-300x199.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/GameChanger-2-6-768x509.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/GameChanger-2-6-1536x1018.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/GameChanger-2-6-2048x1358.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/GameChanger-2-6-750x497.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/GameChanger-2-6-1140x756.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/GameChanger-2-6-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Abus</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Abus has made a number of other updates to the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/abus-gamechanger-helmet-review\">original GameChanger</a> with the new version 2.0. That starts with new front eyebrow vents, which it says allow up to 32 per cent more airflow into the front of the helmet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Abus says that the shape of the lateral struts of the helmet cage also pushes more air into the helmet at higher speeds, as well as improving airflow over the helmet’s outer surface. Changes at the rear are then claimed to increase air outflow by 20 per cent. </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/kask-wg11-vs-mips-safety\">Kask takes on Mips with WG11 safety tech: Is it better and what’s in a name?</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/safest-bike-helmet\">Bike helmet safety: Standards, testing and tech, plus Virginia Tech’s top-rated helmets</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/lazer-kineticore\">Lazer tackles rotational impacts with new Mips rival KinetiCore</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-best-budget-cycling-helmets\">Best budget cycling helmets: Safe on a budget</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>There are other changes at the back as well, with a longer kammtail, which Abus says is optimised for 46 to 52kph rider speeds and increases the helmet’s virtual airfoil length by 11 per cent. The kammtail edge is lowered by 8 degrees from the original GameChanger, which Abus says improves the helmet’s aerodynamics when riding in the drops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A new Aeroblade design on the top of the helmet is claimed to improve both aerodynamics and ventilation, helping to draw air more efficiently from the head.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s also a new strap design that sees a wider V-shape and, in the MIPS helmet, there’s a new Fidlock magnetic buckle, making getting the helmet on and off easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, Abus has made it easier to dock your sunglasses at the front or rear of the helmet, with eyewear ports that work with straight and curved sunglass arms.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Crash detection system</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Abus GameChanger 2.0 integrates with the brand’s QUIN accelerometer-based crash detection system. This fits into the helmet and works in a similar way to the Specialized ANGi sensor, detecting a sudden acceleration and alerting your named contacts via a phone app which sends SMS and email alerts along with your GPS location.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The QUIN sensor is rechargeable by micro USB without the need to remove it from the helmet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All Abus helmets are made in the brand’s own factory in Italy. Abus has been helmet sponsor to the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/movistar\">Movistar </a>team since 2017, when it supplanted <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/catlike-factory-visit\">Catlike</a>. The GameChanger helmet is one of the main options used by the team, along with the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/abus-airbreaker-helmet-review\">AirBreaker</a> lightweight helmet.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Abus GameChanger 2.0 specifications</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Gamechanger-2-packshot-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Gamechanger-2-packshot-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Gamechanger-2-packshot-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Gamechanger-2-packshot-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Gamechanger-2-packshot-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Gamechanger-2-packshot-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Gamechanger-2-packshot-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Gamechanger-2-packshot-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Gamechanger-2-packshot-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Gamechanger-2-packshot-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/Gamechanger-2-packshot.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Abus</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sizes:</strong> S, M, L</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Claimed weight: </strong>260g / 265g / 275g</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Colours: </strong>Non-MIPS 11 / MIPS 4</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price without MIPS:</strong> £239.99 / €279.99</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price with MIPS:</strong> £279.99 / €299.99</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Check out our complete <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/clothing/helmets\">helmet</a> coverage for more helmet news.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Happy with the original GameChanger?
