Now, though, a new study from six Apple engineers shows that the mathematical \"reasoning\" displayed by advanced large language models can be extremely brittle and unreliable in the face of seemingly trivial changes to common benchmark problems.</p>\n<p>The fragility highlighted in these new results helps support previous research suggesting that LLMs use of probabilistic pattern matching is missing the formal understanding of underlying concepts needed for truly reliable mathematical reasoning capabilities. \"Current LLMs are not capable of genuine logical reasoning,\" the researchers hypothesize based on these results. \"Instead, they attempt to replicate the reasoning steps observed in their training data.\"</p>\n<h2>Mix it up</h2>\n<p>In \"GSM-Symbolic: Understanding the Limitations of Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models\"—currently available <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05229\">as a pre-print paper</a>—the six Apple researchers start with <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/openai/gsm8k\">GSM8K's standardized set of over 8,000 grade-school level mathematical word problems</a>, which is <a href=\"https://klu.ai/glossary/GSM8K-eval\">often used as a benchmark</a> for modern LLMs' complex reasoning capabilities. They then take the novel approach of modifying a portion of that testing set to dynamically replace certain names and numbers with new values—so a question about Sophie getting 31 building blocks for her nephew in GSM8K could become a question about Bill getting 19 building blocks for his brother in the new GSM-Symbolic evaluation.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/llms-cant-perform-genuine-logical-reasoning-apple-researchers-suggest/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/llms-cant-perform-genuine-logical-reasoning-apple-researchers-suggest/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5884b3ed54ea4bb4ec1319ad38ab1dda8ee20c7444b1826860f4daca492b9ef7","category":"Tech"}
