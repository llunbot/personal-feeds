The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-dropper-posts/\">dropper post</a> also opens up plenty of room for you to move around.</p>\n<p>This aluminium bike might be aimed at descending, but it won’t make getting to the top of a trail a drag because it ascends surprisingly fast considering its burly 14.86kg weight and gnarly tyres.</p>\n<p>With a 140mm travel RockShox fork and SRAM groupset, the Stoic has a great spec for the price, but there are also two less pricey versions of the Stoic in Canyon’s lineup starting from £799.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/canyon-stoic-4-review/\">Read the full Canyon Stoic 4 review</a></li>\n</ul><h2>Merida Big.

Trail 500’s geometry is relatively short. This means on paper it doesn’t have the stability of bikes with a longer wheelbase.</p>\n<p>But, the Merida has a shorter seat tube than many other bikes allowing riders to size up without worrying about standover height, unlocking a longer reach and a more stable wheelbase.</p>\n<p>With this in mind, the Big. Trail 500 is a comfortable climber. The longer reach in testing meant there was plenty of room to move around and the steep seat tube improved comfort, made pedalling easier and reduced front wheel lift.</p>\n<p>When it comes to descents, the Recon fork has plenty of mid-stroke and low-speed compression helping you go fast and amplify the aluminium frame’s calm feel.</p>\n<p>The mix of Merida’s own-brand kit, including a dropper post, and branded kit from Shimano keeps the bike’s price down but this doesn’t stop it from being one of the most capable bikes for under £2,000.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/merida-big-trail-500-review/\">Read the full Merida Big.
