[credit:\n                              Samsung                            ]\n                      </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n\n<p>Samsung has announced its next Tile/AirTag competitor, the <a href=\"https://news.samsung.com/us/introducing-new-samsung-galaxy-smarttag2-a-smart-way-to-keep-track-of-important-things-in-your-life/\">Galaxy SmartTag 2</a>. The new Bluetooth trackers are $30 each and ship globally on October 10.</p>\n<p>The design is interesting, with a giant ring on the top and a large overall size. Samsung says the battery, a removable CR2032, will last for 500 days in \"normal\" mode, while a new \"Power Saving\" mode will last 700 days (Samsung did not expand on what \"power saving\" mode does). It's also IP67-rated.</p>\n<p>The big ring on top feels like it should somehow attach to an object, but it's a solid ring that never opens; it's not a clip. The press release says you'll need a \"clip or keyring\" to attach the SmartTag 2 to something. Samsung's hero shot shows the tag directly attached to some objects like a key, but this does not appear to be possible outside the world of Photoshop.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1973705#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1973705&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4eceb683703797f6d9768b119d80c5eb36cfdc869b3d1cc76c6d3bee982ce2ba","category":"Tech"}
