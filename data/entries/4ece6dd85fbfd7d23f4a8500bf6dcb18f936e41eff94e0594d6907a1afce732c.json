Apple has gradually <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/18/apple-tv-remote-usb-c-port/\">phased out Lightning</a> across its product lineup over the past few years, with all four iPhone 15 models launching later this year expected to be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/16/iphone-15-pro-usb-c-port/\">equipped with a USB-C port</a> as well.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>H2 Chips</h3>\r<br />\nThe current AirPods Max have an Apple-designed H1 chip in each ear cup, and an upgrade to H2 chips is likely for the next model. Introduced with the second-generation AirPods Pro, the H2 chip <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/07/airpods-pro-2-h2-chip-features/\">enables several benefits</a>, including improved sound, increased active noise cancellation, and Adaptive Transparency mode.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>Increased Active Noise Cancellation</h3>\r<br />\nWith the H2 chip, the second-generation AirPods Pro provide <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/07/new-airpods-pro-with-h2-chip-more/\">up to twice as much active noise cancellation</a> as the original AirPods Pro, according to Apple. A similar improvement in noise cancellation is likely for the next AirPods Max.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>Adaptive Transparency Mode</h3>\r<br />\nTransparency mode lets some outside noise in, allowing you to hear a conversation and other ambient sounds. The second-generation AirPods Pro take this feature a step further with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/block-out-loud-noises-adaptive-transparency/\">Adaptive Transparency mode</a>, which can reduce loud environmental noises, such as a passing vehicle siren, construction tools, or loud speakers at a concert. With H2 chips, the next AirPods Max will likely feature Adaptive Transparency mode as well.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>Conversation Boost</h3>\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/enable-conversation-boost-airpods-pro/\">Conversation Boost</a> is designed to help people with mild hearing challenges stay more connected in conversations. The feature uses the AirPods Pro's beam-forming microphones to boost the volume of a person talking in front of you, making it easier to listen to a face-to-face conversation, and there is also an option to reduce ambient noise. Given the AirPods Max also have beam-forming microphones, perhaps Conversation Boost will eventually be expanded to the over-ear headphones.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Other Possibilities</h2>\r<br />\nIn January, we <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/15/airpods-max-2-features-and-launch-date/\">outlined several other potential features</a> for the second-generation AirPods Max, including longer battery life, new color options, Bluetooth 5.3 support, a U1 chip that would enable Precision Finding in the Find My app, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Launch Timing</h2>\r<br />\nThe current AirPods Max <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/08/airpods-max/\">launched in December 2020</a> for $549 in the U.S. and have not received any hardware upgrades since then. The headphones are available in five colors: Space Gray, Silver, Green, Pink, and Sky Blue.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple will likely release new AirPods Max <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/03/kuo-airpods-max-2-second-half-2024/\">in the second half of 2024 or the first half of 2025</a>, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, so the headphones are still over a year away from receiving an update based on that estimate. New color options are always a possibility in the interim, as happened with the HomePod mini in late 2021.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/\">AirPods Max</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Max\">AirPods Max (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/19/airpods-max-2-potential-features/\">Next AirPods Max Could Adopt These Five Features From Beats Studio Pro and AirPods Pro</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/next-airpods-max-could-adopt-these-five-features-from-beats-studio-pro-and-airpods-pro.2396351/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4ece6dd85fbfd7d23f4a8500bf6dcb18f936e41eff94e0594d6907a1afce732c","category":"Apple"}
