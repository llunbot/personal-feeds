Today it’s following those up with <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213723\">iOS and iPadOS 15.7.5</a>, <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213724\">macOS Monterey 12.6.5</a>, and <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213725\">macOS Big Sur 11.7.6</a> to patch those same vulnerabilities in older devices that are still receiving software updates but aren’t capable of running the newest OSes.</p>\n<p>Mac owners will also want to install last week’s <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213722\">Safari 16.4.1</a> update. Safari is still updated separately from the rest of the OS on Macs, so the Safari update plugs one of the security holes (CVE-2023-28205, a WebKit arbitrary code execution vulnerability), and the macOS update patches the other (CVE-2023-28206, a graphics-related bug that can allow arbitrary code execution with kernel privileges).</p>\n\n<p>You'll be able to install the Mac updates on any Mac that's running Big Sur or Monterey, even if the hardware is capable of upgrading to Ventura. Apple is only providing <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/apple-releases-ios-15-security-updates-for-devices-that-cant-upgrade-to-16/\">iOS</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/apple-ends-ipados-15-updates-for-newer-ipads-install-ipados-16-to-stay-secure/\">iPadOS 15 updates</a> to older devices that can’t run version 16. That list of old devices includes models like the iPhone 6S and 7, the original iPhone SE, the last iPod Touch, and the iPad Air 2 that Apple sold for several years in the mid-2010s.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1930503#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1930503&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5355e7d5d32548cb91f951badc2f68cdd0da4f85c92a31606a01c5d264b6e0c6","category":"Tech"}
