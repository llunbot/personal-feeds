Sometimes you’ll even need your password when deleting files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what do you do if you’ve lost or forgotten the password, or it doesn’t work? Maybe you inherited or bought the Mac secondhand and you don’t know the password. Don’t panic.

You will need to remember your master password as that’s how the password manager is kept secure, but you can look for any other password you use – so you could store your Mac password this way. Apple also offers it’s own <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2583512/apple-passwords-review-free-and-simple-password-manager.html\">Passwords app</a> that stores your passwords – but unfortunately it won’t store the password to your Mac.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s Passwords app can be helpful if you have forgotten your Apple ID though. On an iPhone open the Passwords app search for Apple and you should see one or more Apple ID usernames. Tap on these to find one with a recent date and hopefully that will be the one you are after.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to iOS 18 this required iCloud Keychain. So open Settings, find Passwords and search for Apple as above. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to stop someone else resetting your Mac password</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you know how to reset your password you may be worried that if you can use Recovery Mode to reset the password, someone else could do the same thing – and once a person has got access to your Mac, you’ve usually lost control over it. There are some steps you can take to protect your data, though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way to protect your data is to turn on FileVault encryption. This encrypts the contents of your Mac, and the Password Reset utility will not show until you unlock it with Disk Utility. When you set up FileVault you can choose to receive a Recovery Key (which you should print out) or you can tie it to your Apple ID. Beware that if you forget or you lose these your data will be lost forever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To turn FileVault on follow these steps (slightly different depending on the macOS version).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In Ventura or later:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Go to System Settings. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click on Privacy &amp; Security.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Scroll down to FileVault. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click on Turn On…</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Choose Allow my iCloud account to unlock my disk, or Create a recovery key and do not use my iCloud account.
