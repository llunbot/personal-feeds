Available in lilac, pale gray, graphite colors, the Keys-To-Go 2 is just under 10 inches long, four inches wide, and it weighs 7.84 ounces.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere is a built-in cover that protects the keyboard during travel, keeping it safe from scratches and spills. It is equipped with scissor keys that have 1mm of travel for a comfortable typing experience, and there is an option to connect to up to three devices and swap between them quickly.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLogitech designed the keyboard with two layouts, including a Universal layout and a dedicated Apple layout for iPhones, iPads, and Macs. The top key row features several shortcut keys for adjusting volume, media playback, and screen brightness levels, as well as locking the ‌iPad‌'s display.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nThe keyboard pairs to an ‌iPad‌ using Bluetooth, and there are replaceable coin cell batteries that Logitech says will last up to three years depending on usage.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Keys-To-Go 2 keyboard is priced at $80 and it can be <a href=\"https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/tablet-keyboards/keys-to-go2-universal.920-012867.html\">purchased from the Logitech website</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/logitech/\">Logitech</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/18/logitech-keys-to-go-2/\">Logitech Launches 'Keys-To-Go 2' Portable Keyboard for Tablets</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/logitech-launches-keys-to-go-2-portable-keyboard-for-tablets.2429555/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4558bdfbf29aeeb554a43f729004f20f90aab07ac41e1346e901dd7de4a83b58","category":"Apple"}
