We kicked off with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2022-canyon-torque/\">Canyon’s new Torque</a> – a bike built for the rigours of your local hills, even if those hills include the RedBull Rampage site in Utah. We also looked at Strava’s year in review, gave 12 tips for newbies to Zwift and reviewed the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/merida-big-trail-600-review/\">Merida Big Trail 600</a>.</p>\n<p>We’ve been working hard on our collection of Best Lists to help you choose new bikes, components and clothing. These are all populated from the reviews our experienced testers have ploughed plenty of time into, so you can be sure the advice is as good as you’re going to get.</p>\n<p>This week, we’ve refreshed our <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-tyres/\">Best Gravel Tyres</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-winter-cycling-gloves/\">Best Winter Gloves</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-helmets-for-trail-riding/\">Best Mountain Bike Helmets</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-hardtail-mountain-bikes/\">Best Hardtails</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-trail-bikes/\">Best Trail Bikes</a> lists – phew!</p>\n\n<h2>Sportful Supergiara Puffy</h2>\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> It’s a niche bit of kit, but one that in early testing makes sense, in the right conditions!</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tom Marvin / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>On first impressions, the Supergiara Puffy looks rather, er, unique. And it certainly stands out from the crowd with its short-sleeve-yet-insulated construction.</p>\n<p>The jacket is aimed at gravel riders (who else?!) who are off on big adventures where a bit of warmth might be handy, but speeds are still high (so a full-on insulated jacket might be too much).</p>\n<p>The torso has Thermore insulation built into a water-repellant outer shell. This keeps the important bits of your body dry in a shower and comfortable in chilly conditions.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Soft fabrics around the neck aid cosiness in the cold.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tom Marvin / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>There’s some insulation in the shoulders too, but there’s also plenty of thinner stretch material in the arms to ensure mobility isn’t compromised.</p>\n<p>The ends of the arms are kept snug with an elasticated hem to keep cold drafts out of your core.</p>\n<p>Finally, the whole shebang folds into that little mesh pocket on the chest, for easy stowage – Sportful even says it can be strapped directly to your bars.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The fabric chest pocket is the only storage you’ll get, and it accommodates the jacket itself.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tom Marvin / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>So, er, why might this work? Well, the forearms are a really good place to regulate temperature, so by keeping them out in the wind you’re less likely to overheat. At the same time, keeping your core protected from the cold can help keep extremities comfortable too.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A bonus ‘this is what it looks like on a human’ photo.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tom Marvin / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>We’ve only ridden in it once, and it was far too warm. But, it’s lightweight and comfortable! Now it’s chillier, we’ll be back out in this funky-looking jacket.</p>\n<ul><li>£180 / $199.95</li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Sendhit First Aid Kit</h2>\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The kit is just bigger than my hand, and weighs the same as a couple of chocolate bars.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tom Marvin / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>While we all assume we’re riding gods, sometimes things go wrong and we end up on the floor.

These plastic devices rely on Clug and tyre deformation as you push the tyre into the Clug, before everything returns to its original shape with enough stability to prevent your bike falling out.</p>\n<p>However, Clug has gone one step to securing your bike further with the Clug Pro, with added Fidlock (yes, the magnetic bottle cage company) security.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Fidlock buckle snaps on with magnets and then twists to take in the string, ensuring a snug fit.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tom Marvin / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The magnet is attached to the end of a cord.
