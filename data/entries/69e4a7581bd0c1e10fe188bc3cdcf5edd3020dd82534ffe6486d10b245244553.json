I know people love these old Stumpy frames and Rokus did a great job detailing the parts list with a succinct story about where he got this bike. Read on below for all the details!<span></span></p>\n<p>I bought the Stumpjumper frame without a fork by coincidence as I was buying another Stumpjumper from a collector, I built it up from a lot of parts that I had leftover from my Surly Troll I sold this year and then cycled with it to Paris.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/08/DSCF9668.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I got lucky to find these NOS ceramic Mavic rims at a local bike shop, as I was looking for them for a while. It’s sort of a size too big but I love the geometry and it suits me well plus it fits a Blackburn Outpost Elite large framebag.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/08/DSCF9736.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/08/DSCF9642.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/08/DSCF9663.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/08/DSCF9665.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/08/DSCF9660.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/08/DSCF9629.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/08/DSCF9647.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/08/DSCF9730.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/08/DSCF9634.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/08/DSCF9623.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/08/DSCF9783.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Specs:</strong><br />\n1992 20” Specialized Stumpjumper frame<br />\nSurly Troll fork<br />\nChris King headset<br />\nSRAM XX1 carbon cranks<br />\nCrankbrothers Stamp 3 pedals<br />\nNOS Mavic 217 Ceramic rims with White Industries MI5 in the back and a SON28 in the front<br />\nSpecialized Pizza Rack<br />\nPaul Component Box Car stem with a swapped faceplate<br />\nErgotec Ladytown handlebars<br />\nPaul Component Canti Lever brake levers<br />\nPaul Component Klamper in the front<br />\nShimano XTR vbrake in the back with ceramic Kool Stop pads<br />\nSRAM Apex shifter and derailleur<br />\nSRAM 11-42 cassette<br />\nContinental 26×2.2 Speed King Race Sport tires<br />\nJagwire cables<br />\nErgon GC1 grips<br />\nErgon SMC Core saddle<br />\nShimano XT seatpost<br />\nAXA defender lock<br />\nROK strap</p>\n<p>____</p>\n<p><em>We’d like to thank all of you who have <a href=\"mailto:readersrides@theradavist.com\" target=\"_blank\">submitted Readers Rides</a> builds to be shared over here.
