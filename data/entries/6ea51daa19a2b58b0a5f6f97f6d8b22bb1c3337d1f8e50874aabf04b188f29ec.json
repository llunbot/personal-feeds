In his <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-06-25/apple-2023-and-2024-road-map-iphone-15-m3-macs-ipad-air-vision-pro-headset-ljbftjwx\">weekly <em>Power On</em> newsletter</a>, Gurman said this iMac remains \"further out,\" suggesting that it might be at least a year or two away from launching.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iMac-Pro-2022-27-and-24-iMac.jpg\" alt width=\"1626\" height=\"914\" />\r<br />\n\"The company is also conducting early work on an iMac with a screen over 30 inches,\" wrote Gurman. He did not share any additional details at this time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nExcluding refurbished models, the iMac is currently only available in a 24-inch size, as Apple discontinued the Intel-based 27-inch iMac and iMac Pro over the last few years. Despite occasional rumors about the iMac Pro making a comeback, there is still no larger iMac with Apple silicon available. One solution is to purchase a 27-inch Studio Display and connect it to a Mac with Apple silicon, but this is not an all-in-one setup.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nReleased in April 2021, the 24-inch iMac features a colorful, ultra-thin design and is equipped with the M1 chip. Gurman expects the 24-inch iMac to be updated with the as-yet-unannounced M3 chip <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/19/when-to-expect-the-next-imac-to-launch/\">by early next year</a>. All current Apple silicon chips are manufactured based on TSMC's 5nm process, while the M3 chip is expected to move to a 3nm process for significant performance and power efficiency improvements.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA larger iMac is one of many products <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/26/apple-roadmap-2023-24-15-new-devices/\">on Apple's product roadmap</a>, according to Gurman. He also expects a second-generation Apple Watch Ultra to launch later this year, suggesting that the high-end watch might be updated on an annual basis like other models.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac\">iMac (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91\">iMac</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/26/imac-with-over-30-inch-display/\">Apple Reportedly Developing Larger iMac With Over 30-Inch Display</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reportedly-developing-larger-imac-with-over-30-inch-display.2394237/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6ea51daa19a2b58b0a5f6f97f6d8b22bb1c3337d1f8e50874aabf04b188f29ec","category":"Apple"}
