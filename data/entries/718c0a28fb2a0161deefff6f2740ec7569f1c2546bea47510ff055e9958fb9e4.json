{"title":"iPad Mini vs. iPad Air Buyer's Guide","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ipad-mini-vs-ipad-air/","date":1717512300000,"content":"Apple recently introduced the sixth-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a>, featuring the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> chip, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a> Pro support, and a larger display size option. In 2021, Apple debuted the sixth-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a>, offering an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> Air-style redesign with a larger display, the A15 Bionic chip, and more. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/ipad-mini-vs-air-early-2022.jpg\" width=\"2498\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThe ‌iPad mini‌ effectively shares the design of the ‌iPad Air‌, with both devices possessing many of the same features such as an all-screen design with no Home button, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a> in the top button, and stereo speakers. There are still some important differences between the devices, such as their display sizes and chips, that clearly set the devices apart.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nShould you buy the more expensive, larger ‌iPad Air‌, or opt for the more affordable, smaller ‌iPad mini‌? Our guide helps to answer the question of how to decide which of these two iPads is best for you. All of the key differences between the two devices are listed below:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<table>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <th>‌iPad mini‌</th>\r<br />\n <th>‌iPad Air‌</th>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>8.3-inch display with 326 ppi</td>\r<br />\n <td>11-inch or 13-inch display with 264 ppi</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>SDR brightness: 500 nits max</td>\r<br />\n <td>11-inch model SDR brightness: 500 nits max\r<br />\n13-inch model SDR brightness: 600 nits max</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Smaller, compact design for maximum portability</td>\r<br />\n <td>Larger design that is better for productivity</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Weighs 0.66 pounds (297 grams)</td>\r<br />\n <td>Weighs 1.02 pounds (462 grams) or 1.36 pounds (617 grams)</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>A15 Bionic chip</td>\r<br />\n <td>‌M2‌ chip</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>6-core CPU</td>\r<br />\n <td>8-core CPU</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>5-core GPU</td>\r<br />\n <td>9-core GPU</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>4GB of memory</td>\r<br />\n <td>8GB of memory</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td></td>\r<br />\n <td>Media Engine\r<br />\nHardware-accelerated H.264 and HEVC\r<br />\nVideo decode engine\r<br />\nVideo encode engine</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Rear Quad-LED True Tone flash</td>\r<br />\n <td></td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Smart HDR 3</td>\r<br />\n <td>Smart HDR 4</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Wi-Fi 6 connectivity</td>\r<br />\n <td>Wi-Fi 6E connectivity</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td></td>\r<br />\n <td>‌Apple Pencil‌ hover</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Supports ‌Apple Pencil‌ with USB-C and second-generation ‌Apple Pencil‌</td>\r<br />\n <td>Supports ‌Apple Pencil‌ with USB-C and ‌Apple Pencil‌ Pro</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Compatible with Bluetooth keyboards only</td>\r<br />\n <td><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/smart-connector/\">Smart Connector</a> to support Apple's Magic Keyboard and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/smart-keyboard/\">Smart Keyboard</a> Folio</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>64GB or 256GB of storage</td>\r<br />\n <td>128GB, 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB of storage</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Available in Space Gray, Starlight, Purple, and Pink</td>\r<br />\n <td>Available in Space Gray, Starlight, Purple, and Blue</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Starts at $499</td>\r<br />\n <td>Starts at $599 or $799</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n</table>\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOverall, the ‌iPad Air‌ is the best all-around option for the majority of users, providing a large screen for productivity and consuming entertainment in a slim, portable design. The additional $100 needed to buy the ‌iPad Air‌ over the ‌iPad mini‌ is more than justified for the benefits that come with its larger display and ‌M2‌ chip, not least the ability to practically use it as a laptop replacement with the Magic Keyboard and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/stage-manager/\">Stage Manager</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYet, most customers who choose the ‌iPad mini‌ will do so because of its screen size rather than in spite of it. The ‌iPad mini‌ is ideal for comfortably reading books, playing handheld games, and easy transport and storage. Those who buy the ‌iPad mini‌ will likely have a specific use case in mind for how they will use the device, such as for note-taking on the go, throwing into a small bag to use on public transport, or giving it to a kid as their first tablet.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf you do not see the ‌iPad mini‌'s smaller display, easy one-handed grip, lightweight design, and portable form factor as an advantage for your use case and are focused on a more versatile display size, you will likely prefer the ‌iPad Air‌, especially as it is now available with a 13-inch size option. The ‌iPad Air‌ is more of an all-around device that works as a potential laptop replacement with support for ‌Stage Manager‌, with the added bonuses that come with a bigger screen for productivity and entertainment.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is also worth noting that the ‌iPad mini‌ is almost three years old, while the ‌iPad Air‌ has just been refreshed, so the latter is almost certainly a better purchase in terms of longevity. A new ‌iPad mini‌ model is expected to launch later this year with a faster chip, so if you have your heart set on the smallest ‌iPad‌ it may be worth holding off until the refreshed version comes out.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air </a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air\">iPad Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini\">iPad Mini (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ipad-mini-vs-ipad-air/\">iPad Mini vs. iPad Air Buyer's Guide</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-mini-vs-ipad-air-buyers-guide.2337402/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"718c0a28fb2a0161deefff6f2740ec7569f1c2546bea47510ff055e9958fb9e4","category":"Apple"}
