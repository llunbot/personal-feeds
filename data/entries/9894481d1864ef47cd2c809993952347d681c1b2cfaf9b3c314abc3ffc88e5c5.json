{"title":"WSJ: ‘Why You’re Losing More to Casinos on the Las Vegas Strip’","link":"https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-youre-losing-more-to-casinos-on-the-las-vegas-strip-73f6f3ab","date":1685551707000,"content":"\n<p>Katherine Sayre, reporting for The Wall Street Journal (<a href=\"https://apple.news/AZg4sD5AdQ86ddbt456JLaw\">News+</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Blackjack, a fast-paced card game, historically paid out a ratio\nof 3:2 when a player hit 21 on the first two cards. That means a\ngambler wins $15 for every $10 bet. Now, many blackjack tables\non the Strip pay out at 6:5, which means that same $10 yields\nonly $12.</p>\n\n<p>John and Kristina Mehaffey, owners of gambling-news and data\ncompany Vegas Advantage, have been cataloging these changes since\n2011, walking miles-long routes through casinos to record the\nnumber of blackjack and roulette tables set outside of VIP areas.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Mehaffeys’ data, more than two-thirds of\nblackjack tables on the Strip currently offer 6:5 payouts, as\nopposed to 3:2.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>6:5 blackjack should be illegal. I mean that. I don’t understand what the gambling regulators in Nevada are doing that this is permissible. What I’ve seen in recent years is that all of the lower-limit tables have 6:5 payouts, and to get real blackjack, with 3:2 payouts, you need to play at tables with $50 minimums, sometimes $100 on weekends.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/31/blackjack-six-to-five\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"9894481d1864ef47cd2c809993952347d681c1b2cfaf9b3c314abc3ffc88e5c5","category":"Tech"}
