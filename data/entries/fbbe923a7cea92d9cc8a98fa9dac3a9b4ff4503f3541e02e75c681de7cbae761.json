While I’m not interested in such a device, it sure does look pretty dang cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The laptop has a black case with a Surface logo in shiny gold (because, you know, the 50th anniversary is the golden anniversary). That’s neat, but when you open the laptop, you’ll find the Microsoft logo from 1975 at the bottom right of the keyboard. When the laptop starts up, it has a special gold Windows 11 wallpaper. Microsoft is running a sweepstakes to give away of 50 of these laptops.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><div> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DIRaAiGCqdq/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"> <div> <div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div><div></div> <div></div><div> <div>View this post on Instagram</div></div><div></div> <div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></a><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DIRaAiGCqdq/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by Microsoft Surface (@surface)</a></p></div></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, the 50th Anniversary Surface looks sweet… but I can’t help but think it wouldn’t look much better as a MacBook. Imagine next year, when Apple marks its 50th anniversary, the company issues a new black color–not Midnight, not Space Black, but Black–with the Apple logo designed by Rob Janoff, the one on the Apple II with the six-color Apple and the “Apple” text logo aligned with the apple bite. Then, when you start this special edition MacBook, you are greeted with a special wallpaper of the <a href=\"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/logopedia/images/2/23/Apple-76.png/revision/latest?cb=20240927100036\">original Apple logo</a> with Sir Isaac Newton sitting under an Apple tree, created by Ronald Wayne. That would be awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has been known to let anniversaries pass by, but it’s not without precedence. In 2017, the iPhone X marked the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, and back in 1997, Apple unveiled special commemorative Mac hardware for the company’s <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/225962/twentieth-anniversary-mac-the-delight-is-in-the-details.html\">20th anniversary</a>, known as the Twentieth Anniversary Mac or TAM. Will Apple surprise us and make a special-edition MacBook for its 50th? I know I’d buy one, even if I had to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2660512/president-trump-us-tariffs-impact-apple-products-price.html\">go into serious debt to do so</a>.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"fbbe923a7cea92d9cc8a98fa9dac3a9b4ff4503f3541e02e75c681de7cbae761","category":"Apple"}
