Emojipedia has created sample designs for the proposed emoji, so these are not the versions that will be used on iPhones, iPads, and Macs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere are 108 new directional emoji, with most of these consisting of people emoji with multiple skin tones. The emoji build on existing person walking, person running, person kneeling, person with white cane, person in manual wheelchair, and person in motorized wheelchair emoji, adding orientation directions like left and right.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEmoji 15.1 characters will be finalized in September 2023, and then Apple, Google, and other device manufacturers will adopt them through future software updates. It often takes Apple several months to introduce new emoji, so while these are set to be approved in September, Apple won't add them to its devices until 2024.
