Eleven months later, the legitimate app was updated to add entirely new functionality. It included the ability to remotely turn on the device mic and record sound, connect to an attacker-controlled server, and upload the audio and other sensitive files that were stored on the device.</p>\n<h2>Surreptitious recording every 15 minutes</h2>\n<p>The secret espionage functions were implemented using code from <a href=\"https://github.com/AhMyth\">AhMyth</a>, an open source RAT (remote access Trojan) that has been incorporated into several other Android apps in recent years. Once the RAT was added to iRecorder, all users of the previously benign app received updates that allowed their phones to record nearby audio and send it to a developer-designated server through an encrypted channel. As time went on, code taken from AhMyth was heavily modified, an indication that the developer became more adept with the open source RAT. ESET named the newly modified RAT in iRecorder AhRat.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1941834#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1941834&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e008d1d20a9ab3f16f0a11f6c4f181de1ae0fdbd5d3bccfa0cc9d8607445dc6e","category":"Tech"}
