Stage 9 of the <a href=\"/tags/vuelta-a-espana\" target=\"_blank\">Vuelta a España</a> was quite a day for <a href=\"/tags/bahrain-victorious\" target=\"_blank\">Bahrain Victorious</a>.</p>\n<p>On the toughest stage of the Vuelta so far it took a while for a breakaway to be established, with the peloton initially raging forward towards the rest day.</p>\n<p>Eventually, with half of the stage already done, a group of talented climbers got away, however just under 30km later, as <a href=\"/tags/team-ineos\" target=\"_blank\">Ineos Grenadiers</a> decided to start pacing it back, Damiano Caruso decided he wanted some alone time.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/913/tour-of-britain-route-riders-live-tv-guide-all-you-need-to-know\">Tour of Britain 2021: Route, teams and all you need to know</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/9974/mark-cavendish-to-race-tour-of-britain\">Mark Cavendish to race Tour of Britain</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 117: on sale now!</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nAttacking solo with 71km and a load of climbing still to go, the <a href=\"/tags/giro-ditalia\" target=\"_blank\">Giro d'Italia</a> runner-up sensed the chase, took his chance and never looked like being pegged back, taking only his second Grand Tour stage win.</p>\n<p>Fans of his team – and Bahraini people – didn't know where to look though, as back down the stunning <a href=\"/in-depth/8891/vuelta-a-espana-classic-climb-alto-de-velefique\" target=\"_blank\">Alto de Velefique</a> team leader Mikel Landa was going backwards, supported by Dauphiné hero Mark Padun and Tour de France KOM nearly-man Wout Poels, while Jack Haig, himself backed by Giro stage winner Gino Mäder, found himself up to fourth overall and just 21 seconds off the podium.</p>\n<p>Landa wasn't the only contender shown up on the mountain though, a series of attacks by Adam Yates and then Enric Mas left a few riders in damage control mode, including Yates himself, who was left to wait – but not too much – for Ineos team leader <a href=\"/tags/egan-bernal\" target=\"_blank\">Egan Bernal</a>.</p>\n<p>Mas came home with <a href=\"/tags/primoz-roglic\" target=\"_blank\">Primož Roglič</a> – who looked like he was playing the game in easy mode, increasing his hold on the red jersey – while teammate Miguel Ángel López tried to chase them back and finished with Yates and Haig around 40 seconds down.</p>\n<p>That was just part of a great day for Movistar, as they hold second and third overall and lead – of course they do – the team classification, while former friends Landa and Richard Carapaz fell back. Watch out for <em>El Jaguar</em> in the coming stages though, not all is at it seems.</p>\n<p>Check out the great Chris Auld's images from the day, including a few that wouldn't look out of place on a Cyclist Big Ride feature:</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/10011/vuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-9-gallery#4\"><p><span>Image 5 of</span> 31</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/08/cauldphoto-vuelta-stage9-0368.jpg?itok=Jj6f8a2v\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 5 of </span>31</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/in-depth/10011/vuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-9-gallery\">Vuelta a Espana 2021 Stage 9 gallery</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/in-depth\">In-depth</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>23 Aug 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F10011%2Fvuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-9-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Vuelta%20a%20Espana%202021%20Stage%209%20gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F10011%2Fvuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-9-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Vuelta%20a%20Espana%202021%20Stage%209%20gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F10011%2Fvuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-9-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Vuelta%20a%20Espana%202021%20Stage%209%20gallery&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F10011%2Fvuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-9-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/10011/vuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-9-gallery#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 31</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/08/cauldphoto-vuelta-stage9-0297.jpg?itok=hrqg0MQz\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"bedf933969d6042dad5bdd270eeb732219d62526c908e51d43d4a61f2adf18f9","category":"Cycling"}
