It might be a bit early to say “best in show” but that didn’t stop me from muttering it to myself today when I walked by the Wolf Tooth booth this morning. My jaw dropped. I’ve been following the work of Apogee since the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2023-made-bike-show-coverage-part-02/\" target=\"_blank\">2023 MADE Bike Show</a> where I documented the brand’s first prototype. Last year, they displayed a whole fleet at <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2024-made-bike-show-part-02/\" target=\"_blank\">MADE</a> and launched an <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/apogee-one-steel-full-suspension/\" target=\"_blank\">initial batch pre-order</a>.
