[...] I answered by reminding viewers of some history:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In 1989, President George H. W. Bush nominated John Tower,\nsenator from Texas, for secretary of defense. Tower was a very\nconsiderable person, a real defense intellectual, someone who\ndeeply understood defense, unlike the current nominee. It emerged\nthat Tower had a drinking problem, and when he was drinking too\nmuch he would make himself a nuisance or worse to women around\nhim. And for that reason, his nomination collapsed in 1989. You\ndon’t want to think that our moral standards have declined so\nmuch that you can say: <em>Let’s take all the drinking, all the\nsex-pesting, subtract any knowledge of defense, subtract any\nleadership, and there is your next secretary of defense for the\n21st century.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I told this story in pungent terms. It’s cable TV, after all. And\nI introduced the discussion with a joke: “If you’re too drunk for\nFox News, you’re very, very drunk indeed.”</p>\n\n<p>At the next ad break, a producer spoke into my ear. He objected to\nmy comments about Fox and warned me not to repeat them. I said\nsomething noncommittal and got another round of warning. After the\nbreak, I was asked a follow-up question on a different topic,\nabout President Joe Biden’s pardon of his son. I did not revert to\nthe earlier discussion, not because I had been warned, but because\nI had said my piece. I was then told that I was excused from the\nstudio chair. Shortly afterward, co-host Mika Brzezinski read an\napology for my remarks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Jesus. The abject obsequiousness is staggering. Yes, it’s a joke at Fox News’s expense. But Fox News — on-air — has indeed been backing Hegseth’s nomination, even though it’s quite obvious that everyone who works there knows he has an alcohol problem. <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/pete-hegseths-drinking-worried-colleagues-fox-news-sources-tell-nbc-ne-rcna181471\">From that NBC News report</a> (note that despite their names, the MSNBC and NBC News newsrooms are no longer associated):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for defense\nsecretary, drank in ways that concerned his colleagues at Fox\nNews, according to 10 current and former Fox employees who spoke\nwith NBC News. Two of those people said that on more than a dozen\noccasions during Hegseth’s time as a co-host of <em>Fox &amp; Friends\nWeekend</em>, which began in 2017, they smelled alcohol on him before\nhe went on air. Those same two people, plus another, said that\nduring his time there he appeared on television after they’d heard\nhim talk about being hungover as he was getting ready or on set.</p>\n\n<p>One of the sources said they smelled alcohol on him as recently\nas last month and heard him complain about being hungover this\nfall. None of the sources with whom NBC News has spoken could\nrecall an instance when Hegseth missed a scheduled appearance\nbecause he’d been drinking. “Everyone would be talking about it\nbehind the scenes before he went on the air,” one of the former\nFox employees said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note too that <em>Fox &amp; Friends Weekend</em> airs at 6:00 <em>in the morning</em>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/05/frum-msnbc\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"79455ec1b23e5e88ba56cb4c88d8fb0c754a69d9cae39e3010ed0be32a8b65f2","category":"Tech"}
