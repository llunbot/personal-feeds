It could also adopt Apple's in-house 5G chip that has been under development for a number of years as Apple has sought to break free from Qualcomm as its cellular chip supplier.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>iPhone 15 USB-C Cables Without MFi Badge May Have Data Transfer and Charging Speed Limits</h2>\r<br />\nWhile Apple is expected to replace the Lightning port with a USB-C port on the iPhone 15 lineup later this year, the company <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/28/iphone-15-usb-c-accessories-limited-without-mfi/\">may still limit the functionality of cables and accessories</a> that aren't certified under its MFi program.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/05/iPhone-15-to-Switch-From-Lightning-to-USB-C-in-2023-feature.jpg\" alt width=\"2621\" height=\"1475\" />\r<br />\nApple's MFi program uses a special authentication chip in approved accessories to ensure their authenticity and reassure customers that the products are safe to use with their Apple devices. The authentication could, however, also be used to limit the functionality of non-MFi accessories such as with data transfer and/or charging speeds.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to leaker \"ShrimpApplePro,\" Apple's manufacturing partner Foxconn is already moving forward with mass production on USB-C cables and accessories under Apple's MFi program.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Everything New in iOS 16.4 Beta 2: Apple Books Changes, Apple Music Classical Mentions, Apple Pay in South Korea and More</h2>\r<br />\nApple this week released the second developer and public beta versions of an upcoming iOS 16.4 update, and we've discovered <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/28/everything-new-ios-16-4-beta-2/\">some additional changes</a> since the first beta.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/01/iOS-16.4-Feature-Red.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nOne of the most notable changes is a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/28/ios-16-4-apple-books-page-turning-animation/\">return of the \"curl\" page-turning animation in Apple Books</a> that was removed in iOS 16.0. Code in the new beta also hints that Apple is getting closer to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/28/apple-music-classical-code-ios-16-4-beta-2/\">launching its promised Apple Music Classical app</a>, while there are some additional tweaks in the Settings app under AppleCare device coverage and Always On Display.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>iPhone 15 Pro Max Could Have Thinner Camera Bump and Smaller Footprint</h2>\r<br />\nThe iPhone 15 Pro Max will be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/25/iphone-15-pro-max-smaller-camera-and-footprint/\">thicker than its predecessor</a> despite having a slightly reduced height and width, but it could offer a less protrusive camera rear array, according to newly shared CAD renders and dimensions.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/ice-universe-iphone-15-pro-max-cad-render.jpeg\" alt width=\"1966\" height=\"1194\" />\r<br />\nAccording to dimensions from leaker \"Ice Universe,\" the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max's footprint is approximately 1 mm smaller both in terms of height and width compared to the ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ Max, but it is 5% thicker. The CAD renders and accompanying dimensions suggest that the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max will have a less protrusive camera bump than previously expected, being 0.59 mm shallower than that of the ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ Max.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Reportedly Has Secretive 'Startup' Team Working on Experimental Technologies for Future Devices</h2>\r<br />\nWhile we learned last week that a secretive \"Exploratory Design Group\" within Apple has had success with non-invasive blood glucose monitoring, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman this week <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/27/apple-secretive-team-working-on-experimental-tech/\">shared more information about how this group known as \"XDG\" operates</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/05/apple-park-at-night-1.jpg\" alt width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nXDG includes only a few hundred people and operates as a \"startup\" working on a number of different projects. Group members are organized by skill set and may work on multiple projects simultaneously, but XDG members are not permitted to discuss their work with others in the group who are not working on that specific project.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe group is said to be working on next-generation display technology, artificial intelligence, low-processor technologies, next-generation batteries for smartphones, and health features for headset devices to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/27/apple-ar-vr-headset-eye-disease/\">help people with eye diseases</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>MacRumors Newsletter</h3>\r<br />\nEach week, we publish an email newsletter like this highlighting the top Apple stories, making it a great way to get a bite-sized recap of the week hitting all of the major topics we've covered and tying together related stories for a big-picture view.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSo if you want to have <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/macrumors/mar-2-2023\">top stories</a> like the above recap delivered to your email inbox each week, <b><a href=\"http://eepurl.com/OHdUX\">subscribe to our newsletter</a></b>!<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/top-stories/\">Top Stories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/04/top-stories-yellow-iphone-14/\">Top Stories: Yellow iPhone 14 Next Week?, iPhone SE 4 and iPhone 15 Rumors, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/top-stories-yellow-iphone-14-next-week-iphone-se-4-and-iphone-15-rumors-and-more.2382717/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"MacRumors Staff","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0852bef61ba98cbd9a7be17c2262584b8a11b7317f2efd9965a54d52bc275083","category":"Apple"}
