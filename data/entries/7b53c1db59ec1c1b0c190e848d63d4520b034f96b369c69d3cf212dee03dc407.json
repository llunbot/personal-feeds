To keep things tidy, Arc Search also archives tabs after a user-defined period, and blocks GDPR  banners and ads/trackers automatically. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>a little Sunday surprise for you...<br /><br />meet <a href=\"https://twitter.com/browsercompany?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@browsercompany</a>'s 2nd product:<br /><br />üîçArc Searchüîé<br /><br />it's a default browser for your iPhone<br />...that BROWSES FOR YOU<br /><br />the origin story is a bit unusual so I wanted to give you the full backstory: <a href=\"https://t.co/pkVQJYN0QQ\">pic.twitter.com/pkVQJYN0QQ</a></p>‚Äî Josh Miller (@joshm) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joshm/status/1751734580124787028?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 28, 2024</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nArc Search is available for free on the App Store [<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/arc-search/id6472513080\">Direct Link</a>] and requires iOS 16 or later, while Arc Browser for Mac can be downloaded from the <a href=\"https://arc.net\">company's website</a>.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/29/arc-search-iphone-app-ai/\">Arc Search for iPhone Merges AI and Web Search in a Browser App</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/arc-search-for-iphone-merges-ai-and-web-search-in-a-browser-app.2417739/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7b53c1db59ec1c1b0c190e848d63d4520b034f96b369c69d3cf212dee03dc407","category":"Apple"}
