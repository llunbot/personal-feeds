It's not just reliable engines, computers, and sophisticated guidance algorithms. There's also the launch pad, and perhaps even more of an afterthought to casual observers, the roads, bridges, pipelines, and electrical infrastructure required to keep a spaceport humming.</p>\n<p>Brig. Gen. Kristin Panzenhagen, commander of the Space Force's Eastern Range at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, calls this the \"non-sexy stuff that we can't launch without.\" Much of the ground infrastructure at Cape Canaveral and Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, the military's other launch range, is antiquated and needs upgrades or expansion.</p>\n<p>“Things like roads, bridges, even just the entry into the base, the gate, communications infrastructure, power, we’re looking at overhauling and modernizing all of that because we really haven’t done a tech refresh on all of that in a very long time, at least 20 years, if not more,\" said Col. James Horne, deputy director for the Space Force's assured access to space directorate.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995665#p3\">Read 28 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995665&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"70d9a14dee0f5e8784a8e739333269ac4ecd5ca92365912798d8e1b69c9b965e","category":"Tech"}
