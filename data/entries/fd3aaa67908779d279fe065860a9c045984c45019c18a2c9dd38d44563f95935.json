{"title":"AWS Weekly Roundup – AWS Dedicated Local Zones, Events and More – August 28, 2023","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-weekly-roundup-aws-dedicated-zones-events-and-more-august-28-2023/","date":1693257234000,"content":"<p>This week, I will meet our customers and partners at the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/es/events/summits/mexico-city/\">AWS Summit Mexico</a>. If you are around, please come say hi at the community lounge and at the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/es/events/summits/mexico-city/f1-gameday/\">F1 Game Day</a> where I will spend most of my time. I would love to discuss your developer experience on AWS and listen to your stories about building on AWS.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Last Week’s Launches</strong></span><br /> I am amazed at how quickly service teams are deploying services to the new <code>il-central-1</code> Region, aka <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-open-aws-israel-tel-aviv-region/\">AWS Israel (Tel-Aviv) Region</a>. I counted no fewer than <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/?whats-new-content-all.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&amp;whats-new-content-all.sort-order=desc&amp;awsf.whats-new-categories=*all&amp;whats-new-content-all.q=tel-aviv&amp;whats-new-content-all.q_operator=AND&amp;awsm.page-whats-new-content-all=2\">25 new service announcements</a> since we opened the Region on August 1, including ten just for last week!</p> \n<p>In addition to these developments in the new Region, here are some launches that got my attention during the previous week.</p> \n<p><strong>AWS Dedicated Local Zones</strong> – Just like <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/localzones/\">Local Zones</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/dedicatedlocalzones/\">Dedicated Local Zones</a> are a type of AWS infrastructure that is fully managed by AWS. Unlike Local Zones, they are built for exclusive use by you or your community and placed in a location or data center specified by you to help comply with regulatory requirements. I think about them as a portion of AWS infrastructure dedicated to my exclusive usage.</p> \n<p><strong>Enhanced search on AWS re:Post</strong> – AWS re:Post is a cloud knowledge service. The enhanced search experience helps you locate answers and discover articles more quickly. Search results are now presenting a consolidated view of all AWS knowledge on re:Post. The view shows AWS Knowledge Center articles, question and answers, and community articles that are relevant to the user’s search query.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon QuickSight supports scheduled programmatic export to Microsoft Excel</strong> – <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight/\">Amazon QuickSight</a> now supports scheduled generation of Excel workbooks by selecting multiple tables and pivot table visuals from any sheet of a dashboard. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/07/amazon-quicksight-snapshot-export-apis/\">Snapshot Export APIs</a> will now also support <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/sending-reports.html\">programmatic export to Excel format,</a> in addition to Paginated PDF and CSV.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon WorkSpaces announced a new client to support Ubuntu 20.04 and 22.04</strong> – The new client, powered by <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/workspaces/wsp/\">WorkSpaces Streaming Protocol</a> (WSP), improves the remote desktop experience by offering enhanced web conferencing functionality, better multi-monitor support, and a more user-friendly interface. To get started, simply download the new Linux client versions from <a href=\"https://clients.amazonworkspaces.com/linux-install\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon WorkSpaces client download website</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon Sagemaker</strong> <strong>CPU/GPU profiler</strong> – We launched the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/announcing-the-preview-of-amazon-sagemaker-profiler-track-and-visualize-detailed-hardware-performance-data-for-your-model-training-workloads/\">preview of Amazon SageMaker Profiler</a>, an advanced observability tool for large deep learning workloads. With this new capability, you are able to access granular compute hardware-related profiling insights for optimizing <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/train/\" target=\"_blank\">model training</a> performance.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon Sagemaker rolling deployments strategy – </strong>You can now update your Amazon SageMaker Endpoints using a rolling deployment strategy. <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/deployment-guardrails-rolling.html\">Rolling deployment</a> makes it easier for you to update fully-scaled endpoints that are deployed on hundreds of popular accelerated compute instances.</p> \n<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/new/\">For a full list of AWS announcements, be sure to keep an eye on the What's New at AWS page.</a> \n<p><span><strong>Other AWS News</strong></span><br /> Some other updates and news that you might have missed:</p> \n<p><strong>On-demand Container Loading in AWS Lambda</strong> – This one is not new from this week, but I spotted it while I was taking a few days of holidays. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/marc-brooker-b431772b/\">Marc Brooker</a> and team were awarded Best Paper by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/usenix-association/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_detail_base%3B%2BRUB%2Fd4%2BQtKzBQdTZCbFMg%3D%3D\">USENIX Association</a> for <a href=\"https://lnkd.in/g5r4ZWNG\">On-demand Container Loading in AWS Lambda</a> (pdf).
