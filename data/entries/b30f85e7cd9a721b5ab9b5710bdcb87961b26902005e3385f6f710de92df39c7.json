A slight change to the production process means that less resin is needed and therefore weight is reduced.</p>\n<p>The result is a newly labelled Xelius Carbon UD SLI frame – the latter being Super Light Innovation. Lapierre says it saves 232g compared to the existing SL2 Team Disc.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://cyclist.b-cdn.net/sites/cyclist/files/2021/12/lapierre_xelius_sl3_vence5.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>In the new range there are three levels to that: Lay-up Light at 725g, Lay-up Stiff at 745g and Lay-up Standard at 845g – all claimed figures. The Light option is for sizes XS to M only, while the Stiff variant is for L and XL.</p>\n<p>There have also been several stiffness-related improvements, with a bigger downtube and bottom bracket as well as wider, asymmetrical chainstays and 1.5in headset bearings. Stiffness levels vary between the different lay-ups but you can probably guess from the naming which is stiffest.</p>\n<p>Lapierre has also taken inspiration from its <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/9015/lapierre-aircode-drs-80-review\" target=\"_blank\">Aircode</a> aero road bike to help give the Xelius – which thanks to its weight is used as a climber by the pros – an extra push on descents. To this end, there are aero profiles on the downtube, seat tube and seat stays, the fork and head tube have had a slight reshaping, the top tube has been given a steeper slope, and cables and hoses have been fully integrated.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://cyclist.b-cdn.net/sites/cyclist/files/2021/12/xelius_sl_9.0_my22_-_view_2.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Lapierre says its CFD modelling and wind tunnel tests have shown an average aerodynamic improvement of 8.5% at 0-20° yaw angles from the SL2 to the SL3, that apparently equates to around 7 watts at 40kmh, 12 watts at 50kmh and 22 watts at 60kmh.</p>\n<p>Other changes include a new more compact and lighter seat clamp, clearance for 32mm tyres, a new smaller Trap Door for Di2 access, and a lowering of the overall centre of gravity through lower bottle cage and Di2 battery positions.</p>\n<h2>Lapierre Xelius SL3 geometry</h2>\n<div>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://cyclist.b-cdn.net/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/12/lapierre_xelius_sl3_geometry.png?itok=X0lIjLDE\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Geometry changes have also been inspired by the Aircode thanks to feedback from Lapierre's pro partners, meaning improved aerodynamics and overall performance.</p>\n<p>While reach has been lengthened, the frame has been made more compact. The top tube is very slightly shorter top tube on most sizes, and also slopes more, meaning more exposed seat post to flex over bumps, an important feature as the Xelius is what both FDJ teams use for the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/1037/carved-in-stone-the-appeal-of-cobbled-classics\" target=\"_blank\">cobbled classics</a>.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/10325/lapierre-xelius-sl-2022\">2022 Lapierre Xelius SL3: Versatile race bike range gets new lay-ups and across the board refinements</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/9815/david-gaudu-and-groupama-fdjs-new-lapierre-xelius-sl\">David Gaudu and Groupama-FDJ's new Lapierre Xelius SL</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/buying-guides/4343/best-road-bike\">Best road bikes: the best bikes on the market from under £1,000 to over £10,000</a></div>    </div></div><h2><span>Lapierre Xelius SL3 specs and pricing</span></h2>\n<h3>Lapierre Xelius SL 5.0</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://cyclist.b-cdn.net/sites/cyclist/files/2021/12/xelius_sl_5.0_my22_-_view_1.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Groupset: </strong>Shimano 105</li>\n<li><strong>Wheels: </strong>Lapierre Road disc Alloy</li>\n<li><strong>Tyres: </strong>Continental Ultra Sport 3 SL 700×25</li>\n<li><strong>Saddle: </strong>Selle Italia X3 boost</li>\n<li><strong>Price: </strong>£2,699</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Lapierre Xelius SL 6.0</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://cyclist.b-cdn.net/sites/cyclist/files/2021/12/xelius_sl_6.0_my22_-_view_1.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Groupset: </strong>Shimano Ultegra</li>\n<li><strong>Wheels: </strong>DT Swiss E1800 Spline32</li>\n<li><strong>Tyres: </strong>Schwalbe One Raceguard Tubeless Easy 700×25</li>\n<li><strong>Saddle: </strong>Prologo Dimension</li>\n<li><strong>Price: </strong>£3,199</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Lapierre Xelius SL 7.0</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://cyclist.b-cdn.net/sites/cyclist/files/2021/12/xelius_sl_7.0_mineral_gray_my22_-_view_1.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Groupset: </strong>Shimano Ultegra Di2</li>\n<li><strong>Wheels: </strong>DT Swiss E1800 Spline32</li>\n<li><strong>Tyres: </strong>Schwalbe One Raceguard Tubeless Easy 700×25</li>\n<li><strong>Saddle: </strong>Fizik Argo Vento R5</li>\n<li><strong>Price: </strong>£4,399</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Lapierre Xelius SL 8.0</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://cyclist.b-cdn.net/sites/cyclist/files/2021/12/xelius_sl_8.0_my22_-_view_1.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Groupset: </strong>Shimano Ultegra Di2</li>\n<li><strong>Wheels: </strong>Lapierre Road Disc 38</li>\n<li><strong>Tyres: </strong>Continental GP5000 S TR 700×25</li>\n<li><strong>Saddle: </strong>Fizik Argo Vento R5</li>\n<li><strong>Price: </strong>£5,399</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Lapierre Xelius SL 9.0</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://cyclist.b-cdn.net/sites/cyclist/files/2021/12/xelius_sl_9.0_my22_-_view_1.jpg\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Groupset: </strong>Shimano Dura-Ace Di2</li>\n<li><strong>Wheels: </strong>Lapierre Road Disc 38</li>\n<li><strong>Tyres: </strong>Continental GP5000 S TR 700×25</li>\n<li><strong>Saddle: </strong>Fizik Argo Vento R5</li>\n<li><strong>Price: </strong>£6,999</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Image credits: Lapierre</em> </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/bikes\">Bikes</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"wstrickson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"b30f85e7cd9a721b5ab9b5710bdcb87961b26902005e3385f6f710de92df39c7","category":"Cycling"}
