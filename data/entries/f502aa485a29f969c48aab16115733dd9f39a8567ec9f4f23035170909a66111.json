The quantization slightly reduces accuracy, but it maintains all parameters and delivers approximately 17-18 tokens per second, which is sufficient for many practical applications.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPerhaps most impressively, the Mac Studio accomplishes this while consuming under 200 watts of power. Comparable performance on traditional PC hardware would require multiple GPUs drawing approximately ten times more electricity.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe capability to run such advanced AI models locally offers privacy advantages for sensitive applications like healthcare data analysis, where sending information to cloud services raises security concerns.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nHowever, this performance doesn't come cheap â€“ a Mac Studio configured with M3 Ultra and 512GB of RAM starts at around $10,000. Fully maxed out, an M3 Ultra Mac Studio with 16TB of SSD storage and an Apple M3 Ultra chip with 32-core CPU, 80-core GPU, and 32-core Neural Engine costs <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/maxed-out-m3-ultra-mac-studio-14099/\">a cool $14,099</a>. Of course, for organizations requiring local AI processing of sensitive data, the Mac Studio offers a relatively power-efficient solution compared to alternative hardware configurations.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple says the M3 Ultra is the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/apple-introduces-m3-ultra-chip/\">fastest Mac chip it has ever released</a>, thanks to its strategy of fusing two M3 Max chips together using the company's \"UltraFusion\" technology. This makes the chip's specs double that of the M3 Max. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/\">Mac Studio</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac-Studio\">Mac Studio (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-studio.237\">Mac Studio</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/apples-m3-ultra-runs-deepseek-r1-efficiently/\">Mac Studio With M3 Ultra Runs Massive DeepSeek R1 AI Model Locally</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mac-studio-with-m3-ultra-runs-massive-deepseek-r1-ai-model-locally.2453311/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f502aa485a29f969c48aab16115733dd9f39a8567ec9f4f23035170909a66111","category":"Apple"}
