As a proof of concept, the team engineered a small robotic face capable of smiling, covered entirely with a layer of pink living tissue.</p>\n\n<p>The researchers note that using living skin tissue as a robot covering has benefits, as it's flexible enough to convey emotions and can potentially repair itself. \"As the role of robots continues to evolve, the materials used to cover social robots need to exhibit lifelike functions, such as self-healing,\" wrote the researchers in the study.</p>\n<p>Shoji Takeuchi, Michio Kawai, Minghao Nie, and Haruka Oda authored the study, titled \"<a href=\"https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-physical-science/fulltext/S2666-3864(24)00335-7?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2666386424003357%3Fshowall%3Dtrue#\">Perforation-type anchors inspired by skin ligament for robotic face covered with living skin</a>,\" which is due for July publication in <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/cell-reports-physical-science/home\">Cell Reports Physical Science</a>.
