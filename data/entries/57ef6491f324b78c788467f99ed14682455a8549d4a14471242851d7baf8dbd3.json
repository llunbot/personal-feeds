First- and 2nd-generation Kindle and Kindle DX devices had no Wi-Fi support, relying solely on free 3G connectivity to reach Amazon—which is a real problem for those devices, since US mobile network operators will begin reclaiming 2G and 3G frequency bands for use with 4G and 5G this year.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/amazon-download-via-usb.png\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/amazon-download-via-usb-640x185.png\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/amazon-download-via-usb.png\">If all else fails, you should still be able to download books to your older Kindle by connecting it to a PC via its charge cable.</a> (credit: Jim Salter)</p></div>\n<p>Owners of 1st- and 2nd-generation Kindles should still be able to use the \"Manage Your Content and Devices\" <a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/hz/mycd/digital-console/contentlist/booksAll/dateDsc/\">page</a> on Amazon to transfer books to Internet-orphaned Kindles via USB cable, but that's hardly convenient compared to the devices' original promise of freedom from wires and Wi-Fi passwords alike.</p>\n<p>First-gen Kindle owners can get a free 10th-gen Kindle Oasis and cover, and 2nd-gen Kindle and Kindle DX owners are eligible for $70 off a new Kindle Paperwhite or Kindle Oasis, plus $25 in e-book credits—but you'll need to use a promo code from the email Amazon sent in order to qualify. Without the promo code, Amazon only offers 1st-generation Kindle owners a $5.00 Amazon gift card.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1784320#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1784320&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"57ef6491f324b78c788467f99ed14682455a8549d4a14471242851d7baf8dbd3","category":"Tech"}
