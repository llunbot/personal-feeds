Before that, she took two years to recover from a traumatic brain injury (TBI) sustained when she crashed in a professional road race in 2016.</p>\n<p>When she was leading out a teammate for a sprint, her handlebar got tangled in metal fencing on the side of the road. She flipped forward onto her head.</p>\n<p>Due to post-traumatic amnesia, she has no recollection of the crash or of the three weeks she spent in intensive care afterwards.</p>\n<p>“I think not being able to remember those first three weeks really helped me because I feel like it’s your body’s way of protecting itself,” says De Crescenzo.</p>\n<p>“My brain took about two years to get back to a new state of normal.”</p>\n<p>Only then did she successfully attempt a full return to road cycling.</p>\n<h2>Talk about it</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Specialized and Globe bike designer Erik Nohlin\" title=\"Globe-Press-Kit-23\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Nohlin felt his inability to ride negatively impacted his personal and professional life.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Globe</i></span></div>\n<p>All four riders we spoke to say therapy helped them recover from the mental consequences of their crashes.</p>\n<p>For De Crescenzo and Nohlin, the worst consequence of their TBI was depression.</p>\n<p>Therapy sessions taught Nohlin he had been through a “near-death experience”.</p>\n<p>He would “freeze up” while cycling and eventually avoided bikes altogether. His therapist told him this was because he had realised the damage riding a bike could do to him.</p>\n<p>For a bike designer and accomplished long-distance cyclist, this resulted in a “complete loss of identity”.</p>\n<p>Eight months on from the crash, following several failed attempts to restart cycling, Nohlin was referred to a psychotherapist.</p>\n<p>Using a therapy technique called ‘habit control’, Nohlin gradually began riding again.</p>\n<p>Ian Boswell, who won the men’s Unbound 200 in 2021, also says therapy helped him deal with the uncertainty surrounding his return to the bike.</p>\n<p>Having been forced to retire from the WorldTour at the age of 28, therapy enabled him to feel satisfied with what he’d achieved to date.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"LA-PLAINE-TONIQUE, FRANCE - JULY 31: Michael Valgren of Denmark and Team EF-Easypost competes during the 35th Tour de l'Ain 2023, Stage 1 a 154km stage from Loyettes to La Plaine Tonique on July 31, 2023 in La Plaine Tonique, France.\" title=\"35th Tour de l'Ain 2023 - Stage 1\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Valgren pulled through tough spells on his journey back to the WorldTour.</span></figcaption><span> <i> Luc Claessen/Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p><span>Valgren, meanwhile, says he tends to be a “closed book” and his wife, who is a psychologist, helped him open up. </span></p>\n<p><span>Without the support of his team, sports psychologist and family, the EF Education-EasyPost pro says: “I could have fallen into a black hole, I could have got depressed.”</span></p>\n<p><span>De Crescenzo used a combination of occupational and speech therapy at a rehabilitation centre and physiotherapy at a hospital. </span></p>\n<p><span>She says studying to qualify as an epidemiologist provided a welcome distraction from her inability to race. </span></p>\n<p><span>But speaking to other cyclists helped with the final step of recovery, according to De Crescenzo. </span></p>\n<p><span>“Talking to other cyclists is how I got back on the bike.</span></p>\n<p><span>“</span>For me at least, that might even have been more valuable than talking to a therapist,” she says.</p>\n<p>De Crescenzo says restarting road cycling with a former professional, Timmy Duggan, who recovered from a TBI helped her regain confidence.</p>\n<p>“That’s why I’m very open to talking about my experience to other cyclists who go through the same thing.</p>\n<p>“Lots of people reach out to me for inspiration.
