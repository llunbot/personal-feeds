It should also enable the wheels to track the terrain more effectively, boosting traction and helping to absorb impacts better.</p>\n<p>Zipp says it has accomplished this thanks to the proprietary carbon layup used to create the new rims.</p>\n<p>The wheels are wider than most contemporary XC wheelsets at 30mm wide. The range-topping DT Swiss XRC wheelset is 25mm wide, for example.</p>\n<p>Zipp recommends the new rims are paired with tyres 2.3 to 2.5in wide.</p>\n<h3>Lightweight hubs</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"ZIPP new 1Zero Hitop mountain bike wheelset\" title=\"Zipp 1Zero Hitop wheels - ZIPP front hub\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Skinny hubs are laced with 24 J-bend Sapim CX Ray spokes at the front and rear.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The top-spec 1Zero Hitop SW wheelset is built around Zipp’s new ZM2 SL hubs.</p>\n<p>The six-pawl hub offers 66 points of engagement – the same as Zipp’s ZR1 road hubs.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"ZIPP new 1Zero Hitop mountain bike wheelset\" title=\"Zipp 1Zero Hitop wheels - Rear hub\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The ‘SW’ wheelset features the new ZM2 SL hubs.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The hubs use a centre-lock rotor mount to reduce weight.</p>\n<p>This wheel is available with either regular end caps or broader Torque Caps, which are said to improve the connection between the fork and wheel.</p>\n<p>The 1Zero Hitop S wheels use Zipp’s ZM900 hubs.</p>\n<p>They share the same rims and also use 24 spokes in each wheel – Sapim CX Sprint J-bend spokes in this case.</p>\n<p>The four-pawl ZM900 rear hub has 52 points of engagement.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"ZIPP new 1Zero Hitop mountain bike wheelset\" title=\"Zipp 1Zero Hitop wheels - ZIPP centre lock\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> To help save weight on the top-spec wheel, the ZM2 SL hubs use a centre-lock disc rotor mount.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The AM900 hubs use six-bolt rotor mounts.</p>\n<p>Both hubs come with either XD-Driver or Microspline freehub options.</p>\n<p>Zipp offers a lifetime warranty on its rims and wheelsets, though it’s worth noting that there is a total system weight limit of 130kg for both wheelsets.</p>\n<h3>TyreWiz 2.0</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"ZIPP new 1Zero Hitop mountain bike wheelset\" title=\"Zipp 1Zero Hitop wheels - ZIPP logo\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The top-spec wheelset includes TyreWiz pressure gauges as stock. </span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The top-spec 1Zero Hitop SW wheelset includes a pair of updated TyreWiz 2.0 air pressure gauges as standard.</p>\n<p>These neat little units use an integrated valve and sit flush on the inside of your rim, measuring your tyre pressure on the fly.</p>\n<p>Small blinking lights on each TyreWiz unit indicate whether your tyres are set to your preferred pressures (green means they’re fine, slow blinking red means the pressure is too low, while fast blinking red lights mean they’re too firm).</p>\n<p>Pressure readouts are now available in bar or PSI (in 0.1psi increments) and accuracy is now said to be even better at +/- 2 per cent.</p>\n<p>This latest iteration is also said to offer increased adaptability to more rim shapes thanks to the different length valve stems and different shaped rubber grommets.</p>\n<p>The pressure sensors are available to buy as a pair for £130.</p>\n<h2>Range overview</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"ZIPP new 1Zero Hitop mountain bike wheelset\" title=\"Zipp 1Zero Hitop wheels - Zipp 1Zero Hitop\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The new 1Zero Hitops carbon wheels come in two models – the ‘S’ or top-spec ‘SW’ as seen here.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>There are two different versions of the 1Zero Hitop wheels available.
