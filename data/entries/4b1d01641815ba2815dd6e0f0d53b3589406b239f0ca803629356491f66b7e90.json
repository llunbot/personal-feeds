They keep your desk clear of unnecessary cords, and it's now easy to find one with advanced capabilities, a nice set of programmable buttons, and the ability to hold a reliable connection. Some people use a wireless mouse to control a distant system—like a media PC, for example—and are interested in mice that not only cut the cord but the volume as well.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/pop-wireless-mouse.910-006544.html\" target=\"_blank\">Logitech Pop Mouse</a> is aimed at that latter crowd. But before you notice its absence of cable and ability to easily toggle across three devices paired with Bluetooth, you'll see the daring color options that scream \"vibrant\" in all their plastic glory.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/pop-wireless-mouse.910-006544.html#buy-pop-wireless-mouse\" target=\"_blank\">Priced at $40</a>, the Pop Mouse also boasts an \"emoji button\" directly under the scroll wheel, pushing the device toward a young demographic. But that emoji button is programmable, so the Pop Mouse can still be a viable option for advanced users looking for a secondary or travel mouse. Just don't rely on this diminutive, flatter, more limited mouse for your next big Photoshop project.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1809218#p3\">Read 32 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1809218&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4b1d01641815ba2815dd6e0f0d53b3589406b239f0ca803629356491f66b7e90","category":"Tech"}
