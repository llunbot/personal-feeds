It will then help you find a bicycle retailer who can do the work for you.</p>\n<p>Full details can be found <a href=\"https://www.opencycle.com/recalls/campagnolohydraulicbrake\">on the Open website</a>.</p>\n<hr /><p><strong><em>Update 5 April 2023: </em>Campagnolo has issued the following statement in response to the recall of Ekar-equipped Open bicycles:</strong></p>\n<p>“Open Cycles AG has initiated a voluntary recall for select models of its bicycles and frames equipped with Campagnolo hydraulic brake hoses.</p>\n<p>“Campagnolo encourages everyone to strictly follow the instructions provided by Open Cycle in its recall notice.</p>\n<p>“However, as a point of clarification, the recall notices suggest that the recall is due to some deficiency in the Campagnolo hoses.  This suggestion is inaccurate.  The Campagnolo hoses meet and exceed the requirements of all applicable standards, are not in any way defective, and did not cause this recall.</p>\n<p>“The cause of the recall is directly related to the “Multistop” inserts used in the recalled frames.  These inserts are too narrow, thereby bending the Campagnolo hoses far beyond the limits as specified in Section 4.3 of Campagnolo’s instruction manual.</p>\n<p>“The responsibility of the “Multistop” inserts for this recall is confirmed by the corrective action plan:  the existing inserts with narrow holes are being replaced with new inserts.  Campagnolo did not design, manufacture, sell or specify the inserts.”</p>\n<p> </p>","author":"Stan Portus","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"2af0b8acc81089f3b4febd66f7d1fab55714b49ec2768c0958d543fd1283372f","category":"Cycling"}
