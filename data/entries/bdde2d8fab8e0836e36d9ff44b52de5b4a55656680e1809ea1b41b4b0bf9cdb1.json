The dosage is just a third of the 30-microgram doses given to people ages 12 and above.</p>\n<p>One month after the second dose, researchers measured the children's levels of antibodies able to neutralize the SARS-CoV-2 virus in a lab experiment. The geometric mean titer of antibody in the 5 to 11 year olds was 1,197.6 (95 percent confidence interval of 1,106.1 to 1,296.6), which is comparable to the geometric mean titer of 1,146.5 seen in people ages 16 to 25.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1796679#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1796679&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bdde2d8fab8e0836e36d9ff44b52de5b4a55656680e1809ea1b41b4b0bf9cdb1","category":"Tech"}
