Large solar arrays in geostationary orbit collect solar energy and beam it back to Earth via microwaves as a continuous source of clean energy.</p>\n<p>However, implementing this technology is not so simple. In recent years, in search of long-term power solutions and concerned about climate change, the European Space Agency has been studying space-based solar power. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/08/european-space-chief-says-continent-will-lead-in-space-based-solar-power/\">Some initial studies found</a> that a plan to meet one-third of Europe's energy needs would require massive amounts of infrastructure and cost hundreds of billions of dollars. At best, such a system of very large satellites in geostationary space might come online by the middle of this century.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/solar-power-from-space-actually-it-might-happen-in-a-couple-of-years/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/solar-power-from-space-actually-it-might-happen-in-a-couple-of-years/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"90e3d06bf3b434278f2af8eb476e3f002bf9fe41b89bbb9bbfd9982279e89985","category":"Tech"}
