So, it re-branded to Off Course in 2024.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Off-Course-Bike-Shop-139.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Off-Course-Bike-Shop-139.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Off-Course-Bike-Shop-139.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Off-Course-Bike-Shop-139.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Off-Course-Bike-Shop-139.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Staples</h3>\n<p>Off Course is a modern shop that still believes in having a dense stock of everyday staples. Being in Australia, they bring in many brands from the United States, and it’s cheaper to bring in sizable orders rather than one-off deliveries. Lining the walls of Off Course, you’ll find every spec and color available, displayed in ways that make this ex-architect froth with his camera.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Off-Course-Bike-Shop-21.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Off-Course-Bike-Shop-21.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Off-Course-Bike-Shop-21.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Off-Course-Bike-Shop-21.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Off-Course-Bike-Shop-21.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Buildout</h3>\n<p>Photographing (and designing) spaces used to be my full-time gig, so I like to flex the skills I learned documenting <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/2013/03/08/skyhouse-with-an-indoor-slide-by-david-hotson-and-ghislaine-vinas/\" target=\"_blank\">my old architecture projects</a> when I walk into a space like Off Course.
