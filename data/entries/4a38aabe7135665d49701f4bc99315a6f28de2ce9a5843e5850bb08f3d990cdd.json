Normally scavenger hunt races in LA take you through the busy streets of downtown, but not for this race. Instead, the goal is to get you out of the big city, taking participants deep into the mountains to places many didn’t know were accessible by bike.</p>\n<p>The LA Tourist Race is fewer rules and more fun. It’s more of an if it rolls, then race it vibe. Aero bars probably won’t help, but if you want them, Mike and the team won’t stop you from rolling into the fun. No race license, just show up on whatever bike you have and go. Race it, ride it or just be part of the before and after party, it doesn’t matter.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lat-Mike-1340x1005.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"1005\" /></p>\n<figure></figure>\n<p>LA Tourist Race is celebrating its fifth year, and this is the second one of the series. For race two, SoCal has finally gotten some much-needed rain and snow so the water crossings are ragging. While this has limited some of Mike’s favorite mountaintop peaks, we will likely still ride through a bit of snow and plenty of water. However, the recent rain has already scared many even though the overall distance is fairly short when compared to years in the past.</p>\n<p>The race starts on March 11th at <a href=\"https://www.letsridecyclery.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Let’s Ride Cyclery</strong></a> in Burbank, Ca, on Hollywood way between the Chandler bike path and Magnolia Blvd. Also about half a block from the famous <a href=\"https://www.portosbakery.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Porto’s Bakery</strong></a>.</p>\n<h2><strong>THE FORMAT</strong></h2>\n<p>The race is a scavenger hunt style with four checkpoints. Since you can do the stops in any order, with the only real set rule being you must start and finish at the <a href=\"https://www.letsridecyclery.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Let’s Ride Cyclery</strong></a> &amp; LA Tourist HQ in Burbank. The race starts at 8 am on Saturday, March 11th, 2023.</p>\n<h2><strong>THE ROUTE</strong></h2>\n<p>The checkpoints will be released a few days before the race to registered participants. The best part is building route options while debating if the roads and trails you have chosen will be rideable. Overall expect a tough yet fun experience no matter what route or category you have chosen. For this second race, our route is 50 miles (80 km) with 7,550 ft (2300 m) of climbing.</p>\n<div>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/LAT2023-2-1340x532.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"532\" /></figure>\n</div>\n<h2><strong>TROY’S BIKE CHOICE</strong></h2>\n<p>I have chosen a bike with a Lauf Grit fork, the new Lauf Siegla. A set of light but durable WTB CZR I23 wheels. Tires have not been chosen yet, but the Kenda Booster Pro tires in size 40mm should be a good all-around choice. For gears, a SRAM AXS XPLR 1x system. There is a 40t crankset matched with a 10-44t cassette.</p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Lauf-AXS-force-1x-1340x1005.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"1005\" /></figure>\n<p>As a backup in case it rains the entire night before the race, the XC mountain bike with larger 2.3 tires and more climbing-friendly gears might get called in. The mountain bike has a 32t chainring matched to a 10-50t SRAM AXS Eagle cassette. With the damp and steep climbs, the extra range might be the difference between riding and hiking certain sections. We will have to see what mother nature brings.</p>\n<p>With so much water and the likelihood of having to shoulder the bike a lot, no frame bag this year. Temperatures will likely be in the 50s, but the shade and canyons will be in the low 40s, so a jacket or vest and arm warmers should be all we need. And some dry sock at the finish.</p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/LAT-2023-scout-1340x1787.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"1787\" /></figure>\n<h3><strong>THE NEXT RACE</strong></h3>\n<p>If you can’t make it to race #2, no worries.
