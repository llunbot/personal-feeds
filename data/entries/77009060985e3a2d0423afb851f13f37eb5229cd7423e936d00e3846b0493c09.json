The move is likely an effort to limit online cheating that can be enabled by certain external devices, but it seems set to have unintended consequences for communities that rely on adapters for more legitimate users.</p>\n<p>In recent days, users on sites like <a href=\"https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-will-start-banning-unofficial-third-party-controllers-in-november.777461/\">ResetEra</a> and <a href=\"https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xboxs-new-policy-say-goodbye-to-unofficial-accessories-after-november\">Windows Central</a> began reporting encounters with \"error 0x82d60002\" when they plug certain accessories into their Xbox. An on-screen message appearing alongside that error indicates that \"using unauthorized accessories compromises your gaming experience\" and refers users to <a href=\"https://www.xbox.com/en-US/accessories\">Microsoft's list of officially supported accessories</a>.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/errors/error-code-0x82d60002\">recently added Xbox support note</a> clarifies that the error appears when \"one of the accessories you’re trying to connect was not manufactured by Microsoft or another licensed Xbox hardware partner.\" After the error appears, Microsoft says that \"you’ll have two weeks to use the accessory, after which time it will then be blocked from use with the console. At that time, you’ll receive error code 0x82d60003. We encourage you to contact the store or manufacturer where you obtained the accessory to get help with returning it.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1979691#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1979691&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"77009060985e3a2d0423afb851f13f37eb5229cd7423e936d00e3846b0493c09","category":"Tech"}
