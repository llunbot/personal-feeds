{"title":"Google Fi Still Doesn’t Fully Support RCS Either","link":"https://support.google.com/fi/answer/6188337?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid","date":1734380097000,"content":"\n<p>A few weeks ago, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/04/shame-on-google-messages\">in a post</a> primarily complaining about Google’s disingenuous claims about their Messages app’s support for encryption (they suggest, heavily, that it encrypts every message or most messages, but fact only supports encryption for RCS message sent between users of Google Messages on Android devices), I also complained about the fact that Google’s own Google Voice doesn’t support RCS at all.</p>\n\n<p>Turns out Google Fi doesn’t support RCS fully either. Google Fi is Google’s cellular phone service. I actually use it to provide service to my Android burner phone. The prices are excellent and the service is fine for my minimal needs for a phone I barely use. But Google Fi offers something called “<a href=\"https://support.google.com/fi/answer/6188337?hl=en&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid\">call and voicemail sync</a>” that lets Fi users make and answer voice calls through the web. If you enable this, you lose RCS. See Reddit threads <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleFi/comments/1eoe76k/the_year_is_2024_and_you_still_cant_use_rcs_and/\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleFi/comments/14gm7zo/to_sync_or_not_to_sync/\">here</a> with Fi fans complaining about it.</p>\n\n<p>It’s just wild to me that Google would spend years <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/9/23297951/google-apple-rcs-adoption-campaign-getthemessage-blue-green-messages\">waging a campaign</a> urging Apple to support RCS, yet Google itself doesn’t support RCS in its own products.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/16/google-fi-rcs-sync\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"885661d6c85fad5bd22b9230e261ebb8cc24c94e3e85c71357be1fc66fed6ca4","category":"Tech"}
