The trick is knowing when you should buy a new iPhone. Luckily we are here to help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we answer all of your questions about when you should and shouldn’t buy a new iPhone – including advice on when Apple is likely to discount the price of older iPhone handsets. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Looking for to buy a new iPhone right now? In February 2025 Apple discontinued the iPhone SE and iPhone 14 and added the iPhone 16e to the line up. The next update isn’t expected until September 2025, so as long as you aren’t considering shopping in July or August 2024, it is a good time to buy. But, if you are hoping to take advantage of some good discounts, you might want to wait to see if Amazon often holds a Spring Sale in March and one in July. The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2382944/best-iphone-prime-day-deals-october-2024.html\">October Prime Day sale</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1375699/best-iphone-cyber-monday-deals-2024.html\">Black Friday</a> later in the year are also good opportunities to save some money. You can save all year round though, take a look at our round up of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672801/best-iphone-deals.html\">best iPhone deals</a>. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>Should I buy a new iPhone right now?</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>If you want to buy an iPhone 16 series handset, including the iPhone 16e, our advice is to buy now.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you want to buy an iPhone 15 you may find that the iPhone 16e is a better choice as it supports Apple Intelligence, which the iPhone 15 doesn’t support.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>There are certain times of the year when you can get the best deals on a new iPhone, these are during the Amazon Prime Sales in July and October, and Black Friday.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Those in the market for a new handset are probably wondering whether now is a good time to buy a new iPhone. Is there any danger that a new model will be released in the near future? Will prices drop or increase?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you buy, it’s a good idea to check that there isn’t an iPhone update due soon. To answer that question, no iPhone updates are expected until September 2025 when Apple is likely to introduce the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2393967/iphone-17-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">iPhone 17.</a> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It isn’t just because of the enticement of a new iPhone that we encourage you to check that there is not an imminent update. It is also because when Apple introduces a new iPhone it usually reduces prices of the predecessors, and even discontinues some models. So it can be best to wait until after a new iPhone launches to get the best price for the previous generation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not always that simple though, waiting may mean spending more to buy your iPhone if following a product update Apple raises prices, as it has done in the past. It’s also lowered prices in the past though, so you may just have to cross your fingers and hope for the best. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Waiting may also mean you have less choice if Apple discontinues the iPhone you wanted to buy. Although just because Apple doesn’t sell an iPhone doesn’t mean you can’t buy it.

That is without a doubt in the months leading up to September. So don’t buy a new iPhone in August, unless you want to be kicking yourself a month later when the price of that model drops and a new model arrives. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only reason to buy an iPhone in the run-up to an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672537/when-is-apples-next-event.html\">Apple Event</a> is if it is likely to be discontinued. Apple tends to discontinue the Pro and Pro Max models of the previous generation when it introduces the next generation, so if you want to buy one of those models you may want to buy one while you still can. However, we’d suggest that it would be wise to wait for the next-gen version which is likely to present you with more for your money. Or take advantage of discounts as vendors sell off old stock after the new models arrive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best time to buy an iPhone isn’t necessarily when a new model launches either – unless you’re desperate to have the very latest hardware. You might be happy to wait a month or two after the launch and wait for supply to catch up with demand, and for any problems with the new phones to be identified and (hopefully) fixed. The other advantage of buying around the October/November time frame is that is when shopping events, like <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/black-friday\">Black Friday</a>, take place, but as we said above, we don’t tend to see the newest iPhone models discounted much, or at all, at these events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’d say that it’s fine to buy a new iPhone at any time within nine months of it launching, but if you are hoping to save some money on your purchase we’d recommend waiting a few more months.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When does Apple update the iPhone?</h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/iPhone-16-review-11.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPhone 16 review 11\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/iPhone-16-review-11.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1920w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/iPhone-16-review-11.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/iPhone-16-review-11.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/iPhone-16-review-11.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/iPhone-16-review-11.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/iPhone-16-review-11.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/iPhone-16-review-11.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Chris Martin / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Knowing when the latest iPhones came out should help when making a judgment on whether there will be an update soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672537/when-is-apples-next-event.html\">when is the next Apple event</a> to find out if an Apple event is imminent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple usually updates the iPhone range at an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/831417/apple-september-iphone-event-date-time.html\">Apple Event in September</a>.

From time to time you will see deals from other resellers. We track these in our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672801/amazing-iphone-deals-for-april-2022.html\">Best iPhone Deals round-up</a>, so check that page regularly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Will there be Black Friday iPhone discounts?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The earliest you could expect to get a discount on the newest iPhones is around Black Friday at the end of November, so you might be planning to hold out until then. However, the deals we tend to see, if any, are usually for older handsets so if you are hoping for a discounted iPhone 16 or iPhone 16 Pro following their launch you will probably be disappointed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nor should you expect to get a discount in an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672787/apple-black-friday.html\">Apple Black Friday sale</a>. Apple’s Black Friday sale usually only takes the form of vouchers with select product purchases, rather than a discount, and it is unlikely that the newest iPhone would qualify as in previous year’s new iPhones haven’t been included. See our round-up of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1375699/best-iphone-black-friday-deals-2024.html\">Best Black Friday iPhone deals</a> to see what could be in store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that while shopping events like Black Friday gets all the attention, that’s not the only time you can get discounts on Apple products: we see discounts all the time. Another event where we see good iPhone deals is Prime Day, which happens in July and October every year. So take a look at the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2382944/best-iphone-prime-day-deals-october-2024.html\">iPhone deals for Amazon Prime Day</a> sale to see what you might be able to save.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our experience, we don’t tend to see discounts on the newest handset until the spring–and these are always from third-party resellers, never from Apple. In fact, we don’t tend to see the iPhone discounted in the U.S. very often, most of the discounts we see are in the U.K. where unlocked iPhones are often sold off-contract at a good discount.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion: Is now a good time to buy a new iPhone?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The worst time to buy is usually between July or August, mainly because with new iPhones on the horizon the price of the older handsets are likely to drop very soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want the newest iPhones then the best deals don’t tend to come before the spring and summer months. If you are happy to buy an older iPhone then you will probably see decent deals around Prime Day and Black Friday – but deals happen all year round. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We hope this article has proved helpful in reaching an informed buying decision.
