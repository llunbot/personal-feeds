Forever hooked on bikes and inspired by the outdoors, he was drawn to the connections humans form with their surroundings. Soon, he began racing, and then in 1995, he was racing for Moots.</p>\n<p>That year, when he picked up his racing frame, he had the opportunity to meet Kent Eriksen, the founder and builder of Moots. Back then, he was building out of the back of a shop called Sore Saddle Cyclery in Steamboat Springs. Seeing the shop, the tooling, fixtures, and frame-building process planted a seed that would take another decade to gestate.</p>\n<p>In 2001, he graduated with a master’s degree in Ecology from the University of Colorado at Boulder. He moved to Nederland to take a job at the city’s Open Space GIS department. While there, he worked in trail planning but ended up getting burned out managing the expectations of the various user groups. He also found the politics of the warring factions to be emotionally and physically draining.</p>\n<p>In 2007, looking for respite from the politics of his day job, he bought a custom Hunter Cycles with a funky geometry, requesting a slacker head angle than was standard or normal at the time, solely to test out his ideas on bicycle geometry. Whit cites this as the bike that inspired him, noting it was his vehicle to “tour and get lost in the woods on.” He rode it everywhere and eventually took it from Grand Junction, Colorado, to Durango for the 2009 Single-Speed World Championships.</p>\n<p>Some bikes leave a lasting impression, and that custom Hunter Cycles finally spurred Whit to pursue framebuilding.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Meriwether-Cycles-Shop-Visit-44.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Meriwether-Cycles-Shop-Visit-44.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Meriwether-Cycles-Shop-Visit-44.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Meriwether-Cycles-Shop-Visit-44.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Meriwether-Cycles-Shop-Visit-44.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>In 2010, he took a “framebuilding class” in Denver with Chris Kopp. The class was intimate in a one-on-one environment. He was so green at the time that the whole process was completely new to him, and working with a legend like Kopp, who was a “master welder” at Yeti Cycles when they were based in Golden, Colorado, Whit realized how hard TIG welding was.</p>\n<p>Never one to be afraid of a challenge, he dove right in taking Chris’ advice of buying a welder, a small mill/drill, and began to put in a lot of practice welding tubing, spending the rest of that year practicing welding every night after work. By April 2011, Whit had built his first frame on his own.</p>\n<p>He moved to California in 2012 and began to build bikes full-time under the name Meriwether Cycles.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Whits-Meriwehter-Luddite-Silk-Ti-Soft-Tail-29er-32.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Whits-Meriwehter-Luddite-Silk-Ti-Soft-Tail-29er-32.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Whits-Meriwehter-Luddite-Silk-Ti-Soft-Tail-29er-32.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Whits-Meriwehter-Luddite-Silk-Ti-Soft-Tail-29er-32.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Whits-Meriwehter-Luddite-Silk-Ti-Soft-Tail-29er-32.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>You Don’t Pick Your Own Nickname</h3>\n<p>Meriwether was a nickname given to Whit by a friend that was reading the journals of Lewis and Clark. Meriwether Lewis was the primary route finder and naturalist of the expedition, documenting the new species the group encountered for western science.</p>\n<p>This nickname was bestowed on Whit because he made maps of the local trails (before GPS and internet mapping were a thing), and many of his typical rides would end up getting him and his riding companions lost. Wayfinding aside, Whit’s degree in ecology and love for being in the backcountry prompted the nickname to stick. He loved the name Meriwether for a bike brand that would promote exploration and discovery.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/2024-MADE-Bike-Show-Pauls-Meriwether-x-Oddity-Touring-Fat-Bike-25.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/2024-MADE-Bike-Show-Pauls-Meriwether-x-Oddity-Touring-Fat-Bike-25.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/2024-MADE-Bike-Show-Pauls-Meriwether-x-Oddity-Touring-Fat-Bike-25.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/2024-MADE-Bike-Show-Pauls-Meriwether-x-Oddity-Touring-Fat-Bike-25.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/2024-MADE-Bike-Show-Pauls-Meriwether-x-Oddity-Touring-Fat-Bike-25.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2024-made-bike-show-meriwether-oddity/\" target=\"_blank\">Paul’s Meriwether</a> we featured last month. We’ll use this as a stand-in for the discussion below.</em></p>\n<h3>A Benchmark Bike</h3>\n<p>Whit’s custom Hunter Cycles informed his approach to building. He did everything on that bike; it was a true “quiver killer.” He cites Rick Hunter’s work as being a major inspiration for his own craft. Framebuilding is a slow burn. It takes time to develop one’s skills and understanding of construction.</p>\n<p>After building his first bike in 2011, he made twenty-five frames for himself and his friends to further hone his craft. Soon, he took on wild one-off projects for customers seeking unique expedition bikes. Like Mike Curiak, who, in 2015, requested a very large fat bike that would roll on prototype 26 x 5.5+” tires.</p>\n<p>Mike requested the bike be built with the shortest chainstays possible. Paired with a slack head angle, among other geometry tweaks, Mike believed that short stays helped the bike float effortlessly atop soft snow by keeping body weight over the rear tire for better traction. It also kept the front wheel light so it wouldn’t dig in and throw the rider off-course.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/2024-MADE-Bike-Show-Pauls-Meriwether-x-Oddity-Touring-Fat-Bike-23.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/2024-MADE-Bike-Show-Pauls-Meriwether-x-Oddity-Touring-Fat-Bike-23.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/2024-MADE-Bike-Show-Pauls-Meriwether-x-Oddity-Touring-Fat-Bike-23.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/2024-MADE-Bike-Show-Pauls-Meriwether-x-Oddity-Touring-Fat-Bike-23.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/2024-MADE-Bike-Show-Pauls-Meriwether-x-Oddity-Touring-Fat-Bike-23.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/2024-MADE-Bike-Show-Pauls-Meriwether-x-Oddity-Touring-Fat-Bike-36.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/2024-MADE-Bike-Show-Pauls-Meriwether-x-Oddity-Touring-Fat-Bike-36.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/2024-MADE-Bike-Show-Pauls-Meriwether-x-Oddity-Touring-Fat-Bike-36.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/2024-MADE-Bike-Show-Pauls-Meriwether-x-Oddity-Touring-Fat-Bike-36.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/2024-MADE-Bike-Show-Pauls-Meriwether-x-Oddity-Touring-Fat-Bike-36.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>His design to solve Mike’s request involved an elevated chainstay, allowing for a wider tire to fit in the rear triangle without worrying about the trifecta of clearance: chainstay, chainring, and crankarm interference. In doing so, the bike was able to be run with a narrower q-factor and a healthier chain line. Both of these matter for expedition bikes ridden in sub-freezing temperatures as drivetrain efficiency can suffer due to ice and snow.</p>\n<p>Noting the amount of “custom” that goes into these bikes, Whit told me, “We also developed a 217 mm rear end with custom hubs made by Onyx. This allowed the needed tire clearance for the prototype tires, but also less chain wear and cross-up since most of the time you’re grinding in the lowest gears with this type of bike.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/2024-MADE-Bike-Show-Pauls-Meriwether-x-Oddity-Touring-Fat-Bike-6.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/2024-MADE-Bike-Show-Pauls-Meriwether-x-Oddity-Touring-Fat-Bike-6.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/2024-MADE-Bike-Show-Pauls-Meriwether-x-Oddity-Touring-Fat-Bike-6.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/2024-MADE-Bike-Show-Pauls-Meriwether-x-Oddity-Touring-Fat-Bike-6.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/08/2024-MADE-Bike-Show-Pauls-Meriwether-x-Oddity-Touring-Fat-Bike-6.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Portage Handles and Touring Machines</h3>\n<p>Whit spent many years defining his modus operandi for Meriwether, and one customer in particular nudged his direction towards expedition-minded frame designs. In 2015, the same year as Mike’s funky fat bike, Whit built Nicholas Carman a hardtail mountain bike for touring.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2002\" height=\"1335\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Nickholas_Meriwether.jpg?fit=1200,1335&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Nickholas_Meriwether.jpg?w=2002&amp;quality=75 2002w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Nickholas_Meriwether.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Nickholas_Meriwether.jpg?resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Nickholas_Meriwether.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Nickholas_Meriwether.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>When visiting the <a href=\"https://www.adventurecycling.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Adventure Cycling Association</a> in Missoula, Nicholas saw a portage handle on a bike built by Sam Braxton. He thought it’d be cool to have a bike with one, so he requested one on his Meriwether. A portage handle is an additional tube welded between the seat and chainstays to aid in lifting the bike over fallen trees when the bike has a framebag. It makes a lot of sense, especially for a touring bike, so Whit began putting these on his bikes as signature details.</p>\n<p><em>Read all about Nicholas’ hardtail on the <a href=\"https://meriwethercycles.com/2022/12/15/tbt-2015-nicholas-29-27-5/\" target=\"_blank\">Meriwether blog</a>.</em></p>\n<p>Whit’s popularity among adventure cyclists began to grow and in 2019 Abe Taylor pinged Whit to build him a mountain touring bike. Modeled after his beloved Salsa Woodsmoke, he brought Whit some ideas about how to go about making the ultimate touring machine.</p>\n<p>As Whit put it, “That’s a big claim to be the ultimate of anything, but I think Abe has solid ground to stand on.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1818\" height=\"1212\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Abe_Meriwether.jpg?fit=1200,1212&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Abe_Meriwether.jpg?w=1818&amp;quality=75 1818w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Abe_Meriwether.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Abe_Meriwether.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Abe_Meriwether.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Abe loved his Salsa Woodsmoke but it, like many others, cracked at the elevated chainstay and had to be retired. When he engaged with Whit, the premise was to make a more durable frame with some added accoutrements for rugged mountain touring. One of which was a double portage handle.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Meriwether-Cycles-Shop-Visit-38.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Meriwether-Cycles-Shop-Visit-38.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Meriwether-Cycles-Shop-Visit-38.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Meriwether-Cycles-Shop-Visit-38.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Meriwether-Cycles-Shop-Visit-38.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>To make a portage handle, Whit bends a 14″ or so piece of steel or titanium tubing in a large arch. The center part of the arch will be the bike’s seatstay bridge, and the remaining parts will be its optional portage handles.
