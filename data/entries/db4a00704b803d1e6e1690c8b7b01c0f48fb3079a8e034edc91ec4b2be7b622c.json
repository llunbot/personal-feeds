Both side channels are the result of the chipsâ€™ use of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculative_execution\">speculative execution</a>, a performance optimization that improves speed by predicting the control flow the CPUs should take and following that path, rather than the instruction order in the program.</p>\n<h2>A new direction</h2>\n<p>The Apple silicon affected takes speculative execution in new directions. Besides predicting control flow CPUs should take, it also predicts the data flow, such as which memory address to load from and what value will be returned from memory.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/newly-discovered-flaws-in-apple-chips-leak-secrets-in-safari-and-chrome/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/newly-discovered-flaws-in-apple-chips-leak-secrets-in-safari-and-chrome/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"db4a00704b803d1e6e1690c8b7b01c0f48fb3079a8e034edc91ec4b2be7b622c","category":"Tech"}
