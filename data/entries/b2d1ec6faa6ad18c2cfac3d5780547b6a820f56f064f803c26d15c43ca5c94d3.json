One of the reasons is that I hate watching the bike get bounced around on the rack in my rearview mirror. With other hitch-mounted racks, that’s what I’d see back there: the bike mounted to the rack, floppin’ all over the place. It can be hard to watch. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/first-look-new-improved-1up-usa-2024-super-duty-double-hitch-bike-rack/\" target=\"_blank\">my 1UP USA Super Duty</a> Double hitch rack is built for severe off-roading. And when my Super Duty is combined with the <a href=\"https://1up-usa.com/\" target=\"_blank\">1UP USA</a>‘s <a href=\"https://1up-usa.com/product/wheel-saver\" target=\"_blank\">Wheel Savers</a> (now in XL size for MTBs) and <a href=\"https://1up-usa.com/product/wheel-chock\" target=\"_blank\">Wheel Chocks</a>, the shakey shenanigans are eliminated.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-hero-e1740773156983.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1062\" height=\"753\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-hero-e1740773156983.webp\" alt=\"1UP USA Wheel Chock and Wheel Saver Review hero\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-hero-e1740773156983.webp 1062w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-hero-e1740773156983-297x211.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-hero-e1740773156983-120x85.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-hero-e1740773156983-768x545.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Wheel Chock and Wheel Savers in use (Photos / Ron Frazelle)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The 1UP USA Wheel Savers and Chocks aren’t just for vehicles that go off-roading. These accessories work great to stabilize the bike on the rack, keeping any unnecessary movement at bay. And they work very well, especially when working together.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1UP Wheel Chocks</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-side-shot.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-side-shot.webp\" alt=\"1UP USA Wheel Chock and Wheel Saver Review side shot\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-side-shot.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-side-shot-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-side-shot-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-side-shot-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Wheel Chock in the Fat Tire Size</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Retail: $110 (both standard size and fat tire size)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Standard Size will fit tires up to 3″ wide, and the Fat tire Size will fit tires from 3″ up to 5″ wide. </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Wheel Chocks are great at preventing that annoying front wheel sway that most “tray-type” hitch-mounted bike racks suffer from. That sway doesn’t actually do any harm to the bike or the wheel (as long as the uprights are tight), but man, it’s annoying. The Wheel Chock eliminates that sway, and makes the mounted bike more stable on rough roads.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-rail.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-rail.webp\" alt=\"1UP USA Wheel Chock and Wheel Saver Review rail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-rail.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-rail-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-rail-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-rail-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-rail-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-rail-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-slot-rail-front.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-slot-rail-front.webp\" alt=\"1UP USA Wheel Chock and Wheel Saver Review slot rail front\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-slot-rail-front.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-slot-rail-front-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-slot-rail-front-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-slot-rail-front-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-rail-slot.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-rail-slot.webp\" alt=\"1UP USA Wheel Chock and Wheel Saver Review rail slot\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-rail-slot.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-rail-slot-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-rail-slot-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-rail-slot-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Chocks are made from machined aluminum and are anodized black and red. They come with the ratchet rail and all of the mounting hardware. They are very well made, and I’m confident that they will last for a very long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once installed, they’re easily removable as well, with the ratchet rail staying on the rack tray. I keep one on my rack all the time. But, doing so does risk the chance of someone taking it while you are parked. They slide on a notched rail that sits at the center of the tray. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-wheel-chock-working.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-wheel-chock-working.webp\" alt=\"1UP USA Wheel Chock and Wheel Saver Review wheel chock working\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-wheel-chock-working.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-wheel-chock-working-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-wheel-chock-working-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-wheel-chock-working-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Wheel Chock Standard Size on 47mm tire…</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-wheel-chock-standard.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-wheel-chock-standard.webp\" alt=\"1UP USA Wheel Chock and Wheel Saver Review wheel chock standard\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-wheel-chock-standard.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-wheel-chock-standard-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-wheel-chock-standard-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-wheel-chock-standard-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-wheel-chock-standard-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-wheel-chock-standard-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>…and on a 2.6″ tire</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After you get your bike on the rack and snug the load arms down, you can install the Wheel Chock.

Both sizes have a center section that is designed to fit smaller road tires, while the XL version has a second standoff for gravel tires, while MTB tires fill up the whole tray. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-off-the-road.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-off-the-road.webp\" alt=\"1UP USA Wheel Chock and Wheel Saver Review off the road\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-off-the-road.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-off-the-road-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-off-the-road-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-off-the-road-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Wheel saver increases the contact patch for the rack’s load arm to add stability to the front wheel while offering an added level of protection for high-end wheels. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-off-road.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-off-road.webp\" alt=\"1UP USA Wheel Chock and Wheel Saver Review off road\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-off-road.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-off-road-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-off-road-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-off-road-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A good use for these is if you have your rack high where there is a lot of wind force, like the top of a car or high up on the back of an adventure van. Or when the bike/rack is going through added stress, like spirited driving or going off-road. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>In Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve used both the Wheel Saver and the Wheel Chock non-stop since I’ve gotten them. They both work well separately and very well when working together. They work exceptionally well when taking a road that may be a little less friendly. I used them while doing some light off-roading, and the bike stayed very still. The only downside is that they’re not included with a new rack. Adding both accessories will quickly rack up the price tag for your 1UP setup. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-oof-the-beaten-path.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-oof-the-beaten-path.webp\" alt=\"1UP USA Wheel Chock and Wheel Saver Review oof the beaten path\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-oof-the-beaten-path.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-oof-the-beaten-path-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-oof-the-beaten-path-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-oof-the-beaten-path-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, both of the products are made very well and definitely up to the 1UP standard of manufacturing. I expect them both to last a long time. They are a welcome addition to my rack setup, and I don’t want to use the rack without them.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-hasnt-budged.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-hasnt-budged.webp\" alt=\"1UP USA Wheel Chock and Wheel Saver Review hasn't budged\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-hasnt-budged.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-hasnt-budged-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-hasnt-budged-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1UP-USA-Wheel-Chock-and-Wheel-Saver-Review-hasnt-budged-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have one of the above-listed racks and are looking to stabilize your steed better, I would highly recommend these additions. Our bikes aren’t getting any cheaper, and it’s worth the investment to keep them as safe as possible from damage while transporting them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://1up-usa.com/\" target=\"_blank\">1UP-USA.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/1up-usa-wheel-chock-wheel-savers-review/\">1UP USA Wheel Chock and Wheel Savers Will Add Stability to Your Life</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"b2d1ec6faa6ad18c2cfac3d5780547b6a820f56f064f803c26d15c43ca5c94d3","category":"Cycling"}
