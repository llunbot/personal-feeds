Notably, during that year's \"State of the Union\" session, Apple showed a presentation slide that said the update had \"0 new features,\" as Apple opted to focus on under-the-hood performance and stability improvements.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"We've built on the success of Leopard and created an even better experience for our users from installation to shutdown,\" said Apple's former software engineering chief Bertrand Serlet. \"Apple engineers have made hundreds of improvements so with Snow Leopard your system is going to feel faster, more responsive and even more reliable than before.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith Snow Leopard, Apple said it refined 90 percent of the foundational \"projects\" that were built into Mac OS X. Apple pitched the update as offering a more responsive Finder app, an improved Mail app that loaded emails up to twice as fast, up to 80% faster Time Machine backups, and a 64-bit version of Safari that was up to 50% faster than the previous version. Snow Leopard also took up around half as much disk space as Leopard.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYou can watch Serlet speak more about Snow Leopard at WWDC 2009 below.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/28/mac-os-x-snow-leopard-15-years/\">Mac OS X Snow Leopard Launched 15 Years Ago Today With '0 New Features'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mac-os-x-snow-leopard-launched-15-years-ago-today-with-0-new-features.2434641/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e55e795de4c2558716731f433d0264bfea2a08b79c7df413e118f397ab8b118a","category":"Apple"}
