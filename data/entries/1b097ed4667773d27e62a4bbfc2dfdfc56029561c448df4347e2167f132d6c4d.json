It’s also making <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/22/24137334/xbox-vr-headset-microsoft-meta-quest-limited-edition\">a limited-run, gaming-focused Quest with \nXbox</a>. </p>\n\n<p>On the theme of opening up, Meta is also pushing for more ways to \ndiscover alternative app stores. It’s making its experimental App \nLab store more prominent and even inviting Google to bring the \nPlay Store to its operating system, which is now called Horizon \nOS. <a href=\"https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/meta-horizon-os-open-hardware-ecosystem-asus-republic-gamers-lenovo-xbox/\">In a blog post</a>, Meta additionally said that it’s \nworking on a spatial framework for developers to more easily port \ntheir mobile apps to Horizon OS. [...] </p>\n\n<p>Zuckerberg has been clear that he wants his company to be a more \nopen platform than Apple’s. Here, he’s firmly positioning Meta’s \nHorizon OS as the Android alternative to Apple’s Vision Pro. Given \nhow Android was more of a reaction to the iPhone, an analogy he’d \nprobably prefer is how Microsoft built the early PC market by \nlicensing Windows. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It definitely seems more like Windows than Android — there’s no word that Horizon OS is going open source. But we have an answer regarding what Zuckerberg meant when he positioned the Quest platform — now the Horizon OS platform, I suppose — <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/02/14/zuckerberg-vision-pro\">as the “open” alternative to Apple’s VisionOS</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/22/meta-horizon-os-licensing\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"1b097ed4667773d27e62a4bbfc2dfdfc56029561c448df4347e2167f132d6c4d","category":"Tech"}
