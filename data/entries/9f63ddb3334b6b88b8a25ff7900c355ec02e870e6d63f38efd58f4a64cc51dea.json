But if you’re looking for a new iPad mini, there’s never been a better time to buy.

It may be a couple of years old, but it’s still a fantastic tablet, with a super-light design built around an 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display, an A15 processor, and a 12MP ultra-wide front camera. Weighing about a half-pound, it’s smaller and lighter than a book, and sturdy enough to cram into any bag or backpack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s also the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BJLT98Q7\"><strong>10th-gen iPad, which is down to $299</strong></a>, $50 off its MSRP, and the best price we’ve ever seen. The 10th-gen iPad is Apple’s entry-level tablet, with a 10.9-inch display and an A14 processor. It’s also got Touch ID, in the power button, 64GB of storage, and a choice of several fun colors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also save $150 on any iPad Pro once you check the $50 coupon box on these listings:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J9G6SP\" target=\"_blank\">11-inch M4 iPad Pro (512GB)</a>: $1,049 with coupon ($149 off, MSRP $1,199)</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J9SMLK\" target=\"_blank\">13-inch M4 iPad Pro (256GB)</a>: $1,150 ($149 off with coupon, MSRP $1,299)</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3JB95VD\" target=\"_blank\">13-inch M4 iPad Pro (512GB)</a>: $1,350 ($149 off with coupon, MSRP $1,499)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of the iPad Pro, there’s also a sale on the Apple Magic Keyboard.
