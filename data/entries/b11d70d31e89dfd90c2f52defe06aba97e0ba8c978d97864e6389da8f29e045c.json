Different kinds of blue cheese have distinctive flavor profiles: they can be mild or strong, sweet or salty, for example. Soon we might be able to buy blue cheeses that belie the name and sport veins of different colors: perhaps yellow-green, reddish-brown-pink, or lighter/darker shades of blue, according to a <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38191473/\">recent paper</a> published in the journal Science of Food.</p>\n<p>“We’ve been interested in cheese fungi for over 10 years, and traditionally when you develop mould-ripened cheeses, you get blue cheeses such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stilton_cheese\">Stilton</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roquefort\">Roquefort</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorgonzola\">Gorgonzola</a>, which use fixed strains of fungi that are blue-green in color,\" <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1033414\">said co-author Paul Dyer</a> of the University of Nottingham of this latest research. \"We wanted to see if we could develop new strains with new flavors and appearances.\"</p>\n<p>Blue cheese has been around for a very long time.

Months later, he came back to the cave and found it had molded into Roquefort. It's a fanciful tale, but scholars think the basic idea is sound: people used to store cheeses in caves because their temperature and moisture levels were especially hospitable to harmless molds. That was bolstered by a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8660109\">2021 analysis</a> of paleofeces that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/10/the-proofs-in-the-poop-austrians-have-loved-beer-blue-cheese-for-2700-years/\">found evidence</a> that Iron Age salt miners in Hallstatt (Austria) between 800 and 400 BCE were already eating blue cheese and quaffing beer.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2004359#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2004359&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b11d70d31e89dfd90c2f52defe06aba97e0ba8c978d97864e6389da8f29e045c","category":"Tech"}
