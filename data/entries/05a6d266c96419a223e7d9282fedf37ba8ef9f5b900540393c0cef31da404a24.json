More importantly, the helmet works with their 4D Brow Cooling design with a gap in front of the forehead which helps draw air into the helmet channels, and out the large rear exhaust vent. We’ve been very impressed with the ventilation of recent Specialized helmets, and it seems the Search will be no different. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside, you’ll find a MIPS Evolve Core system which is partially responsible for the helmet’s 5-Star Virginia Tech helmet rating. The helmet is secured with the Specialized FS3 Fit system with Occipital base adjustment – the same you’ll find on the S-Works Evade 3 and Prevail 3. The straps are also a thin 10mm webbing with an adjustable Tri-fix webbing system. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-7.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-7-1536x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Specialized Search Gravel Helmet sunglass port\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-7-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-7-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-7-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-7-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-7-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-7-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-7-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The helmet also features a Secure Sunglass Storage dock, that holds most sunglasses tenaciously. The little rubber flaps and port for the temple seem to work really well. The only catch is that it’s so secure, that it seems to require two hands at times to store or remove the glasses from the dock. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-2-1536x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Specialized Search Gravel Helmet actual weight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-2-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-2-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-2-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-2-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-2-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On the scale, a medium Search helmet checks in at 316g, which seems quite reasonable for a helmet at this price with these features. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>First Impressions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I haven’t had much time in the Search yet due to travel and illness, but my initial impressions are very good. I love the fit, much like the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/specialized-propero-4-aero-road-helmet-actual-weight/\" target=\"_blank\">recent Propero 4</a>, though the Search seems to sit up a bit higher and feels heavier even though it’s less than 10g. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a helmet that is $40 less, the Search seems like a great option for riders who want excellent ventilation that will stand up to the abuse of adventure and gravel riding. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pricing &amp; Colors</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/MY23_SEARCH_GROUP_2111_V3.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"9504\" height=\"6336\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/MY23_SEARCH_GROUP_2111_V3.jpg\" alt=\"Specialized Search helmet colors\n\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/MY23_SEARCH_GROUP_2111_V3.jpg 9504w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/MY23_SEARCH_GROUP_2111_V3-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/MY23_SEARCH_GROUP_2111_V3-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/MY23_SEARCH_GROUP_2111_V3-768x512.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially offered in five colors, the Search will have some models that coordinate with the new Recon shoes below. Available in S, M, and L, the helmets are all priced at $160. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Recon 1, 2, and 3 Shoes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with the Search helmet, Specialized is introducing three new versions of their Recon Gravel shoe. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-5.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-5-1536x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Specialized Recon gravel shoes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-5-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-5-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-5-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-5-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-5-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-5-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-4.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-4-1536x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Specialized Recon gravel shoes tread\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-4-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-4-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-4-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-4-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-4-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-4-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-3.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-3-1536x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Specialized Recon gravel shoes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-3-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-3-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-3-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-3-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-3-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At the high end, the new Recon 3.0 is a dual-BOA gravel shoe with the stiffest sole. The Carbon STRIDE toe-flex technology is said to allow for natural movement off the bike while keeping things stiff for pedaling. Dual BOA L6 dials allow for micro-adjustment while riding, and a chunky SlipNot rubber outsole should grip well on most surfaces. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-1-1536x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Specialized Recon gravel shoes actual weight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-1-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-1-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-1-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-1-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-Search-Helmet-Recon-gravel-shoes-actual-weight-1-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Our 41.5 sample weighed 320g per shoe which is a bit less than claimed. It’s even lighter when you consider that these shoes run big. I’d say that they’re at least a 1/2 size if not a full size bigger than claimed – big enough that the 41.5 I usually wear slips at the heel and has a lot of extra room at the toes. Keep that in mind for sizing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Recon 3.0s are priced at $250 and available in Black or Dusty Clay as shown. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Recon 2.0</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-recon2.0-studio-1-scaled.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-recon2.0-studio-1-1536x864.jpg\" alt=\"Specialized Recon 2.0\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-recon2.0-studio-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-recon2.0-studio-1-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-recon2.0-studio-1-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-recon2.0-studio-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-recon2.0-studio-1-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-recon2.0-studio-1-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Recon 2.0 drops to a single BOA L6 dial with a lower velcro strap, and the stiffness drops from a 10 to a 6, though still with the STRIDE toe-flex design. The 2.0s claim to be only 2g heavier than the 3.0, and sell for $180 in Black or Dune White and Vivid Pink. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Recon 1.0</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-recon1.0-studio-1-scaled.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-recon1.0-studio-1-1536x864.jpg\" alt=\"Specialized Recon 1.0\n\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-recon1.0-studio-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-recon1.0-studio-1-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-recon1.0-studio-1-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-recon1.0-studio-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-recon1.0-studio-1-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/specialized-recon1.0-studio-1-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Last but not least, the Recon 1.0 is the most affordable by far at $120. You’ll find the same injection STRIDE toe-flex tech on the 2.0 with a 6.0 stiffness rating, just with a lower-level BOA dial and upper without the added velcro strap. Coincidentally, these are also the lightest by claim at 331g for a single 42 shoe. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.specialized.com/us/en/search/p/1000208718?color=1000208720-1000208718\" target=\"_blank\">specialized.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/specialized-search-delivers-mid-priced-gravel-helmet-new-recon-1-2-3-shoes/\">Specialized Search Delivers Mid-Priced Gravel Helmet + New Recon 1, 2 &amp; 3 Shoes</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"05a6d266c96419a223e7d9282fedf37ba8ef9f5b900540393c0cef31da404a24","category":"Cycling"}
