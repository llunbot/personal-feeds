But I refuse to accept that – a Greek man once told it to me on the island of Crete and he was tremendously old and had a shotgun in his car. It’s the explanation as to why Greek coffee is as it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coffee, he said, has been around for an age, but it only came to Europe in the 1500s with the invading Ottoman Turks. Now, at this point in history the Ottoman Empire for the most part took Islam as its religion, while the Greeks were practising Orthodox Christianity (courtesy of the Byzantine Empire, aka, the Romans). </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n

result is the siltier-than-the-Nile <em>Ellinikos kafe</em> I’m tentatively sipping amid the morning commuters in a cafe in Ioannina, dressed in full kit, helmet on the table, bike propped nearby, doing a terrible job of blending in with the locals.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\"

Pavlos will take you catamaran sailing, cliff jumping, wreck diving, ultrarunning, sea kayaking and beer drinking. He’s a bit like a friend for hire, which is nice as I’m here on my own, and although I’ve visited Greece a lot I’ve never been to this part before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is Epirus, a region in the northwest on the border with Albania. If they’ve encountered it at all, most travellers will only have looked unwittingly at Epirus from the island of Corfu, just off its coast. This is not a well-known holiday destination, but I think that’s a good thing.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-03-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Epirus Greece\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-03-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-03-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-03-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-03-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-03-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-03-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Corfu sucks up the tourists, meaning that as much as any place you’ll find in Western Europe these days – and goodness knows travellers like me are the source of our own lament – Epirus is that horribly cliched word: authentic, a place that can offer adventure by two wheels.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Land of contradictions</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-04-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Epirus Greece\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-04-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-04-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-04-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-04-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-04-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-04-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-04.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>The old town of Ioannina within the ancient city walls.</figcaption><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>We strike out north from Ioannina – or Yannena to its friends – the capital city of Epirus and, like many places in Greece, really, really old. The focal point of the city is its castle and vast walls, which ensnare an old town that is either charmingly rough or roughly charming, depending on your disposition. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main reason Ioannina is here is Pamvotida, a huge lake once chockful of fish and potable water but now threatened by the presence of people and pollution.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-05-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Epirus Greece\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-05-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-05-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-05-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-05-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-05-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-05-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-05-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-05.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Climbing towards Papingo in the Zagori region.</figcaption><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Like all good lakes, Pamvotida enjoys some excellent stories, which Pavlos is happy to regale me with as we set off.

Greece, though, is a tricky customer. I can’t profess to have travelled far and wide, but the parts I’ve seen and love show a country that deals with two hands, the first serving beauty, the second proffering grit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think this sticks out to travellers like me because if anything’s even <em>slightly</em> nice or old in England (Scotland and Wales are different matters, much more egalitarian) it gets cordoned off and you have to pay to enter, but in Greece everything is just thrown together and you can park anywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Craggy backbone</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-07-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Epirus Greece\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-07-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-07-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-07-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-07-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-07-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-07-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-07-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-07.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>The road to Papingo, with the limestone karsts of Mount Tymphe in the background.</figcaption><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Greece seems imbued with a cheerful lawlessness, the kind that is at once freeing and responsible for the piles of rubbish laid at the feet of the sorts of street statues we’d try to put behind glass. Here, postcard views turn ruinous urban sprawl and back again in the blink of an eye.

At its crest is a monument Pavlos says belongs to one of Greece’s many wars, and a Hellenic flag, its primary blue and white folds lifting and falling in the breeze. I’ve long taken the blue of the Greek flag to be symbolic of the sea, but days like these make it seem twinned with the sky.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-08-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Epirus Greece\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-08-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-08-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-08-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-08-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-08-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-08-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-08-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-08.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Soon we’re dropping down into increasingly cool air, a sign we’re heading for trees and water, and sure enough pines appear in earnest, thickening into forest as the road flattens and rolls over an ancient bridge and riffling water beneath. This is the Voidomatis River, says Pavlos, proudly adding that it’s the cleanest river in Europe. It certainly looks the part – every stone and fish and reed clearly visible even three metres up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Voidomatis marks one of many gateways into the Pindus Mountains, which run from over the border in Macedonia, via Albania and down to the tip of the Peloponnese in southern Greece. Hence the Pindus’s pet name, ‘The Spine of Greece’. Here lies Greece’s second highest mountain, Mount Smolikas, and Greece’s second longest gorge, the Vikos.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-09-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Epirus Greece\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-09-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-09-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-09-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-09-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-09-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-09-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-09-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-09.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>The Aristis stone bridge over the Voidomatis River, which flows through the Vikos Gorge.</figcaption><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Eagle-eyed geographers will of course know the tallest mountain in Greece is Mount Olympus (2,918m), which is presumably why the gods chose it, and the longest gorge is the Samiria in Crete, which incidentally is where the bloke with the shotgun told me about the coffee.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At 2,637m, Smolikas would be a wonderful cycling summit were it paved, but instead we’ll have to make do with one of the highest roads in these parts, which runs from the bottom of the gorge to the villages of Papingo and Mikro.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-10-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Epirus Greece\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-10-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-10-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-10-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-10-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-10-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-10-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-10-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-10.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>I’d not heard of the Pindus before today, and when Pavlos tells me the upcoming climb won’t even reach 1,000m I can’t say I’m ready to be impressed.

The region, full of merchants given its proximity to the rest of Europe, was left to flourish, and the old wooden bridges that once connected the many villages over such difficult topography were replaced in stone by rich locals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Descending back to the Voidomatis takes little effort and barely any more time, the monolithic peak of Tymphe and its exposed limestone peaks looking over us with a grey-purple stare familiar to anyone who has ridden in the Dolomites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We retrace our tyre tracks a considerable way, back past the Greek flag, through roads lined with autumnal-turning trees, plummeting, climbing then dropping once more.

A sharp descent is cruel, its relief turning quickly to discomfort as we have to regain the metres lost. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-16-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Epirus Greece\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-16-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-16-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-16-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-16-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-16-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-16-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-16-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-16.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>It’s strange to see the altitude gain only just pass 1,000m – we seem so much higher – but it’s an optical illusion; we’re surrounded by mountains with no real reference points, just the blind sensation of climbing. Eventually the road plateaus and pedalling returns to base levels, before gravity finally blesses us with freewheeling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We cross a newer bridge built next to its forebear, ours prosaic in steel and concrete, the ancient Zagori a thing of stone-teetering splendour. But no sooner can we wonder at this latest architectural marvel than beauty segues back into the basic and the rough-hewn. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-17-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Epirus Greece\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-17-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-17-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-17-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-17-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-17-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-17-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-17-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-17-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/big-ride-epirus-greece-17.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Few roads are much higher than 1,000m in Epirus’s slice of the Pindus Mountains, but being surrounded by mountains gives the illusion it’s much higher.</figcaption><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Houses with wrecks of farm vehicles and olive trees in their gardens populate the landscape; behind us the many undulations and colour grades of the Pindus morph into one lumpy, darkened form. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before long we’re circumventing a highway on a cracked old road, an expanse of water just starting to unfold ahead.

From there it’s a ferry crossing to Igoumenitsa, which is a 90-minute drive to the hotel on the coast where we were based. Total travel time is around 30 hours and costs start from around £330. <a href=\"https://www.rome2rio.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Rome2rio.com</a> is a great resource for planning such journeys. Alternatively, flights go regularly from London Stansted to Perveza airport, then it’s a 1 hour 25 minute drive to MarBella Elix.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Accommodation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The MarBella Elix (<a href=\"https://www.marbella.gr/\" target=\"_blank\">marbella.gr</a>), near Perdika, truly earns every one of its five stars, with private infinity pools, a mini funicular to the beach and the widest array of food offerings you could think of. Full board costs from £185pn for a standard double; half board from £100; and rather wonderfully, free ice cream is served all day from the hotel’s beach cafe.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Thanks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Big thanks to Pavlos Zitakis from Explore the Outside (<a href=\"https://www.exploretheoutside.com/\" target=\"_blank\">exploretheoutside.com</a>), who planned our route and taught us about Greek masonry, and his business partner George, who drove our support vehicle with tireless cheer. Many thanks also to Periklis Gompakis, who hosted us at the MarBella Elix, and Isabelle Thomas, from Grifco PR (<a href=\"https://www.grifcopr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">grifcopr.com</a>), who planned our itinerary.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/greece-epirus-cycling\">The forgotten world of Epirus: Greece Big Ride</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"cccce5a7760fdbfcca8f8eae368bcbd8f0c743430c028a02ae57d9eb26c4f547","category":"Cycling"}
