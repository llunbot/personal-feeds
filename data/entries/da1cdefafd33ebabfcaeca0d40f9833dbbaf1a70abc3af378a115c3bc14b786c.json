The right investment to make it easier and safer for people to travel by bike (or by foot) could go a long way in helping to reduce emissions.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Urban deliveries could be completed by cargo or e-cargo bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>John Keeble / Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>An Energy Saving Trust <a href=\"https://energysavingtrust.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/EST007-01-ESTDFT-Electrifying-last-mile-deliveries-guide-WEB-02.pdf\">report</a> says 33 per cent of all urban deliveries could be completed by cargo or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-electric-cargo-bike/\">e-cargo bikes</a>.</p>\n<p>As an example of the potential impact the switch could make, the report points to Zedify, a delivery company with 69 cargo bikes and five electric vans in its fleet of vehicles. In one year, this fleet of vehicles is estimated to have saved more than 426 tonnes of CO2 emissions, showing the potential of electric vans, but particularly e-cargo bikes.</p>\n<p>Electric vehicles cost a lot of money and prioritising them for private use makes emission reduction on a personal scale an activity of the rich: not everyone will be able to afford to make the change to one of these vehicles.</p>\n<p>Of course, ebikes and bicycles in general aren’t that cheap. But they are much cheaper than cars and, as CyclingUK has said, the UK government should follow the lead of the USA in <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/us-ebike-tax-credit-bill/\">proposing ebike subsidies</a>.</p>\n<p>This is also why public transport should be integral to reducing transport emissions alongside cycling and walking.</p>\n<p>Investment in public transport over private electric vehicle ownership would mean disadvantaged groups aren’t left behind.</p>\n<p>It would also help achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development goal 10, which says we should “progressively achieve and sustain income growth of the bottom 40 per cent of the population at a rate higher than the national average”.</p>\n<h2>The bigger picture</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Prioritising electric vehicles limits the potential health benefits of active travel.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Luis Alvarez / Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>There is the question of resource allocation, too. As Thea Riofrancos, professor in political science and author of <i>A Planet to Win: Why we need a Green New Deal,</i> has argued, if we’re going to be extracting lithium and cobalt for batteries to help the move away from hydrocarbons, we should regulate the use of these minerals to benefit the greatest number of people.</p>\n<p>These materials should be used for small electric vehicles such as bikes and public transport rather than private cars, enabling <a href=\"https://www.climateandcommunity.org/_files/ugd/d6378b_b03de6e6b0e14eb0a2f6b608abe9f93d.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">more mobility for less mining</a>.</p>\n<p>Powering Up Britain’s emphasis on electric vehicles comes as no surprise. There was little talk of other modes of transport at <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/long-reads/this-is-planet-saving-stuff-chris-boardman-on-cop26/\">COP26 in Glasgow</a> and the government recently cut £200 million of active travel funding, leaving local authorities to fight over a far smaller pot of money for cycling and walking infrastructure.</p>\n<p>But this dire oversight will come back to bite us, emissions aside. The government’s lack of action around active travel will deprive people of the health benefits – physical and mental – associated with walking and cycling. It will also mean people who can’t use or afford private electric vehicles may struggle to travel safely or sustainably.</p>\n<p>By ignoring cycling, walking and public transport, the government has missed the bigger picture in more ways than one.</p>\n\n<p> </p>","author":"Stan Portus","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"da1cdefafd33ebabfcaeca0d40f9833dbbaf1a70abc3af378a115c3bc14b786c","category":"Cycling"}
