{"title":"Here we go again: The iPhone ‘shake-up’ is now coming in 2027","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2660868/here-we-go-again-the-iphone-shake-up-is-now-coming-in-2027.html","date":1744096460000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>While iPhone watchers have been eagerly awaiting this year’s update to see just how different the new models will be, a new report throws some cold water on those sky-high expectations. As it turns out, the real big change isn’t coming until the iPhone’s 20th anniversary in 2027.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-04-06/will-apple-raise-iphone-prices-in-the-us-after-trump-tariffs-iphone-17-details\">Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman</a>, writing in his weekly Power On newsletter, Apple’s big iPhone overhaul is still two years away, now targeted to mark 20 years of the iPhone. Gurman reports that two brand-new iPhones will make an appearance in 2027—Apple’s first folding phone and “a bold new Pro model that makes more extensive use of glass.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, 2027 will actually be when the iPhone 19 is due, but we’ve been here before. Remember, the Phone’s 10th anniversary, which saw the launch of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/667617/iphone-x-review-2.html\">iPhone X</a>, was also the year of the iPhone 8, but Apple launched the iPhone X as a special edition followed by the iPhone XS, and the iPhone 9 was forever lost to history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has been rumored to release a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2629813/apple-folding-iphone-design-display-specs-release.html\">folding iPhone</a> for many years, but in recent months rumors have suggested that it’s far along in the development process. Just last month, it was <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2645516/the-folding-iphones-killer-feature-might-be-a-liquidmetal-hinge.html\">reported</a> that Apple had developed a LiquidMetal hinge to help reduce the appearance of a crease in the center of the screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As far as the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2393967/iphone-17-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">iPhone 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2659880/that-big-iphone-redesign-predicted-for-this-year-it-might-not-be-so-big-after-all.html\">Gurman says</a> it will represent “more of a revamp” than the iPhone 16, “will appear quite similar” to the current iPhones. So if you really want something different, it looks like you’ll have to wait yet another two years.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"6162d67b3cfe673d842111c20e371da155d34b5472d38419ea8ab2ad74d70401","category":"Apple"}
