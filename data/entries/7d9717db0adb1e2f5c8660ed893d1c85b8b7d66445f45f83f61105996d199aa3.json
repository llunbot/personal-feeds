The attacks used a zero-click method, meaning they required no interaction on the part of targets. Simply receiving a call or text on an iPhone was enough to become infected by the Pegasus, which is among the world’s <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/04/found-quite-possibly-the-most-sophisticated-android-espionage-app-ever/\">most advanced</a> pieces of known malware.</p>\n<h2>“Huge blindspot”</h2>\n<p>Apple said the vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-41064, stemmed from a buffer overflow bug in <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/imageio\">ImageIO</a>, a proprietary framework that allows applications to read and write most image file formats, which include one known as WebP. Apple credited the discovery of the zero-day to Citizen Lab, a research group at the University of Toronto’s Munk School that follows attacks by nation-states targeting dissidents and other at-risk groups.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1970341#p3\">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1970341&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7d9717db0adb1e2f5c8660ed893d1c85b8b7d66445f45f83f61105996d199aa3","category":"Tech"}
