{"title":"Driving the biggest, least-efficient electric car: The Hummer EV SUV","link":"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/11/driving-the-biggest-least-efficient-electric-car-the-hummer-ev-suv/","date":1730828809000,"content":"<p>GMC's Hummers have always been divisive. After getting hold of the rights to a civilian version of the US military vehicle in 1999, the company set about designing new, smaller vehicles to create an entire range. The ungainly H2 and H3 followed, both SUVs playing to the sensibilities of a country grappling with its warlike nature. By 2010, the Hummer brand was dead and laid dormant until someone had the bright idea to revive it for the electric vehicle generation. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/04/the-hummer-ev-is-an-electric-truck-for-people-who-think-evs-are-stupid/\">We drove</a> the pickup version of that new Hummer in 2022, now it's time for the $104,650 Hummer EV SUV.</p>\n<p>I'll admit I was worried that the Hummer EV wasn't going to fit in my parking space. This is an extremely large vehicle, one that's classified as a class 3 medium-duty truck—hence the yellow lights atop the roof. In fact, at 196.8 inches (5,000 mm) long, it's actually slightly shorter than the pickup version, although that length doesn't count the big spare tire hanging off the back.</p>\n<figure>\n      <img width=\"640\" height=\"493\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Hummer-EV-SUV-9-640x493.jpg\" alt=\"A Hummer EV SUV seen head-on, in a parking space.\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Hummer-EV-SUV-9-640x493.jpg 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Hummer-EV-SUV-9-300x231.jpg 300w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Hummer-EV-SUV-9-768x592.jpg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Hummer-EV-SUV-9-1536x1184.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Hummer-EV-SUV-9-2048x1579.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Hummer-EV-SUV-9-980x756.jpg 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Hummer-EV-SUV-9-1440x1110.jpg 1440w\" />\n      <figcaption>\n        <div>\n    <div></div>\n    <div>\n      The SUV fit—just.\n\n              <span>\n          Credit:\n\n          \n          Jonathan Gitlin\n\n                  </span>\n          </div>\n  </div>\n      </figcaption>\n    </figure>\n      <figure>\n      <img width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Hummer-EV-SUV-4-640x480.jpg\" alt=\"A Hummer EV SUV seen from the rear, at a charging location\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Hummer-EV-SUV-4-640x480.jpg 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Hummer-EV-SUV-4-300x225.jpg 300w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Hummer-EV-SUV-4-768x576.jpg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Hummer-EV-SUV-4-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Hummer-EV-SUV-4-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Hummer-EV-SUV-4-980x735.jpg 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Hummer-EV-SUV-4-1440x1080.jpg 1440w\" />\n      <figcaption>\n        <div>\n    <div></div>\n    <div>\n      It even filled the charger bay.\n\n              <span>\n          Credit:\n\n          \n          Jonathan Gitlin\n\n                  </span>\n          </div>\n  </div>\n      </figcaption>\n    </figure>\n  \n<p>Its 86.5-inch (2,196 mm) width just about fit between the lines, although it was a tight squeeze to try to open a door and climb up into the Hummer if my neighbor was parked as well. And climb up you do—there's 10.2 inches (259 mm) of ground clearance even in the suspension's normal setting, and the overall height is a towering 77.8 inches (1,976 mm). There is an entry mode that drops the car on its air springs by a couple of inches, but only if you remember to engage the feature when you park.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/11/driving-the-biggest-least-efficient-electric-car-the-hummer-ev-suv/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/11/driving-the-biggest-least-efficient-electric-car-the-hummer-ev-suv/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
