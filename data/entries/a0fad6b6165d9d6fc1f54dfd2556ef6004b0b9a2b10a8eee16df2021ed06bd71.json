bike and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/folding-bikes/hummingbird-single-speed-flax-review/\">Hummingbird’s Single Speed Flax</a> folder.</p>\n<p>Armchair fans of the Tour de France

what we’ve published this week, with coverage from the Sea Otter show in California just beginning.</p>\n<p>Now, though, it’s time to kickstart the weekend and delve into this week’s <a

height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> There’s every chance you’d get into Berghain wearing these shorts.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Wearing protection when riding can sometimes be a chore, with various gear soon adding up to make a foam suit of armour.</p>\n<p>Canyon’s Enduro-Bibshorts are designed to simplify this by adding protection directly into your shorts.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The rear of the shorts has space for armour and a hydration pack.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>A D3O Viper Central insert can be placed within a sleeve on the back of the shorts, providing you with lightweight back protection.</p>\n<p>There is also a second sleeve designed to fit a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-hydration-packs/\">hydration pack</a>, with the bib straps featuring loops to guide a hose from the rear to the front of the shorts.</p>\n<p>Canyon has used the Basque brand Etxeondo’s chamois, which it says has gender-specific ergonomics.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The pockets are made from a mesh material.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The shorts feature pockets on either thigh, which look perfect for keeping phones, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-energy-bars/\">energy bars</a> and keys close to hand while riding.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A belly button hole is designed to enable you to relieve yourself without taking the bibs off.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The front of the shorts features a zip with a cut-away at the bottom to make relieving yourself a little easier.</p>\n<ul><li>£180.95/$249.99/€206.95</li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>POC Omne Lite</h2>\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The large vents should provide good cooling.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>POC says the new Omne Lite is based on the Omne Air platform, featuring more ventilation and a lighter weight.</p>\n<p>The Swedish brand claims a size-medium helmet tops the scales at 240g, which certainly puts it near the lighter end of the spectrum.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The helmet is minimalist to save on weight.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>A minimal polycarbonate shell is embedded into an expanded polystyrene liner, which POC says keeps the weight low, while optimising protection.</p>\n<p>The Omne Lite uses a lightweight fastening system with a dial on the cradle to adjust the size.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The rear of the helmet leaves plenty of room for a mullet.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The system uses a cable that allows for what POC calls a 360-degree fit.</p>\n<p>Oversized vents feature on the rear of the helmet to enable warm air from the helmet to exhaust out of the rear when riding.</p>\n<p>The helmet comes in small, medium and large, with a wide fit also available.</p>\n<ul><li>£170/$190/€190</li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Garmont 9.81 Hi-Ride</h2>\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The shoes are said to blend comfortable walking and flat-pedal performance.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Garmont’s 9.81 Hi-Ride shoes are designed for flat-pedal performance and easy walking when off the bike, combining all the ingredients needed for the perfect pub-bike shoe.</p>\n<p>The shoe’s upper is made from a recycled ripstop nylon material, which Garmont says is abrasion resistant with a heat-bonded trim adding structure.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> As riding shoes go, these look to be some of the most casual.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Laces are used to fasten the shoes, with an extra eyelet at the top of the pattern enabling you to perform a heel lock.</p>\n<p>The heel of the shoes features a vulcanised rubber cup with a reflective insert, which should make you more visible to motorists at night.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Earthy tones give the shoes gravel vibes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The cuff of the shoe is asymmetrical, with the inner of the shoe built up more to protect your ankle from the crankset.</p>\n<p>An OrthoLite insole sits within the shoe, which Garmont says is made from 100 per cent recycled material.</p>\n<p>The midsole also receives an eco treatment, being made from a bio-based compound called PlumeFoam, which is derived from sugarcane.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The honeycomb sole is said to be be grippier on flat pedals.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Garmont’s proprietary GTF Hyve sole is used, featuring honeycomb lugs and differing support zones.</p>\n<p>The tread on the ball of the foot is smaller and closer together, and uses a softer compound to provide a better pedal interface, while the rest of the sole is made from a harder compound with larger knobs to provide better walking ability.</p>\n<ul><li>€140</li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Crud Cloth</h2>\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Crud Cloth is made from 100 per cent cotton.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Those familiar with post-ride car park routines will be well aware of the shower in a can, but the Crud Cloth promises to be a shower in a bag.</p>\n<p>The US brand says it uses a system similar to instant ice packs, with the Crud Cloth requiring a smack and a squish before removing it from the packaging.</p>\n<p>The cloth itself measures 12x12in and is made from 100 per cent cotton. Crud Cloth says it can be washed and reused, though it’s not clear if this is for the same application.</p>\n<p>An inner pod contains soap, which is said to be made from 100 per cent natural ingredients and essential oils.</p>\n<p>The cloth is kept separate from the soap in the vacuum-packed packaging in order to prolong the shelf life, which the brand claims is forever.</p>\n<p>The Crud Cloth comes in a pack of seven and is available with citrus, lavender, peppermint and tea tree scents.</p>\n<p>There is also an unscented version available.</p>\n<ul><li>$25</li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>","author":"Nick Clark","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"a0fad6b6165d9d6fc1f54dfd2556ef6004b0b9a2b10a8eee16df2021ed06bd71","category":"Cycling"}
