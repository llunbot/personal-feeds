Inspired by the steep climbs, unrelenting descents and rough roads of the Gifford Pinchot Forest in Sage’s backyard, the Storm King GP will push riders to discover untapped gravel gems far beyond the beaten trail.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/10/SAGE_SK_XPLR_CB_BIOUSA.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/10/SAGE_SK_XPLR_CB_BB.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><strong> Key Features</strong><br />\n-Redesigned Storm King frame<br />\n-Suspension corrected geometry<br />\n-5mm decrease in head tube length to accommodate the longer axle-to-crown of the Rudy suspension fork<br />\n-The headtube angle has been reduced by .5 degree. This was done to optimize handling to take advantage of the added capability brought on by the front suspension.<br />\n-The chainstays have also been lengthened by 5mm. The longer stays help strike a proper balance front to back and further increase stability in rougher terrain, due to the longer wheelbase.<br />\n-Slacker seat tube<br />\n-The seat tube angle was decreased by 2.25 degrees. This was done to compensate for the 0 offset XPLOR dropper post and allows the saddle to be centered on the rails<br />\n-Front – Center<br />\n-The front-center has been increased by 10mm. This helps to reduce the likelihood of toe overlap and increases the overall wheelbase for added stability.<br />\n-Full SRAM XPLR kit<br />\n-SRAM Red XPLR drivetrain<br />\n-40T single ring crank<br />\n-10-44 cassette<br />\n-Rock Shox Rudy suspension fork 40mm<br />\n-Rock Shox XPLR dropper post<br />\n-Zipp XPLR 101 carbon wheels<br />\n-Zipp G40 gravel tires</p>\n<p><strong>Price</strong><br />\nSage Storm King GP (non-anodized)- MSRP: $11,765<br />\nSage Storm King GP (anodized)- MSRP: $12,765</p>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://sagetitanium.com/products/storm-king-gp/\" target=\"_blank\">Sage</a>.</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"2a20e6c05c01f48158965da73f0c19c41be880c08dd04bc1d3c200c7b25c2a11","category":"Cycling"}
