A <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-plans-announce-google-search-competitor-monday-sources-say-2024-05-09/\">Reuters</a> report claimed that the company behind ChatGPT is planning to launch a search engine as early as <em>this Monday, </em>but OpenAI denied that Monday would be the day.</p>\n<p>The company recently confirmed it's holding a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1788987793613725786\">livestream event</a> on Monday, though, but an OpenAI rep told Ars that \"Despite reports, we’re not launching a search product or GPT-5 on Monday.\" Either way, Monday is an interesting time for an OpenAI livestream.

Earlier this week, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24151616/openai-is-entering-the-search-game\">The Verge</a> reported that \"OpenAI has been aggressively trying to poach Google employees\" for an upstart search team. \"Search.chatgpt.com\" is already <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DataChaz/status/1786296216176689254\">being set up</a> on OpenAI's server, so it's all falling into place.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023495#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023495&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"56d519a9da98371a3dc195fe7a5ac91a09f9f8434ad799648e3c88539641cb53","category":"Tech"}
