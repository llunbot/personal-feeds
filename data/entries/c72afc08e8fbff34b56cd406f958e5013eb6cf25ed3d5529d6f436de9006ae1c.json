There’s nothing worse than rushing to meet a deadline when you suddenly shudder to halt due to having to work out how to edit or complete a PDF. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, help is at hand, as PDFgear is not only a powerful editing tool available on macOS, iOS and Windows. It’s also completely free and, unlike many other editors, doesn’t have file limits for the size of document you’re working with. The software has also recently added an impressive new AI feature too, one that could revolutionise how you work with PDFs in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Powerful Editing Tools</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need to quickly fill out a PDF form, then <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.pdfgear.com/&amp;xcust=1-1-2127023-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">PDFgear</a> should be your go-to app. Simply open the file in PDFgear and you have access to everything you’ll need. You can enter or edit text, convert to another format such as a Word document, annotate the existing text and images, reorganise pages, merge PDFs together or split one into smaller parts, as well as the very useful ability to digitally sign the document. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everything is achieved through the friendly and thoughtfully designed interface, which makes interacting with PDFs incredibly easy. No more frustrations, just do what needs to be done within the document, save it and you can move on to your next task. Just how it should be.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/PDFgear2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"PDFgear Copilot AI\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/PDFgear2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/PDFgear2.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/PDFgear2.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/PDFgear2.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" /></figure><p>PDFgear</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>New advanced AI Copilot</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest tool in PDFgear is Copilot, the first AI assistant to work with PDFs. You may have seen Windows Copilot announced recently, which works across the Windows operating system and can interact with PDFs. But <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.pdfgear.com/pdf-copilot/?utm_source=pcworld&amp;utm_medium=media&amp;xcust=1-1-2127023-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">PDFgear Copilot</a> is a specialised approach catering to those working with PDFs and comes with some amazing capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can summarise long documents, like manuals, textbooks or legal contracts, giving you the important highlights and themes included in the text. This will be invaluable for students or researchers working on projects that would normally require hours of reading to find the relevant data. With Copilot it happens in a matter of minutes.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/PDFgear3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"PDFgear article\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/PDFgear3.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/PDFgear3.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/PDFgear3.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/PDFgear3.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" /></figure><p>PDFgear</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s not all though. Via the text interface you can ask questions about the content of the document and Copilot will provide accurate answers and statistics without you having to trawl through pages and pages of text. If you’re not clear on an element in the document, you can ask Copilot to explain it or expand on the subject. The software can also rewrite passages to make them clearer and easier to understand.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as this, Copilot also allows users to operate PDFgear through text commands. So, for example, if you want to convert a document to another format, print it or save it, just tell Copilot and this will be done for you. It really does mark a huge step forward in terms of useability and simplicity.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>PDFs made easy</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>PDFgear makes working with PDFs a breeze. Its powerful suite of tools allows you to fill out forms, edit and annotate with ease, plus the groundbreaking AI Copilot feature not only saves time but can instantly improve reports or projects. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you’re someone who has never worked with PDFs before or an experienced user, PDFgear and Copilot will do all the heavy lifting without you needing to even learn an interface or spend any money.
