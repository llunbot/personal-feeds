If you still wanted a non-commercial just-in-case plan, there is one, but you're going to have to hunt a bit.</p>\n<p>RealVNC users with Home subscriptions will likely receive an email from the company with the subject line: \"Important changes to your Home subscription.\" The email notes that the firm is \"Retiring our Home plan\" as of June 17, 2024.</p>\n<p>After \"launching a wider range of tiered plans designed to better cater to more users\" and to \"maintain a cohesive set of plan options,\" the email states, Home must be retired. RealVNC, asking itself FAQ-style, \"What do I need to do?\" notes that the easiest way to avoid disruption is to upgrade to a paid plan.
