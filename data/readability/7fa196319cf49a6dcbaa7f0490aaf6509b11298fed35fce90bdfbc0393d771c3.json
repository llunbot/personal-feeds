So, you’ll see mention here of products that I’ve been testing for anywhere from a few weeks to almost a year, and it might be the first time you’ve seen them mentioned.</p><p>Because I’m way behind on actually writing a full review for many of them, but they’re coming. However I can’t delay giving them kudos until then, so here are the bikes, components, kit, and gear I’ve used in 2021.</p><p>These Editor’s Choice awards, along with our Buyer’s Guides and Gift Guides, are honestly some of the most fun stories we get to write all year.&nbsp;We can lighten up on the objectivity and go full send on the compliments. The products listed below are the ones I’ve most enjoyed riding and using this year, and I hope you enjoy reading about them. As always, I’ll start with a bit about me to put things in perspective…</p><h3>ABOUT TYLER</h3><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/where-to-ride-carvins-cove-mountain-bike-trails-roanoke-virginia-13.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/where-to-ride-carvins-cove-mountain-bike-trails-roanoke-virginia-13.jpg\" alt=\"riding mountain bikes at carvins cove trails near roanoke virginia\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/where-to-ride-carvins-cove-mountain-bike-trails-roanoke-virginia-13.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/where-to-ride-carvins-cove-mountain-bike-trails-roanoke-virginia-13-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/where-to-ride-carvins-cove-mountain-bike-trails-roanoke-virginia-13-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/where-to-ride-carvins-cove-mountain-bike-trails-roanoke-virginia-13-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/where-to-ride-carvins-cove-mountain-bike-trails-roanoke-virginia-13-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/where-to-ride-carvins-cove-mountain-bike-trails-roanoke-virginia-13-696x464.jpg 696w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/where-to-ride-carvins-cove-mountain-bike-trails-roanoke-virginia-13-1068x712.jpg 1068w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/where-to-ride-carvins-cove-mountain-bike-trails-roanoke-virginia-13-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p>My rides are split evenly between drop bar and flat bar, with the former being about half road and half gravel. While I still appreciate a died-in-the-wool cyclocross bike, gravel has entirely replaced any CX racing for me, for now.</p><p>I’m still torn between the lighter weight of 40mm gravel tires and the comfort and grip of 47s – I am, after all, a weight weenie. But for road, I simply don’t ride anything narrower than 28s anymore, and often it’s 30s or 32s.</p><p>On the trails, I’ve been putting all those new gravel suspension forks to the test, but not quite ready to declare a winner (and there are some new ones coming early next year I can’t tell you about). But most days, it’s a proper mountain bike, and locally it’s mostly an XC or light trail bike…which is about all I’ve had a chance to ride this year. One in particular stands out, as you’ll soon see.</p><p>Mostly I’m riding for fun or “work”, but I do push it just enough to be able to finish the growing wave of 100+ mile gravel events without dying. Also, weight training, which has really improved my power and climbing, I highly recommend it.</p><h2>Experience</h2><div id=\"attachment_280204\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06221713/tyler-and-watts-thomson-bike-tour-portugal-gravel-2.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-280204\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06221713/tyler-and-watts-thomson-bike-tour-portugal-gravel-2.jpg\" alt=\"Rolling through Portugal's countryside with Thomson Bike Tour\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06221713/tyler-and-watts-thomson-bike-tour-portugal-gravel-2.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06221713/tyler-and-watts-thomson-bike-tour-portugal-gravel-2-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06221713/tyler-and-watts-thomson-bike-tour-portugal-gravel-2-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06221713/tyler-and-watts-thomson-bike-tour-portugal-gravel-2-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06221713/tyler-and-watts-thomson-bike-tour-portugal-gravel-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06221713/tyler-and-watts-thomson-bike-tour-portugal-gravel-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-280204\">Rolling through Portugal’s countryside with Thomson Bike Tours. Photo: Marc Gasch</p></div><p>Surprisingly, despite travel only ramping up toward the end of the year, I’ve managed to have several big ride experiences that are worth sharing, but two (sorta three) stand out. First was Thomson Bike Tour’s new Gravel Tour series. Watts and I rode along on their first-ever <a href=\"https://www.thomsonbiketours.com/trips/gravel-portugal/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Portugal Gravel trip</a>, which traverses the southern tip of the country and finishes near the coast. Bookended by a day in Lisbon to explore the city by foot, eating and drinking our way thru castles and squares, it was an epic cycling vacation.</p><div id=\"attachment_280205\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06221716/tyler-and-watts-thomson-bike-tour-portugal-gravel-3.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-280205\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06221716/tyler-and-watts-thomson-bike-tour-portugal-gravel-3.jpg\" alt=\"gravel cyclists on portugals southern coast on rock overlook\" width=\"1400\" height=\"933\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06221716/tyler-and-watts-thomson-bike-tour-portugal-gravel-3.jpg 1400w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06221716/tyler-and-watts-thomson-bike-tour-portugal-gravel-3-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06221716/tyler-and-watts-thomson-bike-tour-portugal-gravel-3-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06221716/tyler-and-watts-thomson-bike-tour-portugal-gravel-3-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06221716/tyler-and-watts-thomson-bike-tour-portugal-gravel-3-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-280205\">The rocky southern coast of Portugal, where I definitely will go back to surf. Photo: Marc Gasch</p></div><p>What stood out about it was how amazingly well Thomson’s recon crew strung together 80% or more gravel and dirt roads. Considering we rode almost 300 miles over 6 days, climbing almost 25,000 feet, that’s impressive. And the few road bits we did ride were very nice, too.</p><p>It was hard. While the amenities and meals are nice, their focus is clearly on the quality of the ride, and it shows. Also, their staff are awesome. I highly recommend it if you’re looking for a cycling-centric vacation that lets you explore an area from the backroads. We have a full story and video about the trip coming soon.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/05191208/belgian-waffle-ride-and-big-sugar-race-photos.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/05191208/belgian-waffle-ride-and-big-sugar-race-photos.jpg\" alt=\"tyler at belgian waffle ride nc and big sugar gravel bike races\" width=\"1200\" height=\"788\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/05191208/belgian-waffle-ride-and-big-sugar-race-photos.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/05191208/belgian-waffle-ride-and-big-sugar-race-photos-297x195.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/05191208/belgian-waffle-ride-and-big-sugar-race-photos-800x525.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/05191208/belgian-waffle-ride-and-big-sugar-race-photos-120x79.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/05191208/belgian-waffle-ride-and-big-sugar-race-photos-768x504.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p>I also really enjoyed “racing” (more like participating) in the inaugural NC Belgian Waffle Ride and Big Sugar events this year. Both were about 103 miles, with about 10,000 and 8,000 feet of climbing respectively. Both were amazing, but for slightly different reasons.</p><p><a href=\"https://belgianwaffleride.bike/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BWR NC</a> was about 70% paved, but the roads (scouted out by Gulo Composite’s team) were phenomenal. At the finish, we got a cold towel and a giant beer, and then the heavens opened and rain dumped on us. But a crazy thing happened…no one left. It’s one of very, <em>very</em> few races where people stuck around, had more beers, cheered on late finishers, and created a killer vibe.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.bigsugargravel.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Big Sugar</a> was almost 80% gravel, and it was hard. Like, <em>really</em> hard. But there was a brewery stop in the middle, and our race numbers had a ticket for a free beer there. And if we wanted to burn our meal ticket, we could do it there, or save it for the finish…where our 2nd beer ticket could be redeemed. That it was combined with Outerbike, and finished in downtown Bentonville, AR, made it a great weekend and an awesome event.</p><h2>MOUNTAIN BIKE</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06170840/santa-cruz-blue-2021-xc-race-bike-review.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06170840/santa-cruz-blue-2021-xc-race-bike-review.jpg\" alt=\"santa cruz blur xc 2021 race bike review\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1050\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06170840/santa-cruz-blue-2021-xc-race-bike-review.jpg 1400w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06170840/santa-cruz-blue-2021-xc-race-bike-review-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06170840/santa-cruz-blue-2021-xc-race-bike-review-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06170840/santa-cruz-blue-2021-xc-race-bike-review-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06170840/santa-cruz-blue-2021-xc-race-bike-review-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\"></a></p><p><strong>EDITOR’S CHOICE: Santa Cruz Blur XC</strong><br>Most of my mountain biking this year has been on my own bikes, testing other components. But that doesn’t diminish in any way the fact that the new <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/all-new-santa-cruz-blur-gets-superlight-super-fast-with-single-pivot-design/\">Santa Cruz Blur</a> is a standout bike. It’s amazingly light at just 23lb 2oz (10.49kg) out of the box, in an XL size…with 2.4″ tires, remote lockout, and a dropper post!</p><p>That combination of full functionality spec and a rippin’ fast, efficient suspension design that’s surprisingly capable for having just 100mm of travel makes it an absolutely stunning bike to ride. The geo is modern, and if you need something a little more aggressive, go for the trail version with a 120mm fork and 115mm rear travel…or make your own by simply swapping out the fork and shock, the XC and TR versions share the same frame.</p><h2>ROAD &amp; GRAVEL BIKES</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/27183011/bmc-urs-lt-gravel-bike-review-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/27183011/bmc-urs-lt-gravel-bike-review-2.jpg\" alt=\"bmc urs lt full suspension gravel bike review ride down a mountain pass in switzerland\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1046\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/27183011/bmc-urs-lt-gravel-bike-review-2.jpg 1400w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/27183011/bmc-urs-lt-gravel-bike-review-2-297x222.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/27183011/bmc-urs-lt-gravel-bike-review-2-800x598.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/27183011/bmc-urs-lt-gravel-bike-review-2-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/27183011/bmc-urs-lt-gravel-bike-review-2-768x574.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\"></a></p><p><strong>EDITOR’S CHOICE: BMC URS LT</strong><br>Is it telling that all three of my favorite drop bar bikes this year are gravel bikes? Leading the pack is the new <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bmc-urs-lt-full-suspension-gravel-bike/\">BMC URS LT</a>, which took their rear micro-suspension concept and found a way to add it to the front. Except they did it completely differently, with a coil-sprung, hydraulically damped steerer tube design.</p><p>The result is a bike that looks normal but rides like nothing else. Small chatter and rain ruts? No problem. Loose over hard and chunky corners? Won’t slip. And that’s the most impressive part, the traction. Yep, it’s comfortable, too. I was able to rail the roughest corners with confidence and finish a 7 hour day feeling fresh. The ride quality is nothing short of amazing, and you can check <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-bmc-urs-lt-gravel-bikes-micro-suspension-gives-it-macro-shred-ability/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">my full URS LT review</a> with video for more details.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/29171631/fezzari-shafer-review-bikepacking-setup.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/29171631/fezzari-shafer-review-bikepacking-setup.jpg\" alt=\"fezzari shafer gravel bike with road wheels and frame bags by a street sign\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1050\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/29171631/fezzari-shafer-review-bikepacking-setup.jpg 1400w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/29171631/fezzari-shafer-review-bikepacking-setup-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/29171631/fezzari-shafer-review-bikepacking-setup-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/29171631/fezzari-shafer-review-bikepacking-setup-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/29171631/fezzari-shafer-review-bikepacking-setup-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\"></a></p><p><strong>EDITOR’S CHOICE: Fezzari Shafer</strong><br>The all-new <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/fezzari-shafer-gravel-bike-debuts-with-tons-of-mounts-dialed-geometry-lightweight-frame/\">Fezzari Shafer</a> is both road bike and gravel bike. Well, technically it’s a gravel bike, but of the nearly 800 miles I have on this bike so far, about half are on the pavement, and more than half of those are with it loaded down as shown above.</p><p>You can read my <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-fezzari-shafer-is-an-adventure-ready-gravel-bike-thats-ready-to-race/\">full Shafer review</a> here for more, but suffice to say it’s light, comfortable, fast, and extremely versatile. I’d argue it’s also quite good looking. With enough mounts across the frame and fork to be a proper bikepacking rig, but a light enough frame to use for gravel racing or everyday group rides, it’s quite literally a quiver killer for most folks.</p><p>My pick would be the Campagnolo Ekar build because that group is freakin’ amazing and would have been called out here if Cory hadn’t already had it in his Editor’s Choice roundup last year. Just grab a lighter, aero wheelset for road riding and you’ve got everything you need for every drop bar adventure. Oh, and complete bikes <a href=\"https://www.fezzari.com/shafer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">start at just $2,299</a>…seriously.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/05202821/tyler-riding-specialized-crux-lightest-gravel-bike.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/05202821/tyler-riding-specialized-crux-lightest-gravel-bike.jpg\" alt=\"tyler riding the specialized crux worlds lightest gravel bike at maple sally\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1050\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/05202821/tyler-riding-specialized-crux-lightest-gravel-bike.jpg 1400w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/05202821/tyler-riding-specialized-crux-lightest-gravel-bike-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/05202821/tyler-riding-specialized-crux-lightest-gravel-bike-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/05202821/tyler-riding-specialized-crux-lightest-gravel-bike-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/05202821/tyler-riding-specialized-crux-lightest-gravel-bike-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\"></a></p><p><strong>HONORABLE MENTION: Specialized Crux</strong><br>The world’s lightest gravel bike? That can also fit huge tires? Yes, please! The <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/all-new-specialized-crux-goes-full-gas-on-gravel-racing-w-725g-frame-big-tires/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">new Specialized Crux</a> took all the ultralight carbon layup tricks they learned with the Aethos road bike (which <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bikerumor-editors-choice-awards-2020-tylers-best-bikes-gear-picks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">made my list last year</a>) and applied it to a race-ready gravel bike. The result is a purpose-built drop bar bike that’s wicked fast and light.</p><p>There aren’t any accessory mounts, because it’s made for racing, but there are three bottle cage mounts. The handling is spot on for going fast, and it begs you to push it just a bit faster. This isn’t a Grinduro bike, but it might be the perfect SBT or Unbound bike, just swap the tires based on the course, up to 700×47 if you know it’s gonna be a bit rough. Oh, and that paint scheme…it’s gorgeous.</p><h2>E-BIKES</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/22181453/2021-specialized-turbo-levo-eMTB-ride-review-02.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/22181453/2021-specialized-turbo-levo-eMTB-ride-review-02.jpg\" alt=\"specialized levo turbo 3 cornering hard\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1125\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/22181453/2021-specialized-turbo-levo-eMTB-ride-review-02.jpg 1500w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/22181453/2021-specialized-turbo-levo-eMTB-ride-review-02-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/22181453/2021-specialized-turbo-levo-eMTB-ride-review-02-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/22181453/2021-specialized-turbo-levo-eMTB-ride-review-02-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/22181453/2021-specialized-turbo-levo-eMTB-ride-review-02-768x576.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/22181453/2021-specialized-turbo-levo-eMTB-ride-review-02-696x522.jpg 696w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/22181453/2021-specialized-turbo-levo-eMTB-ride-review-02-1068x801.jpg 1068w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/22181453/2021-specialized-turbo-levo-eMTB-ride-review-02-560x420.jpg 560w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/22181453/2021-specialized-turbo-levo-eMTB-ride-review-02-80x60.jpg 80w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/22181453/2021-specialized-turbo-levo-eMTB-ride-review-02-265x198.jpg 265w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></a></p><p><strong>EDITOR’S CHOICE – eMTB: Specialized Turbo Levo</strong><br>There are a lot of good e-mountain bikes out, and I have a lot of them in for long term review. What separates the Specialized Turbo Levo is that it takes a holistic, proprietary approach to the drive system. With a custom motor, custom software, and custom controls and app, it allows them (and, ultimately, you) to fine tune the way it works based on your preferences.</p><p>Need to save battery? Maximize power? Or let the software figure out how much assist to provide so you can finish with a little juice left in the battery? The Levo does that, all while demolishing rough terrain and aggressive trails…and climbs. Like all of Specialized’s e-bikes, it’s expensive, but there’s a good reason for it.

This year, we brought along a non-cyclist father/son combo thanks to loaners from Bulls Bikes. The dad rode the all-road <a href=\"https://www.bullsbikesusa.com/desert-falcon-evo.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Desert Falcon EVO e-bike</a>, which works as both a road and gravel bike, depending on the tires.</p><p>The son rode the <a href=\"https://www.bullsbikesusa.com/urban-evo-10-diamond.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Urban EVO 10 Diamond</a>, a Class 3 commuter e-bike with a rear rack, plus some rather nice grips and saddle to class it up a bit. Both used Bosch motors and Shimano drivetrains, and have swappable batteries, making it possible for both riders to have plenty of assist <em>and</em> still make it 80+ miles each day. Both bikes worked great, and come well-spec’d for the price. The dad enjoyed it so much he ended up buying a non-electric bike afterward and has been joining us on group rides since!</p><h2>CYCLING KITS</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/05185859/chpt3-most-days-jersey-and-bibshort-review.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/05185859/chpt3-most-days-jersey-and-bibshort-review.jpg\" alt=\"david millar chpt3 most days cycling jersey and bibshorts review on a cyclist\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/05185859/chpt3-most-days-jersey-and-bibshort-review.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/05185859/chpt3-most-days-jersey-and-bibshort-review-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/05185859/chpt3-most-days-jersey-and-bibshort-review-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/05185859/chpt3-most-days-jersey-and-bibshort-review-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/05185859/chpt3-most-days-jersey-and-bibshort-review-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p><strong>EDITOR’S CHOICE – KIT: CHPT3 Most Days</strong><br>David Millar’s CHPT3 clothing brand is pretty simple…there’s really just one road kit in a few colors. The <a href=\"https://chpt3.com/en-int/collections/most-days-mens-jerseys/products/most-days-performance-mens-jersey-forest-green\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Most Days Performance Jersey</a> pairs with the <a href=\"https://chpt3.com/en-int/collections/most-days-mens-shorts/products/most-days-mens-bib-short-outer-space\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Most Days Bibshort</a>. Mix and match the colors, they all seem to work together, and you’re likely to get as many compliments as I did while wearing them. Fortunately, the substance matches the style, with an all-day comfortable chamois and just-right fit.</p><p>I do wish the jersey pockets were just a tad deeper, and the bibs require a bit of lean-over to pull them down far enough for potty breaks, but otherwise, this is an amazing kit. I even took a spill testing the new Crux and there’s but one tiny hole on the shoulder, so they’re durable, too. The leg gripper and sleeve length are just right, and overall it’s just a super comfortable kit that really is great for Most Days. Bonus points for being moderately priced, too.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/05191206/assos-mille-gt-reflective-cycling-jacket.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/05191206/assos-mille-gt-reflective-cycling-jacket.jpg\" alt=\"MILLE GT CLIMA JACKET EVO\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/05191206/assos-mille-gt-reflective-cycling-jacket.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/05191206/assos-mille-gt-reflective-cycling-jacket-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/05191206/assos-mille-gt-reflective-cycling-jacket-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/05191206/assos-mille-gt-reflective-cycling-jacket-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/05191206/assos-mille-gt-reflective-cycling-jacket-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p><strong>EDITOR’S CHOICE – JACKET: Assos Mille GT Clima Jacket Evo<br></strong>The <a href=\"https://www.assos.com/us/mille-gt-clima-jacket-evo-182127.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Assos Mille GT Clima Jacket Evo</a> is a mouthful to say, but the feature set is even bigger. With windproof and highly water-resistant membrane bonded to an extremely lightweight mesh, it’s a perfect multi-season shell for any ride. It’s light, easily scrunches up small enough to cram in a jersey pocket, and the cut is just loose enough to easily get on or off while riding. A pass-thru slot allows jersey pocket access, too.</p><p>What really sets it apart are the microscopic reflective glass beads infused into the membrane, making it wildly reflective all the way around. Unlike some hi-viz jackets, Assos pulls it off with a subdued, not-too-shiny look that fits with their high-end kits. A soft collar makes it comfy even when full zipped up for more protection, too.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06170831/gore-cycling-jersey-removable-sleeves-review.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06170831/gore-cycling-jersey-removable-sleeves-review.jpg\" alt=\"gore phantom cycling jacket jersey with removable sleeves\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06170831/gore-cycling-jersey-removable-sleeves-review.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06170831/gore-cycling-jersey-removable-sleeves-review-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06170831/gore-cycling-jersey-removable-sleeves-review-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06170831/gore-cycling-jersey-removable-sleeves-review-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06170831/gore-cycling-jersey-removable-sleeves-review-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p><strong>HONORABLE MENTION: Gore Phantom Jacket</strong><br>This one’s quite an interesting piece. Unlike most “jackets” with removable sleeves that turn into vests, this one becomes a jersey, with mid-length sleeves underneath. The beauty of the <a href=\"https://www.gorewear.com/us/en-us/phantom-jacket-mens-100645?variant=978\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gore Phantom Jacket’s</a> design is that you don’t need to wear a regular jersey underneath; just slide the arms off once you warm up and you’re all set for shoulder-season rides without overheating your core.</p><p>The body and removable sleeves are GORE-TEX Infinium with Windstopper, which is also water-resistant. It’s a slim fit that wears much more like a jersey than a jacket. There <em>are</em> a lot of seams, so I’d recommend pairing with bibshorts or a base layer for more comfort. The rear has three pockets, with the two outer ones being kinda narrow…which are perfect for securing a smartphone, but just a bit tricky to dig into while riding. A fourth zippered pocket stashes cash and keys safely. Reflective elements throughout help keep you visible.</p><div id=\"attachment_280193\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06184903/duer-stay-dry-denim-slim-stretch-mens-jeans.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-280193\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06184903/duer-stay-dry-denim-slim-stretch-mens-jeans.jpg\" alt=\"duer stay dry slim performance stretch jeans shown from all angles\" width=\"1200\" height=\"561\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06184903/duer-stay-dry-denim-slim-stretch-mens-jeans.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06184903/duer-stay-dry-denim-slim-stretch-mens-jeans-297x139.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06184903/duer-stay-dry-denim-slim-stretch-mens-jeans-800x374.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06184903/duer-stay-dry-denim-slim-stretch-mens-jeans-120x56.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06184903/duer-stay-dry-denim-slim-stretch-mens-jeans-768x359.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-280193\">Not me…will update with actual photo soon.</p></div><p><strong>HONORABLE MENTION – CASUAL: Duer Stay Dry Denim</strong><br>I just got these and they’ve already become a staple of my wardrobe. <a href=\"https://shopduer.com/collections/mens-stretch-jeans/products/mens-water-resistant-stretch-jeans-slim?color=jet-black\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Duer’s</a> blend of cotton, Coolmax polyester, and Lycra makes them a truly performance pair of stretch jeans, and a biodegradable DWR coating makes them water repellant.

I liked it so much I’ve called in my own for long term review on my own bikes, and I don’t anticipate taking those off anytime soon. They’re wide, with 150mm and 160mm width options that even stays a bit wide through the nose, but they don’t feel weird like some other wider wide-nosed saddles I’ve tried.</p><p>In fact, they feel amazing, thanks in large part to supremely comfortable padding and zero pressure points. But the overall shapes just works, and, while it’s not evident while riding, there must be something to their Wing Flex design. If you’ve been struggling to find a comfortable saddle for long days on rough terrain, you have to check this one out.

The result is a bar that’s simultaneously ultra comfortable and deceptively aerodynamic.</p><p>It’s not so much that the bar itself is super aero, but the way it’s shaped forces your arms and body into a more aerodynamic position, particularly if you grab it close to the center. And since your arms and body are way bigger than the bar, it produces an outsized benefit in drag reduction. It’s essentially free speed that’s also probably the most comfortable road handlebar I’ve ever used.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06200738/sr-suntour-auron-2021-trail-mtb-fork-review.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06200738/sr-suntour-auron-2021-trail-mtb-fork-review.jpg\" alt=\"sr suntour auron rc2 mountain bike suspension fork review\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1050\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06200738/sr-suntour-auron-2021-trail-mtb-fork-review.jpg 1400w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06200738/sr-suntour-auron-2021-trail-mtb-fork-review-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06200738/sr-suntour-auron-2021-trail-mtb-fork-review-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06200738/sr-suntour-auron-2021-trail-mtb-fork-review-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06200738/sr-suntour-auron-2021-trail-mtb-fork-review-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\"></a></p><p><strong>EDITOR’S CHOICE – SUSPENSION FORK: SR Suntour Auron R2C</strong><br>Other than, you know, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/sr-suntour-shows-prototype-electronic-suspension-on-tom-pidcocks-gold-medal-mtb/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tom Pidcock winning an Olympic Gold Medal</a> on an SR Suntour fork (and he’s not the first), the brand really doesn’t get the recognition it deserves.

Plus, that matte gray is just kinda sexy looking, too.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06200916/gloworm-g2-mountain-bike-lights-installation-review-5.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06200916/gloworm-g2-mountain-bike-lights-installation-review-5.jpg\" alt=\"gloworm g2 mountain bike lights for night riding\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06200916/gloworm-g2-mountain-bike-lights-installation-review-5.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06200916/gloworm-g2-mountain-bike-lights-installation-review-5-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06200916/gloworm-g2-mountain-bike-lights-installation-review-5-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06200916/gloworm-g2-mountain-bike-lights-installation-review-5-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06200916/gloworm-g2-mountain-bike-lights-installation-review-5-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p><strong>EDITOR’S CHOICE – BIKE LIGHTS: Gloworm XSV G2.0&nbsp;</strong><br>There’s a reason the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/new-gloworm-g2-0-night-lights-let-you-customize-output-via-app-up-to-3600-lumens/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gloworm G2.0&nbsp;series</a> mountain bike lights are <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/the-best-mountain-bike-lights-of-2021-ride-illuminated-into-fall/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">our best overall choice</a> for MTB night riding. This latest edition takes everything we loved about them -swappable lens elements to customize the beam, long life, wireless remote- and made them better.

On an e-Bike, the tough casing let me get away with low pressures without squirm, and the grippy rubber bit into whatever I rolled across, from soft dirt to solid rock surfaces at Kanuga bike park.</p><p>Riding them through Pisgah’s rocks and roots proved their grip was undeniably good under a human-powered bike, too. While they’re a bit heavy for those hour-long climbs that NC’s Blue Ridge Mountains are (in)famous for, they make up for it on the chunky, rocky descents where lesser tires get sliced and shredded. If you need a tough tire for trail to enduro, the Specialized <a href=\"https://www.specialized.com/us/en/butcher-grid-trail-2bliss-ready-t9/p/187347?color=300425-187347\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Butcher</a> and <a href=\"https://www.specialized.com/us/en/eliminator-grid-trail-2bliss-ready-t7/p/173627?color=272180-173627\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Eliminator</a> T7/9 tires won’t disappoint.

That’s the OneUp EDC system, and it’s fantastic.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.oneupcomponents.com/collections/edc/products/edc-pump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OneUp EDC Pump</a> comes with an integrated CO2 chuck in the head; just thread it out and attach the cartridge. Store that inside the pump and there’s still room for their ECD Multitool, which snaps securely into the storage capsule. The pump itself is no slouch, especially if you opt for the larger 100cc model, which actually inflates proper mountain bike tires in a reasonable amount of time.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06170835/osprey-syncro-20-hydration-pack-for-mtb-review.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06170835/osprey-syncro-20-hydration-pack-for-mtb-review.jpg\" alt=\"osprey syncro 20 hydration pack review\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06170835/osprey-syncro-20-hydration-pack-for-mtb-review.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06170835/osprey-syncro-20-hydration-pack-for-mtb-review-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06170835/osprey-syncro-20-hydration-pack-for-mtb-review-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06170835/osprey-syncro-20-hydration-pack-for-mtb-review-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06170835/osprey-syncro-20-hydration-pack-for-mtb-review-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p><strong>EDITOR’S CHOICE – HYDRATION PACK: Osprey Syncro 20</strong><br>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=ale&amp;pw=147535&amp;mi=16517&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.osprey.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fproduct%2Fsyncro-20-SYNCRO20S19_338.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc\">Osprey Syncro 20</a> is their largest mountain bike hydration pack, yet it’s extremely lightweight. Which is remarkable considering how many features it packs in, from a rain cover to helmet holder, tons of pockets and sleeves and internal organization, and even a dedicated reservoir chamber.</p><p>This is my go-to pack when we’re headed out for photo shoots as I can fit my Sony A7S III in a hard case, plus a couple of GoPros, all the mounts, phone, snacks, tool, pump, shock pump, and a 3L reservoir. Thanks to their wing-shaped shoulder harness, chest- and waist straps, and upper- and lower compression straps on the sides, the whole thing stays stable even over jumps, drops and whoops, too.</p><p>And the separated AirSpeed back panel keeps the pack from resting directly on my jersey and making a sweaty mess. Bonus points for securely holding a GoPro with MaxGrip Tripod handle in the side pockets, captured by the side compression straps, making it quickly accessible. If you carry a lot of stuff, this pack is definitely worth a look.</p><h2>OFF THE BIKE</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06213647/best-coffee-grinder-and-sneakers-for-cyclists.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06213647/best-coffee-grinder-and-sneakers-for-cyclists.jpg\" alt=\"fellows ode brew coffee grinder review and allett rfid wallet review\" width=\"1437\" height=\"1074\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06213647/best-coffee-grinder-and-sneakers-for-cyclists.jpg 1437w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06213647/best-coffee-grinder-and-sneakers-for-cyclists-297x222.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06213647/best-coffee-grinder-and-sneakers-for-cyclists-800x598.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06213647/best-coffee-grinder-and-sneakers-for-cyclists-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06213647/best-coffee-grinder-and-sneakers-for-cyclists-768x574.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1437px) 100vw, 1437px\"></a></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.all-ett.com/collections/rfid-wallets/products/hybrid-card-wallet-leather?variant=39668453376164\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Allet Hybrid Card Wallet</a> combines a Nappa leather and three internal card sleeves plus a micro-pen slot into a slim profile that also has RFID protection. I love how slim it is, yet still able to carry several credit cards, cash, ID and the requisite Costco membership and health insurance cards.</p><p>So, I wanted to try <a href=\"https://loomfootwear.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Loom’s Waterproof Sneakers</a> because they use a Merino wool lining, waterproof knit exterior, ultralight foam cushioning, and claim to be eco-friendly and cruelty-free. But, their sizing is off by about one full U.S. size, so the 13 fit like a 12, and my toes crammed against the front.</p><p>So I gave them to my teenage son, who pretty much destroys shoes by climbing on stuff, riding to school every day, and otherwise just being a teenager who wears the same shoes every day until they fall apart. These have outlasted anything else he’s owned and, many months later, still look almost new. And he says they’re very comfortable. They’re great, just size up (regardless of what their sizing chart says, trust me).</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08V3VFXCN/?tag=20br-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fellow Ode Brew Grinder</a> replaced my old, perfectly functional but deafening burr grinder because I was tired of having to wrap several towels around it every morning to avoid waking the fam. Not only is the Ode Brew Grinder much, much quieter, it’s also unfathomably fast. A full pot’s worth of beans grinds in just a few seconds. It does fling a few grinds as you remove the cup (thanks, static electricity), and it’s expensive, but it’s worth the peace, quiet, and simplicity.</p><p>If I have to say anything more about the <a href=\"https://www.benchmade.com/535-3-bugout.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Benchmade 535-3 Bugout</a> EDC pocket knife other than that the handle is milled carbon fiber, it’s probably not worth explaining why I love this thing so much. It’s made in the USA, has an S90V steel blade that’s plenty sharp, and…the handle is carbon fiber.</p><h2>…and then there’s NFTs</h2><div id=\"attachment_280201\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06214108/tylers-nft-collection.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-280201\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06214108/tylers-nft-collection.jpg\" alt=\"tylers nft collection\" width=\"979\" height=\"648\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06214108/tylers-nft-collection.jpg 979w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06214108/tylers-nft-collection-297x197.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06214108/tylers-nft-collection-800x530.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06214108/tylers-nft-collection-120x79.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06214108/tylers-nft-collection-768x508.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 979px) 100vw, 979px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-280201\">Just some of my NFTS. Clockwise from top left: Blockchain Badlands, Rebel Rabbits, Blockchain Billionaires, Foxy Fam, Wobblebug, and MetaTravellers. I regret <em>nothing!</em></p></div><p>If I haven’t lost you yet, I wanna share one more experience that I’m stoked on from this year. And I intentionally buried this down here because many of you are probably going to roll your eyes and check out after the next 5 words: I’ve totally gotten into NFTs.</p><p>Still here?</p><p>Let me explain why diving headfirst into crypto and NFT has been an amazing experience. First, because it’s been simply fascinating to learn about not just where it’s been, but where these things are headed and how they will 100% guaranteed impact your life in the very near future, whether you like it or not. Everything from music to gaming to sports will see some aspect of their industries upended by blockchain technology.</p><p>Right about now you’re either nodding in agreement or you think I’m an idiot, so let me explain the second reason this has been (and continues to be) an amazing experience: The community.</p><p>If that sounds trite, then you’re not into it yet, or you haven’t found the right project. The good NFT projects aren’t about the art (because, yes, I know, you can right-click that JPG and now you “own” it, too… Sure, whatever). They’re about the community they build around the project and the real-world utility they offer. And THAT is where these things start getting really, <em>really</em> interesting.</p><p>Third, and I never thought I’d say this, they’ve made Twitter fun again. Not the watching-a-dumpster-fire-burn-out-of-control kind of fun, either. Fun because the NFT community as a whole is massively friendly and supportive in ways regular Twitter definitely is not. We build each other up, not tear everyone down. It’s like a parallel universe of nice people. <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/tylerbenedict\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Follow me</a> and you’ll see.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06214339/BikeClubNFT-feature-banner.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06214339/BikeClubNFT-feature-banner.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"600\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06214339/BikeClubNFT-feature-banner.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06214339/BikeClubNFT-feature-banner-297x149.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06214339/BikeClubNFT-feature-banner-800x400.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06214339/BikeClubNFT-feature-banner-120x60.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06214339/BikeClubNFT-feature-banner-768x384.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p>So, what’s the cycling tie-in? I promise, this isn’t a shill, you can absolutely ignore this if you want. But I, along with three other cycling industry nerds, have launched <a href=\"http://www.bikeclub.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bike Club NFT</a>. Zach was kind enough <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bike-club-nft-is-the-first-blockchain-based-cycling-club-to-be-minting-real-world-benefits/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">to cover it here</a>. I’m beyond excited about it, and I hope you will be, too. This is a totally separate project from Bikerumor, so this is the only time I’ll mention it here, but I hope you’ll check it out.</p><p>I’ll finish with this: The support we’ve received from both industry and riders has been amazing, and it’s introduced me to incredible people that, even as the founder of Bikerumor, I’d likely have never met, and <em>that</em> is a big part of why this such an amazing new experience.</p><p>(Don’t worry, I’m not going anywhere, I’m still deeply and gratefully involved in Bikerumor and have been working very hard behind the scenes with <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bikerumor-merges-with-gearjunkie-switchback-travel-more/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">our new owners</a> to turn things up a notch here…but that’s a whole ‘nother experience, and a story for another time!)</p><p>Here’s hoping you and yours have a wonderful holiday season, making your own experiences and planning for new ones!
