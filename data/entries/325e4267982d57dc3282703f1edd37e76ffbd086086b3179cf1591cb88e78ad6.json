But it's not unprecedented: The US Marine Corps has also tested <a href=\"https://www.twz.com/marines-test-fire-robot-dog-armed-with-rocket-launcher\">robotic dogs armed with rocket launchers</a> in the past.</p>\n<p>MARSOC is currently in possession of two armed Q-UGVs undergoing testing, as confirmed by Onyx Industries staff, and their gun systems are based on Onyx's <a href=\"https://onyx-ind.com/otss/\">SENTRY remote weapon system</a> (RWS), which features an AI-enabled digital imaging system and can automatically detect and track people, drones, or vehicles, reporting potential targets to a remote human operator that could be located anywhere in the world. The system maintains a human-in-the-loop control for fire decisions, and it cannot decide to fire autonomously.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022843#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022843&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"325e4267982d57dc3282703f1edd37e76ffbd086086b3179cf1591cb88e78ad6","category":"Tech"}
