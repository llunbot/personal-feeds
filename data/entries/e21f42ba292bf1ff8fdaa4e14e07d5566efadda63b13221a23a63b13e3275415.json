One thing the companies have done to get software developers on board is to offer mini PC developer kits, which can be connected to a software developer's normal multi-monitor setup and doesn't require the same cash outlay as an equivalently specced Surface tablet or laptop.</p>\n\n<p>Qualcomm has announced the <a href=\"https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2024/05/qualcomm-accelerates-development-for-copilot--pcs-with-snapdrago\">Snapdragon Dev Kit for Windows</a>, a small black plastic mini PC with the same internal hardware as the new wave of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/microsofts-copilot-ai-pc-requirements-are-embarrassing-for-intel-and-amd/\">Copilot+ PCs</a> with Snapdragon X Plus and Snapdragon X Elite processors in them. The box is fairly generously specced, with a slightly faster-than-normal version of the Snapdragon X Elite that can boost up to 4.3 GHz, 32GB of RAM, and a 512GB NVMe SSD.</p>\n<p>Unlike the Windows Dev Kit 2023, which appeared to be a repurposed Surface Pro 9 motherboard thrown into a black plastic box, the Snapdragon Dev Kit appears to be purpose-built. It has a single USB-C port on the front and two USB-C ports, an HDMI port, two USB-A ports, a headphone/speaker jack, and an Ethernet port in the back. This isn't an overwhelming complement of ports, but it's in line with what Apple offers in the Mac mini.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025919#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025919&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e21f42ba292bf1ff8fdaa4e14e07d5566efadda63b13221a23a63b13e3275415","category":"Tech"}
