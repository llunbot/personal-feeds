This time, it’s with his first physical product that’s actually available for purchase! Fabricated by Jank Components out of Bellingham WA, the Jank Beverage clip is a <a href=\"https://jankcomponents.com/products/jank-beer-cage-beer-can-holder-for-bikes\">unique way to carry your favorite can of beer</a>, utilizing your bike’s water bottle bosses – just don’t expect your beverage to be kept cold and unshaken along the way. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Jank-x-Outside-Brenden-Beverage-Clip-down-tube-mount.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Jank-x-Outside-Brenden-Beverage-Clip-down-tube-mount-800x600.jpeg\" alt=\"Jank x Outside Brenden Beverage Clip down tube mount\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Jank-x-Outside-Brenden-Beverage-Clip-down-tube-mount-800x600.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Jank-x-Outside-Brenden-Beverage-Clip-down-tube-mount-297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Jank-x-Outside-Brenden-Beverage-Clip-down-tube-mount-120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Jank-x-Outside-Brenden-Beverage-Clip-down-tube-mount-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Jank-x-Outside-Brenden-Beverage-Clip-down-tube-mount.jpeg 1280w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Jank Components)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The product seemed to have gotten legs after Brendan posted his 3D-printed prototype to his IG.

There are three different versions that can accommodate a regular can (12oz), a tallboy can (16oz), and a stovepipe can (19.2oz). </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Jank-x-Outside-Brenden-Beverage-Clip-sizes.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Jank-x-Outside-Brenden-Beverage-Clip-sizes-800x600.jpeg\" alt=\"Jank x Outside Brenden Beverage Clip sizes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Jank-x-Outside-Brenden-Beverage-Clip-sizes-800x600.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Jank-x-Outside-Brenden-Beverage-Clip-sizes-297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Jank-x-Outside-Brenden-Beverage-Clip-sizes-120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Jank-x-Outside-Brenden-Beverage-Clip-sizes-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Jank-x-Outside-Brenden-Beverage-Clip-sizes.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I do like the description of the Jank Beverage Clip on their website… “<em>Think of this as a pump holder but instead of holding a tire pump it holds a mood pump”.</em> There are some older versions of the beverage clip available on the website as well. The newer versions are 3D printed from HTPA-CF, for a durable final product. Prefer to 3D print your own? You can purchase the <a href=\"https://outsidebrendan.com/products/12-oz-can-holder-3d-file\" target=\"_blank\">STL files from Brendan’s website for $4.99</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Retail: </strong>$19.99 – $24.99</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jank Components have a few more cool 3D printed items on the website as well, like the<a href=\"https://jankcomponents.com/products/spare-sram-axs-battery-holder\"> SRAM AXS Battery Holder</a>, a <a href=\"https://jankcomponents.com/products/side-mount-for-dynaplug-racer\">Side Mount for Dynaplug Racer</a>, and the <a href=\"https://jankcomponents.com/products/love-dart-edc-pump-stans-dart-add-on\">Plug Buddy/EDC Stan’s Dart Add-on</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check the other stuff they offer as well at the link below. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://jankcomponents.com/\">JankComponents.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/like-warm-shaken-beer-check-out-the-jank-beverage-clip/\">Like Warm, Shaken Beer?
