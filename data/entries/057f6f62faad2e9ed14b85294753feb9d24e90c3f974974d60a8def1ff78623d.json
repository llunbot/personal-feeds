This guide demystifies the different categories to help you to narrow down the options if you’re in the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Types of road bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Road bikes are a broad category of bikes designed for – as their name says – riding on tarmacked roads, as opposed to mountain bikes, which are designed purely for off-road use. Within the road bike universe there is a range of bikes adapted for different uses. Some of them are even designed for a bit of off-road action, while the popular gravel bike category (explained below) will let you head onto unpaved surfaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s worth thinking about the type of riding you want to do before choosing a bike, although many novice riders find within a couple of years that they want to upgrade to a new bike that better suits needs and aspirations they didn’t know they had.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Already know what you’re after? Head to our guide to the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-road-bike\" target=\"_blank\">best road bikes</a>. For the rest of you, these are the three major types of road bike…</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Endurance road bike</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/canyon-endurace-cf-7-etap-review-1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Endurance road bike\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/canyon-endurace-cf-7-etap-review-1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/canyon-endurace-cf-7-etap-review-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/canyon-endurace-cf-7-etap-review-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/canyon-endurace-cf-7-etap-review-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/canyon-endurace-cf-7-etap-review-1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/canyon-endurace-cf-7-etap-review-1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/canyon-endurace-cf-7-etap-review-1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/canyon-endurace-cf-7-etap-review-1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/canyon-endurace-cf-7-etap-review-1-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/canyon-endurace-cf-7-etap-review-1.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Matthew Loveridge / Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Fairly upright geometry</strong></li><li><strong>Wider tyres and other comfort features</strong></li><li><strong>Wide spread of gears</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>An endurance road bike, also called a sportive bike, is designed to provide a comfortable riding position and plenty of gears so that you can climb hills while still making good progress on the flat. That allows you to ride for longer distances without getting tired, but it also makes an endurance bike a good option for the novice rider.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A typical endurance bike will have a short reach, putting the handlebars within easy reach and encouraging you to sit upright, placing more of your weight on the saddle. It’s likely to have a high stack as well – the height of the top of the head tube and hence the handlebars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most entry-level bikes will have endurance geometry and an alloy frame, possibly with a carbon fork to help reduce road vibration. Move further up the price range and carbon fibre takes over, often leading to a lighter bike. Titanium and steel are also options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The number of gears typically increases as well, starting from around eight and going up to 12. Wide tyres make a big difference in how comfortable a road bike is to ride and endurance bikes will typically have tyres that are 28mm wide or more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More expensive endurance bikes may get added comfort features. Examples are Specialized’s Future Shock stem, the Canyon VCLS split seatpost and the IsoSpeed system found on some Trek bikes, all designed to help smooth out road imperfections. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Examples of endurance bikes that we’ve reviewed at <em>Cyclist</em>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/cannondale-synapse-carbon-1-rle-review\" target=\"_blank\">Cannondale Synapse</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/canyon-endurace-cf-7-etap-review\" target=\"_blank\">Canyon Endurace CF</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/giant-defy-advanced-2-review\" target=\"_blank\">Giant Defy</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-s-works-roubaix-review\" target=\"_blank\">Specialized Roubaix</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>2.

The bikes ridden by professional cyclists can be very expensive, but bike brands usually make cheaper versions of their racing bikes too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carbon fibre is almost always the preferred frame material, although there are titanium, aluminium and steel options. Components will also be chosen to keep weight down. That usually includes carbon wheel rims, a carbon seatpost and often carbon handlebars. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Almost all race bikes now include aerodynamic tube profiles and integrated handlebar systems with hidden cables to improve the bike’s aerodynamics. Some are designed to be as aero as possible, with deep tube profiles and an aggressive riding position, while others look to keep weight down with a less aerodynamic but lighter frame.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of that makes a racing bike can sometimes be a significantly more expensive option than an entry-level endurance bike, but it will lead to a more sprightly ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most race bikes will seat you in a more hunched-over position than an endurance bike, as however aerodynamic a race bike’s frame is, around 80 percent of the drag when riding comes from the rider. The best way to reduce this is to decrease the size of your frontal profile so that you catch less of the wind, that’s why road bikes – and especially time-trial bikes, as seen below – typically position the rider long and low on the bike. This can get uncomfortable after a while though, particularly for the novice rider, but with practice comes adaptation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Examples of lightweight race bikes that we’ve reviewed at <em>Cyclist</em>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/vitus-vitesse-evo-review-2\" target=\"_blank\">Vitus Vitesse Evo</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-s-works-aethos-review-lightest-ever-disc-brake-bike\" target=\"_blank\">Specialized Aethos</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/festka-scalatore-disc-review\" target=\"_blank\">Fetska Scalatore</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Examples of more aerodynamic race bikes that we’ve reviewed at <em>Cyclist</em>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/merida-reacto-4000-review\" target=\"_blank\">Merida Reacto</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/scott-foil-rc-review\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Foil RC</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/cervelo-s5-review-2\" target=\"_blank\">Cervelo S5</a> </strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. All-road bike</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/12/03072916/bmc-roadmachine-x-1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"All-road bike\" /><figcaption>Joseph Branston / Cyclists</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All-road bikes are the furthest extension of a road bike you can imagine. They blur the line between tarmac and trails, mixing the best bits of an endurance road bike and an all-rounder gravel bike. All-road bikes are designed to handle everything you could encounter on a road from the smoothest streets to light gravel terrain. You can’t always predict where a ride will take you and the all-road edict aims to provide one bike that can handle them all. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In reality, this is quite a vague concept and many all-road bikes could easily fit into other categories. The main common factors however are a relaxed geometry, wide tyre clearance and wide gearing options. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Isn’t that just like an endurance road bike?’, I hear you ask – yes and no. All-road bikes typically take these ideas a step further than endurance road bikes, with typical tyre clearances of around 30-38mm. While many all-road bikes will still come a double crankset, they will generally have easier gearing options and some <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/sram-groupsets-buyers-guide\" target=\"_blank\">component brands, such as SRAM</a>, even have all-road specific chainring options. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All-road bikes are designed to handle a wider range of terrain and so will usually have a more relaxed, upright geometry than an endurance road bike. They may be specced with components such as wider handlebars to help provide more stability on rougher roads. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of these elements can also make all-road bikes perfect winter training bikes, and they will often have multiple mounting points for storage and mudguards. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Examples of all-road bikes we’ve reviewed at <em>Cyclist: </em></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/bianchi-impulso-allroad-review\" target=\"_blank\">Bianchi Impulso Allroad</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/bmc-roadmachine-x-review\" target=\"_blank\">BMC Roadmachine X</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/fara-far-review\" target=\"_blank\">Fara F/AR</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/vitus-venon-evo-rs-ultegra-di2-review\" target=\"_blank\">Vitus Venon Evo</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Types of gravel bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The next category of drop handlebar bike is the gravel bike. It’s a lot newer than the road bike genre and is still evolving. Around ten years ago, the first generation of gravel bikes were either road bikes with slightly wider tyres or rebranded cyclocross bikes (see below). But gravel bikes have changed fast, typically offering around 45mm of tyre clearance and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-gravel-gearing-how-to-get-lower-gears\" target=\"_blank\">lower gearing</a> than a road bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravel bikes are also diversifying, with some designed for riding fast off-road and others more geared towards long-haul gravel adventures, possibly spanning many days, and some even acting as drop-bar mountain bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Already an expert? Head straight to our guide to the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-gravel-bike\" target=\"_blank\">best gravel bikes</a>. If you need to know more first, these are the three loose categories into which gravel bikes can be divided…</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. All-rounder gravel bike</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/cannondale-topstone-carbon-17-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Cannondale Topstone Carbon gravel bike\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/cannondale-topstone-carbon-17-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/cannondale-topstone-carbon-17-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/cannondale-topstone-carbon-17-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/cannondale-topstone-carbon-17-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/cannondale-topstone-carbon-17-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/cannondale-topstone-carbon-17-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/cannondale-topstone-carbon-17-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/cannondale-topstone-carbon-17-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/cannondale-topstone-carbon-17-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/cannondale-topstone-carbon-17.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Lizzie Crabb</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Wide tyre clearance</strong></li><li><strong>Low gearing</strong></li><li><strong>Plenty of mounts for mudguards, a rack, luggage and water bottles</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Many gravel bikes are still designed to cater for a variety of uses. They will offer wide tyre clearance and the option to fit mudguards and a rack, making them a good option for commuting duties as well as off-road leisure riding. There are typically three sets of bottle cage mounts and further mounts for luggage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ride position is quite upright, as with an endurance road bike, for long-distance comfort and to let you change your position to negotiate off-road obstacles. More expensive all-rounder gravel bikes may include some form of front and/or rear suspension.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most all-rounder gravel bikes will have gearing that goes below 1:1, either from a subcompact two-chainring groupset or often from a single chainring groupset with a wide-ranging cassette. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Examples of all-rounder gravel bikes that we’ve reviewed at <em>Cyclist</em>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/giant-revolt-0-review\" target=\"_blank\">Giant Revolt</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/ribble-gravel-sl-review\" target=\"_blank\">Ribble Gravel SL</a> </strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/moots-routt-rsl-review\" target=\"_blank\">Moots Routt RSL</a></strong></li><li><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-sworks-diverge-str-review\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Specialized Diverge STR</strong></a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>2.

To cater for gravel racing, gravel race bikes are much more like road race bikes. They’ll often have aerodynamic tube profiles, narrower handlebars to reduce drag, and typically narrower tyre clearance than all-rounder gravel bikes. They may be higher geared too, to cater for the higher speeds in gravel races.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravel races typically cover long distances, possibly without support, so gravel race bikes will usually have more mounting points than road race bikes, to allow riders to carry extra food and fluids, although they won’t have the full array of luggage mounts found on all-rounder or bikepacking-oriented gravel bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Examples of fast gravel bikes that we’ve reviewed at <em>Cyclist</em>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/cervelo-aspero-review\" target=\"_blank\">Cervélo Áspero</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/bmc-kaius-review\" target=\"_blank\">BMC Kaius</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/factor-ostro-gravel-review\" target=\"_blank\">Factor Ostro Gravel</a> </strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>3.

They’ll be designed to carry lots of luggage and may have mounting points on the fork legs as well as the usual set on the frame itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ride position will be relaxed and the gearing very low to help you get up steep climbs while fully loaded. They’ll often have handlebars that are wide and flared, so you can more easily fit a handlebar bag. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many bikepacking gravel bikes have 650b wheels, rather than the 700c wheel size that’s more common on road bikes. This allows the fitting of wide, grippy tyres that can be run at low pressures to add extra comfort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Examples of bikepacking gravel bikes that we’ve reviewed here at <em>Cyclist</em>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/canyon-grizl-gravel-bike\" target=\"_blank\">Canyon Grizl</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/3t-exploro-ultra-review\" target=\"_blank\">3T Exploro Ultra</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/stanton-switchpath-ti-review\" target=\"_blank\">Stanton Switchpath Ti </a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cyclocross bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/02174307/vitus_energie_evo_cyclocross_copy_of_vituscx-9241-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Rider lifting cyclocross bike off the ground as he runs\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/02174307/vitus_energie_evo_cyclocross_copy_of_vituscx-9241-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/02174307/vitus_energie_evo_cyclocross_copy_of_vituscx-9241-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/02174307/vitus_energie_evo_cyclocross_copy_of_vituscx-9241-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/02174307/vitus_energie_evo_cyclocross_copy_of_vituscx-9241-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/02174307/vitus_energie_evo_cyclocross_copy_of_vituscx-9241-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/02174307/vitus_energie_evo_cyclocross_copy_of_vituscx-9241-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/02174307/vitus_energie_evo_cyclocross_copy_of_vituscx-9241-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/02174307/vitus_energie_evo_cyclocross_copy_of_vituscx-9241-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/02174307/vitus_energie_evo_cyclocross_copy_of_vituscx-9241.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Vitus</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Designed to be raced off-road</strong></li><li><strong>Edgy handling to tackle obstacles</strong></li><li><strong>Less tyre clearance than most gravel bikes </strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Like gravel bikes, cyclocross bikes are designed for riding off-road. But cyclocross bikes are designed for short, sharp races that typically take place in winter, last around an hour and include obstacles that riders must negotiate either on their bikes or running and carrying them. There’s a popular professional circuit and a large amateur scene in countries including the UK and USA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The nature of cyclocross courses means that cyclocross bikes are designed to be more nimble than gravel bikes. They’re also built to be easier to shoulder and run with, with a large central triangle and usually a flattened top tube to make carrying more comfortable. In UCI-sanctioned cyclocross racing, tyres need to be 33mm or less, so pure ‘cross bikes often have less clearance than gravel bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While cyclocross bikes have some genre-specific features, they can work well as speedy gravel bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Examples of cyclocross bikes that we’ve reviewed at <em>Cyclist</em>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/first-ride-review-canyon-inflite-cf-slx\" target=\"_blank\">Canyon Inflite</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-s-works-crux-review\" target=\"_blank\">Specialized Crux</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Touring bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/03/03061659/trek_520_touring_bike-970x728.jpg\" alt=\"Touring bike\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/03/03061659/trek_520_touring_bike-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/03/03061659/trek_520_touring_bike-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/03/03061659/trek_520_touring_bike-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/03/03061659/trek_520_touring_bike-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/03/03061659/trek_520_touring_bike-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/03/03061659/trek_520_touring_bike-1140x855.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/03/03061659/trek_520_touring_bike.jpg 1920w\" /><figcaption>Trek</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Stable geometry</strong></li><li><strong>Mounts for mudguards and racks</strong></li><li><strong>Often steel or sometimes aluminium or titanium</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Touring bikes are designed for multi-day rides on tarmac. They have mounting points to add a rear and sometimes a front rack, allowing you to use panniers to carry your gear. You can usually fit full mudguards as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ride is stable, with a relaxed, upright position for comfortable riding. Weight tends not to be an issue, so frames are usually made of metal rather than carbon fibre; steel is a favourite but you can also find aluminium and titanium touring bikes. Components are chosen for durability rather than speed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The popularity of gravel bikes and the availability of bikepacking luggage that doesn’t need racks and so saves weight has meant that bikepacking set-ups are increasingly replacing the traditional touring bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Examples of popular <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/best-touring-bikes\">touring bikes</a>: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Genesis Croix de Fer</strong></li><li><strong>Kona Sutra</strong></li><li><strong>Ridgeback Voyage</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Time-trial/triathlon bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"648\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/07/05172308/myles_warwood_new_to_time-trialling_dsc_3909-970x648.jpg\" alt=\"myles_warwood_new_to_time-trialling_dsc_3909\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Aero bars for low ride position</strong></li><li><strong>Aero frame and deep section or disc wheels</strong></li><li><strong>Steep saddle angle</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Time-trial and triathlon bikes are distinguished by their bar extensions, which let you rest your forearms on pads and control the bike from a narrow position to reduce wind resistance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The frame shapes are designed to be aerodynamic and the bikes are typically equipped with very deep section wheels, or even a spokeless disc wheel at the rear. The saddle is positioned well forward over the crankset to help the rider to maintain their aero ride position.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UCI, the organisation that controls bike racing, dictates certain rules about the shape of bikes, which time trial bikes need to conform to. Triathlon bikes are outside those requirements though, so there are more radical designs with very deep tube sections and other features like feed boxes that also improve the bike’s aerodynamics.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Flat bar road bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/05/06142036/3t_exploro_racemax_boost_flatbar_action-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"3t_exploro_racemax_boost_flatbar_action\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Flat bars provide upright ride position</strong></li><li><strong>Most are designed to be rugged</strong></li><li><strong>Some flat bar road bikes available</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Most flat bar bikes fall into the hybrid category.

They’re good for leisure rides and commuting. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some brands also offer flat bar versions of their road or gravel bikes, for riders who prefer a flat bar to a drop bar. You may find this more comfortable than drop bars, although it places you in a more upright ride position that is less aerodynamic and stops you using different hand positions, which can make a longer ride on a flat bar bike less comfortable. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Examples of flat bar road bikes that are available are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Specialized Sirrus – Buy now from <a href=\"https://www.specialized.com/GB/en/shop/bikes/active-bikes/fitness--hybrid-bikes/sirrus/c/sirrus\" target=\"_blank\">Specialized (From £599)</a></strong> </li><li><strong>Giant FastRoad: – Buy now from <a href=\"https://www.tredz.co.uk/.Giant-FastRoad-Advanced-2-2023-Road-Bike_256904.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Tredz (£1,299)</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Which type of road bike is right for me?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/11/041a2314-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Rider cornering on aero road bike with mudguards\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/11/041a2314-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/11/041a2314-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/11/041a2314-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/11/041a2314-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/11/041a2314-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/11/041a2314-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/11/041a2314-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/11/041a2314-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/11/041a2314.jpg 1773w\" /><figcaption>Honor Elliott / Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can see from the above that there’s a lot of choice of types of road and gravel bikes. Some are quite niche, and these bikes are often expensive, so unless you are planning to take on a triathlon, for example, a tri bike is probably not the place to start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think you’ll want to stick to road riding, an endurance road bike is a good first choice. It will give you a more comfortable riding position that will help you to increase your fitness, explore new places and increase the length of your rides.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An all-rounder gravel bike may be a little slower on the road, but can offer more variety, taking you up byways and bridleways and away from traffic. It’s always possible to swap out the tyres for a smoother tread if you do want to ride on the road. A gravel bike is also an excellent commuter bike option and a capable bike for cyclocross racing.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-road-bike-upgrades\">Best road bike upgrades for every budget</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-gravel-bike\">Best of the best gravel bikes 2023: Cyclist’s top-rated gravel and adventure bikes</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-road-bike\">Best road bikes: Best bikes from under £1,000 to over £10,000</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>If you want to try racing or want to be able to ride faster, a race bike may be a better option. It will feel more lively than an endurance road bike or a gravel bike, but you may find the typically edgy handling and low ride position more difficult to get used to. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the UK, there’s a new road bike time trial category, so you can try racing alone against the clock on a race bike without the expense of buying a separate time-trial bike. Many road bikes now have sufficient tyre clearance that you could try your hand at gravel racing on a road race bike as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don’t like the idea of using drop bars, a more sporty flat bar bike is a good alternative for leisure rides.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, if you want a little help on your rides, there are e-bike versions of every category of bike you can think of – head to our sister site <em><a href=\"https://www.cyclingelectric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Cycling Electric</a></em> for more.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/what-type-of-bike-should-i-get\">What type of bike should I buy?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"pnorman","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"057f6f62faad2e9ed14b85294753feb9d24e90c3f974974d60a8def1ff78623d","category":"Cycling"}
