In that time, it has sold over a million e-bikes. Now its latest product range has emerged, featuring several innovative and compact designs. Among them, our favourite is the T1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This outrageously fun and fashionable e-bike is the perfect companion for spring outings. It rolls on small 20-inch wheels and can be folded into a compact package for easy transport and storage. At the same time, its enormous tyres and front suspension mean it’s capable across a broad range of terrain.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/DYU-T1-lifestyle-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/DYU-T1-lifestyle-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/DYU-T1-lifestyle-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/DYU-T1-lifestyle-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/DYU-T1-lifestyle-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/DYU-T1-lifestyle-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/DYU-T1-lifestyle-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/DYU-T1-lifestyle-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/DYU-T1-lifestyle-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/DYU-T1-lifestyle.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>However, despite its outsized capabilities, it remains easy to handle and store while providing equal enjoyment whether you’re riding for leisure or commuting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It manages this thanks to a robust one-piece aluminium frame that’s hinged in the centre, allowing the T1 to be folded in seconds. The frame has no welding points, making for a clean and fashionable design that is beautiful to look at.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/dyu-t1-03.jpg\" alt=\"DYU T1\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/dyu-t1-03.jpg 1800w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/dyu-t1-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/dyu-t1-03-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/dyu-t1-03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/dyu-t1-03-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/dyu-t1-03-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/dyu-t1-03-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/dyu-t1-03-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/dyu-t1-03-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/dyu-t1-03-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Further towards the bike’s front is a sizeable frame-integrated battery that can be locked in place for safekeeping. This is combined with a powerful 250W rear hub motor to generate a range of 26 miles per charge in throttle mode and 34 miles in pedal assist mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A perfect fit for your lifestyle</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The DYU T1 is ready to fit seamlessly into the busiest lives. Whether you’re swinging a leg over to head to the shops or using it in place of public transport to meet up with friends, its easy-stepover frame configuration always inspires confidence. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/DYU-T1-lifestyle-2-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/DYU-T1-lifestyle-2-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/DYU-T1-lifestyle-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/DYU-T1-lifestyle-2-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/DYU-T1-lifestyle-2-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/DYU-T1-lifestyle-2-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/DYU-T1-lifestyle-2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/DYU-T1-lifestyle-2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/DYU-T1-lifestyle-2-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/DYU-T1-lifestyle-2.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>This is as true if you’re hopping on and off the bike at the beginning and end of your journey or starting and stopping as you filter through traffic. With plenty of support from the motor and reactive handling, it’s an assured ride in all situations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The T1’s upright riding position is comfortable and can fit a vast range of users, so you’ll always be perfectly positioned. To achieve this, the T1 employs an adjustable height stem and saddle that can be quickly reconfigured, allowing multiple riders to share a single bike. Combined with the hinge located in the centre of the frame, these also allow the T1 to be folded in seconds.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1800\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/dyu-t1-04.jpg\" alt=\"DYU T1\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/dyu-t1-04.jpg 1200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/dyu-t1-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/dyu-t1-04-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/dyu-t1-04-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/dyu-t1-04-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/dyu-t1-04-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/dyu-t1-04-1140x1710.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The resulting folded package measures just 90 x 50 x 80cm. This means the T1 is small enough to stash at home, and easy to take aboard public transport or bring inside when it might otherwise have been left locked on the street. As a result, the DYU T1 is a bike that can always travel with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Support when you need it</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On the road the T1 benefits from an intelligent torque sensor that accurately measures speed, pedal torque and cadence, and changes the output of the motor accordingly, allowing you to find your own pace and delivering a more responsive and intuitive riding experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lighting your way is a hardwired front lamp that provides forward illumination and is conveniently powered by the main battery. An integrated rear rack is built into the frame itself to help you make the most of the bike’s sizeable 150kg load limit.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/dyu-t1-05.jpg\" alt=\"DYU T1\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/dyu-t1-05.jpg 2000w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/dyu-t1-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/dyu-t1-05-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/dyu-t1-05-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/dyu-t1-05-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/dyu-t1-05-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/dyu-t1-05-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/dyu-t1-05-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/dyu-t1-05-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/dyu-t1-05-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Defining the T1’s versatile character are enormously wide tyres. These allow it to float comfortably above a range of surfaces from tarmac to gravel while providing stability and grip. A rugged suspension fork boosts this ability further by adding even more cushioning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 7-speed Shimano drivetrain helps the rider contribute as much effort as they wish, while reliable mechanical disc brakes take care of stopping.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you progress on your journey, each of your key stats is displayed on the bike’s central multi-function LED display. Here you can find information on current speed, charge remaining, power assistance level selected, and distance achieved.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"1500\" height=\"2250\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/dyu-t1-06.jpg\" alt=\"DYU T1\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/dyu-t1-06.jpg 1500w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/dyu-t1-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/dyu-t1-06-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/dyu-t1-06-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/dyu-t1-06-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/dyu-t1-06-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/dyu-t1-06-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/02/dyu-t1-06-1140x1710.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>Buy with confidence</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Like all of DYU’s bikes, the creation of the T1 springs from a desire for cleaner cities and a greener planet.
