On one hand, some groups hate taxes and are indifferent to climate change—in Canada, various provincial governments actively fought (and <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/supreme-court-federal-carbon-tax-constitutional-case-1.5962687#:~:text=In%20a%206%2D3%20decision,to%20curb%20greenhouse%20gas%20emissions.\">ultimately lost</a>) against the federal government’s implementation of a carbon levy.

Noah Scovronick, a researcher at the Gangarosa Department of Environmental Health at Emory University and one of the paper’s authors, said that it’s possible to help reduce emissions while also implementing a carbon tax that redistributes wealth to people on the lower side of the socioeconomic spectrum.</p>\n<p>And that's good news, as carbon taxes are already in use. According to the <a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/pricing-carbon\">World Bank</a>, in 2020, around 40 countries and 20 cities, states, or provinces already have some kind of carbon-pricing mechanism. The United States has, <a href=\"https://www.sanders.senate.gov/press-releases/sanders-boxer-propose-climate-change-bills-2/\">occasionally</a>, mulled over the idea of implementing one itself. “[It] does have a history in terms of being endorsed by a number of politicians and/or economists as a sort of—I don’t want to say straightforward—but one of the potentially more straightforward ways you could approach emissions reductions,” Scovronick told Ars.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1818028#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1818028&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Doug Johnson","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"81a48842bf64dff111a366e0b077ee178aa88ed4d88672404cd342fdcc3db32c","category":"Tech"}
