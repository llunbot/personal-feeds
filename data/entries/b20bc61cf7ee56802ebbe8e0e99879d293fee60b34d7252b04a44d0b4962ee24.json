Then there's the Mario series, where <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/7298/super-mario-bros/credits/nes/?autoplatform=true\">every person credited with the creation of the original <em>Super Mario Bros.</em></a> in the 1980s ended up having <a href=\"https://www.gamesradar.com/5-people-made-the-original-super-mario-bros-all-of-them-were-still-at-nintendo-to-ship-wonder-38-years-later/\">a role in the making of <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em></a> just last year.</p>\n<p>In a recent interview with Ars Technica, <em>Wonder</em> producer Takashi Tezuka said it wasn't that tough to get that kind of creative continuity at Nintendo. \"The secret to having a long-tenured staff is that people don't quit,\" he said. \"For folks who have been there together for such a long time, it's easy for us to talk to each other.\"</p>\n\n<p>That said, Tezuka added that just getting a bunch of industry veterans together to make a game runs the risk of not \"keeping up with the times. Really, for me, I have a great interest in how our newer staff members play, what they play, what they think, and what is appealing to them. I think it's very interesting the things we can come up with when these two disparate groups influence each other to create something.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017848#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017848&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b20bc61cf7ee56802ebbe8e0e99879d293fee60b34d7252b04a44d0b4962ee24","category":"Tech"}
