Louisiana has reached \"very high\" ILI activity, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm\">the latest flu surveillance update</a>. The percentage of flu tests coming back positive is also increasing nationwide, with only one region, the Mid-Atlantic region, showing a stable week-over-week positivity rate. But the CDC noted that its rate overall is trending upward.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/flu-map.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/flu-map-640x332.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/flu-map-1280x663.jpg 2x\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/flu-map.jpg\"></a> </p></div>\n<p>This year's flu season is again starting early; the current flu activity levels are about four to six weeks ahead of when we usually see them. And with activity already at highs in many states, there's a good chance that we'll once again see extremely high levels in some placesâ€”moving from red to the dreaded deep purple on CDC's scale, which we saw last year.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1985873#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1985873&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e9649cbdef85c6bf0c99ef07483226cf11e650622f75c4c7a6b391bbcca80052","category":"Tech"}
