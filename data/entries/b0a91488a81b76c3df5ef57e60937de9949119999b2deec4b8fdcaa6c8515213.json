Each member will get a $2000 stipend to help cover costs to get them to the races. Then, on top of that will be a whole bunch of free Old Man Mountain gear, prototypes to test, a full suite of Silca goodies to make your bike faster, more free gear &amp; industry deals, plus help figuring out a training plan for your individual racing goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Loam &amp; Gravel Society – Experimental Bikepacking Team</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Loam-and-Gravel-Society-Experimental-Bikepacking-Team-supported-by-Old-Man-Mountain-and-Silca_OTT-July-2021-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Loam-and-Gravel-Society-Experimental-Bikepacking-Team-supported-by-Old-Man-Mountain-and-Silca_OTT-July-2021-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Loam &amp; Gravel Society Experimental Bikepacking Team, founded and supported by Old Man Mountain &amp; Silca, OTT\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Loam-and-Gravel-Society-Experimental-Bikepacking-Team-supported-by-Old-Man-Mountain-and-Silca_OTT-July-2021-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Loam-and-Gravel-Society-Experimental-Bikepacking-Team-supported-by-Old-Man-Mountain-and-Silca_OTT-July-2021-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Loam-and-Gravel-Society-Experimental-Bikepacking-Team-supported-by-Old-Man-Mountain-and-Silca_OTT-July-2021-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Loam-and-Gravel-Society-Experimental-Bikepacking-Team-supported-by-Old-Man-Mountain-and-Silca_OTT-July-2021-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Loam-and-Gravel-Society-Experimental-Bikepacking-Team-supported-by-Old-Man-Mountain-and-Silca_OTT-July-2021-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Old Man Mountain)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Call it a mix between the birth of a factory bikepacking race team and a call out for ultra-distance influencers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any way you look at it, OMM (<em>they abbreviate their own name like that, and I’ve already grown tired of typing Old Man Mountain</em>) was looking for a way they could support some of the cyclists on the bikepacking &amp; ultra racing scene. And at the same time grow their visibility amongst more competitive bike riders, while testing and refining their next crop of products still in development.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Loam-and-Gravel-Society-Experimental-Bikepacking-Team-supported-by-Old-Man-Mountain-and-Silca_Elkhorn-gravel-bikes-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Loam-and-Gravel-Society-Experimental-Bikepacking-Team-supported-by-Old-Man-Mountain-and-Silca_Elkhorn-gravel-bikes-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Loam &amp; Gravel Society Experimental Bikepacking Team, founded and supported by Old Man Mountain &amp; Silca, loaded gravel bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Loam-and-Gravel-Society-Experimental-Bikepacking-Team-supported-by-Old-Man-Mountain-and-Silca_Elkhorn-gravel-bikes-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Loam-and-Gravel-Society-Experimental-Bikepacking-Team-supported-by-Old-Man-Mountain-and-Silca_Elkhorn-gravel-bikes-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Loam-and-Gravel-Society-Experimental-Bikepacking-Team-supported-by-Old-Man-Mountain-and-Silca_Elkhorn-gravel-bikes-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Loam-and-Gravel-Society-Experimental-Bikepacking-Team-supported-by-Old-Man-Mountain-and-Silca_Elkhorn-gravel-bikes-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>My personal take on it is then. It seems like OMM are strongly hinting that they are also working on more race-oriented gear-hauling products. The majority of the current offerings (and their existing crop of brand <a href=\"https://oldmanmountain.com/omm-ambassadors/\" target=\"_blank\">ambassadors</a>) lean more toward the heavy-duty, utilitarian way of carrying gear on your bikes, or classic loaded touring just off-road; <em>think</em>: burly <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/old-man-mountain-new-pizza-rack-3-pack-mounts/\" target=\"_blank\">racks</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/old-man-mountain-basket-pannier-trunk-axle-pack-for-suspension-forks/\" target=\"_blank\">baskets</a>. But OMM also already created some interesting things like their <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/first-look-old-man-mountain-axle-pack-puts-bikepacking-anything-cages-on-any-fork/\" target=\"_blank\">Axle Packs</a>. Those provide a great way to mount gear on bikes not normally well-suited for bikepacking – like lightweight race bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wouldn’t be surprised to see more of that show up on bikes of the new Loam &amp; Gravel Society experimental bikepacking team.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Old-Man-Mountain-Axle-Pack-bolt-on-fork-anything-cage-accessory-mount-adapter-review_front-view-fish-eye.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Old-Man-Mountain-Axle-Pack-bolt-on-fork-anything-cage-accessory-mount-adapter-review_front-view-fish-eye.jpg\" alt=\"First Impressions Review: Old Man Mountain Axle Pack bolt-on fork anything cage accessory mount adapter\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Old-Man-Mountain-Axle-Pack-bolt-on-fork-anything-cage-accessory-mount-adapter-review_front-view-fish-eye.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Old-Man-Mountain-Axle-Pack-bolt-on-fork-anything-cage-accessory-mount-adapter-review_front-view-fish-eye-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Old-Man-Mountain-Axle-Pack-bolt-on-fork-anything-cage-accessory-mount-adapter-review_front-view-fish-eye-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Old-Man-Mountain-Axle-Pack-bolt-on-fork-anything-cage-accessory-mount-adapter-review_front-view-fish-eye-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Old-Man-Mountain-Axle-Pack-bolt-on-fork-anything-cage-accessory-mount-adapter-review_front-view-fish-eye-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Old-Man-Mountain-Axle-Pack-bolt-on-fork-anything-cage-accessory-mount-adapter-review_front-view-fish-eye-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Old-Man-Mountain-Axle-Pack-bolt-on-fork-anything-cage-accessory-mount-adapter-review_front-view-fish-eye-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“We commit to nurturing a lively and inclusive cycling community by focusing on shared experiences and collective joy.
