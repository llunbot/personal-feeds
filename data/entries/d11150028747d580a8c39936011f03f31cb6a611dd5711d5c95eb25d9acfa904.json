Tires are one of them, particularly as we grapple with overweight EVs with tire-shredding torque. And brakes are another—even an EV with regenerative braking will occasionally need to use its friction brakes, after all.</p>\n<p>Over in Europe, the people responsible for writing regulations have taken this into consideration with the <a href=\"https://www.sae.org/news/2023/05/brakes-sustainability-dust-regulations\">upcoming Euro 7 standard</a>, which sets new limits on 10- and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/14/brake-pad-dust-toxic-exhaust-emissions\">2.5-micron particulate emissions</a> on all new vehicles—including EVs—starting next year. And to help OEMs achieve that target, Brembo has developed a new brake and pad set called Greentell that it says cuts brake dust emissions by 90 percent, improving durability in the process.</p>\n<p>\"We started 10 years ago to investigate a different solution. The main topic that we had in mind was to develop a disk that is greener than the current production of cast iron,\" said Fabiano Carminati, VP of disc technical development at Brembo.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/brembos-new-brakes-cut-particulate-emissions-by-90-percent/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/brembos-new-brakes-cut-particulate-emissions-by-90-percent/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
