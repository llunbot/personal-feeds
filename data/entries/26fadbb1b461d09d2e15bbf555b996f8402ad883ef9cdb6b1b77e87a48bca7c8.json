Cook is required by Apple to use private aircraft for both business and personal travel.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple set a target compensation of $59 million for Cook, but Cook earned more through the cash incentive payout that executives receive when Apple performs well.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThough Cook's 2024 compensation exceeded what he earned in 2023, it was still down from the $99 million that he was awarded in 2022. Cook and the Board of Directors opted to decrease Cook's total compensation after his 2022 earnings reached almost $100 million.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOther Apple executives, including Luca Maestri, Kate Adams, Deirdre O'Brien, and Jeff Williams, earned $27.2 million.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/10/tim-cook-2024-salary/\">Apple CEO Tim Cook Earned $74.6 Million in 2024</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-ceo-tim-cook-earned-74-6-million-in-2024.2447167/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"26fadbb1b461d09d2e15bbf555b996f8402ad883ef9cdb6b1b77e87a48bca7c8","category":"Apple"}
