We have spent countless hours riding it, fine-tuning it and thinking about how to make it better, to be worth of sitting next to the MAGMA in our bike catalog.</p>\n<cite>– Alberto Contador</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3>Race-ready Gravel Geometry</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Aurum-Manto-race-ready-carbon-gravel-bike_geometry.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"370\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Aurum-Manto-race-ready-carbon-gravel-bike_geometry-800x370.jpg\" alt=\"Aurum Manto race-ready carbon gravel bike, geometry\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Aurum-Manto-race-ready-carbon-gravel-bike_geometry-800x370.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Aurum-Manto-race-ready-carbon-gravel-bike_geometry-297x137.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Aurum-Manto-race-ready-carbon-gravel-bike_geometry-120x56.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Aurum-Manto-race-ready-carbon-gravel-bike_geometry-768x355.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Aurum-Manto-race-ready-carbon-gravel-bike_geometry-1536x710.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Aurum-Manto-race-ready-carbon-gravel-bike_geometry.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The gravel race bike comes in five sizes with quick geometry that is gently tweaked for the two smaller sizes to prevent toe overlap even with big tires.

extreme.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Aurum-Manto-race-ready-carbon-gravel-bike_downhill.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\"
