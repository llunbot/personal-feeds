{"title":"The New York Times, Finally: ‘Trump’s Rambling Speeches Reinforce Question of Age’","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/06/us/politics/trump-speeches-age-cognitive-decline.html","date":1728433358000,"content":"\n<p>Peter Baker and Dylan Freedman, reporting for The New York Times, with the conspicuous absence of Maggie Haberman from that shared byline:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Former President Donald J. Trump vividly recounted how the\naudience at his climactic debate with Vice President Kamala Harris\nwas on his side. Except that there was no audience. The debate was\nheld in an empty hall. No one <a href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/tv/trump-speaks-of-nonexistent-debate-audience-says-they-went-crazy/\">“went crazy,”</a> as Mr. Trump\nput it, because no one was there.</p>\n\n<p>Anyone can misremember, of course. But the debate had been just a\nweek earlier and a fairly memorable moment. And it was hardly the\nonly time Mr. Trump has seemed confused, forgetful, incoherent or\ndisconnected from reality lately. In fact, it happens so often\nthese days that it no longer even generates much attention.</p>\n\n<p>He rambles, he repeats himself, he roams from thought to thought — some of them hard to understand, some of them unfinished, some\nof them factually fantastical. He voices outlandish claims that\nseem to be <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/09/21/us/politics/trump-harris-2024-election-speech.html\">made up out of whole cloth</a>. He digresses into\nbizarre tangents about golf, about sharks, about his own\n<a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?538664-1/president-trump-campaigns-prairie-du-chien-wisconsin\">“beautiful”</a> body. He relishes <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113196240601584865\">“a great day in\nLouisiana”</a> after spending the day in Georgia. He expresses\nfear that North Korea is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/01/us/politics/trump-speech-wisconsin.html\">“trying to kill me”</a> when he\npresumably means Iran. As late as last month, Mr. Trump was still\nspeaking as if he were running against President Biden, five weeks\nafter his withdrawal from the race.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Better late than never, but if it were Joe Biden who had rambled on about “the audience going crazy” at a debate that had no audience, the New York Times would have been all over it the next day, not a month later.</p>\n\n<p>I don’t think Donald Trump was ever hooked up right. But he’s clearly losing the few  marbles he ever had to dementia, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/03/20/donald-trump-dementia-father-fred-alzheimers-biden/\">just like his father did</a>. The signs were clear during his 2017–2021 term in office:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>John F. Kelly, his second White House chief of staff, was so\nconvinced that Mr. Trump was psychologically unbalanced that he\nbought a book called “The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump,” written\nby 27 mental health professionals, to try to understand his boss\nbetter. As it was, Mr. Kelly came to refer to Mr. Trump’s White\nHouse as “Crazytown.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Of course the Times had to both-sides this story, and this is who they found to do it:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Sam Nunberg, a former Trump political adviser, said he still\ntalked with people who see him almost daily, and had not heard of\nany concerns expressed about the former president’s age. “I don’t\nreally see any major difference,” he said. “I just don’t see it.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Nunberg is the guy <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2018/03/05/former-trump-aide-sam-nunberg-possibly-drunk-says-he-wont-cooperate-with-mueller-subpoena/\">who showed up shitfaced drunk</a> on half a dozen cables news appearances at the height of the Robert Mueller investigation. That’s the guy saying, sure Trump is OK in the head today.</p>\n\n<p>If you haven’t watched Trump speak in a while — because you’re on team “fuck that guy”, like any sane voter — you should watch the video clips the Times culled for this piece. Like I said, I don’t think the guy was <em>ever</em> hooked up right, but it’s very clear he’s in serious decline today.</p>\n\n<p>My suggestion to the Harris campaign is that they should repeatedly describe Trump as “an 80-year-old”, and force Trump surrogates to correct them that he’s “only” 78.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/08/nyt-trump-dementia\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"501ce6f039c66e62461b6caee47b28693d125aa671ef387f79edbabed37eac1d","category":"Tech"}
