Specifically, employees are concerned that governments could force Apple to use the technology for censorship by finding content other than CSAM. Some employees are worried that Apple is damaging its industry-leading privacy reputation. \r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>Apple employees have flooded an Apple internal Slack channel with more than 800 messages on the plan announced a week ago, workers who asked not to be identified told Reuters. Many expressed worries that the feature could be exploited by repressive governments looking to find other material for censorship or arrests, according to workers who saw the days-long thread.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nPast security changes at Apple have also prompted concern among employees, but the volume and duration of the new debate is surprising, the workers said. Some posters worried that Apple is damaging its leading reputation for protecting privacy.</blockquote>Apple employees in roles pertaining to user security are not thought to have been part of the internal protest, according to the report. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nEver since its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/05/apple-new-child-safety-features/\">announcement last week</a>, Apple has been bombarded with criticism over its CSAM detection plans, which are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/10/apple-committed-to-child-safety-features/\">still expected to roll out with iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 this fall</a>. Concerns mainly revolve around how the technology could present a slippery slope for future implementations by oppressive governments and regimes.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has firmly pushed back against the idea that the on-device technology used for detecting CSAM material could be used for any other purpose. In a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/09/apple-faq-csam-detection-messages-scanning/\">published FAQ document</a>, the company says it will vehemently refuse any such demand by governments. \r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote><strong>Could governments force Apple to add non-CSAM images to the hash list?</strong>\r\n<br />\r\nApple will refuse any such demands. Apple's CSAM detection capability is built solely to detect known CSAM images stored in iCloud Photos that have been identified by experts at NCMEC and other child safety groups. We have faced demands to build and deploy government-mandated changes that degrade the privacy of users before, and have steadfastly refused those demands. We will continue to refuse them in the future. Let us be clear, this technology is limited to detecting CSAM stored in iCloud and we will not accede to any government's request to expand it. Furthermore, Apple conducts human review before making a report to NCMEC. In a case where the system flags photos that do not match known CSAM images, the account would not be disabled and no report would be filed to NCMEC.</blockquote>An <a href=\"https://appleprivacyletter.com\">open letter</a> criticizing Apple and calling upon the company to immediately halt it's plan to deploy CSAM detection has gained more than 7,000 signatures at the time of writing. The head of WhatsApp has also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wcathcart/status/1423701473624395784\">weighed into the debate</a>. <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-privacy/\">Apple privacy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-child-safety-features/\">Apple child safety features</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/13/apple-employees-concerns-over-csam/\">Apple Employees Internally Raising Concerns Over CSAM Detection Plans</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-employees-internally-raising-concerns-over-csam-detection-plans.2307422/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=_cZnXr00v_g:BsqooylRvu8:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=_cZnXr00v_g:BsqooylRvu8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/_cZnXr00v_g\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d3bbca1fe53607c617cfc06e4338faed03c0ba9dc452fe839e3115421a946a67","category":"Apple"}
