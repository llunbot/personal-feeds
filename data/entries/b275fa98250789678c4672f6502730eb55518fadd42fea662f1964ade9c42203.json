In fact, Meta would probably prefer that everyone forget about <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/10/meta-quest-pro-review-for-those-with-more-money-than-sense/\">last year's ill-considered Quest Pro</a>, which paired a handful of minor improvements with an absolutely massive $1,500 starting price. Even <a href=\"https://howl.me/ckMFXh4IYmt\" target=\"_blank\">a quick price drop to $1,000</a> couldn't save this over-engineered stopgap gadget.</p>\n<p>What a difference a year makesâ€”or three years, for VR aficionados who wisely stuck with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/09/review-we-do-not-recommend-the-299-oculus-quest-2-as-your-next-vr-system/\">2020's Quest 2</a> until now. The Quest 3 offers distinct improvements over previous Quest headsets in the areas that matter most (resolution, form factor, etc.) without many of the Pro's more expensive, heavy, and least necessary indulgences (eye-tracking cameras, rechargeable controllers, charging dock, etc.). The Quest 3 also offers a usable (but rough) suite of new mixed-reality features, providing an intriguing glimpse of a world where VR content is routinely layered over our view of reality.</p>\n<p>Most importantly, the <a href=\"https://howl.me/ckMFWxXICzj\" target=\"_blank\">Quest 3</a> does this all at a mass-market price (starting at $500) and in a way that ensures continuity with Quest's existing software. While there's nothing here that will usher in the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/03/people-will-fall-for-it-like-a-drug-game-devs-on-the-future-of-vr/\">long-sought</a> virtual reality <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/10/what-happened-to-the-virtual-reality-gaming-revolution/\">revolution</a>, this is the kind of incremental improvement the space needs if it's going to continue to increase <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/09/meta-quest-struggles-to-outpace-the-wii-us-flaccid-software-sales/\">the size of its niche</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1975955#p3\">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1975955&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b275fa98250789678c4672f6502730eb55518fadd42fea662f1964ade9c42203","category":"Tech"}
