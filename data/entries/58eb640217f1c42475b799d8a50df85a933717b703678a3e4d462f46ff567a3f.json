Dylandkt clarified to <em>MacRumors</em> that this relates to the entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro model with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> chip, which starts at $1,299. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nDylandkt also told <em>MacRumors</em> that the 14-inch MacBook Pro will be priced around the current high-end 13-inch model, which it is expected to replace in the lineup, but will be priced much more closely to the 16-inch model due to their similar feature sets and performance.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe current high-end 13-inch MacBook Pro, which still features Intel chips, starts at $1,799. A base configuration with 1TB of storage is also available for $1,999. The current 16-inch MacBook Pro, which is not expected to see a price rise, starts from $2,399. This means that the 14-inch MacBook Pro could be priced in the region of $2,000.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nDylandkt has correctly predicted details about a number of Apple's product launches. As early as November 2020, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dylandkt/status/1326956166790909954?s=20\">Dylandkt claimed</a> that the next-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> would feature an ‌‌M1‌‌ chip. This was five months before the device emerged. Before the launch of the 24-inch ‌<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>‌ earlier this year, Dylandkt <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dylandkt/status/1383453651285381122?s=20\">correctly predicted</a> that the new, redesigned ‌‌iMac‌‌ would replace the smaller entry-level ‌‌iMac‌‌ only and feature an ‌‌M1‌‌ chip rather than an M1X.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe new MacBook Pro models are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/16/when-can-we-expect-the-redesigned-macbook-pros/\">expected to debut around October</a>, offering <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/04/macbook-pro-copy-iphone-design/\">new designs</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/25/14-16-macbook-pro-mini-led-display/\">brighter panels</a> with higher contrast, an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/11/macbook-pro-14-and-16-upgraded-webcam/\">improved webcam</a>, function keys with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/apple-removing-touch-bar-rumor/\">no Touch Bar</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/2021-macbook-pro-more-ports-rumor/\">more ports</a>, and a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/16/magsafe-returning-macbook-pro/\">MagSafe connector for charging</a>.
