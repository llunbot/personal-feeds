But when Amazon's <em>Fallout </em>series showed up on Prime and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/04/three-episodes-in-the-fallout-tv-series-absolutely-nails-it/\">absolutely nailed it</a>, it spurred a lot of players to crack open their libraries and commence some post-apocalyptic replaying. And maybe first-time playing, too.</p>\n<p><em>Fallout 76</em>, the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/04/fallout-76s-wastelanders-expansion-makes-west-virginia-feel-like-home/\">online multiplayer title</a> that is the most recent full release, saw perhaps the biggest delta. The game hit its all-time peak of 43,887 simultaneous players on Wednesday, April 17, <a href=\"https://steamcharts.com/app/1151340\">according to SteamCharts</a>, roughly one week after the Amazon series' debut. For the year leading up to that peak, <em>Fallout 76</em> had hovered around 7,000-10,000 players through most of 2024, and then jumped after the series' debut. Of course, that number only counts PC players, and only those on Steam; the game, which launched simultaneously on consoles, and is <a href=\"https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/fallout-76\">available on Microsoft's Game Pass</a>, likely has many more players.</p>\n<p>SteamDB, another Steam stats tracker, suggested on X (formerly Twitter) that the <em>Fallout</em> game series as a whole had <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SteamDB/status/1779459741984379079\">more than doubled its concurrent player count by April 14</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018228#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018228&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"00e26773efa87f0bd6469d7cd90915459685a59e88d7800092b162b9e1a2b62c","category":"Tech"}
