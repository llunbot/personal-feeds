Other investors\ninclude Sutter Hill Ventures, Thrive Capital, Maverick Ventures\nand SV Angel. Altman doesn’t have equity in io, OpenAI said. [...]</p>\n\n<p>When he left Apple six years ago, Ive started the firm LoveFrom, a\ncollective of designers and engineers. The staff includes veterans\nof Apple’s hardware and software departments, as well as friends\nof Ive and other collaborators.</p>\n\n<p>He then co-founded io last year with Apple alumni Scott Cannon,\nEvans Hankey and Tang Tan. Hankey was Ive’s successor at Apple and\nremained at the company until 2023, while Tan led iPhone and Apple\nWatch product design until 2024. Cannon worked at Apple before\nco-creating the once-popular email app Mailbox, which was acquired\nby Dropbox Inc. [...]</p>\n\n<p>LoveFrom has a number of former Apple designers who helped create\nthe look of the Mac and iPhone operating systems, including Bas\nOrding, Mike Matas and Chris Wilson, Ive said. They could help\nredesign OpenAI’s app for a new generation of consumers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I struggle to imagine what they even <em>could</em> be making, but that’s one hell of a lineup of talented ex-Apple folks. I know a few other people who’ve joined IO too, and they’re A-teamers.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/22/gurman-io-team\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b8172f76fa1a292409da8e4449634513a0687279db7c6c269a4c177ab023dc36","category":"Tech"}
