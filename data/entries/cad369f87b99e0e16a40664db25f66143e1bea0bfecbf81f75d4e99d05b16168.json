There is a little too much darkness in this world and not enough light, a little too much pseudoscience and not enough science. We'll let other publications offer you a daily horoscope. At Ars Technica, we're going to take a different route, finding inspiration from very real images of a universe that is filled with stars and wonder.</em></p>\n    \n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Good morning. It's January 9, and today's image showcases the Milky Way Galaxy rising above the visitor's center on Mauna Kea on the Big Island of Hawaii.</p>\n<p>The Big Island is one of my favorite places on Earth. It has some of the world's best beaches, some of its most active volcanoes, wonderful people, and a world-class observatory on the great mountain, which climbs about 13,800 feet above sea level. Astronomers say the atmosphere up there, so remote from major landmasses, has some of the best \"seeing\" quality in the world.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1994526#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1994526&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cad369f87b99e0e16a40664db25f66143e1bea0bfecbf81f75d4e99d05b16168","category":"Tech"}
