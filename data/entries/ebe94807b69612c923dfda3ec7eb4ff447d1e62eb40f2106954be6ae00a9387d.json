Here’s all we know so far about potential release dates, new features and which models will be able to run the software. It’s everything you need to know about iPadOS 17.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPadOS 17 release date: When will iPadOS 17 come out?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s no official date from Apple as yet, but it does have a pretty reliable history of releasing software versions around the same time each year, as you can see from the dates below.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>iPadOS 16:</strong> October 24, 2022</li><li><strong>iPadOS 15:</strong> September 20, 2021</li><li><strong>iPadOS 14:</strong> September 16, 2020</li><li><strong>iPadOS 13:</strong> September 24, 2019</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>With the exception of the last version, which was thought to be delayed to add polish to some features, Apple always introduces a new iteration of iPadOS in the second half of September. We think it’s likely that iPadOS 17 will launch at the same time as <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1519552/ios-17-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 17</a>, as we aren’t expecting any major changes that might delay its launch, so a September launch is most likely. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the run-up to the full release, Apple will also make available beta versions of the OS to those on the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/674359/how-to-join-apples-beta-program-and-try-out-new-software.html\">Apple Beta Software program</a>. This includes several iterations, and we expect it to look something like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>June 5, 2023: </strong>iPadOS 17 is announced at <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678333/wwdc-ios-macos-watchos-hardware-keynote.html\">WWDC</a>, and the first developer beta is released.</li><li><strong>July 2023:</strong> Apple releases the first public beta of iPadOS 17.</li><li><strong>June to September 2023:</strong> A series of additional developer and public betas appear.</li><li><strong>September/October 2023:</strong> The final public version of iPadOS 17 is released.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To see the history of every release so far, you can read our guide to all the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1659017/ios-versions-list.html\">iOS and iPadOS versions.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPadOS 17 compatibility: Which iPads will run iPadOS 17?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple usually does an excellent job of keeping older iPads up to date in terms of the software versions they run. When iPadOS 16 arrived, only a couple of older iPads that were running iPadOS 15 couldn’t make the transition. We don’t know yet whether this will be the case in 2023, but it could be the last gasp for <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1796152/ipados-17-compatibility-ipad-pro.html\">a few devices</a> that are now pretty long in the tooth, according to a source from French site iPhoneSoft in April 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The prime suspects for the cull are the 2016 iPad Pro 9.7-inch and 2015 iPad Pro 12.9-inch (1st generation) whose A9X processors are getting on a bit now. There’s also the 2017 iPad (5th generation) which runs on an even slower A9 processor. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just above those are the iPad Pro 10.5-inch, which sports an A10X, as does the iPad Pro 12.9-inch (2nd generation), and the iPad (6th generation) with its A10, but we hope they might slip through to iPadOS 17 this time around. It may well be that these older iPads get the new version of iPadOS, but not all the features. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That would leave the following on the compatibility list for iPadOS 17:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>iPad Pro 12.9 (5th gen)</li><li>iPad Pro 11 (3rd gen)</li><li>iPad Pro 12.9 (4th gen)</li><li>iPad Pro 11 (2nd gen)</li><li>iPad Pro 12.9 (3rd gen)</li><li>iPad Pro 11 (1st gen)</li><li>iPad Pro 12.9 (2nd gen)</li><li>iPad Pro 10.5</li><li>iPad (9th gen)</li><li>iPad (8th gen)</li><li>iPad (7th gen)</li><li>iPad (6th gen)</li><li>iPad mini (6th gen)</li><li>iPad mini (5th gen)</li><li>iPad Air (4th gen)</li><li>iPad Air (3rd gen)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPadOS 17 features: What new features will we see in iPadOS 17?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s been a definite lack of substantial rumors when it comes to iPadOS 17. This could suggest that Apple intends to make it a performance-boosting iteration rather than rolling out too many new features or that most of the new features will also be available for iOS. However, there are a few things that we do expect to find when we launch the new software on our iPads for the first time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Third-party app stores</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The EU has been getting up in Apple’s grill for a little while now. We’ve all heard about the iPhone’s switch from Lighting ports to USB-C that seems imminent, after the political bloc created laws to make it obligatory to use the standard in its region. We’ve even seen leaked photos that purport to show an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1516245/iphone-15-leak-usb-c-lightning-port.html\">iPhone 15 bearing a USB-C port</a> for the first time. But there’s also another set of laws in place, called the Digital Markets Act, which impels Apple to open up its devices to third-party app stores.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-13/will-apple-allow-users-to-install-third-party-app-stores-sideload-in-europe?leadSource=uverify%20wall&amp;xcust=1-1-1794980-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman</a> has reported on the story, saying it’s likely we’ll see Apple introducing third-party app stores and the ability to sideload apps in iPadOS 17. These capabilities have been available on Android for years, but it would be a huge change to the “walled garden” approach Apple has adopted since the introduction of the first iPhone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether Apple users will want to take advantage of these new marketplaces remains doubtful, but at least they will now have the choice. At least they will in some countries—it’s likely that sideloading will <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1794764/sorry-u-s-iphone-users-sideloading-in-ios-17-will-likely-be-limited-to-europe.html\">only be available for iPhone users in Europe</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>macOS for iPad</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s always said it won’t happen, but Majin Bu (back in October 2022) tweeted that <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1359226/macos-14-m2-ipad-pro-rumor.html\">macOS 14 could be destined for the M2 iPad Pro</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Majin Bu doesn’t have a great track record though, and there is little evidence that Apple is working to merge the iPad and Mac lines, so it may never happen. But with <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1814473/final-cut-logic-pro-ipad-subscription-launch.html\">Final Cut and Logic Pro now available on the iPad Pro</a> we should never say never.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>According with my source Apple would be testing a smaller version of macOS exclusively for the new iPad Pro M2!<br />\"Mendocino\" should be the codename for macOS 14. A simplified version should be planned for the M2. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://t.co/f4RrainlZ1&amp;xcust=1-1-1794980-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">pic.twitter.com/f4RrainlZ1</a></p>— Majin Bu (@MajinBuOfficial) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1583065617950613504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-1794980-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">October 20, 2022</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Custom Lock Screens</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/631448/ios-16-features-compatibility-how-to-update.html\">iOS 16</a> dropped, it came with a revamped Lock Screen on which you could use widgets, dynamic images, and new fonts and colors to make the device feel far more customizable than ever. Sadly, the same capabilities didn’t make their way into <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/631448/ios-16-features-compatibility-how-to-update.html\">iPadOS 16</a>, but rumors report that the new Lock Screen customization is <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1790478/ipados-17-iphone-lock-screen-always-on-oled-display.html\">coming to tablets</a> in iPadOS 17.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a rundown of what this feature can do on iPhone, take a look at our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/786981/how-to-customize-lock-screen-ios-16.html\">guide to customizing your Lock Screen in iOS 16</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Third-party browsers free from WebKit</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another potential spillover from the EU’s Digital Markets Act is allowing third-party browsers such as Chrome and Firefox to use their own engines, rather than the Apple WebKit variant that the company currently demands. This would see the other browsers behave more like their web-based versions, instantly beefing up their capabilities. We’d like to see this as it would also provoke Apple to up its game with Safari.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>New Control Center</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve seen a few rumors that iOS 17 could come with an updated version of Control Center. As is often the case, this suggests we could see a similar venture on iPadOS 17. There are no solid details on what the revamp would do, but we’d be very happy to see this underdeveloped part of the system be given some love.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s all we’ve found so far, but obviously, we’ll keep updating this article as new information comes to light, so be sure to check back.

It’s time for Apple to allow an iPad to be set up with different profiles, like a Mac can be. This would allow an iPad to have age restrictions specific to children’s accounts.  </p>\n\niPad</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"ebe94807b69612c923dfda3ec7eb4ff447d1e62eb40f2106954be6ae00a9387d","category":"Apple"}
