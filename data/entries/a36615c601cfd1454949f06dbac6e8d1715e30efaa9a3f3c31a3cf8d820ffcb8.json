Over the past few months, we've reported on numerous stops and starts, but the industry behemoth seems to have come to the hardest stop yet, according to a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-15/apple-delays-return-to-office-until-date-yet-to-be-determined\">Bloomberg</a> report.</p>\n<p>According to a memo sent to Apple employees by CEO Tim Cook, the company's return-to-office date (which was last set at February 1 a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/11/apple-employees-will-return-to-the-office-this-february-leaked-cook-email-says/\">few weeks ago</a>) has once again been delayedâ€”but this time, it has been delayed to a \"date yet to be determined.\" Up to this point, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/08/as-apple-postpones-office-return-workers-say-they-value-flexibility-over-money/\">previous delays</a> had set a new target. Not so this time.</p>\n<p>Cook wrote in the memo that the delay is due to \"rising cases in many parts of the world\" as well as \"the emergence of a new strain of the virus.\" He described the change in plans as a delay, though, not a cancellation. Employees will get at least four weeks of notice before a new return-to-office date, he added.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1821188#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1821188&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a36615c601cfd1454949f06dbac6e8d1715e30efaa9a3f3c31a3cf8d820ffcb8","category":"Tech"}
