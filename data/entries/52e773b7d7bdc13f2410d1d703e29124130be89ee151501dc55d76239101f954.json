There is a little too much darkness in this world and not enough light, a little too much pseudoscience and not enough science. We'll let other publications offer you a daily horoscope. At Ars Technica, we're going to take a different route, finding inspiration from very real images of a universe that is filled with stars and wonder.</em></p>\n    \n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Good morning. It's January 31, and today's image comes from the James Webb Space Telescope. The image is actually a collage of many different photos.</p>\n<p>NASA's new infrared telescope observed 19 nearby face-on spiral galaxies in near- and mid-infrared light as part of its contributions to the Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS program (PHANGS). This program also includes images and data from NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope, the Very Large Telescope’s Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer, and the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2000101#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2000101&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"52e773b7d7bdc13f2410d1d703e29124130be89ee151501dc55d76239101f954","category":"Tech"}
