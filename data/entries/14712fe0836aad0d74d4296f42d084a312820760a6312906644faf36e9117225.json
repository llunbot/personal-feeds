{"title":"Sunderfolk review: RPG magic that transports your friends together","link":"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/sunderfolk-review-rpg-magic-that-transports-your-friends-together/","date":1744981219000,"content":"<p>The <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/sunderfolk-is-a-couch-co-op-tactical-rpg-you-play-with-a-phone-no-really/\">creators of <em>Sunderfolk</em></a> wanted to make a video game that would help players “Rediscover game night.” By my reckoning, they have succeeded, because I am now regularly arguing with good friends over stupid moves. Why didn’t I pick up that gold? Don’t you see how ending up there messed up an area attack? Ah, well.</p>\n<p>That kind of friendly friction, inside dedicated social time, only gets harder to come by as you get older, settle into routines, and sometimes move apart. I’ve hosted four <i>Sunderfolk</i> sessions with three friends, all in different states, and it has felt like reclaiming something I lost. <a href=\"https://www.dreamhaven.com/games/sunderfolk\"><i>Sunderfolk</i></a> is a fun game with a lot of good ideas, and the best one is convincing humans to join up in pondering hex tiles, turn order, and what to name the ogres who shoot arrows (“Pointy Bros”).</p>\n<p>Maybe you already have all the gaming appointments you need with friends, online or in person. <i>Sunderfolk</i>, I might suggest, is a worthy addition to your queue as a low-effort way to give everyone a break from being the organizer. It does a decent job of tutorializing and onboarding less experienced players, then adds depth as it goes on. Given that only one person out of four has to own the game on some system, and the only other hardware needed is a phone, it’s a pretty light lift for what I’m finding to be a great payoff. Some parts could be improved, but the core loop and its camaraderie engine feel sturdy.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/sunderfolk-review-rpg-magic-that-transports-your-friends-together/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/sunderfolk-review-rpg-magic-that-transports-your-friends-together/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"14712fe0836aad0d74d4296f42d084a312820760a6312906644faf36e9117225","category":"Tech"}
