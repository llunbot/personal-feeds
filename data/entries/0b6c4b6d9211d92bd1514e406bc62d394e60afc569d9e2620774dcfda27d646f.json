Issue 164 of the magazine hit the shelves, which featured articles including my <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/monte-zoncolan-ovaro-cycling\">Monte Zoncolan Big Ride</a> and our<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/goscheneralp-cycling\"> Göscheneralp Classic Climb</a>. The latest <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/luke-rowe-podcast\">podcast also came out with one of Wales’s favourite sons, Luke Rowe</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile on the website we had an <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/boru-mccullagh-interview-2025\">interview with round-the-world cyclist Boru McCullagh</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pro-team-history-mercier\">history of the Mercier team</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/maglia-nera-giro-ditalia\">our case for the return of the <em>maglia nera</em></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve also launched our latest competition: <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/win-a-cycling-trip-to-flanders\">win a cycling trip for two to Flanders</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyways, let’s shift into this week’s selection of cycling goodies, including a robotic belt, a streetwear-inspired jersey and a bike bag inspired by a sandwich.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Hypershell Pro X exoskeleton</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1702\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/DSC_9015-scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/DSC_9015-scaled.webp 2560w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/DSC_9015-300x199.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/DSC_9015-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/DSC_9015-768x511.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/DSC_9015-1536x1021.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/DSC_9015-2048x1362.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/DSC_9015-750x499.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/DSC_9015-1140x758.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/DSC_9015-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/DSC_9015-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/DSC_9015-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you thought exoskeletons were just for insects and cybermen, then listen up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hypershell claims that its range of wearable tech is the first of its type in outdoor exoskeletons. The Tron-like system attaches above your hip, using a belt anchored by the 72Wh battery. This sends the robotic femurs to life, assisting your legs when walking, hiking, rock climbing or riding your bike using AI to learn from your natural movements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pro X is paired by Bluetooth to the Hypershell + app, which is needed to set up and control the exoskeleton. The app lets you calibrate the exoskeleton and manage the several pre-programmed settings it offers. It also records how many steps, metres of elevation and kilometres you’ve clocked up while using the device. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1702\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/DSC_9043-scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/DSC_9043-scaled.webp 2560w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/DSC_9043-300x199.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/DSC_9043-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/DSC_9043-768x511.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/DSC_9043-1536x1021.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/DSC_9043-2048x1362.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/DSC_9043-750x499.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/DSC_9043-1140x758.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/DSC_9043-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/DSC_9043-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/DSC_9043-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with the specific activity modes, there are four broad presets: Eco, Transparent, Resistance and Hyper. As the name suggests, Hyper is the most aggressive, using all the torque and horsepower that comes with the two joint-like motors. The resistance mode, however, is one of the more interesting features. When turned on, it locks in a forceful resistance that makes for a tougher ride when out on the road. Yes, it doesn’t feel quite so natural, but it certainly adds an extra training edge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The button on the right joint can be used to adjust the power – or resistance – rising in 20% increments. Alternatively, you can slide the level of assistance down to the nearest 5% on the Hypershell+ app. These changes are supposed to become more intuitive with more usage as the AI learns.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/exoskeleton-v1-scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/exoskeleton-v1-scaled.webp 2560w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/exoskeleton-v1-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/exoskeleton-v1-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/exoskeleton-v1-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/exoskeleton-v1-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/exoskeleton-v1-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/exoskeleton-v1-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/exoskeleton-v1-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/exoskeleton-v1-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/exoskeleton-v1-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/exoskeleton-v1-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In total, the Pro X weighs 1.8kg, supported slightly by a carbon fibre reinforced polymer. It may appear quite bulky, but it does fold down into a fairly compact size. It comes with a full toolbox to transport the device, with specific slots to store the battery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When used for walking, the rechargeable battery’s range is up to 17.5km and it comes with a spare. There’s no clear-cut claimed range on the bike, but I’d imagine it would last considerably longer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what is it for? Hypershell claims that the device can reduce physical exertion by up to 30% – working essentially as an e-bike conversion. The brand also says the exoskeleton can offset up to 30kg of baggage load. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy from <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=205647X1684865&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fhypershell.tech%2Fen-uk%2Fpages%2Fhypershell-x-exoskeleton%3Freferrer%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F\" target=\"_blank\">Hypershell ($1,199, approx £900)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+4\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-4-970x300.webp\" alt=\"Cyclist banner saying 'the world's best cycling magazine, delivered to your door, click here to subscribe'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-4-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-4-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-4-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-4-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-4-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-4-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-4-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tailfin Rear Top tube bag</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2048\" height=\"1536\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/3EF40006-B589-493E-9C40-FECE8FCCD3D9.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/3EF40006-B589-493E-9C40-FECE8FCCD3D9.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/3EF40006-B589-493E-9C40-FECE8FCCD3D9-300x225.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/3EF40006-B589-493E-9C40-FECE8FCCD3D9-970x728.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/3EF40006-B589-493E-9C40-FECE8FCCD3D9-768x576.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/3EF40006-B589-493E-9C40-FECE8FCCD3D9-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/3EF40006-B589-493E-9C40-FECE8FCCD3D9-750x563.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/3EF40006-B589-493E-9C40-FECE8FCCD3D9-1140x855.webp 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Tailfin has launched a new bag, making use of an often overlooked part of the frame. Sitting on the top tube and seatpost, the brand’s new rear top tube bag is said to be inspired by the shape of a supermarket sandwich.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bag has 0.9L of space and is made with waterproof seams and zipper gutter, which uses Tailfin’s patented design. Like the brand’s other bags, it also comes equipped with two thermoplastic straps, with a third optional, and it can share a strap with Tailfin’s other products.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2048\" height=\"1536\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/889F837B-24FD-4A0F-9816-C28D2ED0C1ED.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/889F837B-24FD-4A0F-9816-C28D2ED0C1ED.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/889F837B-24FD-4A0F-9816-C28D2ED0C1ED-300x225.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/889F837B-24FD-4A0F-9816-C28D2ED0C1ED-970x728.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/889F837B-24FD-4A0F-9816-C28D2ED0C1ED-768x576.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/889F837B-24FD-4A0F-9816-C28D2ED0C1ED-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/889F837B-24FD-4A0F-9816-C28D2ED0C1ED-750x563.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/889F837B-24FD-4A0F-9816-C28D2ED0C1ED-1140x855.webp 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To prevent chafing the bag has been tapered and brushed with carbon stiffeners for a rigid shape.

this time designed alongside Dutch brand Patta.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Who are Patta?’ I hear you ask. It’s a Black-owned streetwear brand first launched in Amsterdam during the mid-2000s. Starting as a shoe boutique, it evolved into one of the hottest names in streetwear, and recently struck up a collaboration with Nike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This new range was designed alongside Patta’s creative director Vincent van de Waal and builds on the previous collaboration between the two brands. It features a set of drawings and phrases that stem from the Patta Cycling Club ethos, including the Surinamese phrase <em>Lobi libi</em> (love life), which appears on the shoulder panels and matching socks.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/patta-2-scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/patta-2-scaled.webp 2560w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/patta-2-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/patta-2-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/patta-2-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/patta-2-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/patta-2-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/patta-2-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/patta-2-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/patta-2-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/patta-2-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/patta-2-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The jersey is modelled off the Rapha Pro Team jersey and is adorned with plenty of playful visuals, including dancing cats, palm trees and stars. The constellation continues onto the bibshorts, which are available with cargo pockets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although I’ve opted for the stone and black pairing, the jersey and shorts also come in a purple and pink design, this time with Rapha’s Pro Team Aero jersey and Pro Team bibshorts. There’s more to the line-up than just lycra, as Rapha + Patta have unveiled matching sunglasses, hoodies, musettes and caps that lean on the streetwear aesthetic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The hypebeasts and streetwear collectors have already swept up a lot of the collection, despite it only being out for about a week now. So, if you want a slice of the Patta collab, you’d better be quick.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Explore the <a href=\"https://content.rapha.cc/us/en/story/rapha-patta\" target=\"_blank\">Rapha+Patta range</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>What we’re into this week: Sufjan Stevens’ Carrie and Lowell 10th Anniversary Edition</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"546\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Sufjan-Stevens-Carrie-and-Lowell-970x546.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Sufjan-Stevens-Carrie-and-Lowell-970x546.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Sufjan-Stevens-Carrie-and-Lowell-300x169.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Sufjan-Stevens-Carrie-and-Lowell-768x432.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Sufjan-Stevens-Carrie-and-Lowell-750x422.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Sufjan-Stevens-Carrie-and-Lowell-1140x641.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Sufjan-Stevens-Carrie-and-Lowell.webp 1280w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Michigan-born artist Sufjan Stevens has a broad portfolio of music spanning almost three decades. His work straddles themes of faith, Americana and his enigmatic personal life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2015 he shared his most personal work in the album <em>Carrie and Lowell</em>. The record, titled in honour of his mother and step-father, charts grief, mortality and acceptance. The album was written in the aftermath of losing his estranged mother, who struggled with mental health problems, and includes the gut-wrenching ‘Fourth of July’, which transports us to Stevens’ mother’s deathbed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Guardian, NME and Pitchfork placed the record in their lists of the best albums of the 2010s. I can’t argue with them, <em>Carrie and Lowell</em> is one of my most cherished albums of all-time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In celebration of the ten-year anniversary of its release, Stevens has shared an extended cut of the record. In this version, he shares demos from the album. These include a never-before-released version of ‘Fourth of July’, ‘Death With Dignity’ and the original cut of ‘Mystery of Love’, which didn’t make the album at the time, but lived on as one of Stevens’ biggest hits following its inclusion in the <em>Call Me By Your Name </em>soundtrack a few years later.</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"332\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-4-970x332.webp\" alt=\"Cyclist newsletter banner saying 'get your regular dose of Cyclist, click here to sign up'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-4-970x332.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-4-300x103.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-4-768x263.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-4-1536x526.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-4-2048x701.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-4-750x257.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-4-1140x390.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/rapha-patta-collaboration\">In The Drops: Electric legs, Rapha x Patta kit, Tailfin rear top tube bag and Sufjan Stevens</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Ewan Wilson &#124; Staff Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"0b6c4b6d9211d92bd1514e406bc62d394e60afc569d9e2620774dcfda27d646f","category":"Cycling"}
