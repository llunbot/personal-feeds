In addition to AirPods, Apple offers both regular and Pro versions of the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and there will likely be a regular version of the Apple Vision Pro headset in the future. Nevertheless, Apple has used a few other suffixes for higher-end products over the years, such as the AirPods Max and the Apple Watch Ultra.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple went on to release second-generation AirPods Pro in September 2022, and it updated the headphones with a USB-C charging case and a few other features a year later. Third-generation AirPods Pro are rumored to be released in 2025.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro\">AirPods Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/22/airpods-pro-were-almost-named-airpods-extreme/\">AirPods Pro Were Almost Named AirPods Extreme</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airpods-pro-were-almost-named-airpods-extreme.2420187/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8dfdd43a80a56858b82ab18ca44dbb423cfd2a84bfcbf24b2700533f90b00f1e","category":"Apple"}
