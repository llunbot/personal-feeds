Young initially expected the monitor to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/05/20/apple-27-inch-mini-led-display-october-rumor/\">launch in 2022</a>, but a release has yet to materialize.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/apple-studio-display.jpg\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"893\" />\r<br />\nIn a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DSCCRoss/status/1645454528031096833\">tweet shared with paying subscribers</a> today, Young said that Apple has \"killed off\" the display \"for now\" for reasons unclear, despite shipping some display panels for the monitor last year. He did not provide a reason for Apple's decision, and it's unclear if the company will ever release the monitor in the future or if it will remain cancelled.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYoung previously said the display would support ProMotion, allowing for up to a 120Hz refresh rate. Given the 27-inch size that was rumored, it is possible the display could have been a next-generation version of the Studio Display, but it also could have been a new model positioned between the Studio Display and the higher-end Pro Display XDR. The current Studio Display starts at $1,599 with a 5K resolution and no ProMotion.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple released the Studio Display in March 2022 alongside the Mac Studio. The monitor has not received any hardware updates since launching.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYoung has a good track record with display-related information about future Apple products. In the past, he accurately revealed that ProMotion was coming to the iPhone 13 Pro and the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro, that the sixth-generation iPad mini would be equipped with a larger 8.3-inch display, and many other details.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/displays/\">Apple Pro Display XDR</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/studio-display/\">Apple Studio Display</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ross-young/\">Ross Young</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-accessories.77\">Mac Accessories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/10/apple-27-inch-mini-led-display-cancelled/\">Apple's Rumored 27-Inch Display With ProMotion No Longer Planned</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-rumored-27-inch-display-with-promotion-no-longer-planned.2386447/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4b117643bf96ff543436ff20d2231ccc0a26d66f0a3a0754af0a501247ecc7b3","category":"Apple"}
