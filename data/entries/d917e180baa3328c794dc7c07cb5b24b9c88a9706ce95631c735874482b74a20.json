The detailed aerial map offers some tantalizing clues about the ancient culture whose people built hundreds of similar fortresses in a mountainous region that spans the modern countries of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey. Based on their survey and excavations within the fortress walls, Cranfield University archaeologist Nathaniel Erb-Satullo and his colleagues suggest the fortified community may have been a place where nomadic herders converged during their yearly migration, but the evidence still leaves more questions than answers.</p>\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"616\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/urn_cambridge.org_id_binary_20241224093543482-0012_S0003598X24001972_S0003598X24001972_fig2-1024x616.png\" alt=\"gray map of a promontory between two gorges, with walls and buildings marked and labelled.\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/urn_cambridge.org_id_binary_20241224093543482-0012_S0003598X24001972_S0003598X24001972_fig2-1024x616.png 1024w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/urn_cambridge.org_id_binary_20241224093543482-0012_S0003598X24001972_S0003598X24001972_fig2-640x385.png 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/urn_cambridge.org_id_binary_20241224093543482-0012_S0003598X24001972_S0003598X24001972_fig2-768x462.png 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/urn_cambridge.org_id_binary_20241224093543482-0012_S0003598X24001972_S0003598X24001972_fig2-1536x923.png 1536w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/urn_cambridge.org_id_binary_20241224093543482-0012_S0003598X24001972_S0003598X24001972_fig2-2048x1231.png 2048w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/urn_cambridge.org_id_binary_20241224093543482-0012_S0003598X24001972_S0003598X24001972_fig2-980x589.png 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/urn_cambridge.org_id_binary_20241224093543482-0012_S0003598X24001972_S0003598X24001972_fig2-1440x866.png 1440w\" />\n      This map shows an aerial map of the ancient megafortress at Dmanisis Gora.\n        Credit:\n          Erb-Satullo et al. 2025\n      \n<h2>An abandoned ancient megafortress</h2>\n<p>The half-buried Bronze Age ruins of Dmanisis Gora perch on a windswept promontory a few kilometers away from a cave where <i>Homo erectus</i> (or a close relative) lived 1.8 million years ago. Deep, steep-sided gorges run along two sides of the promontory, and sometime between 1500 and 1000 BCE, people stacked boulders into a double layer of high, thick walls to block off the end of the plateau from the plains to the west. Sheltered between the 4-meter high, 2.5-meter wide walls and the 60-meter-deep gorges, people built dugout houses, then later aboveground stone ones, along with stone animal pens and other buildings.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/archaeologists-just-mapped-a-bronze-age-megafortress-in-georgia/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/archaeologists-just-mapped-a-bronze-age-megafortress-in-georgia/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kiona N.
