It requires a 13mm thick dropout with a pretty big 30x40mm flat area on the inside and 25mm diameter flat spot on the outside. Transmission derailleurs simply require ~30mm in diameter flat on both sides. That’s pretty common on carbon bikes anyway. Alloy bikes with big machined dropouts can also easily make that work. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But many quality steel (and titanium) bikes use much smaller and often hooded dropouts, optimized to weld or braze-on small diameter seatstays &amp; chainstays. And they simply don’t have enough free real estate to work with UDH. Yes, it’s possible to make it work. Some steel bikemakers have switched to <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/zoceli-crafts-new-narum-135mm-short-link-steel-full-suspension-trail-bike-for-bespoked/\" target=\"_blank\">bigger</a> or <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/esker-portage-dropouts-sram-udh-how-to-add-transmission-hayduke-or-japhy/\" target=\"_blank\">interchangeable dropouts</a>, rearranged <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/onguza-original-gravel-model-1-african-steel-gravelbike/\" target=\"_blank\">layout of their stays</a> to fit, and some have come up with a <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/nordest-bardino-v3-5-brings-udh-to-affordable-steel-enduro-hardtail/\" target=\"_blank\">good UDH-ready compromise</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sour’s solution was just to tweak the standard a bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s that mean?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Sour-Not-UDH-on-steel-bikes_almost-universal-derailleur-hanger-Transmission-direct-mount-compatibility_inside-and-out-renderings.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"650\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Sour-Not-UDH-on-steel-bikes_almost-universal-derailleur-hanger-Transmission-direct-mount-compatibility_inside-and-out-renderings.jpg\" alt=\"Sour Not-UDH almost universal derailleur hanger Transmission direct mount compatibility for steel bikes, renderings\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Sour-Not-UDH-on-steel-bikes_almost-universal-derailleur-hanger-Transmission-direct-mount-compatibility_inside-and-out-renderings.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Sour-Not-UDH-on-steel-bikes_almost-universal-derailleur-hanger-Transmission-direct-mount-compatibility_inside-and-out-renderings-297x161.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Sour-Not-UDH-on-steel-bikes_almost-universal-derailleur-hanger-Transmission-direct-mount-compatibility_inside-and-out-renderings-120x65.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Sour-Not-UDH-on-steel-bikes_almost-universal-derailleur-hanger-Transmission-direct-mount-compatibility_inside-and-out-renderings-768x416.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That means, the Sour Not-UDH is pretty much the same as a regular UDH, just with a bit of that inward-facing plastic upper fin chopped off. Sour says it’s about 25% smaller overall. That lets them fit it into a compact hooded dropout, and doesn’t get in the way of their integral rack/fender mount. And on the outside, there’s just a spacer since steel dropouts aren’t 13mm thick. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Sour-Not-UDH_Sour-hanger-vs-SRAM-UDH.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Sour-Not-UDH_Sour-hanger-vs-SRAM-UDH.jpg\" alt=\"Sour Not-UDH almost universal derailleur hanger Transmission direct mount compatibility for steel bikes, comparison\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Sour-Not-UDH_Sour-hanger-vs-SRAM-UDH.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Sour-Not-UDH_Sour-hanger-vs-SRAM-UDH-297x186.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Sour-Not-UDH_Sour-hanger-vs-SRAM-UDH-1536x960.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Sour-Not-UDH_Sour-hanger-vs-SRAM-UDH-120x75.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Sour-Not-UDH_Sour-hanger-vs-SRAM-UDH-768x480.jpg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Sour Not-UDH <em>left</em> vs. SRAM UDH <em>right</em> (<em>Bikerumor composite</em>)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, unlike the SRAM UDH which is half plastic, the Sour Not-UDH is entirely made of machined aluminum.

So Sour will deliver all of their new steel bikes with an extra spare hanger, as well.
