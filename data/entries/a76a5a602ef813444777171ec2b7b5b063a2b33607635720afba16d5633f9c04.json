{"title":"Reddit API Pricing Would Cost Apollo Developer $20 Million Per Year","link":"https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/","date":1685557860000,"content":"\n<p>Christian Selig, developer of the splendid Reddit client <a href=\"https://apolloapp.io/\">Apollo</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I’ll cut to the chase: 50 million requests costs $12,000, a figure\nfar more than I ever could have imagined.</p>\n\n<p>Apollo made 7 billion requests last month, which would put it at\nabout 1.7 million dollars per month, or 20 million US dollars per\nyear. Even if I only kept subscription users, the average Apollo\nuser uses 344 requests per day, which would cost $2.50 per month,\nwhich is over double what the subscription currently costs, so I’d\nbe in the red every month.</p>\n\n<p>I’m deeply disappointed in this price. Reddit iterated that the\nprice would be A) reasonable and based in reality, and B) they\nwould not operate like Twitter. Twitter’s pricing was <a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/twitter-data-api-prices-out-nearly-everyone\">publicly\nridiculed</a> for its obscene price of $42,000 for 50 million\ntweets. Reddit’s is still $12,000. For reference, I pay Imgur, a\nsite similar to Reddit in userbase and media, $166 for the same 50\nmillion API calls.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Selig does some ballpark math and estimates that Reddit currently generates about $0.12 in revenue per month per active user. The average Apollo user would cost $2.50 per month in API fees — 20× higher.</p>\n\n<p>Right now Apollo is free to use, but offers a Pro tier with a slew of additional features and fun stuff for a one-time payment of $5, and an Ultra tier with even more for a $13/year subscription. If Reddit goes through with this API pricing, Apollo’s free and Pro tiers would be unsustainable, and the Ultra subscription would have to cost at least $50 or $60 per year.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/31/reddit-apollo-api-pricing\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"a76a5a602ef813444777171ec2b7b5b063a2b33607635720afba16d5633f9c04","category":"Tech"}
