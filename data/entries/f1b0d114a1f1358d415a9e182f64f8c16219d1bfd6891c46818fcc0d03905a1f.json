When that happens, you see a dialog at startup that tells you that “Your computer was restarted because of a problem,” and offers to let you send a report to Apple. There are lots of reasons that your Mac can restart, including a power failure, and you typically know why it happened.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for some people, every time they restart their Mac after that, whether using  <em>&gt; Shutdown</em> or  <em>&gt; Restart</em>, they see the same error. They know everything’s all right, why doesn’t macOS?</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/mac911-computer-restarted-bordered.png\" alt=\"macOS your computer restarted because of a problem\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/mac911-computer-restarted-bordered.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 525w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/mac911-computer-restarted-bordered.png?resize=300%2C267&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w\" width=\"525\" height=\"468\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption><p>This dialog should only appear the first time you restart after a problem.</p></figcaption>\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"macOS your computer restarted because of a problem\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/mac911-computer-restarted-bordered.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 525w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/mac911-computer-restarted-bordered.png?resize=300%2C267&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w\" width=\"525\" height=\"468\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>This dialog should only appear the first time you restart after a problem.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"macOS your computer restarted because of a problem\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/mac911-computer-restarted-bordered.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 525w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/mac911-computer-restarted-bordered.png?resize=300%2C267&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w\" width=\"525\" height=\"468\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>This dialog should only appear the first time you restart after a problem.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The answer is a diagnostic file that can be left in rare circumstances after the problematic restart has resolved itself. You can fix this problem easily enough:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>In the Finder, choose <em>Go &gt; Go to Folder</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Enter exactly the following and press Return: <code>/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports</code></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Look for any file starting with the word <code>Sleep</code> and ending with <code>.diag</code></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delete those files and empty the trash (<em>Finder &gt; Empty Trash</em>).</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>On your next regular restart, the alert will not appear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This Mac 911 article is in response to a question submitted by Macworld reader Henri.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ask Mac 911</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve compiled a list of the questions we get asked most frequently, along with answers and links to columns: <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/3077986/os-x/your-top-questions-to-mac-911-and-some-answers.html\">read our super FAQ</a> to see if your question is covered.
