But before the race rolled out of Dinane, I managed to get my grubby mitts on one of the hot favorite bikes for the race: last year’s winner, Team Trek-Segafredo’s <a href=\"http://cyclingtips.com/tag/Elisa-Longo-Borghini\" target=\"_blank\">Elisa Longo Borghini</a>‘s <a href=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/2023/02/2023-trek-domane-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Trek Domane SLR</a>.</p>\n<p>Along with the rest of her squad, Elisa had again a new steed for the day. Last year you may recall the team showcased the new fourth-generation <a href=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/2022/04/new-trek-domane-rsl-finishes-first-and-third-at-paris-roubaix-femmes/\" target=\"_blank\">Domane with an eye-catching toffee apple red paint job</a>; this year, Trek went one better and had the team lining on another custom colorway, a colorful matte splash of red, yellow, and blue that was supposed to resemble the cobbles they’d be taking on.</p>\n<p>As you’d expect from Trek-Segafredo, there were no corners cut in the material, so without further ado, I ask you nicely to hit that play button and see what Elisa and her team used for a Saturday in hell.</p>\n<p>Thanks,<br />\nDave</p>\n<div></div>\n<p> </p>","author":"Dave Everett","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"469de105055e7f682a292763a34e4a7c0e743c78b30e178bcfb817c1627790cb","category":"Cycling"}
