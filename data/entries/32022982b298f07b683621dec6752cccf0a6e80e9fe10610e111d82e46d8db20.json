The IA’s <a href=\"http://openlibrary.org\">Open Library project</a>—which partners with libraries to scan print books in their collections and offer them as lendable e-books—had no right to reproduce 127 of the publishers’ books named in the suit, judge John Koeltl decided.</p>\n<p>IA's so-called \"controlled digital lending\" practice \"merely creates derivative e-books that, when lent to the public, compete with those [e-books] authorized by the publishers,” Koeltl wrote in his opinion.</p>\n<p>Publishers suing—Hachette, HarperCollins, Penguin Random House, and Wiley—had alleged that the Open Library provided a way for libraries to avoid paying e-book licensing fees that generate substantial revenue for publishers. These licensing fees are paid by aggregators like OverDrive and constitute a “thriving” market that IA “supplants,” Koeltl wrote. Penguin’s e-book licensing generates $59 million annually, for example.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1927024#p3\">Read 28 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1927024&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"32022982b298f07b683621dec6752cccf0a6e80e9fe10610e111d82e46d8db20","category":"Tech"}
