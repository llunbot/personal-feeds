This wild-looking commuter full-face helmet is still officially just a <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thebeam/the-worlds-first-full-face-bicycle-helmet-virgo\" target=\"_blank\">Kickstarter</a> project, but it’s been developed by a company we’ve already seen turn some other innovative ideas into real products. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this commuter full-face has already smashed through its funding goal in its first day of crowdfunding… literally in the first hour!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Beam Virgo MIPS, a safer full-face helmet for commuter ebiking</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Beam is calling the new full-face Virgo helmet project “the safest cycling helmet for e-bikes”, and it’s hard to argue with their logic. With low coverage in the back, an integrated chin-bar up front, built-in visors, hi-viz lighting, and MIPS protection &amp; dial-retention inside… the idea of a full-featured full-face helmet for urban ebike commuting simply makes a lot of sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Beam_Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-Kickstarter_safest-cycling-helmet-for-e-bikes_riding-through-Paris.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Beam_Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-Kickstarter_safest-cycling-helmet-for-e-bikes_riding-through-Paris-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"The Beam x Virgo MIPS full-face commuter ebike helmet on Kickstarter now, the safest cycling helmet for e-bikes, riding through Paris\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Beam_Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-Kickstarter_safest-cycling-helmet-for-e-bikes_riding-through-Paris-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Beam_Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-Kickstarter_safest-cycling-helmet-for-e-bikes_riding-through-Paris-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Beam_Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-Kickstarter_safest-cycling-helmet-for-e-bikes_riding-through-Paris-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Beam_Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-Kickstarter_safest-cycling-helmet-for-e-bikes_riding-through-Paris-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Beam_Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-Kickstarter_safest-cycling-helmet-for-e-bikes_riding-through-Paris-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Beam_Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-Kickstarter_safest-cycling-helmet-for-e-bikes_riding-through-Paris-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Beam_Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-Kickstarter_safest-cycling-helmet-for-e-bikes_riding-through-Paris-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Beam_Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-Kickstarter_safest-cycling-helmet-for-e-bikes_riding-through-Paris.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>all photos c.

But modern helmets -full-faces especially- are now so much lighter and better ventilated that those aren’t as good excuses any more. And if you are getting ebike pedal assist, you might as well get the extra protection if you are less likely to be fully working up a sweat.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>OK, so who are The Beam &amp; Virgo Move again?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Beam_Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-Kickstarter_safest-cycling-helmet-for-e-bikes_city-riding.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Beam_Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-Kickstarter_safest-cycling-helmet-for-e-bikes_city-riding-800x1067.jpg\" alt=\"The Beam x Virgo MIPS full-face commuter ebike helmet on Kickstarter now, the safest cycling helmet for e-bikes &amp; e-scooters?\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Beam_Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-Kickstarter_safest-cycling-helmet-for-e-bikes_city-riding-800x1067.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Beam_Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-Kickstarter_safest-cycling-helmet-for-e-bikes_city-riding-225x300.jpg 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Beam_Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-Kickstarter_safest-cycling-helmet-for-e-bikes_city-riding-90x120.jpg 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Beam_Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-Kickstarter_safest-cycling-helmet-for-e-bikes_city-riding-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Beam_Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-Kickstarter_safest-cycling-helmet-for-e-bikes_city-riding-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Beam_Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-Kickstarter_safest-cycling-helmet-for-e-bikes_city-riding.jpg 1350w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Beam is a young French commuter cycling product start-up with established manufacturing ties in South Korea for a few years.

Yeah, that is the designer behind the new Virgo Move project, too.

More people on bikes is great, but statistically, it means more people getting in bike accidents, too. Plus, while regulated ebikes don’t really make you a lot faster, they are heavier, a bit more difficult to manage, and do make it easier for inexperienced riders to go faster than they would pedal otherwise. And we all know there are plenty of ebikers riding around town in the gray areas with their pedal-assist speed limiters bypassed.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Beam_Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-Kickstarter_safest-cycling-helmet-for-e-bikes_side.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Beam_Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-Kickstarter_safest-cycling-helmet-for-e-bikes_side-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"The Beam x Virgo MIPS full-face commuter ebike helmet on Kickstarter now, the safest cycling helmet for e-bikes, side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Beam_Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-Kickstarter_safest-cycling-helmet-for-e-bikes_side-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Beam_Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-Kickstarter_safest-cycling-helmet-for-e-bikes_side-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Beam_Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-Kickstarter_safest-cycling-helmet-for-e-bikes_side-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Beam_Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-Kickstarter_safest-cycling-helmet-for-e-bikes_side-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Beam_Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-Kickstarter_safest-cycling-helmet-for-e-bikes_side-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Beam_Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-Kickstarter_safest-cycling-helmet-for-e-bikes_side-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Beam_Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-Kickstarter_safest-cycling-helmet-for-e-bikes_side.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So let’s make them, and ourselves, safer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Beam_Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-Kickstarter_safest-cycling-helmet-for-e-bikes_magnetic-visor-up.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Beam_Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-Kickstarter_safest-cycling-helmet-for-e-bikes_magnetic-visor-up-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"The Beam x Virgo MIPS full-face commuter ebike helmet on Kickstarter now, the safest cycling helmet for e-bikes, visor up\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Beam_Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-Kickstarter_safest-cycling-helmet-for-e-bikes_magnetic-visor-up-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Beam_Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-Kickstarter_safest-cycling-helmet-for-e-bikes_magnetic-visor-up-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Beam_Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-Kickstarter_safest-cycling-helmet-for-e-bikes_magnetic-visor-up-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Beam_Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-Kickstarter_safest-cycling-helmet-for-e-bikes_magnetic-visor-up-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Beam_Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-Kickstarter_safest-cycling-helmet-for-e-bikes_magnetic-visor-up-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Beam_Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-Kickstarter_safest-cycling-helmet-for-e-bikes_magnetic-visor-up-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Beam_Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-Kickstarter_safest-cycling-helmet-for-e-bikes_magnetic-visor-up.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the new Virgo full-face ebike helmet offers as much protection as you could ask for.
