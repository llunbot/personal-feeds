T-Mobile is also accused of misleading customers about its security practices, not notifying Washingtonians of the data breach in a timely matter, and downplaying the severity of the breach.\r<br />\n<blockquote>For years prior to August 2021, T-Mobile did not meet industry standards for cybersecurity and knew about these vulnerabilities. These included insufficient processes for identifying and addressing security threats and a systemic lack of oversight. In some cases, T-Mobile used obvious passwords to protect accounts that had access to customers' sensitive personal information. The 2021 breach was enabled, in part, when the hacker guessed obvious credentials to gain access to T-Mobile's internal databases.</blockquote>\r<br />\nT-Mobile's systems were breached in March 2021, but T-Mobile did not learn of the attack until August 2021. Hackers were able to obtain names, phone numbers, addresses, birth dates, social security numbers, driver's license and ID info, IMEI numbers, and IMSI numbers from T-Mobile customers, and that data was sold.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe hacker behind the attack <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/26/t-mobile-security-awful-claims-hacker/\">said that T-Mobile's security</a> was \"awful\" and that the breach occurred when an unprotected T-Mobile router was discovered, which led to access of T-Mobile's Washington data center.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nT-Mobile <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/27/t-mobile-ceo-apologies-for-data-breach/\">apologized for the data breach</a> and promised to prevent a future attack by establishing long-term partnerships with cybersecurity experts.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe lawsuit is seeking restitution for Washingtonians that were harmed in the data breach, along with injunctive relief to require improvements to T-Mobile's cybersecurity practices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nT-Mobile already paid $350 million to settle a class action lawsuit over the data breach in 2022, and it was fined $60 million by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (CFIUS) for failing to prevent or disclose unauthorized access to sensitive customer data.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/t-mobile/\">T-Mobile</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/08/t-mobile-lawsuit-data-breach/\">T-Mobile Facing Another Lawsuit Over 2021 Data Breach</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/t-mobile-facing-another-lawsuit-over-2021-data-breach.2447004/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"43d2001bc69a9b4f4322d08e8144ad13c704d87af15f0441c691c56748b9aa05","category":"Apple"}
