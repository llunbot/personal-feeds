Services teams are listening to your feedback and developing little (or big) changes that makes your life easier when working with our services. The ability to support multiple sessions in the AWS Console is my favorite one so far in 2025.</p> \n<p>But our teams didn’t stop there, let’s look at the last week’s new announcements.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Last week’s launches</strong></span></p> \n<p>Beside the usual Regional expansion (new capabilities that are now available in a new Region), here are the launches that got my attention.</p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/01/amazon-eventbridge-direct-delivery-cross-account-targets/\">Amazon EventBridge announces direct delivery to cross-account targets</a></strong> – <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/\">Amazon EventBridge</a> is now able to deliver events to targets in another AWS account directly without having to send them to the default bus in the target account first. This will simplify so many architectures out there! It supports any target that supports <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_identity-vs-resource.html\">resource-based policies</a>, including <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/\">AWS Lambda</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/\">Amazon Simple Queue Service</a> (Amazon SQS), <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sns/\">Amazon Simple Notification Service</a> (Amazon SNS), <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/\">Amazon Kinesis</a>, and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/\">Amazon API Gateway</a>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/01/amazon-corretto-january-2025-quarterly-updates/\"><strong>Amazon Corretto quaterly update</strong></a> – We announced quarterly security and critical updates for <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/?filtered-posts.sort-by=item.additionalFields.createdDate&amp;filtered-posts.sort-order=desc\">Amazon Corretto</a> Long-Term Supported (LTS) and Feature Release (FR) versions of OpenJDK. Corretto 23.0.2, 21.0.6, 17.0.14, 11.0.26, 8u442 are now available for download. Amazon Corretto is a no-cost, multi-platform, production-ready distribution of OpenJDK. You can download the updates from the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/corretto\">Corretto home page</a> or just type <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-21-ug/generic-linux-install.html\"><code>apt-get</code> or <code>yum update</code></a>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/01/high-throughput-mode-amazon-sns-fifo-topics/\"><strong>High-throughput mode for Amazon SNS FIFO Topics</strong></a> – Amazon SNS now supports high-throughput mode for SNS FIFO topics, with default throughput matching SNS standard topics across all Regions. When you enable high-throughput mode, SNS FIFO topics will maintain order within message group, while reducing the deduplication scope to <em>the message-group level</em>. With this change, you can leverage up to 30K messages per second (MPS) per account by default in US East (N. Virginia) Region, and 9K MPS per account in US West (Oregon) and Europe (Ireland) Regions, and request quota increases for additional throughput in any Region.</p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/01/amazon-connect-agent-workspace-audio-optimization-citrix-workspaces-virtual-desktops/\">Amazon Connect agent workspace now supports audio optimization for Citrix and Amazon WorkSpaces virtual desktops</a></strong> – <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/connect/\">Amazon Connect</a> agent workspace now supports the ability to redirect audio from Citrix and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/workspaces-family/\">Amazon WorkSpaces</a> Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) environments to a customer service agent’s local device. Audio redirection improves voice quality and reduces latency for voice calls handled on virtual desktops, providing a better experience for both end customers and agents.</p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/01/amazon-redshift-history-mode-zero-etl-integrations/\">Amazon Redshift announces support for History Mode for zero-ETL integrations</a> – </strong>This new capability enables you to build <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowly_changing_dimension\">Type 2 Slowly Changing Dimension</a> (SCD 2) tables on your historical data from databases, out-of-the-box in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/\">Amazon Redshift</a>, without writing any code. History mode simplifies the process of tracking and analyzing historical data changes, allowing you to gain valuable insights from your data’s evolution over time.</p> \n<p>Finally, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\">Amazon Bedrock</a> has its own set of announcements. First, for anyone investing in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation\">retrieval-augmented generation</a>, Bedrock now support multimodal content with <strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/01/amazon-bedrock-multimodal-cohere-embed-3-multilingual-english/\">Cohere Embed 3 Multilingual and Embed 3 English</a></strong> models. This enables you to create embeddings to not only index text, but also images.</p> \n<p>Second, read <strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/01/luma-ais-ray2-visual-ai-model-amazon-bedrock/\">Luma AI’s Ray2 visual AI model now available in Amazon Bedrock</a></strong>. Luma Ray2 is a large-scale video-generation model capable of creating realistic visuals with fluid, natural movement. With Luma Ray2 in Amazon Bedrock, you can generate production-ready video clips with seamless animations, ultrarealistic details, and logical event sequences with natural language prompts, removing the need for technical prompt engineering. Ray2 currently supports 5- and 9-second video generations with 540p and 720p resolution.</p> \n<p>And finally, <strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/01/amazon-bedrock-flows-multi-turn-conversation-support/\">Amazon Bedrock Flows announces preview of multi-turn conversation support</a></strong>. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/flows/\">Amazon Bedrock Flows</a> enables you to link foundation models (FMs), <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/prompt-management/\">Amazon Bedrock Prompts</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agents/\">Amazon Bedrock Agents</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/knowledge-bases/\">Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/guardrails/\">Amazon Bedrock Guardrails</a> and other AWS services together to build and scale pre-defined generative AI workflows. This week, the team announced preview of multi-turn conversation support for agent nodes in Flows. This capability enables dynamic, back-and-forth conversations between users and flows, similar to a natural dialogue.</p> \n<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/new/\">For a full list of AWS announcements, be sure to keep an eye on the What's New at AWS page.</a> \n<p><span><strong>Other AWS events<br /> </strong></span>Check your calendar and sign up for upcoming AWS events.</p> \n<p>AWS Summits season is starting!
