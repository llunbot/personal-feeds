Up for <a href=\"https://fave.co/3zjucMa\" target=\"_blank\">preorder now</a>, the Charge 5 adds ECG (electrocardiogram), EDA (electrodermal activity) stress sensors, an AMOLED display, and a stainless steel facelift for $50 more than its predecessor, the <a href=\"https://goto.target.com/b3mmW9\" target=\"_blank\">Charge 4</a>.</p>\n<p>Fitbit says it will continue to sell the $130 Charge 4 until the end of the year, which positions it between the $100 <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3sI2A0y\" target=\"_blank\">Fitbit Inspire 2</a> and the new $180 Fitbit Charge 5. Inching ever closer to smartwatch territory, the new Charge will have most of the capabilities found on Fitbit’s current <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2XJobu3\" target=\"_blank\">Versa</a> and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3DgqC7J\" target=\"_blank\">Sense</a> smartwatches.</p>\n<p>In a closed briefing, Fitbit also disclosed its intention to make smartwatches with Google’s Wear OS built-in. Perhaps this will be the primary distinction between the company’s increasingly capable Charge series and its smartwatch line going forward.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1789554#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1789554&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Corey Gaskin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1dda2cea63df88167b72b9d1d7f51263bd7d9e11754c86c3bc9f9882401e7c93","category":"Tech"}
