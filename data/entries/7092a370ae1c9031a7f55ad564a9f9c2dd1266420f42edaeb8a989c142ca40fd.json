Copilot Vision launched late last year as a feature that could look at pages in the Microsoft Edge browser and answer questions based on those pages' contents. The new Vision update extends that capability to any app window, allowing you to ask Copilot not just about the contents of a document but also about the user interface of the app itself.</p>\n<img width=\"2560\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Vision%E2%80%94FRE-scaled-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Vision—FRE-scaled-1.jpg 2560w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Vision—FRE-scaled-1-640x400.jpg 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Vision—FRE-scaled-1-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Vision—FRE-scaled-1-768x480.jpg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Vision—FRE-scaled-1-1536x960.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Vision—FRE-scaled-1-2048x1280.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Vision—FRE-scaled-1-980x613.jpg 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Vision—FRE-scaled-1-1440x900.jpg 1440w\" />\n      Microsoft's Copilot Vision update can see the contents of any app window you share with it.\n        Credit:\n          Microsoft\n      \n<p>Provided the app works as intended—not a given for any software, but especially for AI features—Copilot Vision could replace \"frantic Googling\" as a way to learn how to use a new app or how to do something new or obscure in complex PC apps like Word, Excel, or Photoshop. I recently switched from Photoshop to <a href=\"https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/photo/\">Affinity Photo</a>, for example, and I'm still finding myself tripped up by small differences in workflows and UI between the two apps. Copilot Vision could, in theory, ease that sort of transition.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/windows-11s-copilot-vision-wants-to-help-you-learn-to-use-complicated-apps/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/windows-11s-copilot-vision-wants-to-help-you-learn-to-use-complicated-apps/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7092a370ae1c9031a7f55ad564a9f9c2dd1266420f42edaeb8a989c142ca40fd","category":"Tech"}
