He hadnâ€™t wanted to hand them over, but the defense had subpoenaed them. Here, take them, he seemed to be saying.</p>\n<p>It was just one of many theatrical moments Eisenman would deliver in a brief day of testimony in San Jose, California. Eisenman invested around $1.2 million in the startup only to see his money vanish when the company went belly-up in 2018. His investment is behind one of the counts of wire fraud that Holmes is facing. But as the court heard, Eisenman had plenty of opportunity to cash out.</p>\n<p>His first chance was in 2010, when Holmes <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/11/holmes-ex-boyfriend-who-was-theranos-exec-bullied-and-ignored-1-2m-investor/\">offered to pay him at least five times his initial investment</a> to buy back his shares. In 2015, he had two more chances: Eisenman spoke with people at SharesPost, a market for trading shares in private companies, who said he could probably sell for $14.75, which would net him at least $20 million. Also in 2015, he was approached by Chris Boies, the son of Theranos attorney and board director David Boies, who offered to pay $15 per share.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1813373#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1813373&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Tim De Chant","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"484513be154a6c9fbbdcca35c0b850fe8add3e54c7229af6b4cf7d27576f9301","category":"Tech"}
