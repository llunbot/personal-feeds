Finding the ideal saddle shape can be a process of trial and error, but by reading this guide, we hope you can hone in on suitable options and find your ideal saddle more easily. We gathered a diverse group of options from well-established industry leaders, to lesser-known innovators, and tested them each for several weeks of daily riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our top picks are listed below along with the best of the rest that are all worthy options to consider.

Power Pro with Mirror</a> saddle features a 3D printed upper, a nylon-injected base, and Titanium rails. While still quite spendy at $325, these more modest base and rail materials help to keep the price a bit closer to earth, while the upper provides a heavenly ride experience that has been much-hyped since the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbikesaddle&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fspecialized-s-works-power-with-mirror-saddle\">S-Works Power with Mirror</a> ($450) saddle was released in 2020.</p><p></p><p>The <em>Mirror Variable Density Matrix</em> upper is a liquid polymer matrix of 14,000 struts and 7,799 nodes, tuned using RETÜL fit data to deliver variable, targeted support throughout the saddle. In plain English, the firmness changes across the upper to maximize support of the sit bones and relieve pressure on soft tissues. </p><p></p><p>Out of the box, the Power Pro with Mirror feels quite soft, even in comparison to the other 3-D printed saddle tested, the Fizik Argo Vento 00 Adaptive. Compared to firmer saddles, it has a somewhat squishy feel and deforms under the rider’s weight, which proved to be a bit distracting and not confidence-inspiring at first. All saddles have a short adjustment period, but the 3D-printed Matrix has a different feel than traditional saddles that takes a little getting used to. Despite some initial skepticism, additional riding with the Power Pro Mirror helped develop a greater appreciation for the feeling that the liquid polymer matrix provided. Eventually, the softness of the upper began to feel more natural and the movement of the saddle wasn’t distracting at all. After a few more rides, the supreme level of comfort was the only thing we noticed. </p><p></p><p>As expected, the profile and shape of the Power Pro Mirror are similar to all previous Specialized Power saddles. A short nose, large cutout, and upswept rear portion provide excellent pelvic support when riding in an aggressive, forward-hinged position. It comes in two widths, 143mm and 155mm (tested), so most riders should be able to find a good fit. The Power Saddle family has been incredibly popular across the road cycling community and works well for most body types.</p><p></p><p>With round 7 x 7mm hollow Titanium rails, the Power Pro Mirror is compatible with almost every seatpost out there. Additionally, the Ti rails offer a bit more flex than oval-shaped carbon fiber rails and tend to make less noise on rough roads while also helping to keep the price significantly lower than the S-Works version. Still, it isn’t the lightest saddle at a measured weight of 247 grams, but we feel the enhanced comfort it provides is worth the slight weight penalty.</p><p></p><p>Even if it wasn’t immediately evident, we found Specialized’s Mirror technology to significantly increase seated comfort on the bike.

At $139, it’s reasonably priced with TiRox rails and even less expensive (but slightly heavier) with T4.0 rails. The 143mm width is also sold with <em>Nack</em> carbon rails with a significant reduction in weight and a bump in price to $235. Similar to models like the Specialized Power Pro with Mirror, the Dimension has a short, 245mm overall length that has become more popular in recent years </p><p></p><p>Sit bone widths vary, so it’s great that Prologo offers the Dimension in both 143mm and the wider “Space” version at 153mm. We found the 153mm width to be an excellent fit, with a nice, supportive platform that spreads the weight evenly between the sit bones. The pelvic support, along with the short-nosed design made it impressively comfortable across the range of seated riding positions, whether tucked down in the drops or sitting more upright with hands on the bar tops while climbing. </p><p></p><p>Out on the road, the Prologo Dimension delivers the comfort that its design promises. On top of excellent lateral stability, the moderate level of cushioning strikes a good balance that’s comfortable for long hours in the saddle. It’s not squishy, but rather a bit cushy, in comparison to the less forgiving race-oriented saddles in our test. A large central cutout, dubbed “P.A.S.” or Perenial Area System by Prologo, is well executed and not at all noticeable when riding. The walls and edges of the P.A.S. transition smoothly into the top of the saddle that you can’t even tell it’s there. </p><p></p><p>It’s hard to fault with the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GM0ALVU/brbggearcyclingroadbikesaddle-20\">Prologo Dimension Space</a>. It is comfortable, easy to install, and looks like it will be able to withstand many tens of thousands of kilometers without issue. In a market where spending triple its cost doesn’t really net a massive gain in comfort or weight reduction, the Dimension Space is a great all-around saddle that stands out as a solid value.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GM0ALVU/brbggearcyclingroadbikesaddle-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Prologo-Dimension-Space-1.jpeg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1199\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Prologo-Dimension-Space-1.jpeg\" alt=\"The Prologo Dimension Space road bike saddle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Prologo-Dimension-Space-1.jpeg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Prologo-Dimension-Space-1-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Prologo-Dimension-Space-1-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Prologo-Dimension-Space-1-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Prologo-Dimension-Space-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Prologo-Dimension-Space-1-1536x1023.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Prologo-Dimension-Space-1-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The Prologo Dimension Space saddle delivers comfort and performance at a reasonable price.

We tested the top-of-the-line “00” model with a carbon fiber base and rails, which results in it being quite a bit lighter than the Specialized with its Titanium rails. Fizik also makes the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbikesaddle&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Ffi-zik-vento-argo-r1-adaptive-saddle\">R1 version of this saddle</a> that retails for $300.</p><p></p><p>To create this saddle, Fizik partnered with a company called Carbon, which offers a “revolutionary Digital Light Synthesis technology. DLS is an additive manufacturing process which uses digital ultraviolet light projection, oxygen permeable optics, and programmable liquid resins to produce parts with excellent mechanical properties, resolution, and surface finish,” according to Fizik. In plain English, the upper is 3-D printed, and this allows the density and therefore the feel of each zone of the saddle to be tuned based on the part of your anatomy with which it will be in contact. </p><p></p><p>Fizik saddles have traditionally been a bit polarizing and difficult to pin down. More recently, however, Fizik appears to be embracing modern trends in saddle design, and doing it very well indeed, as evidenced by both Vento Argo models we tested. </p><p></p><p>That said, the profile of the Vento Argo 00 Adaptive is aimed at riders who ride hard and it is quite firm in comparison to the Power Pro Mirror, for example. Many riders will likely prefer this feeling, as it will be more familiar and possibly more stable over the first few rides than will the Power Pro Mirror, which has a startling amount of suspension built into its 3-D printed upper.</p><p></p><p>Due to its flat fore-aft profile, the Vento Argo 00 Adaptive makes it easy to change positions in different situations. Shifting weight back while climbing or rolling forward into an aggressive tuck on descents is easy and it remains comfortable regardless of the riding position. The carbon fiber shell and base give the saddle a ride quality that not all similarly constructed saddles in this test were able to match. The low-frequency buzz of weathered pavement was simply absent when riding this saddle. At the same time, the stiffness of the Vento Argo 00 lent itself better to shorter, high-intensity rides, whereas the more suspended feel of the Specialized Power Mirror was preferred on longer endurance rides.</p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://jenson.sjv.io/c/2227671/989438/13009?subId1=brbggearcyclingroadbikesaddle&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FFizik-Vento-Argo-00-Adaptive-Saddle%3FqueryID%3Ddd5a2c0da474ad01dbfafad7a5dde399\">Fizik Vento Argo 00 Adaptive</a> is not inexpensive at the retail price of $400, nor is it exceptionally lightweight. The appeal of this saddle is that it offers a firm ride in a 3-D printed construction, with a nice ride quality thanks to its carbon base and rails. If the flat profile suits your preferences, or you tend to move around to different zones of the saddle on climbs, flats, and descents, then this is a 3-D printed saddle to check out. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://jenson.sjv.io/c/2227671/989438/13009?subId1=brbggearcyclingroadbikesaddle&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FFizik-Vento-Argo-00-Adaptive-Saddle%3FqueryID%3Ddd5a2c0da474ad01dbfafad7a5dde399\">Check Price at Jenson USA</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C58XH4D1/brbggearcyclingroadbikesaddle-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fizik-Vento-Argo-00-Adaptive-1.jpeg\"><img width=\"1893\" height=\"1262\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fizik-Vento-Argo-00-Adaptive-1.jpeg\" alt=\"Detail view of the Fizik Vento Argo 00 Adaptive road bike saddle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fizik-Vento-Argo-00-Adaptive-1.jpeg 1893w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fizik-Vento-Argo-00-Adaptive-1-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fizik-Vento-Argo-00-Adaptive-1-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fizik-Vento-Argo-00-Adaptive-1-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fizik-Vento-Argo-00-Adaptive-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fizik-Vento-Argo-00-Adaptive-1-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fizik-Vento-Argo-00-Adaptive-1-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The Fizik Vento Argo 00 Adaptive is an elegant saddle that features a carbon fiber base and rails topped with a 3D-printed upper.

The use of vulcanized natural rubber in the Cambium C15 Carved virtually eliminates the break-in period that is associated with Brooks’ leather models. Further increasing the comfort of the C15 is a “carved” cutout in the top of the saddle. It’s important to note that since the C15 has a traditional, rounded profile, the cutout is not as noticeable in its ability to relieve pressure as some saddles with a more contemporary shape, like the Specialized Power models, for instance. Regardless of the cutout, once properly positioned, the C15 is a luxurious and supportive saddle.</p><p></p><p>The Cambium C15 is covered in a vulcanized natural rubber top that repels water and provides a nice amount of texture, helping to keep your bib shorts securely located in the perfect pedaling position. The C15 has a timeless aesthetic that will look at home on bikes from any era, thanks to its classic lines and modern, dark color scheme. Tubular stainless steel rails connect at a fiberglass plate in the rear of the saddle, where you’ll find a handsome Brooks logo as well as loops for mounting saddlebags or lights.</p><p></p><p>The construction of Cambium is intended to mimic that of Brooks’ leather models by providing shock absorption and a “hammock” type of comfort as it cradles your body weight. While the break-in period is nowhere near as long as the traditional leather, it was about halfway through the first 30-mile test ride that a little initial firmness started to yield and the comfort of the flexible top and shell really began to shine. Taking the C15 out on longer and longer rides only left us more impressed with its long-distance comfort. The C15 also gives very clear feedback on whether it’s positioned optimally, or not, and was intuitive to adjust until perfectly comfortable. </p><p></p><p>Do note that at 435 grams, the C15 is one of the lightest saddles Brooks has ever made, but still double the weight of most racing saddles. For context, 200 grams is about the weight of a half-full water bottle, and certainly worth adding to your bike if the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075HGJ135/brbggearcyclingroadbikesaddle-20\">Cambium C15 Carved</a> keeps you comfortable hour after hour on your biggest cycling adventures. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075HGJ135/brbggearcyclingroadbikesaddle-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Brooks-Cambium-C15-Carved-1.jpeg\"><img width=\"1520\" height=\"1013\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Brooks-Cambium-C15-Carved-1.jpeg\" alt=\"The Brooks Cambium C15 Carved road bike saddle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Brooks-Cambium-C15-Carved-1.jpeg 1520w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Brooks-Cambium-C15-Carved-1-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Brooks-Cambium-C15-Carved-1-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Brooks-Cambium-C15-Carved-1-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Brooks-Cambium-C15-Carved-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Brooks-Cambium-C15-Carved-1-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Brooks saddles are renowned for their impressive comfort, and the Cambium C15 Carved continues that trend.

The Stealth line of saddles is one of PRO’s great success stories and was one of the first road saddles to adopt a short-nose, wide cutout design, intended for aggressive positions on the bike. </p><p></p><p>As the name suggests, the <a href=\"https://jenson.sjv.io/c/2227671/989438/13009?subId1=brbggearcyclingroadbikesaddle&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2Fpro-stealth-carbon-rail-saddle%3F_br_psugg_q%3Dpro%2Bstealth\">PRO Stealth Team</a> coordinates well with the “dark side” aesthetics of modern race bikes, with a gloss black on matte black cover that puts off Stealth fighter jet vibes. It’s also impressively lightweight at just 167g in the 142mm width, thanks to its carbon fiber-reinforced polymer base and carbon rails. Sure, there are some lighter saddles on the market, but compared to other saddles with carbon fiber rails, we found the Stealth team retained a nice amount of compliance, never feeling buzzy or overly stiff on rough pavement.  </p><p></p><p>In our experience, the PRO Stealth Team needs to be nosed down substantially for maximum comfort, to the point where it looks a bit funny on the bike. Looks aside, this nose-down position ensures excellent pelvic and low-back support, without the feeling of sliding forward, even when riding in the most extreme aero positions. And, in those aggressive positions, we found it to be remarkably comfortable, whether using the UCI-banned “puppy paws” position, deep in the drops, or with elbows well-bent and hands tucked behind the brake hoods. This is possible thanks in large part to the generous cutout that extends well into the nose of the saddle. On a test bike that has considerable saddle-to-bar drop, the comfort was apparent once it was adjusted correctly in the nosed-down position. </p><p></p><p>If you are looking for a saddle that will allow you to ride comfortably in an aerodynamic position for extended periods, and want to save some grams, check out the <a href=\"https://jenson.sjv.io/c/2227671/989438/13009?subId1=brbggearcyclingroadbikesaddle&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2Fpro-stealth-carbon-rail-saddle%3F_br_psugg_q%3Dpro%2Bstealth\">PRO Stealth Team</a>.

The Verse does its job well, but quietly and without any surprises. Bontrager got the simple things right and that can’t always be said for saddles costing far more. </p><p></p><p>The Verse Comp is firm but averts any obvious pressure points or harshness on rough roads. A generous central cutout relieves pressure on soft tissues and aids ventilation. The border of the cutout is nicely rounded so that it transitions into the top of the saddle upper without creating any pressure ridges. Overall, the Verse Comp’s profile is well done, offering both fore/aft and lateral stability. There is no risk taken in the profile of the Verse Comp, and we’d expect that most people would at least find this saddle comfortable, if not perfect for their individual anatomy and bike fit. It also comes in 4 widths in 10mm increments between 135mm and 165mm, so virtually everyone should be able to get the right fit.</p><p></p><p>The cover is dimpled in the rear to help riders stay planted in a powerful position. Branding on the cover, and rails, is minimal and almost invisible, allowing it to blend in nicely on just about any bike. The Verse comp is somewhat heavy at 312g with the Blendr mount. The difference of 140 grams between the Verse Comp and the $350 Trek RSL is approximately half a bottle of water saves you $250.

With Ki:um metal rails, a polyurethane base, and EVA foam upper, it’s the more straightforward of the two Fizik saddles we had on test. At $160, it’s also less than half the cost of its 3-D printed sibling, the Vento Argo 00 Adaptive, and factoring in how well it performs, the Vento Argo R3 is a great value. </p><p></p><p>Short-nosed saddles with cutouts are popular because they promote a more powerful forward-hinged pelvis position while relieving pressure on soft tissues that traditional saddles tend to hammer. The intended result is for riders to be able to ride in the drops, or with more elbow bend, and a flatter torso, for longer periods of time. However, in addition to this, the shape just seems to work well for many people. So much so, that lots of new saddles have adopted this shape. </p><p></p><p>At just $160, the Argo Vento R3 has excellent build quality. There are no rough edges or overlooked details anywhere. The branding is also minimal and everything is black, helping this saddle coordinate with the aesthetics of today’s road bikes. The rear portion of the saddle is swept slightly upward, which offers enhanced tailbone support, and helps the pelvis and lower back remain more stable, which feels great when climbing in the saddle. The cutout is massive and very accommodating when riding in the drops. The shape and overall support feel very well suited to its “performance racing saddle” intentions for riding in more aggressive positions. </p><p></p><p>Our only real complaint about the Vento Argo R3 is that on longer rides, the edges of the cutout became more noticeable and presented as ridges of pressure. It’s possible that these ridges may flatten over time, but we feel it is worth noting nonetheless. And, of course, saddle comfort is personal and very subjective, so this may not be an issue at all for other riders. </p><p></p><p>Regardless, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbikesaddle&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Ffi-zik-argo-vento-r3-saddle\">Fizik Vento Argo R3</a> is a reasonably priced short-nosed racing saddle that comes in 140mm and 150mm widths. It is offered in several versions with different rail materials, weights, and price points. And, thankfully, Fizik does offer a comfort guarantee, which makes it easier to try out their saddles to see if it works for you.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbikesaddle&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Ffi-zik-argo-vento-r3-saddle\">Check Price at Competitive Cyclist</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Z1VQHZV/brbggearcyclingroadbikesaddle-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WQPFGJH/brbggearcyclingroadbikesaddle-20\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPrologo Scratch M5 Space\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MRSP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$139</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Measured Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>230g (TiRox alloy rails)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Width Options</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>147mm (Space), 140mm (PAS)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Width Tested</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>147mm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Length</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>250mm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Carbon reinforced polymer, EVA foam, TiRox alloy rails</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Rails</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>TiRox alloy 7x7mm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WQPFGJH/brbggearcyclingroadbikesaddle-20\">\n\n<img width=\"1122\" height=\"748\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Prologo-Scratch-M5-Space.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Road Bike Saddles of 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Prologo-Scratch-M5-Space.jpeg 1122w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Prologo-Scratch-M5-Space-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Prologo-Scratch-M5-Space-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Prologo-Scratch-M5-Space-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Prologo-Scratch-M5-Space-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Prologo-Scratch-M5-Space-720x480.jpeg 720w\" />\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Great support and comfort in aero riding positions</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Looks great on a race bike</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Heavier weight</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WQPFGJH/brbggearcyclingroadbikesaddle-20\">Prologo Scratch M5 Space</a> adopts the popular trend that began with the Specialized Power saddle, combining a short nose with a large cutout, dubbed “PAS” or Perenial Area System by Prologo. These two features encourage riders to hinge forward more with the pelvis to achieve a more sustainable aerodynamic position. The Scratch M5 Space delivers on this objective while also offering a nice degree of cushioning. Soft enough to take the edge of less-than-ideal roads, but firm enough to provide a stable base for seated climbing and seated efforts at high speed. </p><p></p><p>The Scratch M5 is beautifully constructed, with a seamless bonding of the EVA foam upper to a glossy fiberglass base. The TiRox rails are polished which lends a bit of bling to the otherwise stealthy appearance. The “Space” designation applied to this saddle simply means that it is wider at 147mm and has a slightly softer padding. While increased width along with added squish may not always work in concert, Prologo manages to balance them very well here. The Scratch M5 is also offered in the <em>PAS</em> version which is 140m wide. </p><p></p><p>Throughout testing, the Scratch M5 Space provided excellent pelvic stability, both laterally and fore/aft. The lateral stability can easily be attributed to the saddle simply having sufficient width even though 147mm may not qualify as “wide” these days. In terms of fore/aft stability, there are a couple of smart features added to the foam cover of the Scratch M5 Space that may be to thank. First, the rear portion of the saddle has a nice bit of texture added, to help keep the pad of the bib shorts anchored in place. Additionally, the Scratch M5 Space is segmented into three parts, a design Prologo termed MSS, or Multi-Sector System. Designed in collaboration with the Polytechnic of Milan, MSS encompasses 5 separate zones of foam that combine to accommodate the normal pedaling movement in both the pushing and pulling phases. This is key to helping keep the pelvis from sliding forward during the pedal stroke. Not only does the foam density vary, but the saddle cover is also segmented into thirds, with narrow but deep channels running laterally across the saddle to delineate each zone. </p><p></p><p>With a solid all-around performance, impressive stability, and a reasonable price-to-weight ratio, there isn’t much to criticize about the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WQPFGJH/brbggearcyclingroadbikesaddle-20\">Scratch M5 Space</a>. If this saddle fits you well, the Scratch M5 Space can deliver the promised comfort and efficiency gains of a short-nose saddle to many riders and racers.

The RSL features are a short nose to encourage anterior pelvic tilt and a powerful, aerodynamic riding position, while a large cutout offers pressure relief to soft tissues, which tend to get beat up by more traditional saddles.</p><p></p><p>Designed in cooperation with Lidl-Trek athletes, the new RSL (Race Shop Limited) is a firm saddle designed to meet the demands of professional racers. The padding is minimal and relatively firm, supporting powerful pedal strokes without deforming or compressing. At the same time, the carbon base takes the edge of rough roads and never feels buzzy or harsh. It comes in 3 widths, 135mm, 145mm, and 155mm, so you can be sure to get the size that best suits your sit bones and the side-to-side profile is fairly flat.</p><p></p><p>The RSL also features the Blendr accessory mount which can hold the Bontrager Flare tail light, saddle bag, and even a small fender (called the Blendr Fendr) that prevents the rooster tail of filthy road water from hitting your tailbone. The mount is easily removable when not needed. This type of optional integration for accessories is something I wish were incorporated into more saddles. </p><p></p><p>The branding on the RSL is minimal and everything is black, which allows it to fit into the aesthetics of many high-end race bikes on the road today, and not just Treks. There are no markings at all on the carbon fiber rails, so folks who like to know the exact measurements of everything related to the saddle may need to make some DIY markings with a permanent marker. </p><p></p><p>If you’re looking for a lightweight, race-ready saddle with minimal branding, and the option to integrate a taillight or other accessories, check out the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=15585&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbikesaddle&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trekbikes.com%2Fus%2Fen_US%2Fequipment%2Fcycling-components%2Fbike-saddles%2Fperformance-bike-saddles%2Ftrek-rsl-bike-saddle%2Fp%2F42257%2F%3FcolorCode%3Dblack\">Trek RSL Bike Saddle</a>.

The basic premise of many Selle SMP saddles is that the pronounced curvature traces the curvature of the bottom of the human pelvis, and hopefully spreads pressure more evenly across the pelvic bone and surrounding tissue. Combining this unique shape with a massive cutout for perineal relief, the SMP range has a small but devout following of road cyclists and time trialists. The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbikesaddle&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fselle-smp-dynamic\">Selle SMP Dynamic</a> is one of the brand’s more popular models – a minimally padded, highly curved saddle meant for aggressive riding and racing.</p><p></p><p>While Selle SMP’s overall shaping and abundant branding might not suit everyone’s taste, it’s impossible to deny when holding the saddle that the construction quality is world-class. These saddles are hand stitched in Italy, using a leather cover in the case of our test saddle (colorful covers are microfiber). The base is carbon-reinforced nylon and the padding is a foamed elastomer. The rails are Titanium and continue around the back of the saddle, where they are adorned with a ribbon reminding you that the saddle is made in Italia. Three separate quality control stickers are visible in this area, along with more Italian-themed branding. </p><p></p><p>Examining the Dynamic further, it is immediately noticeable how firm it is. It has just a thin layer of padding and relies more on its shape to provide comfort than cushioning. It’s also worth noting that Selle SMP advertises the Dynamic as being “designed for medium-large pelvises”, though at 138mm wide, it’s relatively narrow by today’s standards. Setup and particularly saddle angle are critical to optimize comfort on a saddle of this shape, and it can be a trial-and-error process to get there. Keeping a hex tool handy in your jersey pocket is recommended while you dial it in on the first couple of rides. </p><p></p><p>On steady sections riding tempo or threshold, the SMP Dynamic’s hold on the pelvis is very apparent and felt the most comfortable. The cradled shape keeps you in the sweet spot and the generous cutout keeps the pressure off the sensitive bits. Backing off the wattage and putting more weight onto the saddle, however, the Dynamic became less comfortable due to the fact that it was a little too narrow for our tester. The locked-in feel also presented itself in other ways, as this saddle doesn’t allow for much body movement. Surprisingly, where this sensation was the most foreign and distracting was on twisting descents, where maneuvering the bike through turns with the hips was more challenging than with less shapely saddles.  </p><p></p><p>Still, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbikesaddle&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fselle-smp-dynamic\">Selle SMP Dynamic </a>has a cult following for a reason. If you have been unable to find comfort from the most popular saddles from the bigger brands, don’t mind the heavily branded aesthetics, and have narrower sit bones, the Dynamic might be the answer. Selle SMP also makes a huge range of saddles in varying widths, shapes, and profiles, so there are plenty of other options to fit your body and many fitters have Selle SMP test kits available, so you might be able to try one out before you commit.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbikesaddle&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fselle-smp-dynamic\">Check Price at Competitive Cyclist</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006L2XOEK/brbggearcyclingroadbikesaddle-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbikesaddle&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fselle-italia-slr-ti316-superflow-saddle\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSelle Italia SLR Boost TI 316 Superflow\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MRSP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$319.90</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Measured Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>168g</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Width Options</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>130mm, 145mm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Width Tested</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>145mm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Length</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>248mm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Materials</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>EVA foam upper, Fibra Tek cover, Ti rails, Nylon Shell</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Rails</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>TI 316, 7x7mm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbikesaddle&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fselle-italia-slr-ti316-superflow-saddle\">\n\n<img width=\"1032\" height=\"688\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Selle-Italia-SLR-Boost-TI-316-Superflow.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Road Bike Saddles of 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Selle-Italia-SLR-Boost-TI-316-Superflow.jpeg 1032w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Selle-Italia-SLR-Boost-TI-316-Superflow-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Selle-Italia-SLR-Boost-TI-316-Superflow-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Selle-Italia-SLR-Boost-TI-316-Superflow-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Selle-Italia-SLR-Boost-TI-316-Superflow-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Selle-Italia-SLR-Boost-TI-316-Superflow-720x480.jpeg 720w\" />\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Light with metallic rails</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Excellent build quality</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Requires perfect setup</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Hard to find the sweet spot</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Expensive</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>Selle Italia has a long history of making quality saddles for all types of cycling, many of which have particularly long and confusing model names like the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbikesaddle&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fselle-italia-slr-ti316-superflow-saddle\">Selle Italia SLR Boost TI316 Superflow</a>. At 168g, this is a lightweight, short-length, cutout saddle from a company that is aimed at helping riders get comfortable in an aggressive riding position. </p><p></p><p>While impressive that a saddle this lightweight has metal rails, we found comfort to be lacking and difficulty in finding the sweet spot. Unlike many contemporary short-nose cutout saddles, the SLR Boost Superflow TI316 has a more restrictive feel, requiring the perfect setup, and even then, having some unwanted pressure points. While quite large and pronounced, the Superflow cutout didn’t exactly deliver on the promise of perineal relief when the pelvis is tilted forward. Instead, this saddle’s shape resulted in steady pressure from both the nose and tail of the saddle simultaneously.   </p><p></p><p>That said, saddle comfort is subjective and if the shape of the SLR Boost TI316 matches up well with your anatomy, we imagine it can be a comfortable saddle. However, compared against its short-nosed, cutout competition in this test group, we found it to be a little harder to get along with. </p><p></p><p>The SLR is also an expensive saddle at $319.90 US, although it has a build quality to match the price tag. The cover joins the base seamlessly for a refined, clean appearance, and the matte finish of the TI 316 rails looks industrial but elegant. </p><p></p><p>If you can get a test saddle to try, and like the feel, The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbikesaddle&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fselle-italia-slr-ti316-superflow-saddle\">SLR Boost TI 316 Superflow</a> is a great option, because it saves a significant amount of weight while preserving durability and seatpost compatibility by using 7x7mm round TI 316 rails.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbikesaddle&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fselle-italia-slr-ti316-superflow-saddle\">Check Price at Competitive Cyclist</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VD7991G/brbggearcyclingroadbikesaddle-20\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFabric Scoop Elite\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MRSP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$80</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Measured Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>263g</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Width Options</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>142mm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Width Tested</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>142mm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Length</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>282mm</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Materials</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Nylon, EVA foam, waterproof cover</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Rails</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Chromoly</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VD7991G/brbggearcyclingroadbikesaddle-20\">\n\n<img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fabric-Scoop-Elite-Shallow.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Road Bike Saddles of 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fabric-Scoop-Elite-Shallow.jpeg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fabric-Scoop-Elite-Shallow-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fabric-Scoop-Elite-Shallow-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fabric-Scoop-Elite-Shallow-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fabric-Scoop-Elite-Shallow-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fabric-Scoop-Elite-Shallow-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Fabric-Scoop-Elite-Shallow-720x480.jpeg 720w\" />\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Classy aesthetics</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Easy to Clean</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Good support in more upright riding positions</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Very reasonable price</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Poor finish quality on rails</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>No cutout</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Only available in one narrow-ish width</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VD7991G/brbggearcyclingroadbikesaddle-20\">Fabric Scoop Elite Shallow</a> saddle is elegantly designed, traditionally shaped, and easy to clean, thanks to a smooth, nylon base that is bonded seamlessly to the EVA foam upper. Graphics are minimal and overall the saddle has a pleasing aesthetic. Our test saddle’s base was colored bright red (it comes in red, green, white, and black), so you can add a splash of color to your bike or keep it stealthy if you choose.</p><p></p><p>Installation and adjustment are very straightforward, thanks to 7x7mm round steel rails with 75mm of adjustment fore-aft. Since the Scoop has no cutout, do confirm that your seatpost can accept this saddle. So prevalent are cutouts on today’s saddles, that some seatpost designs will only accept a saddle with one, as one of the tightening bolts is accessed from above, through the cutout.</p><p></p><p>The shape of the Scoop Elite Shallow is a throwback to more traditional saddles, with a “shallow” cradle and a slight rise towards the nose. Fabric makes their saddle in three profiles, with the <em>Shallow</em> versions intended for more neutral riding positions. This lines up with our experience, as it didn’t feel great in more aggressive aero positions, either in the drops or with bent elbows and hands on the hoods. It was, however quite comfortable whilst climbing or in less aggressive positions like riding from the hoods or bar top. This comfort is achieved thanks to a pressure relief channel that is cut out of the tail end of the saddle, which gives space to the tailbone when sat in a more upright position. The <em>Flat</em> profile is intended for more aggressive riding positions, while the <em>Radius</em> is intended for more upright riding.</p><p></p><p>The Scoop Elite Shallow (and the Flat and Radius profiles) is only available in one width, which is 142mm. While that should work for a large portion of riders, we found it to be a bit narrow, though that’s entirely subjective and will depend on your sit bone width. Fabric does make several other saddles, including the Line-S model which comes in a 155mm width.</p><p></p><p>At $80, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VD7991G/brbggearcyclingroadbikesaddle-20\">Fabric Scoop Elite Shallow</a> is a solid platform for riding shorter distances in a more relaxed position that comes at a reasonable price.

The seamless cover is glued around the edges, giving it a very clean and streamlined look. While no issues with the edges peeling developed during my short test period of the Prevail TT, adhesives tend to wear down on things that are exposed to a lot of flex and lots of weather, so durability could be a potential issue in the long term. </p><p></p><p>Aside from some basic specs and a list price, there is very little information available about the Prevaill TT saddle either on the Velo website or elsewhere. Turns out, Velo has created a very nice profile and combined it with just the right amount of density to be super comfortable in any riding position. While there is no full cutout, there is a deep channel running through the Prevail TT that provides pressure relief to soft tissues, both aiding in comfort and avoiding potential negative consequences of spending a lot of hours in the saddle. </p><p></p><p>It’s not a particularly sexy saddle, compared to other options in this test group, but then again, nobody can see your saddle while you’re sitting on it, riding.

decade, the team at Bikerumor has been reporting on the latest cycling news, technologies, and products. Our crew of passionate cyclists spends lots of time on the bike, whether testing new bikes, components, accessories, or apparel, training for the next race, or riding just for the fun of it. All that time spent in the saddle has taught us the importance of having the right tools for the job, and particularly finding the right saddle so we can be comfortable for hours on end. We also know just how tough it can be to find the perfect one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For our road bike saddle buyer’s guide, we tapped frequent Bikerumor contributor, Bennett Shane, to test and compare the 13 models included in this review. Bennett has been road cycling for over two decades and in that time has spanned the spectrum of riding disciplines. Though he hasn’t lined up for a race in a few years, he spent quite a bit of time rubbing elbows in crits and pelotons. These days he prefers to put in big miles on epic rides throughout the Pacific Northwest not far from his home base near Portland, OR. On top of his cycling experience, Bennett spent years working in the cycling industry for several prominent brands. This experience has given him unique insight into the product lifecycle as well as the design, materials, and construction of products spanning from apparel to components. When considered together, his experience in the industry and as a rider/consumer gives him an understanding of products from the inside out, and he has developed a keen ability to discern the performance differences in the products he tests. This year alone, Bennett has applied his testing expertise to several other categories including <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-road-bike-helmets/\">protective cycling helmets</a>, the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-road-bike-shoes/\">best road bike shoes</a>, and <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-cycling-bib-shorts/\">cycling bib shorts</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After researching the best and most popular road bike saddles on the market, we rounded up 13 models for side-by-side testing and comparison. After weighing each model for comparison to the manufacturer’s specs, they were mounted up on Bennett’s small fleet of boutique road bikes and taken for numerous rides to get a feel for their shape, comfort, padding, anatomical relief, and most importantly, how they stack up against each other. After a couple thousand miles of testing, we honed in our favorite models and those that excel in specific ways compared to the rest. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-bike-saddle-weight.jpeg\"><img width=\"2048\" height=\"1365\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-bike-saddle-weight.jpeg\" alt=\"Weighing the Prologo Scratch M5 Space road bike saddle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-bike-saddle-weight.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-bike-saddle-weight-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-bike-saddle-weight-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-bike-saddle-weight-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-bike-saddle-weight-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-bike-saddle-weight-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-bike-saddle-weight-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>In addition to testing them all in the real world, we weighed all the saddles for consistency and comparison to the manufacturer’s specs.

With so many models, sizes, materials, and designs to choose from, finding the right saddle isn’t the most straightforward thing in the world. There’s a lot to consider when choosing a new saddle, so here we break down the most important factors to help you make a more informed purchase decision. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What Type of Riding do You do?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The type of riding you do, and most importantly, your body position while riding, plays a major role in the saddle that will work best for you. Racers and aggressive riders tend to lean forward more which results in more forward pelvic rotation. Often, riders in these powerful positions tend to prefer saddles with short lengths, flat side-to-side profiles, flat tip-to-tail profiles, and effective anatomical relief in the form of a cutout or channel. Riders who ride more casually or simply prefer a more relaxed body position for endurance riding may benefit from a somewhat rounded side-to-side profile and a slightly cradled tip-to-tail profile that provides more support. That said, there are no hard and fast rules, and the saddle that works best for you is the one that fits you well and provides long-term comfort.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-bike-saddle-riding-style-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-bike-saddle-riding-style-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Review author Bennet Shane road biking action shot\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-bike-saddle-riding-style-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-bike-saddle-riding-style-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-bike-saddle-riding-style-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-bike-saddle-riding-style-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-bike-saddle-riding-style-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-bike-saddle-riding-style-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-bike-saddle-riding-style-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Road-bike-saddle-riding-style-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Finding a road bike saddle that fits your anatomy and suits your riding style and body position is critical for long-term comfort. (photo: Ben Guernsey)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Width and Sizing</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Our bodies are all different, so finding the correct saddle width to suit your anatomy is one of the most important things you can do for comfort. Many people don’t realize that road bike saddles come in varying widths to accommodate different-sized and shaped bodies to get an ideal fit. The distance between our sit bones in particular is very important to consider as that is where the majority of our weight rests while seated. A saddle that is too narrow doesn’t provide enough support for the sit bones and can result in excessive pressure on the perineum or pubic bone arch and sensitive soft tissues. Likewise, a saddle that is too wide can cause discomfort by pushing outward on the hips or digging into your inner thighs and negatively impacting the pedal stroke. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Saddles range in width from around 125mm up to 160mm, generally speaking. Many saddles are offered in several different width options across this spectrum while others are available in only a single width. While many riders associate narrower sizes with reduced friction, an appropriately sized saddle can actually reduce friction and many other issues by promoting greater pelvic stability. Thankfully, you don’t have to guess your ideal saddle width. Most bike shops offer some type of measurement of the sit bones, which will tell you which saddle width is ideal for your anatomy. It is also possible to take this measurement at home, and you can easily find instructions on how to do so online. Many shops also have test saddles so you can try before you buy to make sure it works for you. Several brands also offer comfort guarantees so you can try a saddle risk-free and send it back if it isn’t the right fit.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/road-bike-saddle-cutout.jpeg\"><img width=\"1945\" height=\"1297\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/road-bike-saddle-cutout.jpeg\" alt=\"The large cutout of the Fizik Vento Argo R3 road bike saddle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/road-bike-saddle-cutout.jpeg 1945w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/road-bike-saddle-cutout-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/road-bike-saddle-cutout-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/road-bike-saddle-cutout-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/road-bike-saddle-cutout-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/road-bike-saddle-cutout-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/road-bike-saddle-cutout-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Many road bike saddles, like the Fizik Vento Argo R3 pictured here, feature large cutouts intended to relieve pressure on sensitive parts of your anatomy. (photo: Bennett Shane)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Anatomical Relief</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While road riding, we spend lots of time seated and pedaling with most of our weight resting on and around relatively sensitive parts of our anatomy. Almost every saddle being developed now will feature a central cutout or pressure relief channel of some sort. These cutouts or channels are intended to take pressure off of the perineal area which can help to increase comfort, maintain blood flow, and reduce the chances of numbness, irritation, and other issues that may arise. The idea is pretty simple, but the execution varies greatly from brand to brand and saddle to saddle. Some cutouts feel like little more than decoration, while others deliver legitimate pressure relief hour after hour of riding. Along with a good, well-fitting saddle, a <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-cycling-bib-shorts/\">quality pair of cycling bib shorts</a> is an essential piece of kit that can enhance comfort over the course of your rides. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Side-to-side-profile.jpeg\"><img width=\"2029\" height=\"1353\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Side-to-side-profile.jpeg\" alt=\"The side to side profile of the Trek RSL road bike saddle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Side-to-side-profile.jpeg 2029w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Side-to-side-profile-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Side-to-side-profile-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Side-to-side-profile-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Side-to-side-profile-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Side-to-side-profile-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Side-to-side-profile-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The Trek RSL Saddle is a good example of a relatively flat side-to-side profile. (photo: Bennett Shane)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Saddle Profile: Side to Side</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A saddle’s profile – the shape of the saddle from side to side across its widest part – is a key factor in comfort. Much like the width of a saddle, different profile shapes, typically flat or curved, may work better with people’s unique anatomies and different riding styles. Profiles vary from brand to brand and model to model, and some saddles, like the <a href=\"https://jenson.sjv.io/c/2227671/989438/13009?subId1=brbggearcyclingroadbikesaddle&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2Fpro-stealth-carbon-rail-saddle%3F_br_psugg_q%3Dpro%2Bstealth\">PRO Stealth Team</a>, are even offered in both a regular and a curved version. Traditionally, saddle profiles were more rounded, as it was thought that a gradually curving profile would be more accommodating to the sensitive tissue around the pelvis. While this may still work for some riders, profiles have trended flatter in recent times. Flatter profiles promise to enhance lateral stability of the pelvis, which in turn takes pressure off the lower back, and encourages activation of the gluteal muscles during the pedal stroke. Another important benefit of a flat profile saddle is that it allows for more effective cutout designs. Cutouts in combination with a flat profile remove significant pressure from soft tissue and encourage a more even distribution of pressure across a wider section of the pelvis and surrounding muscles and soft tissue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, it is important to bear in mind that a saddle’s profile can play a role in the effective width and where your sit bones rest on the saddle. A saddle that has a more rounded profile will effectively be narrower than its measured total width, while a flatter profile will be much closer to the actual width.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tip-to-tail-profile.jpeg\"><img width=\"1988\" height=\"1325\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tip-to-tail-profile.jpeg\" alt=\"The tip to tail profile of the Selle SMP Dynamic road bike saddle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tip-to-tail-profile.jpeg 1988w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tip-to-tail-profile-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tip-to-tail-profile-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tip-to-tail-profile-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tip-to-tail-profile-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tip-to-tail-profile-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Tip-to-tail-profile-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Tip-to-tail profiles vary significantly from flat to the heavily cradled shape of the Selle SMP Dynamic. (photo: Bennett Shane)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Saddle Profile: Tip to Tail</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another factor to consider is the profile of a saddle from tip to tail. For the most part, saddles are either fairly flat or they have a slightly cradled shape. In general, a flat tip-to-tail profile is better suited to more aggressive, powerful, or aerodynamic riding positions with more forward pelvic rotation. Racers, powerful riders, and those who tend to move around the saddle typically gravitate towards a saddle with a flat profile. Saddles with a cradled profile typically lend themselves better to more neutral or relaxed body positions with less forward pelvic rotation. If you mostly ride from the hoods or the tops or go on long endurance rides, a saddle with a slightly cradled tip-to-tail profile may be the best option for comfort and support.  An example of a cradled saddle is the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbikesaddle&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fselle-smp-dynamic\">Selle SMP Dynamic</a> which has a relatively dramatic curved shape that locks the rider into the sweet spot for static seated pedaling.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/saddle-rail-material.jpeg\"><img width=\"1875\" height=\"1250\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/saddle-rail-material.jpeg\" alt=\"The carbon fiber saddle rails on the Fizik Vento Argo 00 Adaptive road bike saddle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/saddle-rail-material.jpeg 1875w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/saddle-rail-material-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/saddle-rail-material-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/saddle-rail-material-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/saddle-rail-material-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/saddle-rail-material-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/saddle-rail-material-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The material used in the rails of a road bike saddle is one of the biggest factors in both weight and price. The carbon fiber rails on the Fizik Vento Argo 00 Adaptive are 7 x 9mm and require a compatible seatpost or adapter. (photo: Bennett Shane)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Rail Material</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Saddles are often offered in several versions with one of the main differentiators being the material used for the rails. Rail material plays a large role in overall saddle weight and price with lighter and more exotic materials commanding a higher price. The most common types of rails are steel, Chromoly, titanium, and carbon fiber (in order from heaviest/least expensive to lightest/most expensive). As an example, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VD7991G/brbggearcyclingroadbikesaddle-20\">Fabric Scoop Shallow</a> comes in 5 versions, Sport (steel), Elite (Chromoly), Race (titanium), Pro (carbon fiber), and Ultimate (carbon rails and base). Not only do the different versions range in price from $42 (Sport) up to $285 (Ultimate), but the weights follow suit at 338 grams down to 162 grams, respectively, with the other versions falling in between those extremes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another factor to consider with rail materials is their size. Most metal rails are round and have standard 7 x 7mm dimensions that will work on virtually any seatpost. Carbon fiber rails allow saddles to cut upwards of 100 grams of weight but usually have 7 x 9mm rails. Carbon fiber rails may not be compatible with all seatpost clamps, or you may need to get a special adapter to make them fit. If purchasing a saddle with carbon fiber rails, we recommend making sure that your seatpost is compatible. Carbon rails can also make saddles feel stiffer, which may or may not be desirable. Titanium rails achieve decent weight savings compared to chromoly or steel rails, will work on virtually any seatpost, and tend to give the saddle a bit more forgiving feel than carbon fiber rails.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/3d-printed-road-bike-saddle-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/3d-printed-road-bike-saddle-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"The 3D-printed Specialized Power Pro with Mirror road bike saddle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/3d-printed-road-bike-saddle-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/3d-printed-road-bike-saddle-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/3d-printed-road-bike-saddle-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/3d-printed-road-bike-saddle-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/3d-printed-road-bike-saddle-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/3d-printed-road-bike-saddle-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/3d-printed-road-bike-saddle-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/3d-printed-road-bike-saddle-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>3D-printed saddles are relatively new to the market and allow manufacturers to create interesting new designs and cushioning.

(photo: Bennett Shane)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>3D Printing</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>3D printed saddles represent a significant step forward in saddle technology, by shifting away from traditional design which sandwiches foam between a plastic or carbon fiber base and a synthetic cover. Instead of bonding several layers, 3D-printed saddles are made of a latticework of liquid polymer that flexes precisely to the shape and movement of each rider’s unique anatomy and pedaling motion. Not surprisingly, two 3D-printed saddles received top honors among our test group, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbikesaddle&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fspecialized-power-pro-with-mirror-saddle\">Specialized Power Pro with Mirror</a> and the <a href=\"https://jenson.sjv.io/c/2227671/989438/13009?subId1=brbggearcyclingroadbikesaddle&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.jensonusa.com%2FFizik-Vento-Argo-00-Adaptive-Saddle%3FqueryID%3Ddd5a2c0da474ad01dbfafad7a5dde399\">Fizik Vento Argo 00 Adaptive</a>. 3D-printed saddles are examples of true innovation in the cycling industry, and while they are more expensive, we feel they are worth the investment. In addition to the two models we tested, there are a number of other 3D-printed models from Specialized, Fizik, Selle Italia, and others.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Saddle-adjustments.jpeg\"><img width=\"1883\" height=\"1255\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Saddle-adjustments.jpeg\" alt=\"A side view of the Bontrager Verse Comp road bike saddle that shows the adjustment markings on the rails\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Saddle-adjustments.jpeg 1883w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Saddle-adjustments-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Saddle-adjustments-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Saddle-adjustments-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Saddle-adjustments-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Saddle-adjustments-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Saddle-adjustments-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>There are several ways to adjust your saddle to optimize its comfort including sliding it fore and aft on the rails, angling the nose up and down, and, of course, setting it at the right height. (photo Bennett Shane)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Adjusting Your Saddle</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Some fine-tuning of saddle position is almost always necessary to achieve the proper position and optimize comfort for your anatomy and riding style. Adjustments include tilting the nose up and down, sliding the saddle fore and aft (within the adjustment range of the rails), and adjusting the height by telescoping the seatpost in the bike frame. A great place to start is with the saddle clamped in the middle of its rails, and perfectly level, then make adjustments as needed. You can use a spirit level or eyeball it with a ruler. Keep in mind that not all saddles have the same amount of stack (the vertical distance between the rails and the top of the saddle), so if you change saddles, you may also need to adjust the saddle height slightly. If you’re unsure of how to adjust your bike saddle, a professional bike fit can be a great way to dial everything in on your ride. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Women’s Saddles</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>All of the saddles we tested are unisex and are used by both male and female riders. There are a number of women-specific saddles on the market, however, that are designed to work better for female riders. While many female riders get along fine with the dimensions, shapes, and profiles of unisex saddles, some ladies may benefit from a women-specific model. While they look essentially the same as unisex models, many women-specific saddles are offered in wider widths to accommodate wider sit bones and some may also have larger cutouts to enhance comfort for the female anatomy. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Prologo-Dimension-Space-value.jpeg\"><img width=\"1980\" height=\"1320\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Prologo-Dimension-Space-value.jpeg\" alt=\"The Prologo Dimension Space road bike saddle is a good value\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Prologo-Dimension-Space-value.jpeg 1980w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Prologo-Dimension-Space-value-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Prologo-Dimension-Space-value-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Prologo-Dimension-Space-value-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Prologo-Dimension-Space-value-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Prologo-Dimension-Space-value-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Prologo-Dimension-Space-value-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Sure, you can spend $400 or more on a road bike saddle, but realistically, something like the $139 Prologo Dimension Space will serve most riders just as well. (photo: Bennett Shane)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Price</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The cost of road bike saddles varies wildly from less than $50 all the way up to $400 or more. Spending top dollar on a saddle typically gets you fancier materials like carbon fiber, more advanced construction methods like 3D printing, and typically a significant reduction in weight compared to the least expensive options. In the grand scheme of things, the weight penalty of less expensive saddles isn’t that significant, and often they are just as comfortable as more expensive versions. A good example is the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GM0ALVU/brbggearcyclingroadbikesaddle-20\">Prologo Dimension Space</a>, which at $139 is 1/3 the price of the $400 Fizik Vento Argo 00 Adaptive. The Prologo Dimension weighs only about 40 grams more, has a great shape, a functional pressure relief cut out, and comes in two widths to suit your needs. Similarly, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=15585&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbggearcyclingroadbikesaddle&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trekbikes.com%2Fus%2Fen_US%2Fequipment%2Fcycling-components%2Fbike-saddles%2Fperformance-bike-saddles%2Fbontrager-verse-comp-bike-saddle%2Fp%2F32222%2F\">Bontrager Verse Comp</a> retails for $100 and provides a nearly identical level of comfort to the $315 Trek RSL, although it weighs 140 grams more. So, unless weight is your highest priority, you don’t need to shell out the big bucks for fanciest models on the market. That said, if you’re willing and able to afford the best of the best, we doubt you’ll be disappointed assuming the fit is right.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Road Bike Saddles</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><div><div><div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>How do I know what size saddle I need?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>When we talk about saddle size, that is mostly related to saddle width. Road bike saddles come in a range of widths, from approximately 125mm to 160mm (give or take). If you already have a saddle that works well for you, it may be as simple as getting one that is roughly the same width. That said, getting your sit bones measured is the best way to zero in on the correct size to suit your anatomy. Most shops have sit bone measurement tools, and often they have test saddles that you can try out. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Which saddle is the most comfortable?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Saddle fit and comfort are highly subjective and depend on many factors. Everyone’s body is different, so the most comfortable saddle for you may be completely different than for someone else. Finding a saddle that is the right width and profile are two of the most important aspects when it comes to comfort. Adjusting it properly will also play a big role. Whenever possible, trying a saddle before you buy is the best way to ensure it will work for you. Or, if buying online, saddles with a comfort guarantee are a low-risk way to find your perfect match.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Why are some road bike saddles so expensive?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>It really all comes down to the materials and construction methods. Saddles with carbon fiber rails, bases, and 3D-printed tops are expensive to produce and therefore cost more than models made with less exotic materials and simpler constructions. Like many things in cycling, spending more also equates to a reduction in weight which may be important to many riders and racers. Assuming you’re okay with carting around 100-150 extra grams, there are plenty of comfortable saddles that are a fraction of the price of the top-of-the-line models. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Do I need a saddle with a cut-out?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Full cutouts or channels are common on most road bike saddles these days. While many people can and do ride saddles without them, most people can benefit from having this feature. Cutouts and channels are designed to keep pressure off the perineum in men or pubic bone arch in women with the goal of enhancing long-term comfort, increasing blood flow, and preventing numbness and pressure-related issues that may arise. This is of particular importance for riders who spend lots of time in more aggressive riding positions with the upper body hinged further forward, as this rotates the pelvis forward and can result in more pressure on sensitive soft tissues. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>How should my saddle be positioned?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Proper saddle positioning is critical for comfort and performance, and dialing it in perfectly is often a process of trial and error. While many people can find comfort with their saddle positioned perfectly flat and in the middle of the rails, others may need to shift the angle, height, and fore-aft position to optimize it for their body or riding style. Saddle height is generally fairly straightforward and is necessary to achieve proper leg extension during the pedal stroke. Sliding the saddle fore and aft on the rails can lengthen and shorten your reach to the handlebar. Adjusting the tilt angle of the saddle can help to optimize its position for the right amount of support for your body position while riding. When in doubt, consulting with a skilled bike fitter is a great option to get your bike dialed in. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>\n\n\n<div><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-cycling-bib-shorts/?sce=post-related-link\"><div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BR-BuyerGuide_Guernsey_DSC08872-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Best cycling bib shorts lead photo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BR-BuyerGuide_Guernsey_DSC08872-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BR-BuyerGuide_Guernsey_DSC08872-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BR-BuyerGuide_Guernsey_DSC08872-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BR-BuyerGuide_Guernsey_DSC08872-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BR-BuyerGuide_Guernsey_DSC08872-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BR-BuyerGuide_Guernsey_DSC08872-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BR-BuyerGuide_Guernsey_DSC08872-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BR-BuyerGuide_Guernsey_DSC08872-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></div><div><h2>The Best Cycling Bib Shorts of 2023</h2><p> <span>Read more…</span></p></div></a></div>\n\n\n<div><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-road-bike-shoes/?sce=post-related-link\"><div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shimano-S-Phyre-RC9-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Shimano S-Phyre RC9 road bike shoe\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shimano-S-Phyre-RC9-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shimano-S-Phyre-RC9-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shimano-S-Phyre-RC9-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shimano-S-Phyre-RC9-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shimano-S-Phyre-RC9-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shimano-S-Phyre-RC9-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shimano-S-Phyre-RC9-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shimano-S-Phyre-RC9-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></div><div><h2>The Best Road Bike Shoes of 2023</h2><p> <span>Read more…</span></p></div></a></div>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-road-bike-saddle/\">The Best Road Bike Saddles of 2023</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Bennett Shane","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"00ae1ff8ae8a0f665dcd113809af8c166cc4ec99b080c7e9db52e6b3ec84c1a5","category":"Cycling"}
