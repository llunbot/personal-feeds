Muc-Off also declined to put a figure to these claims when asked to do so.</p>\n<h2>What’s it made from?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The lube is oil-based.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Muc-Off</i></span></div>\n<p>Muc-Off confirmed Ludicrous AF is oil-based and made from “readily biodegradable ingredients derived from renewable sources”. Unsurprisingly, it declined to reveal the exact formula, saying the precise blend of oils and friction modifiers is “top-secret”.</p>\n<p>The advantage of synthetic oil-based chain lubes is that the application process is very simple. There’s usually no need to remove the packaging grease from the chain prior to application, for example (which is typically required for wax-based lubricants).</p>\n<p>On the flip-side, because they stay wet, oil-based lubricants tend to attract a larger amount of contaminants when used in the real world, which can quickly lead to an increase in friction beyond what would be seen under lab conditions.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Muc-Off says Ludicrous AF offers “unbeatable performance in both wet and damp or dry and dusty conditions at a range of temperatures”.</p>\n<h2>Standing up to scrutiny</h2>\n<p>When any brand launches a new product with claims it beats everything else in existence, it’s perhaps no surprise that those claims will come under scrutiny.</p>\n<p>Muc-Off says Ludicrous AF is the result of years of research and development, and has been subject to extensive testing both in-house and by its sponsored <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/2021-worldtour-bikes/\">WorldTour</a> teams – Ineos Grenadiers and EF Education-Nippo.</p>\n<p>While Muc-Off’s test results show only three competitor lubricants – a small sample size for a lube claimed to be the world’s fastest – the company tells us it “screen-tested over 30 competitor lubes”, but narrowed down the field to concentrate its most rigorous testing on “high performing race lubes that operate within the same space as Ludicrous AF.”</p>\n<p>Muc-Off also says its results have been independently validated by New Motion Labs, a British manufacturer of novel drivetrain parts, who have recently set up a drivetrain efficiency testing rig at the University of Bath, in south-west England.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The lube is claimed to be faster than key competitors, including CeramicSpeed UFO Drip Lube and AbsoluteBLACK’s Graphene lube.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Muc-Off has been searching for top-end (and suitably expensive) gains in its products for a few years now, having launched its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/fastest-chain-in-the-world-muc-off-deploys-nanotech-to-save-you-6-watts/\">NanoTube chain lube</a> back in 2017.</p>\n<p>The pre-treated chain was claimed to offer a power saving of up to 6 watts, but <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/ceramicspeed-disputes-muc-offs-claims-about-ufo-chain/\">CeramicSpeed issued a robust response</a> disputing Muc-Off’s performance claims and criticising its testing protocols.</p>\n<p>As far as Ludicrous AF is concerned, Muc-Off says it has “absolute confidence” in its testing methods and results.</p>","author":"Simon Bromley","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"df1a81ee95875a327f3c37f35b374ebb576c5cbd79b33047aae3cbb1582e40bc","category":"Cycling"}
