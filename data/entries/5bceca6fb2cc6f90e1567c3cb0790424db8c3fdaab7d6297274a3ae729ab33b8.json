The new button automatically generates a similar preview of the post that appears on Instagram.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOutlining the new sharing features in a <a href=\"https://www.redditinc.com/blog/2023socialsharingupdates\">blog post</a>, Reddit also mentions a new \"one-tap screenshot-sharing experience that allows users to share content without saving images to their device â€“ meaning they can link back to the content rather than only sending a screenshot.\" \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/reddit-instagram-imessage.gif\" alt width=\"1850\" height=\"1000\" />\r<br />\nThe new share options are accessible via a new custom share sheet which appears when Reddit app users tap the share icon under a post. The redditor's most used sharing channels are displayed at the top of the sheet to make the sharing process more convenient without having to leave the app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAlongside the update, Reddit says it is also making sharing simpler for publishers by introducing a new toolbox that makes it easier to display Reddit content on their own platforms.
