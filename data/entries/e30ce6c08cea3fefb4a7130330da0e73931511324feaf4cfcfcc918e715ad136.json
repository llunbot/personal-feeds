We just love riding it, and it’s where a lot of our testing and development happens. It’s a local landmark.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Together with friends and business partners Sam Watson and Chris Davis, Lambert creates bikes that are geared towards the trio’s local terrain, making the name an apt one.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/ryden-bikes\">Meet the maker: Darren Ryden of Ryden Bikes</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/sideways-viola-townsend\">Meet the maker: Viola Townsend of Sideways</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/dan-craven-onguza-bicycles\">Meet the maker: Dan Craven of Onguza Bicycles</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>‘There are lots of roads that go up onto the Downs but they just stop at the top and become dirt tracks. Our bikes are perfect for that because you don’t have to stop and turn back. You can just hop onto the bridleway and keep going.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lambert’s love for getting off the beaten track goes back to childhood when he first discovered mountain biking. He recalls lusting after the latest tech and suspension systems that were coming out at the time. And while he has dabbled in smooth surfaces, mixing with traffic on the road has never really agreed with him. So, when the gravel boom first hit, it was a pivotal moment.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"646\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-windover-2-646x970.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Lambert Windover\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-windover-2-646x970.jpg 646w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-windover-2-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-windover-2-768x1154.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-windover-2-1022x1536.jpg 1022w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-windover-2-750x1127.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-windover-2-1140x1713.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-windover-2.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Richard Lambert knows bikes – alongside designing this gravel model he works at his local bike shop, has designed custom frames for Enigma and is a qualified bike-fitter, so he knows geometry too.</figcaption><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘I had a cyclocross bike that I basically rode gravel on before that’s what people called it. It really suited the sort of riding I like to do. I might start on the road but then see a path and think, “Oh, I wonder what’s down there.” When gravel bikes became a thing I really jumped on that. I just want to be able to explore without being limited, so for a good ten years I’ve been doing that sort of riding.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When he’s not riding bikes, Lambert is working with them. He manages a local bike shop alongside his work at Windover – a balancing act that he admits is getting trickier as the brand expands – and he’s a qualified bike-fitter, with experience working in custom frame design at Enigma. That’s where he met Watson and Davis.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"646\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-windover-3-646x970.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Lambert Windover\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-windover-3-646x970.jpg 646w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-windover-3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-windover-3-768x1154.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-windover-3-1022x1536.jpg 1022w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-windover-3-750x1127.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-windover-3-1140x1713.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-windover-3.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘We would be experimenting with stuff and building our own frames – stuff that Enigma wasn’t doing. Enigma wasn’t really bothered about building off-road bikes. It was much more road-focussed. Eventually we all left, and we launched Windover properly last July.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I probably did somewhere close to 1,000 bike-fits at Enigma, including hundreds of custom frames. I’ve got a very strong knowledge of what works, what doesn’t and what fits most people. That’s the idea behind the Bostal.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Horses for courses</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Bostal is Windover’s do-it-all gravel workhorse. It’s born out of the trio’s frustration with the tyre-width limitations imposed by most bikes. If the urge to stuff a 50mm tyre into it hits you, the Bostal will willingly oblige. And that’s without resorting to 650b wheels.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"347\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-970x347.jpg\" alt=\"Subscribe to Cyclist Magazine\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-970x347.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-300x107.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-768x275.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-1536x550.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-750x269.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-1140x408.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4.jpg 1818w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘The other important thing for us was the geometry,’ says Lambert. ‘I often see people riding with the bars too low and not using the drops. Riding off-road is not about aerodynamics but being able to use the drops comfortably to have better braking control. We felt it was important to have a reasonably high stack height. It’s got a steeper seat angle than a lot of gravel bikes too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It leans more towards the mountain bike designs you get these days, so is better for climbing, and it allows a slightly longer front centre as well, so you’ve got a little bit less toe overlap.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to materials, the Bostal is built from Reynolds 853 DZB steel tubing with internal cable routing and a powder-coat paintjob.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-windover-4-970x645.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Lambert Windover\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-windover-4-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-windover-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-windover-4-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-windover-4-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-windover-4-1140x758.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-windover-4-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-windover-4-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-windover-4-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/meet-the-maker-windover-4.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘Wet paint typically gives you a very nice finish, but it lacks durability,’ says Lambert. ‘We always felt it was a shame to have a fancy paintjob and then strap bags to it, scratch it and ruin it. I guess it’s the sort of people we are – we’re just not bothered about it being too showy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The powder-coat paint is super-tough. You can basically drop tools on it and things like that and there’s no danger of it chipping. We just love the practical nature of it. You don’t want to have to worry about leaning a new bike against something and damaging it. It works well for us and it fits the brand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We contemplated adding extra bag mounts and suchlike but the vast majority of people wouldn’t use them, so we decided to keep the Bostal as minimal as possible while still offering the features that most people will want. I think we’ve got the balance right. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Obviously there are lots of similar bikes out there now. We’re not going to try to pretend we’ve reinvented the wheel. We just wanted to build something that was reasonably priced, functional and built in Europe in good working conditions.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>• This article originally appeared in issue 141 of Cyclist magazine. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to subscribe</a></strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/richard-lambert-windover\">Meet the maker: Richard Lambert of Windover</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"e30ce6c08cea3fefb4a7130330da0e73931511324feaf4cfcfcc918e715ad136","category":"Cycling"}
