As such, the regulator said that \"the only effective remedy to this SLC and its adverse consequences is to prohibit the Merger.\"</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6448f377814c66000c8d067f/Microsoft-Activision_FR_Summary.pdf\">final report</a> cites Microsoft's \"strong position\" in the cloud-gaming sector, where the company has an estimated 60 to 70 percent market share that makes it \"already much stronger than its rivals.\" After purchasing Activision, the CMA says Microsoft \"would find it commercially beneficial to make Activision’s titles exclusive to its own cloud gaming service.\"</p>\n<p>Microsoft has in recent months <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/02/microsoft-signs-10-year-deal-with-nintendo-for-full-feature-call-of-duty/\">signed deals with Nvidia</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/03/microsoft-offers-call-of-duty-to-yet-another-streaming-platform/\">smaller cloud-gaming providers</a> in an attempt to \"mak[e] even more clear to regulators that our acquisition of Activision Blizzard will make Call of Duty available on far more devices than before,\" as Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith <a href=\"https://news.microsoft.com/2023/03/14/microsoft-announces-partnership-with-cloud-gaming-provider-boosteroid-to-bring-more-games-to-more-players-around-the-world/\">said in a statement</a> last month. But the CMA said these kinds of cloud-gaming deals—which Microsoft submitted to the CMA as a proposed remedy for any anticompetitive effects of the merger—were \"limited to cloud gaming providers with specific business models\" and thus not sufficient to address the regulator's concerns.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1934392#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1934392&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2924e8430265af2447230d4fe82e9b2e8a91e254fa8c17f182d679f1dc3aa70b","category":"Tech"}
