However, the specific Apple Intelligence features that will be made available is not yet known. Apple has released Apple Intelligence features in phases, with the first set including notification summaries, the Photos Clean Up tool, reply suggestions in Messages and Mail, writing tools, and the new Siri UI. These features will likely be available at release, but it’s unclear whether the second set, released in the iOS/iPadOS 18.2, which includes <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2556848/how-to-apple-intelligence-siri-chatgpt-iphone.html\">ChatGPT integration</a>, the Image Playground app, Visual Intelligence, and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2545829/ios-18-2-how-to-create-your-own-custom-emoji-with-genmoji.html\">Genmoji</a>, will be delayed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One update that reportedly won’t appear in iOS/iPadOS 18.4 and macOS 15.4 is the much-anticipated Siri content overhaul. A recent report by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2609783/the-new-improved-siri-might-take-even-longer-to-arrive.html\">reported</a> that work on this has run into bugs and performance issues, forcing the company to push its release to May or later with iOS/iPadOS 18.5.
