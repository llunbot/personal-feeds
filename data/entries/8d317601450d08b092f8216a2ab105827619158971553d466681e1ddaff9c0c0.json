Those with Basic or Pro plans — paying $100 and $5000 a month for API access, respectively — have\nexperienced unannounced changes to their plans, numerous bugs, and\noften receive zero customer support. And developers shelling out\nfor Twitter’s Enterprise API Plan, which starts at $42,000 per\nmonth, are experiencing sudden outages and disappointing service\nconsidering the money they’re paying.</p>\n\n<p>“Everything used to work fine before we started paying half a\nmillion per year,” shared one developer in a private Twitter\ndeveloper group chat shared with Mashable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is how Twitter is dealing with <em>paid</em> services. At this point, choosing to pay for Twitter Blue as a user looks about as smart as buying a ticket for OceanGate’s next submarine.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/03/twitter-paid-apis-broken\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"8d317601450d08b092f8216a2ab105827619158971553d466681e1ddaff9c0c0","category":"Tech"}
