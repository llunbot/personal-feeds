It appears that the questions about a bigger iMac are so persistent that Apple responded, confirming with Macworld that a 27-inch iMac with Apple silicon is not in the company’s plans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company believes that its 24-inch iMac with its 4.5K display is an ideal replacement for owners of the 4K and 5K Intel-based iMac. If a larger screen is needed, Apple recommends the 27-inch Studio Display with a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1480091/mac-mini-m2-pro-review.html\">Mac mini</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/622515/mac-studio-m1-max-review.html\">Mac Studio</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s confirmation comes at a time when the company’s Mac sales are struggling. Its fourth quarter 2024 financial results showed that <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2124873/apple-q4-2023-earnings-loss-iphone-mac-sales.html\">Mac sales are down a whopping 35 percent</a> year over year. The release of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2120984/macbook-pro-lineup-with-m3-pro-max-processors-memory-specs.html\">M3 MacBook Pro</a> and iMac could breathe life into Mac sales, but it’s hard not to think a larger-screen iMac would seriously invigorate sales.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s standard practice is to not comment on future product plans–it’s a phrase frequently said by CEO Tim Cook during quarterly results queries. However, the company clearly does not want customers to wait for a product that is not coming anytime soon. It wants to boost its bottom line and have customers invest now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Curiously, Apple’s confirmation <em>specifically</em> addresses a 27-inch iMac. Rumors have floated about regarding a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/349270/imac-pro-release-date-display-price.html\">32-inch iMac Pro</a> with Pro- or Max-level chips. Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman has reported that such an iMac could hit the market in 2024 or 2025. Apple did not comment on those plans. So let the rumors and speculation continue.</p>\n\niMac</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"2d0261a52d456e0f3b3244930bc09808cf4089fd19f5e5f90efe471877188341","category":"Apple"}
