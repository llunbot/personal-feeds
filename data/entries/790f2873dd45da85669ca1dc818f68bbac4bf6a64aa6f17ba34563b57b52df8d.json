Since 2020, our annual Principle Awards program has recognized individuals who embodied each of our nine principles, but this year we've updated the program to celebrate team-based achievements.</p>\n\n<p>This blog post highlights the winning team and finalists for their extraordinary contributions and collaboration, demonstrating our principles at work. </p>\n\n<h3>Meet the 2024 Principle Award winner — team Madrid Tech Hub Opening</h3>\n\n<p>Earlier this year, HashiCorp opened our new Madrid Tech Hub, marking a significant milestone in our commitment to grow our European presence. The charter for our Madrid Tech Hub extends beyond business operations to strive for a positive impact on the local economy and community. And it’s well positioned to support the thriving HashiCorp User Group (HUG) <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/madrid-hashicorp-user-group/\">Madrid group</a>, which includes hundreds of members.</p>\n\n<p>To build and support the new location took a months-long cross-company effort including more than 40 people from the People, Finance, Workplace, Marketing, IT, and WorldWide Field Organization teams.</p>\n\n<p>The team creating the Madrid Hub incorporated many of our nine Principles: Integrity, Kindness, Pragmatism, Humility, Vision, Execution, Communication, Beauty Works Better, and Reflection. They started with a clear Vision of what needed to be done, prioritizing Communication every step of the way as they Executed on the plan. The team took a Pragmatic approach to problem-solving and developing realistic solutions. A focus on Beauty Works Better ensured that the first cohort of employees had the best possible experience when the Hub opened in April of this year.</p>\n\n<p>The team’s collective achievements included:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Setting up the Spain entity and creating a local compensation and benefits strategy</li>\n<li>Developing an IT strategy to ensure employees had the tools to be productive</li>\n<li>Securing office space in the heart of Madrid and building out the space with the HashiCorp look and feel</li>\n<li>Partnering with World Wide Field Organization on headcount planning, resourcing, and an external employer-brand awareness campaign </li>\n<li>Identifying founders internally, and providing immigration and mobility support for employees in the Hub </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Congratulations to the winning team:</strong> James Footman, Suzy Hathaway, Taylor Katigbak, Becky Ketcik, Vincent Cartier, Lisa White, Emily Day, Elisa Tsang, Rocio Lopez, Linda Hermanspann, Amani Alliance, Peppe Gelso, Jenny Nguyen, Shaf Muklas, Sophie Neal, Mara Molina, Heidi Hischmann, Sian Matthews, Ashni Mehta, Rebecca Vazquez, Michelle Roberts, Jen Cacaj, Will Farley Joe Colandro, Julia Friedman, Adam Carroll, Erin Graupmann, Arun Goel, Sorabh Gupta, Varun Gussain, Nitish Khandelwal, Arpit Sharma, Sajnu Agrawal, Will Green, Simon Smith, Sonal Dubey, Akhila Karingula, Sandeep Potlacheruvu, Phaneendra Koppisetti, Gobi Thirugnanam, Jenny Evans. </p>\n\n<h3>Meet the finalists: Team Infrastructure Cloud Launch and team Accessibility Remediation for a Multinational Financial Services Company</h3>\n\n<p>In addition to team Madrid Tech Hub Opening, a pair of other projects also exemplified HashiCorp’s Principles.</p>\n\n<h4>Team Infrastructure Cloud Launch</h4>\n\n<p>In April, <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/introducing-the-infrastructure-cloud\">HashiCorp launched The Infrastructure Cloud </a>at the NASDAQ, a pivotal moment for our company. A clear long-term Vision and extensive Execution brought The Infrastructure Cloud to life across our website, customer presentations, social media, and multiple content assets, including blogs, articles, white papers, videos, infographics, and more. </p>\n\n<p>This updated messaging allows us to better Communicate our value proposition, simplifying our story into two key components — Infrastructure Lifecycle Management (ILM) and Security Lifecycle Management (SLM) — supported by a new maturity model that clearly defines customer pain points and solutions. Not just a simplification of our story, The Infrastructure Cloud helps us better support customers seeking prescriptive guidance to accelerate their cloud programs. </p>\n\n<p>In order to Execute on the launch event at NASDAQ headquarters in New York, as well as creating the narrative and supporting assets, more than 45 members of our Marketing and WWFO teams worked on the project over many months — demonstrating our principles of Beauty Works Better and Reflection at every stage of the project. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Kudos to team Infrastructure Cloud Launch:</strong> Chris Van Wesep, Melar Chen, Diana Smith, Moe Bonneau, Mario Baltodano, Corbin Lawrence, Erin Carney, Coon Lam, Mitch Pronschinske, Raven Kenemer, Kyle Jones, Fredric Paul, Kimmy Lac, Grant Frink, Isaac Sherbin, Kara Kadri, Martin Bergman, Kate Lehman, Autumn Jones, Ben Gage, Heat Hamilton, Ruben Nic, Noel Quiles, Pam Bortnick, Leah Bush, Nels Andereck, Townsend Colon, Kaitlynne Fuery, Alli Steil, Carlos Pastor, Marissa Dietz, Maryann Nguyen-Ng, Fiona Riley, Laura Berman, Candice Anderson, Bomi Kim, Linda Shui, Kayleigh Wong, Grace Rathje, Andrea Scullin, Danielle Hollywood, Grace Stillar, Rosemary Wang, Corrigan Neralich, and Michael Wood. </p>\n\n<h4>Team Accessibility Remediation for a Multinational Financial Services Company</h4>\n\n<p>HashiCorp is committed to digital accessibility for people with disabilities. We are continually improving the user experience of our products, and striving to apply the relevant accessibility standards and regulations. But, accessibility is a journey, not a destination, which means we are continually working to deliver the best, most inclusive experience. </p>\n\n<p>A multinational financial institution performed an accessibility audit on Terraform Enterprise and discovered accessibility issues that needed to be addressed before the customer would renew. Members from many parts of HashiCorp, teams including Terraform’s Engineering, Product and Design teams as well as the WWFO, Web Presence, and Legal teams, engaged help from our Accessibility team, who quickly completed their own internal audit. This required careful Communication to quickly determine a resolution across so many teams.</p>\n\n<p>After our Accessibility team completed an audit, they found many of the customer’s issues could be resolved through adopting our <a href=\"https://helios.hashicorp.design/\">Helios design system</a>. That was already on the Terraform Enterprise roadmap, demonstrating the team’s Vision for predicting customer needs. Our teams worked quickly to close as many issues as possible while planning a roadmap to address the rest, showing Humility, Pragmatism, and Execution.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kudos to team Accessibility Remediation for a Multinational Financial Services Company:</strong> Melanie Sumner, Brian Runnells, Keran Braich, Dylan Egan, Stanley Stuart, Kaitlynne Fuery, Pamela Bortnick, Matt Terich, Mike Fonseca, Jeremy Mefford, Rebecca Yohannes, Ben Barkhouse, Robyn Sandrew, Priyam Bhargava, Patrick Hayes, Priscilla Santos Romo, Ash Rajagopal, Dean Marano, Cristiano Rastelli, Alex Jurubita, Kristin Bradely, Heather Larsen, Jory Tindall, Andrew Gendel.</p>\n\n<p>To learn more about HashiCorp’s Principles visit: <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/our-principles\">https://www.hashicorp.com/our-principles</a>.
