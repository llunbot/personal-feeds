{"title":"BBEdit 15","link":"https://www.barebones.com/support/bbedit/notes-15.0.html","date":1710957460000,"content":"\n<p>BBEdit 15.0.2 just shipped, which reminded me that I never linked to BBEdit 15. Most interesting and useful to me, among many new features:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There’s a new document type, “ChatGPT Worksheet”. This is created \nfrom File → New as with other document types, and provides an \ninterface for conversational exchanges with ChatGPT. In order to \nuse this feature, you will need a ChatGPT account, and an API \nkey. [...] </p>\n\n<p>ChatGPT worksheets work similarly to a shell worksheet: type \nsomething in, and press the Enter key to send it to ChatGPT. (You \ncan also use the “Send Command” keyboard equivalent, as set in the \n“Worksheets” section of BBEdit’s “Menus &amp; Shortcuts” preferences. \nThe default for this command is Control-Return.) After some period \nof time, you’ll receive a response which BBEdit will insert into \nthe document window. </p>\n\n<p>If you wish to cancel your request before the response arrives, \nCommand-period or Control-C will do that. </p>\n\n<p>Responses from ChatGPT are automatically quoted, as long as the \nworksheet’s language is set to “Markdown”. If you change the \nworksheet’s language, this quoting will not occur. </p>\n\n<p>(Since worksheets are Markdown, you can use “Preview in BBEdit” on \na worksheet to visualize it.) </p>\n\n<p>Because chats depend heavily on history, a worksheet saves your \nprompts and the server’s responses. Thus, the document size will \ngrow over time and context is preserved, even if you delete \nprevious prompts and responses from the text area. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>BBEdit ChatGPT worksheets are my favorite interface to ChatGPT in general, but they particularly shine when using ChatGPT for programming advice. It’s so convenient to have the chat in a freeform format right there in your text editor.</p>\n\n<p>Other tentpole new features include a minimap palette, customizable cheat sheets, and significant improvements to “projects”. BBEdit remains my favorite app in the world. $60 for a new license, $30 to upgrade from an older version, or $4/month or $40/year <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bbedit/id404009241?mt=12\">from the Mac App Store</a>.</p>\n\n<p>See also: <a href=\"https://mjtsai.com/blog/2024/01/11/bbedit-15/\">Michael Tsai</a> and <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/01/bbedit-15-adds-chatgpt-support/\">Jason Snell</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/20/bbedit-15\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"2454b90831c2c61d2c24141a79ac0b2effbb6652e2f272fa70dd3a798f37854c","category":"Tech"}
