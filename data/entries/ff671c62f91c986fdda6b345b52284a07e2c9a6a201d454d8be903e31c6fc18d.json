The Conshelf 1 project consisted of a steel structure that hosted two men for a week.</p>\n<p>Now, more than 60 years later, another underwater laboratory is being set up not far from Marseilles, this time to study both the sea and sky. Unlike the Conshelf habitat, the <a href=\"https://www.cppm.in2p3.fr/web/en/LSPM/index.html\">Laboratoire Sous-marin Provence Méditerranée</a> (LSPM) won't be manned by humans. Located 40 km off the coast of Toulon at a depth of 2,450 meters, it is Europe’s first remotely operated underwater laboratory.</p>\n<h2>Physics under the sea</h2>\n<p>Currently, three junction boxes capable of powering several instruments and retrieving data are at the heart of LSPM. The boxes, each measuring 6 meters long and 2 meters high, are connected to a power system on land via a 42-kilometer-long electro-optical cable. The optical portion of this cable is used to collect data from the junction boxes.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1928379#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1928379&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ff671c62f91c986fdda6b345b52284a07e2c9a6a201d454d8be903e31c6fc18d","category":"Tech"}
