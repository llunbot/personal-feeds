There aren't any notable changes so far, but the update will still bring important bug fixes and security improvements. So when can we expect it?\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/iOS-18.5-Feature-Real-Mock.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nBased on historical release timelines for x.5 updates, iOS 18.5 and its sister updates are likely to launch in May. Here's when we saw updates in prior years:\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/13/apple-releases-ios-17-5/\">iOS 17.5</a></strong> - May 13</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/18/apple-releases-ios-16-5/\"><strong>iOS 16.5</strong></a> - May 18</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/05/16/apple-releases-ios-15-5/\">iOS 15.5</a></strong> - May 16</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/26/apple-releases-ios-14-5/\">iOS 14.5</a></strong> - April 26</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/05/20/apple-releases-ios-13-5/\">iOS 13.5</a></strong> - May 20</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\nMany of Apple's x.5 updates are released around the middle of the month, so the week of May 12 is a solid guess, though the week of May 19 is also a possibility.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThough we've only had three betas so far, there are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-5-beta-features/\">so few new features</a> in iOS 18.5 that we probably won't need too many more betas for it to be ready to launch.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's x.5 updates have historically had fewer features than earlier releases, because Apple is often already transitioning much of its new development to the next-generation version of iOS. We're just a couple of months way from when <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/\">iOS 19</a> will be introduced at WWDC, so Apple is working to get it ready to go.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 18.5 won't be the last update to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, and we'll likely see at least one more major point update before ‌iOS 19‌ rolls out this fall.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/23/when-will-ios-18-5-be-released/\">When Will iOS 18.5 Be Released?</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/when-will-ios-18-5-be-released.2455857/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"36c647fdaf6375cf0d72bd61e0b82af9fd6447e419d01ef0cac21a47c7ae9087","category":"Apple"}
