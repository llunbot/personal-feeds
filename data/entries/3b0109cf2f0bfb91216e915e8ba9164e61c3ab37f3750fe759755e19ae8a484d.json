Reports on Twitter, Reddit, the MacRumors Forums, and the Apple Support Communities consist of users reporting their Mac warning that the system has \"run out of application memory\" or that specific applications are consuming ridiculously high amounts of RAM in Activity Monitor.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSome reports call out the macOS Control Center as the main culprit, with YouTuber Gregory McFadden sharing a screenshot of Control Center using up to  20GB of RAM on their 64GB <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-max/\">M1 Max</a> 16-inch MacBook Pro. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Wander1236/status/1453716193530032137\">Other users</a> are also sharing similar experiences on the <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/control-center-high-ram-9-gb-usage-on-monterey-12-0-1-mbp-14-32-gb-ram.2321047/\">MacRumors Forums</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/qk0zfh/control_center_using_10g_of_ram/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">Reddit</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>So glad I got 64GB of memory on my new Mac so I can use 26GB of it for control center...

As shown in the tweets below, Firefox for some users is taking up incredibly high amounts of memory, as high as 80GB for one user. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/FirefoxSupport?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@FirefoxSupport</a> <br />Firefox has a memory leak!<br /><br />macOS 12.0.1 (21A559)<br />Firefox 93.0 (64-bit)<br />MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2021) <a href=\"https://t.co/fC7fNRv7jE\">pic.twitter.com/fC7fNRv7jE</a></p>— y (@y80481629) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/y80481629/status/1453305283317354496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 27, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/AppleSupport?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@AppleSupport</a> got any idea what this is about ? m1 Mac mini 8gb safari does it too.

In some instances, some users have suggested that restarting the Mac helps, while others say the pop-up reappears shortly after. A user on the Apple Support Communities <a href=\"https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253316109?answerId=256201084022#256201084022\">noted their experience</a>: \r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>Since downloading Monterey I receive repeated messages \"your system has run out of application memory\". This is only occurred since downloading Monterey. When examining activity monitor pages seems to be the main culprit using up 18 GB and more!  Is this evidence of a memory leak for Pages with Monterey os? Restart makes no difference. </blockquote>Mac users on the MacRumors Forums (<a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/running-out-of-application-memory-14-m1max-64gb.2321006/?post=30553842#post-30553842\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/memory-leak-mac-book-pro-16-m1-max-your-system-has-run-out-of-memory-lightroom-classic.2320824/\">2</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/64gb-memory-usage.2320643/\">3</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/your-system-has-run-out-of-application-memory-messages-began-to-appear-after-11-6-1-upgrade-from-11-6-facetime-appears-to-be-the-root-cause.2321168/\">4</a>), the Apple Support Communities (<a href=\"https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253310137\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253296271\">2</a>), and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Timberborn/comments/qiv02j/your_system_has_run_out_of_application_memory_on/\">Reddit</a>, are noting similar experiences.
