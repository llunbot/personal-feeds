The relegation and promotion system is calculated over a three-year period. The current cycle has been running from the beginning of 2023 and will conclude at the end of 2025. Over the three seasons, every team’s UCI points are added together into a rolling leaderboard which will eventually dictate the future makeup of the UCI WorldTour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All races in the UCI calendar receive a points classification, from the Tour de France to the Olympics, Paris-Nice and the San Marinese national championships. The points are then dished out based on stage results, general classification and secondary prizes such as the points jersey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of the three-year window, the top 18 teams in the UCI rankings will receive a licence for the UCI WorldTour, the top division of professional cycling. The teams placed 19th and below will compete as UCI ProTeams in the second division of pro cycling. At the end of the last relegation cycle, Lotto and Israel-Premier Tech were relegated after having accumulated fewer points than UCI ProTeams Alpecin-Deceuninck and Arkéa-Samsic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With only a few months left in the current three-year cycle, some teams have already emerged as contenders for relegation, while a couple have surfaced as candidates to receive a pass into the world’s biggest races.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>The current situation</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"1750\" height=\"992\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/mens-wt-relegation.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/mens-wt-relegation.webp 1750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/mens-wt-relegation-300x170.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/mens-wt-relegation-970x550.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/mens-wt-relegation-768x435.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/mens-wt-relegation-1536x871.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/mens-wt-relegation-750x425.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/mens-wt-relegation-1140x646.webp 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we delve into our relegation candidates, let’s take a moment to explain how it all works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UCI’s promotion/relegation system is focussed on a three-year period. Each year, the top 20-ranking riders from each team in the UCI’s individual rider rankings are added to the relegation-promotion standings. The teams that score the 18 best combined scores at the end of the 2023-2025 period will then receive UCI WorldTour licences for the three following seasons (in this instance, 2026-2028).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the final scores will be tallied up at the end of 2025, we can still get a glimpse into how each team is faring, based on the two previous seasons’ results and how each squad’s current top 20-ranked riders are getting on. The chart above compiles these figures to show the current rolling totals, as of Monday 14th April 2025, the day after Paris-Roubaix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unsurprisingly, UAE Team Emirates and Visma-Lease a Bike are in the lead, but two ProTeams, indicated in brown, look to be well inside the mid-table standings, ensuring a WorldTour future. These are the two former top-division teams: Israel-Premier Tech and Lotto.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The dotted line around Picnic-PostNL and XDS-Astana is the drop zone – the boundary between 18th and 19th place in the combined standings. Any team below this ranking would be given ProTeam status, while the 18 teams above the line would receive a WorldTour license until 2028. Based on the current standings and our previous relegation autopsy last year, we can identify five teams that are in the fight for WorldTour places: Cofidis, Picnic-PostNL, XD-Astana, Uno X and Arkéa-B&amp;B Hotels. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+6\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-6-970x300.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-6-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-6-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-6-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-6-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-6-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-6-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Subs-flash-162-for-web-6-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1428\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/uci-points-for-relegation-teams.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/uci-points-for-relegation-teams.webp 2000w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/uci-points-for-relegation-teams-300x214.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/uci-points-for-relegation-teams-970x693.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/uci-points-for-relegation-teams-768x548.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/uci-points-for-relegation-teams-1536x1097.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/uci-points-for-relegation-teams-120x86.webp 120w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/uci-points-for-relegation-teams-350x250.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/uci-points-for-relegation-teams-750x536.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/uci-points-for-relegation-teams-1140x814.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/uci-points-for-relegation-teams-190x136.webp 190w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Out of these five teams, four are existing members of the UCI WorldTour, with Uno X the only one hoping for an ambitious promotion in 2026. The others, therefore, will be aiming to avoid a crushing relegation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This chart highlights how each of the five squads have performed over the past three seasons – those that count towards their WorldTour future. Cofidis are currently the best placed, sitting with 21,134 points. Not far behind are Picnic-PostNL with a combined score of 20,662 points. It’s worth noting, however, that the Dutch team has had a poor start to 2025, indicated by their small slither of red at the top of their bar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast, XDS-Astana have shot up the standings, courtesy of their swashbuckling start to 2025. Their red bar, the colour that represents the four months of the 2025 calendar, equates to over 5,700 points – not far from their end-of-season totals from 2023 and 2024. Behind them sits the hopeful Uno X and Arkéa-B&amp;B Hotels, who trail behind the other contenders on 17,628 points over the three-year cycle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Already, we can spot some trends from the first four months of the 2025 season. XDS-Astana and Uno X have the early jump, with XDS looking to surpass Picnic-PostNL in due course. On the other hand, Picnic and Arkéa have struggled to get out of the blocks in 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With all this in mind, let’s dig into our promotion optimists and our WorldTour squads in fierce defence.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n

Pereyron</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently sitting within the relegation zone, Arkéa-B&amp;B Hotels may have one of the shortest stints in the WorldTour after their promotion at the start of 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arkéa were among the poorest performers in the 2023 rankings, finishing in 19th place, only ahead of Astana. The squad may have finally bagged a Tour de France stage in 2024, but they stalled in the rankings, finishing in 19th once again at the end of the year. Compiling their 2023 and 2024 point hauls, they sat firmly in the relegation zone at the beginning of 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things have only gotten worse this year. The Breton squad are positioned in 24th place in the UCI rankings based on 2025 alone, with Kévin Vauquelin the only saviour. As their rivals advance, Arkéa-B&amp;B Hotels are in the worst position out of any WorldTour team on this list. After Paris-Roubaix, they have fallen to 21st place in the combined three-year standings, with a gulf now opening up between them and rivals XDS-Astana and Uno X.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Strengths</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Arkéa have been efficient at taking points in smaller races. The French team field competitive line-ups for French one-day races and smaller stage races that yield a large amount of UCI points. In 2025 they’ve already claimed two stage races in France, with several stage victories along the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps not in 2025, but over the two previous seasons, the squad have benefitted from their big hitters. Luca Mozzato’s impressive Classics campaign last year yielded a host of points, while Arnaud Démare has continued to be a reliable force in the sprints on the WorldTour and Coupe de France levels. They’re not alone though. Arkéa have plenty of riders capable of mid-table finishes in one-day races, chiefly Belgian Jenthe Biermans. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Weaknesses</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The team have a long-term focus on nurturing talent. The squad have a development team that has been fertile ground for transfers. This is good in the long run, but they need short-term answers to stay away from relegation. This wasn’t helped by a tumbleweed transfer window, which saw the team sign few riders to help with damage limitation. While they failed to bring in new talent, some of the squad’s most reliable points scorers left during the winter, including the team’s third-ranked rider from last year Vincenzo Albanese.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A big problem seems to be a lack of momentum. They have started 2025 on the wrong foot, and it’s hard to see where this can be altered in the following months. Their performance at WorldTour races has been lacklustre and a poor Classics campaign has left them 2,000 points behind their competitors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’ll take a big win from Kévin Vauquelin or Arnaud Démare to fight against the tide. In all honesty, that’s looking unlikely, particularly with Vauquelin eyeing up contracts elsewhere for 2026. The squad have been underhwleming on the WorldTour stage and it’s not even certain how long the project will be around after reports of financial troubles arose last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Relegation risk level: 5/5</h4>\n\n\n\n<h3>Picnic-PostNL</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Adobe-Express-file-35.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Adobe-Express-file-35.webp 1800w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Adobe-Express-file-35-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Adobe-Express-file-35-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Adobe-Express-file-35-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Adobe-Express-file-35-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Adobe-Express-file-35-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Adobe-Express-file-35-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Adobe-Express-file-35-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Adobe-Express-file-35-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Adobe-Express-file-35-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Picnic-PostNL overperformed in the previous UCI rankings cycle, managing to climb into the top five after the Covid-struck season in 2020. Since 2023, however, the team have struggled to keep up this form. Over the past two seasons, they have fallen into the bottom five of the UCI rankings each year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Dutch team might harbour a mixed approach involving a blend of young and old talents, but they currently sit in 18th place in the rolling standings. If they stay on this course, they would stay in the WorldTour by the skin of their teeth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the beginning of 2025, they have floundered. Based on this season alone, they’ve conceded bags of points to the likes of XDS-Astana and Cofidis, and are now just 1,000 points away from relegation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Strengths:</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Pincic-PostNL have a strong contingent of young riders. Oscar Onley, Max Poole, Casper van Uden and Pavel Bittner have succeeded at the top level in 2024. After a slow start to the cycle in 2023, the team have managed to gain momentum and return to winning ways. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To their benefit, they have a wide array of talents across different terrains. The squad boast time-triallists, Classics riders, climbers and importantly sprinters. A lot of their key riders are also locked in on long-term contracts. This gives the team some security in the seasons to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike the other teams on this list, DSM have historically succeeded at Grand Tours, winning stages and finishing in the top 15 overall. This is crucial for the relegation battle, especially if they stay ahead of the French teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Weaknesses:</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Picnic-PostNL are chained to a reduced programme in 2025. They’ve avoided the high points-scoring events on the second or third tier of racing, and they’ve fielded weak teams to high-priority WorldTour events, including the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-classics-monuments-cobbles\">Spring Classics</a>. Maybe the Grand Tour cycle will benefit the Dutch squad, but it’ll be tough to fight against the tide this summer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The squad’s big names are fading away in 2025 as well. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-romain-bardet-moments\">Romain Bardet </a>will leave the squad after the Dauphiné and Fabio Jakobsen has not been delivering since arriving at the team, only taking only a couple of wins at the Tour of Turkey last year. He was a big-budget signing and seems to have been a disappointing investment. He’s now out of action for the rest of the season with injury, so won’t be earning the team any more points.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the young nature of this team, the squad are relatively inexperienced in parts. They are often outmuscled by the super-teams and lack the vast race schedule like the French teams. The results from the development team don’t get funnelled into the UCI rankings for the WorldTour squad, however. With this, they need a real kick up the backside going into the next phase of the 2025 calendar.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Relegation risk level: 4/5</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2>XDS-Astana</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Adobe-Express-file-34.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Adobe-Express-file-34.webp 1800w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Adobe-Express-file-34-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Adobe-Express-file-34-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Adobe-Express-file-34-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Adobe-Express-file-34-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Adobe-Express-file-34-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Adobe-Express-file-34-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Adobe-Express-file-34-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Adobe-Express-file-34-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Adobe-Express-file-34-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>XDS-Astana have won Grand Tours and Monuments in the past decade, but now they find themselves in the fight for WorldTour status.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from Mark Cavendish’s Tour de France hurrah, Astana had a challenging 2024 season. They moved deep inside the relegation zone at the end of 2024, sitting in 21st place, overtaken by their sprightly ProTeam rivals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After nursing the Manx Missile to a 35th stage victory last summer, they have had a new lease of life – perhaps due to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/chinese-company-invests-in-astana-qazaqstan\">XDS’s financial injection</a>. A cunning shopping spree during the off-season saw them wrangle in some experienced names, including Sergio Higuita, Mike Teunissen and Diego Ulissi, to help score points in 2025. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The result of these signings has been staggering, with XDS-Astana now carrying enough momentum to take them across the line for WorldTour survival. The team had a barnstorming start to 2025 and now they are now ranked within the top five in the 2025 UCI rankings. Their breakout star Christian Scaroni even topped the UCI rankings for a month earlier this year. After just four months of racing, they’ve accrued over 5,700 points, around 86% of what they achieved throughout the whole of the 2024 calendar.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Strengths</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>XDS-Astana have a mature roster, with riders filled to the brim with experience and racing know-how. The team also have a strong pedigree behind them and staff who know how to win big races. Former WorldTour riders have been brought into the staff room for 2025 and the results have been incredibly positive. A reshuffled focus on scoring points has also proved fruitful, as XDS-Astana have become mainstays of the top ten rankings in sprints, Classics and mountain stages. They’re also not afraid to back two or more riders in any given race with the goal of scoring even more points.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever’s happened here, it seems to be working. Davide Ballerini and Mike Teunissen have looked rejuvenated in the Classics, while Max Kanter has returned to a good level of sprinting in second-tier races. Lorenzo Fortunato looked sprightly in early-season stage races and the team have mastered the Marc Hirschi school of points scoring in smaller one-day races.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Weaknesses</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Bearing all this in mind, it’s hard to identify any weaknesses in XDS’s current trajectory. Having started the season almost 5,000 behind their rivals, they have catapulted up the standings and bridged the gap to a very achievable 1,000-point push. With six months left in the season, this is certainly possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the halfway point of last season, we suggested that XDS should be more bullish in smaller races offering big UCI point weightings. They’ve certainly picked up on that, having won a host of smaller one-day races in the early part of the season. They’ve also diversified their roster, meaning that they can score points in a wider breadth of races than before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One potential roadblock could be the Grand Tour cycle. With their focus now on nifty points scoring, they could get swamped by their rivals at the Grand Tours, with points harder to score in the GC standings and sprint finishes in those three big races. Cofidis and Arkéa suffered a similar fate in 2022 during the last promotion cycle, but they both picked up enough points to keep them on the right side of the danger zone.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Relegation risk level: 3/5</h4>\n\n\n\n<h3>Cofidis</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Adobe-Express-file-36.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Adobe-Express-file-36.webp 1800w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Adobe-Express-file-36-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Adobe-Express-file-36-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Adobe-Express-file-36-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Adobe-Express-file-36-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Adobe-Express-file-36-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Adobe-Express-file-36-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Adobe-Express-file-36-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Adobe-Express-file-36-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Adobe-Express-file-36-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Cofidis have been kicking about for a while. For a long time, the team were a tried-and-tested fixture of cycling’s second division. As a result, the French squad received a UCI WorldTour licence in 2020 and duly moved up to the top flight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since their promotion – which was decided before the current points system – Cofidis have floated around the bottom quartile of the UCI rankings and currently sit in 17th place after the first two phases of the cycle. They survived the last cull, and it looks as though they might manage to avoid yet another drop zone fight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on current projections, Cofidis <em>will </em>keep their WorldTour license for 2026. They’ve overtaken Picnic-PostNL in the cumulated 2023-2025 standings and some early-season results have pushed them clear of the Dutch team and their compatriots at Arkéa B&amp;B Hotels.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Strengths: </h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Cofidis brought in some important point-scorers for 2025, following a savvy approach to last winter’s transfer window. Alex Aranburu was a fantastic asset for Cofidis’s WorldTour status. He’s been able to scoop up some key points, as well as a rare WorldTour win for the French squad. New signing Dylan Teuns may come into his element in the Ardennes Classics and Emu Buchmann still has to show his hand in the Grand Tours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cofidis also benefit from being French, as the Lille-based team are invited to a plethora of French races. As mentioned, this circuit offers a huge haul of points to be scored. With consistent results in French races, they could keep their WorldTour aspirations alive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Winter sprinting results from Milan Fretin pumped some early-season optimism into the team, and they now sit in a better position than they started the season, having moved further from the drop zone since the start of 2025. XDS-Astana are breathing down their necks, but they just need to keep one foot ahead of Picnic-PostNL to stay safe.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Weaknesses:</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Like their northern French colleagues at Arkéa, Cofidis lack that star power. The squad has decent talent but their race results have been a mixed bag over the past two years. They have missed the mark at Grand Tours, relying on Guillaume Martin to secure a top 15 finish and sprint top tens from Bryan Coquard. With Martin out the door, this only makes it harder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Buchmann may enjoy some solid results in the Grand Tours and stage races to come later in the calendar, but Cofidis may lose some momentum through the points-heavy period between May and September. As long as they stay consistent at the Coupe de France, they should have enough to get over the finish line come October.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Relegation risk level: 3/5</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2>Who is likely to be promoted?</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>A return to form: Lotto &amp; Israel-Premier Tech</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-15-scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-15-scaled.webp 2560w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-15-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-15-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-15-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-15-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-15-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-15-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-15-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-15-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-15-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Cyclist-Ronde-Van-Vlaanderen-06-avril-2025-15-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Xavier Pereyron</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It shouldn’t come as a shock that the two teams that faced relegation in 2022 have learnt from their mistakes. Lotto and Israel-Premier Tech became complacent during the last cycle, and now they have bounced back to former glory to sit in a very comfortable position.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lotto are currently tenth in the standings, while Israel-Premier Tech aren’t far behind in 14th. It’ll take quite the blunder for either team to go down. They laid the groundwork during 2023 and 2024, and now a couple of existing WorldTour teams – Jayco-AlUla and Intermarché – sit as a buffer between them and the fierce relegation battle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both teams have put on the brakes this year. They’ve snubbed some WorldTour invites with confidence and they expect to be in contention for Grand Tour stage victories and stage race podiums.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They’re both WorldTour teams in practice rather than name, receiving invites to all WorldTour races as the two top ProTeams, so it makes perfect sense for them to jump back onto the WorldTour level in 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Promotion likelihood: 5/5</h4>\n\n\n\n<h3>Uno-X Mobility</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-23T161512.986-970x647.png\" alt=\"uno x mobility\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-23T161512.986-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-23T161512.986-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-23T161512.986-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-23T161512.986-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-23T161512.986-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-23T161512.986-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-23T161512.986-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-23T161512.986-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-23T161512.986-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-23T161512.986.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>ARN/Aurélien Vialatte</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The optimists will be backing Uno-X Mobility to make it into the UCI WorldTour. The Norwegian team is relatively fresh-faced. They emerged after the pandemic as a competitive squad and have made it to the Tour startline in the two recent editions. Their mission statement was initially to make it up onto the WorldTour by 2025. This might be a bridge too far, but the team are only a handful of points away from making it to the top division.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More Scandinavian talents have joined the project. Magnus Cort has added a heap of points to their tally in his debut season last year, while the squad’s Classics engine reaped great rewards this spring with an Omloop Het Nieuwsblad victory from Søren Wærenskjold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the French teams really waver in 2025, Uno-X could see the door open to promotion. They currently sit in 20th place and are within touching distance of the WorldTour stragglers. They’ve had a great start to 2025 and a Tour de France invite could see them make progress on the likes of Cofidis and Picnic-PostNL.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Promotion likelihood: 3/5</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/uci-rankings-promotions-and-relegations\">Promotions and relegations update: Which men’s WorldTour teams are in danger in the UCI rankings?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Ewan Wilson &#124; Staff Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"8bdd1a9281de041e4214d7a43e97c903fb64ec1bc753d24cf7d611b763c17261","category":"Cycling"}
