The scammers tell the targets they have been hacked or are at risk of being hacked and that their assets should be protected. The scammers then instruct the targets to liquidate assets into cash. In some cases, the scammers instruct targets to wire funds to a fake metal dealer who will ship purchased merchandise to the victims’ homes.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1999805#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1999805&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8795d528a588ce4734abe57bac8d8fbfc23b784d6400c413a6b9596ba6c12839","category":"Tech"}
