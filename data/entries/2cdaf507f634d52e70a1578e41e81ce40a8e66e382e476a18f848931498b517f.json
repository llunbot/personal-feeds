Their collaboration led to the introduction of the Apple II in 1977, which significantly influenced the personal computing industry. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn 1984, Apple launched the Macintosh, notable for its graphical user interface and the iconic \"1984\" Super Bowl commercial directed by Ridley Scott. However, internal conflicts led to Jobs' departure from Apple in 1985. He then founded NeXT Inc., focusing on advanced computer platforms. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn 1997, Apple acquired NeXT, bringing Jobs back to the company as interim CEO. Under his leadership, Apple revitalized its product line and introduced groundbreaking products like the iMac, iPod, and iPhone.
