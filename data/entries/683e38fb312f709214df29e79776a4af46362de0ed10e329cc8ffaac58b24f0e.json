This registration encompasses a wide array of goods and services, including virtual reality headsets and wearable video displays, effectively granting Huawei exclusive rights to the \"Vision Pro\" name in China until November 2031.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to the Chinese National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA), Apple's application for the trademark rights to \"Vision Pro\" is currently in a state of \"refusal to re-examine.\" Additionally, Apple applied to trademark the brand name \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a>\" in June 2023, and this application is still under examination, leaving the company's branding strategy for the product in China uncertain.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHuawei's first foray into smart eyewear came with the introduction of \"Vision Glass\" in December 2022, expanding its portfolio under the Vision brand, which also includes a range of smart TV screens. Following the release of Apple's Vision Pro in the United States in February, Huawei has been rumored to be preparing to launch similar devices. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/\">China</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/trademark/\">Trademark</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/huawei/\">Huawei</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro\">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/14/vision-pro-trademark-issues-in-china/\">Apple Vision Pro's Name May Still Face Trademark Issues in China</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vision-pros-name-may-still-face-trademark-issues-in-china.2421906/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"683e38fb312f709214df29e79776a4af46362de0ed10e329cc8ffaac58b24f0e","category":"Apple"}
