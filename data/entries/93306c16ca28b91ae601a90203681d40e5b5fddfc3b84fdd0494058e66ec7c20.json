In a related <a href=\"https://help.openai.com/en/collections/5929286-educator-faq\">FAQ</a>, they also officially admit what we already know: AI writing detectors don't work, despite frequently being used to <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=accused+of+using+AI+site%3Areddit.com\">punish students</a> with false positives.</p>\n\n<p>In a section of the FAQ titled \"Do AI detectors work?\", OpenAI <a href=\"https://help.openai.com/en/articles/8313351-how-can-educators-respond-to-students-presenting-ai-generated-content-as-their-own\">writes</a>, \"In short, no. While some (including OpenAI) have released tools that purport to detect AI-generated content, none of these have proven to reliably distinguish between AI-generated and human-generated content.\"</p>\n<p>In July, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/why-ai-detectors-think-the-us-constitution-was-written-by-ai/\">we covered</a> in depth why AI writing detectors such as GPTZero don't work, with experts calling them \"mostly snake oil.\" These detectors often yield false positives due to relying on unproven detection metrics. Ultimately, there is nothing special about AI-written text that always distinguishes it from human-written, and detectors can be defeated by rephrasing. That same month, OpenAI <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/openai-discontinues-its-ai-writing-detector-due-to-low-rate-of-accuracy/\">discontinued</a> its AI Classifier, which was an experimental tool designed to detect AI-written text. It had an abysmal 26 percent accuracy rate.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1966483#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1966483&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"93306c16ca28b91ae601a90203681d40e5b5fddfc3b84fdd0494058e66ec7c20","category":"Tech"}
