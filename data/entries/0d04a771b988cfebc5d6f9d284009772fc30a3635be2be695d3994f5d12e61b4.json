The water landing capped a successful 199-day mission to the International Space Station.</p>\n<p>The spacecraft's return to Earth seemed nominal up until 4 minutes before splashdown, when the vehicle's main parachutes deployed. Three of the four parachutes came out nominally, but inflation of the fourth parachute was delayed by a fraction of a minute. Despite this, the commentators on the NASA-SpaceX livestream indicated that the fourth parachute's inflation rate was normal, and the spacecraft's descent speed nominal.</p>\n<p>The crew emerged from the spacecraft less than an hour later, on board a recovery ship, no worse for wear. Another Crew Dragon spacecraft, carrying NASA's Crew-3 mission, is set to launch from Florida in less than two days. It seems possible that this mission could be delayed due to the parachute issue observed Monday night.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1811085#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1811085&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0d04a771b988cfebc5d6f9d284009772fc30a3635be2be695d3994f5d12e61b4","category":"Tech"}
