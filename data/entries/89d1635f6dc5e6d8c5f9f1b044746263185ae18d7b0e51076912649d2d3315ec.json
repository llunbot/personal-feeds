{"title":"Review: Two Weeks With the Apple Vision Pro","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/vision-pro-2-week-review/","date":1708119294000,"content":"Today marks the two-week anniversary of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a> launch, and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/14/vision-pro-return-friday/\">last day for returns</a> for those who purchased on release day. With plenty of stories going around from those who decided not to keep the $3,500 device, <em>MacRumors</em> videographer Dan Barbera thought he'd share some of the reasons why he'll be keeping his headset.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>\r<br />\nWe need to have a few Vision Pro headsets on hand to write about them here at <em>MacRumors</em>, so that's one of the primary reasons that Dan will be keeping his. Apple is already working on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/\">visionOS</a> 2, and we're interested in seeing what changes and updates are in store. We're also getting new apps on a regular basis, all of which make the Vision Pro a more appealing device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Vision Pro is the best way to be immersed in a movie, especially 3D movies, and that's another key reason why Dan won't be bringing his back to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/\">Apple Store</a>. The Cinema Environment that shuts out the world is hard to beat because it's basically your own personal movie theater.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWorking on the Vision Pro needs some improvement, perhaps with support for multiple Mac displays, but it's useful when traveling with a laptop. It would also be nice to be able to use a mouse, but Magic Keyboard and Trackpad input work well enough.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere are some downsides to the Vision Pro. It's hard to wear for more than about an hour, the battery life is awful, and it doesn't hold a charge at all when not in use. Touch typing with the air keyboard is a poor experience, Personas need a lot of work to be less creepy, there still aren't a whole lot of groundbreaking app experiences, and Guest Mode is awful, so it is fully understandable why we're hearing a lot of return stories.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMake sure to watch Dan's full video to get his thoughts on the Vision Pro after two weeks, and let us know if you kept or returned your Vision Pro in the comments below.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro\">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/vision-pro-2-week-review/\">Review: Two Weeks With the Apple Vision Pro</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/review-two-weeks-with-the-apple-vision-pro.2419660/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"89d1635f6dc5e6d8c5f9f1b044746263185ae18d7b0e51076912649d2d3315ec","category":"Apple"}
