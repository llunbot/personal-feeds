{"title":"Bold, boring and brilliant: 2024 WorldTour team kits","link":"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/bold-boring-and-brilliant-2024-worldtour-team-kits","date":1703401201000,"content":"\n      <p><i><span>This page will be updated as kits are released</span></i></p>\n<p><span>It’s that time of year again. Professional riders are deep into their winter team training camps and when January 1 rolls round, they will be delivered bags of brand new kit for the season ahead. Some will have new sponsors and new colours, while others will have very little change at all – it’s a mixed bag. For us mere mortals who aren’t fortunate enough to have entire new wardrobes of cycling apparel to pick from each year, we have to be content with watching new jersey designs being released throughout the winter from the comfort of our social media accounts. To make ourselves feel a little better, though, we can give our fair and honest judgements on how each team has executed a new jersey design. Who will be the worst and best dressed in the WorldTour peloton next season?</span></p>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<p>Fom brown shorts to black, from red fade to orange fade, from funky patterns to simple minimalism, these are our musings on the 2024 WorldTour team kits, as they are drip fed to us by each team for our perusal.</p>\n<h3>Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale Team</h3>\n<p><span>Last year, AG2R’s team kit led to perhaps the best social media exposure the team had all season. The debate surrounding the team’s choice to wear brown shorts split opinions in the cycling world, some believed it was avant-garde, while others argued it was verging on vulgar. Like Marmite or Brexit, it was one of those debates that will never really be settled, so the newly-named Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale Team has taken the brown shorts out of the equation altogether for 2024. In its place is a very plain and safe kit which we don’t have much to say about.</span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/F_8NWgjWkAASvrl_1024x1024.jpg?v=1702483320\" /></span><em><span>Image: Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale</span></em></p>\n<p><span>It’s not particularly good and not particularly bad, made up of just three colours – blue, white and black – and with the team’s key sponsors printed diagonally in bold typeface. The shorts are black with white logos and the overall look is smart and pleasant, but it certainly won’t be turning heads in the peloton. The likes of Sam Bennett and Ben O’Connor will need to help Decathlon AG2R La Mondiale Team’s results speak for themselves this season, because this isn’t the sort of kit that is going to make any headlines.</span></p>\n<h3>Arkea B&amp;B Hotels </h3>\n<p><span>Arkea’s jersey isn’t a huge departure from the kit we saw the team race in last year, as the French squad sticks to their bold red colour which undoubtedly stands out in the peloton. It’s certainly a step away from the white kits that plenty of teams seem to be leaning towards, and we like the fact that it sticks out from the crowd. Arkea’s kit also gets extra points for the thought that has gone into it, it’s inspired by “EXCALIBUR”, a legendary Breton sword, so motifs of the iconic sword appear across the kit. In a press release, the team wrote that they were looking to “continue to write the legend of the Arkea–B&amp;B Hotels team” as they head into their 20th season in the men’s pro peloton.<img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GAbS9vXXMAAtbE9_1024x1024.jpg?v=1702483645\" /><em><span><span>Image: Arkea B&amp;B Hotels/</span></span><span>Tony Esnault</span></em></span></p>\n<div>While the kit has some meaningful changes compared to last year’s outfit, Arkea have done a good job at keeping the it similar enough that it is still identifiable for the team’s swathes of French supporters. In fact, the team unveiled their new kit after also hosting their traditional supporters' day at the Glaz Arena in Cesson-Sévigné where fans got to ride out with the pros. Fan engagement, bold colours and a jersey with meaning? We like it, Arkea.</div>\n<div></div>\n<h3>Team Bahrain Victorious </h3>\n<div>Déjà vu, anyone? Team Bahrain Victorious’ kit is undoubtedly a big change from their official team kit from last season, but if you think you’ve seen something similar before, that’s because the new jersey is just like the team’s special edition <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/pages/tour-de-france\">Tour de France</a> kit they wore a few months ago. While the team usually is seen in red kit inspired by the Bahrain flag, the Tour saw them switch to ‘pearl white’ jersey, intended to symbolise the pearl fishing in Bahrain. It seems they liked it so much that it’s making a permanent comeback for 2024.</div>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GA5nmewXYAAwdoB_1024x1024.jpg?v=1702483754\" /></div>\n<div><em>Image: Bahrain Victorious/Charly Lopez</em></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>In fact, an impressive amount of thought has gone into the Bahrain Victorious jersey: the navy blue accents and shorts are meant to represent the team’s commitment to cut their carbon emissions, the teal touches represent the tones of the shallow waters of the ‘two seas’, while the gold accents are supposed to reference the team’s inception in 2017. It’s a good try and we appreciate the symbolism, but do all these colours come together to make a kit that really pops? We’d have preferred to see something that would really set Bahrain Victorious apart in a peloton which is rife with white kits (UAE Team Emirates, we’re looking at you) and so many sponsor logos have, in some ways, reduced the impact of the jersey. Still, it’s not a bad effort.</div>\n<div></div>\n<h3>Cofidis</h3>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GA2RnD2WIAAVrG4_1024x1024.jpg?v=1702483884\" /></span><em><span>Image: Cofidis/Capucine Pourre</span></em></p>\n<p><span>If something works, why change it? Cofidis are one of the few teams so far who have stuck to the same jersey design for the 2024 season after they gave the kit a big upgrade ahead of 2023. With the dark red body and white sleeves, the Cofidis kit is smart and eye-catching, and we can see why they didn’t want to change things. The team also had the pressure of designing a French national champion jersey for Victoire Berteau, but we’re not sure they’ve quite hit the mark with this. The white sleeve detract from the colours of the French flag – keeping these blue would have been a nicer touch. That’s being picky, though, overall the Cofidis kit is a good one and we haven’t got many complaints. At least sticking to the same jersey might cut down on waste for the 2024 season, too.</span></p>\n<h3>UAE Team Emirates</h3>\n<p><span>So far, so safe. UAE Team Emirates are another team that hasn’t really pushed the boat out when it comes to their 2024 kit design. They’ve stuck with the usual white base colour and have even extended it so that the sleeves of the jersey are now white too, a move away from the black which has been used in previous seasons. The team launched the kit with the slogan: ‘pure white, pure speed’ and it’s hard to argue with the speed part when considering the success of the Emirati team in the 2023 season. Tadej  <span>Pogačar</span> will, no doubt, also be relieved that he’ll still get the chance to wear white next season despite him finally no longer being eligible for the white jersey competition at the Tour de France – a classification he has won for the last three years.<img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GA5gSUxXUAAb91M_1024x1024.jpg?v=1702484047\" /><em><span>Image: UAE Team Emirates/Alen Milavec</span></em></span></p>\n<p><span>Aside from the switch up to the sleeves, the main ‘Emirates’ logo on the jersey is now smaller and doesn’t wrap around the entire front of the jersey and the kit designers, Pissei, have also added some artistic touches to the bottom of the kit. There are now stripes on the jersey in the colours of the United Arab Emirates flag – the first pops of colour ever really seen on the UAE Team Emirates kit. For a squad that’s known for playing it pretty safe with their kit designs, 2024 sees them shimmy towards a slightly more eye-catching outfit, but there’s still work that could be done to help this jersey pop a little more.</span></p>\n<h3>Ineos Grenadiers</h3>\n<p><span>2024 will be a year of change for the Ineos Grenadiers in many ways. It’s not just long standing staff members like Rod Ellingworth and Dave Brailsford who will bid farewell to the British team ahead of next season, the team’s former kit sponsor, Bioracer, will also say goodbye. Replacing them is Spanish brand Gobik, who have taken their new role as kit suppliers very seriously by the looks of the recently released 2024 kit. While it’s not a total departure from the Ineos Grenadiers colours we’ve seen them wear over the last couple of seasons, the new Gobik kit is a definite change for the team who will be hoping for a change in fortune as well as jersey in 2024.<img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Gobik-INEOS-26-large_1024x1024.jpg?v=1702400052\" /><i>Image: Ineos Grenadiers</i></span></p>\n<p>The kit features a combination of orange, red and black and addition of some shadows stripes on the front of the jersey. While the previous kit featured navy blue shorts, Gobik opted for traditional black shorts in 2024, featuring simple white logos to represent the team’s key sponsors such as Ineos and Pinarello. The Ineos Grenadiers have previously also been seen wearing fluorescent orange training kit – it’s not clear whether this will continue in 2024, especially given that the colour on the new jersey appears to be much brighter than the darker red on the team’s previous Bioracer kit. We’re big supporters of bold colours and the bright orange on the new Ineos kit certainly ticks that box – this team won’t be missed in the peloton next season.</p>\n<h3>Bora-Hansgrohe</h3>\n<p>Well... it certainly stands out. As Bora-Hansgrohe wave goodbye to Le Col as their clothing sponsor and Sportful come back on board to make the German team's 2024 kit, they introduce a fresh, unique shade to the jersey. It's not a huge step away from the colours that Bora wore in 2023, but the light spash of yellowy green on the left shoulder is a bit of a change – and it's certainly not going to be to everyone's taste. Even bolder than the slime green shoulder are the dark green bib tights and shorts, as well as <span>luminous</span> green socks to complete the 2024 outfit – it's not for the faint hearted, but at least it's going to be visible in the peloton.<img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GBYHFZyXgAAkfQ6_1024x1024.jpg?v=1702989208\" /><em>Image: Matthis Waetzel</em></p>\n<p>With the hotly anticipated signing of Primož Roglič for the 2024, the team will be hoping that the Slovenian rider is going to deliver on the hype that he brings with him, taking that yellowy shoulder to plenty of podiums. The likes of Jai Hindley and Sergio Higuita are also amongst Bora's hopes when it comes to the Grand Tours as the team tries to compete with Jumbo-Visma and UAE Team Emirates. With <span>Roglič on board, Bora's chances of taking yellow are greatly elevated, and the <em>maillot jaune</em> would be definitely be an improvement on this team jersey. All we can say is it's a good job it's not a fashion contest.</span></p>\n<h3>Soudal–Quick-Step</h3>\n<p>While the kit reveal video of Julian Alaphilippe lip syncing to Céline Dion’s ‘It’s all coming back to me now’ certainly elevates Soudal-Quick Step a couple of places in our 2024 WorldTour team kit rankings, it did somewhat over-hype the design itself. There’s very little change to the Belgian team’s kit compared to last year, as they stick to that classic navy blue base and the red stripe which has become synonymous with Soudal, a long term sponsor of Patrick Levefere’s squad. The white section across the front of the jersey now fades into blue messily, rather than having a solid transition like last year’s kit, but otherwise it’s a tough game of spot the difference when it comes to Soudal–Quick-Step’s new jersey.<img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Soudal_Quick-Step_2024_Jersey_2_1024x1024.jpg?v=1702990044\" /><em><span>Image: Wout Beel/Soudal–Quick-Step</span></em></p>\n<p><span>In some ways, keeping the jersey similar to its predecessor makes sense: it helps fans follow the team and allows continuity in a sport which can sometimes be complicated and confusing for newcomers. On the other hand, it means we don’t have much to write about for this article, and it’s slightly anticlimactic when backed by disco lights and smoke machines. Julian Alaphilippe will debut the team’s new kit at the Tour Down Under where he will no doubt race with as much panache as he danced with in that – now viral – kit reveal video. </span></p>\n<h3>Astana Qazaqstan Team</h3>\n<p>Will it be in this jersey that Mark Cavendish gets the fairytale ending to his career that he – and many others – are dreaming of? Astana have stuck to the similar, marble-style pattern that has been a hit with fans over the past year and that bright blue hue also remains. The team says that the design “comes from the colour affinity with the blue of the sky and the gold of the sun, as well as with elements of the flag of Kazakhstan.”<img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Biemme-1_1024x1024.jpg?v=1702994049\" /><em>Image: Astana Qazaqstan</em></p>\n<p>It’s not a bad design but similarly to the 2024 Quick Step kit, it’s not much change from the current jersey, either. It certainly seems to be a growing trend amongst WorldTour teams to stick to what they know when it comes to colours and patterns with the aim of better fan retention. If Cav secures his 36th Tour de France stage win in this kit, we can’t imagine Astana will need any help with selling some replica jerseys.</p>\n<h3>Team SD Worx</h3>\n<p><span>Another year, another pink get-up for the world’s very best women’s team, SD Worx. The Belgian outfit had a season of epic proportions in 2023 with wins in the Tour de France Femmes and the World Championships. HR and payroll specialists, SD Worx, have certainly got plenty of bang for their buck when it comes to the number of eyes on their logo which sits front and centre on the team’s jersey. In 2024, SD Worx have stuck to a similar design to the year before but have added a bit of interest with a white, geometric pattern on the bottom right side of the kit. </span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/unnamed-_16_1024x1024.jpg?v=1703068471\" /></span><em><span>Image: Team SD Worx/Getty</span></em></p>\n<p><span>Aside from that, it’s a collage of orange, red, purple and pink colours on the jersey, paired with some plain black shorts to make an outfit that certainly allows the team to stand out in the peloton. Based on their 2023 performances, the team’s riding style will likely do this on its own, however, as the likes of Demi Vollering, Lotte Kopecky, Lorena Wiebes and Marlen Reusser will be hoping for more big wins to add to their already illustrious book of results.</span></p>\n<h3>Israel-Premier Tech</h3>\n<p><span>From abstract and artistic to bold and sharp, Israel-Premier Tech’s 2024 kit is certainly a change from last year’s outfit, though with the same themes prominent throughout. The team have taken inspiration from their 2023 Giro d’Italia special edition jersey with navy as the base of the design and accents of light blue and white on the sleeves, based on the Israeli flag. Perhaps the team are hoping that this kit switch up will help them to emulate the impressive string of results they achieved in the 2023 Giro next year – a race where the likes of Derek Gee rode impressively throughout, animating multiple stages.<img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/noA_IPT_-CampGirona_Day2_2023_298-2-2048x1365_1024x1024.jpg?v=1703069282\" /></span><em><span>Image: Israel-Premier Tech</span></em></p>\n<p><span>The light blue sleeves have also been added with the aim of helping the team better stand out in the peloton, visible from a helicopter shot during races. Geometric patterning on the front of the kit and the blue helmets combine to make the Israel-Premier Tech kit one of the most striking in the peloton, manufacturers Ekoï have done a solid job here to bring a fresh update while also keeping the team identifiable with its previous kit.</span></p>\n<h3><strong>Team Visma | Lease a Bike</strong></h3>\n<p><span>Team Visma | Lease a Bike’s 2024 team kit is an almost ominous symbol of intent to their rivals when it comes to next year’s Tour de France. The yellow jersey is the biggest prize in cycling – one that this team is becoming very good at winning – but why only wear it in one race of the season? Asserting their status as the best men’s squad in the world this year, Team Visma have gone for an eye-catching sunshine number as their outfit all year round, waving goodbye to the black middle section of the jersey that was seen on last season’s kit. The honeycomb patterning on the bottom of the jersey is the main bit of interest, alongside the team’s main sponsors Visma and Lease a Bike. The shorts remain plain black as usual, helping the jersey to really pop.<img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Medium-Trainingsbeeld_shirt_2024_1024x1024.jpg?v=1703167081\" /></span><em><span>Image: Bram Berkien/</span><span>Team Visma | Lease a Bike</span></em></p>\n<p><span>Wout van Aert said in the team’s press release: “the brighter colour makes us stand out even more. Additionally, this year we have a nice, clean shirt. It looks very well crafted.\" Who are we to argue with WVA himself? And, to be honest, it seems that regardless of the jersey design, Jumbo-Visma are on track for another season where they could dominate races across the board, getting that bright kit across the line first far more often than their rivals would like.</span></p>\n<h3>Ceratizit-WNT</h3>\n<p><span>There’s not much new about Ceratizit-WNT’s 2024 outfit – it was first seen at the Tour de France Femmes last year and the team has opted to keep it the same for the year ahead. The jersey design is simple yet effective with a solid blue body and red sleeves, as well as some diamond patterning in a darker navy along the front. The Ceratizit logo is certainly loud and proud, plastered along the sleeves in a font that looks a little bit too big for the space it is occupying.  The simplicity of the logo being the only lettering on the front of the kit is striking, though, and it’s certainly not the messy web of sponsors seen on some other outfits. </span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GC5zjXaWUAANSR3_1024x1024.jpg?v=1704289851\" /></span><em><span>Image: Ceratizit-WNT</span></em></p>\n<p><span>We also enjoy how the jersey fades into the navy shorts though, almost giving the shorts and jersey a skinsuit-like appearance when worn together. It was a positive year for the German squad in 2023 with Cédrine Kerbaol winning the white jersey at the Tour de France Femmes, and they will be aiming for even more in 2024. British track sensation Katie Archibald also remains in the team for another year, and it’s a big year for the Scot with the Olympics coming up.</span></p>\n<h3>FDJ-SUEZ</h3>\n<p><span>Proudly a French squad, we didn’t expect anything other than a blue, white and red kit for FDJ-SUEZ in 2024. There’s no huge changes from last year’s kit, though the team’s jersey makers, Gobik, have added a little bit of interest to spice things up slightly for the year ahead. Rather than a solid blue base, the kit now incorporates a sort of wave design across the jersey and the kit reveal was accompanied by the team writing they are “on a new wave” next season”... edgy?<img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GCwj6hqXsAAPQ5_1024x1024.jpg?v=1704290488\" /></span><em><span>Image: FDJ-SUEZ</span></em></p>\n<p><span>Other than the added patterning on the front of the kit, FDJ-SUEZ have kept things pretty safe with the bottom of the jersey fading into plain black shorts that house the logos of key sponsors in white. The red shoulder of the jersey completes the French-flag inspired look, and FDJ-SUEZ will be hoping that the French national champion comes from their outfit in 2024, after Marie Le Net and Jade Wiel finished in second and third place for the team last year. Aside from that, the likes of Cecilie Uttrup Ludwig and Grace Brown will also be dreaming of getting plenty of success in this wavy kit in the year to come.</span></p>\n<p><em>Cover i<span>mage: Bram Berkien/Team Visma | Lease a Bike</span></em></p>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Rouleur Media","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"c92b2bddb75502b4d6d11a051aed26650bb2c49b73c076ba1505a587b72ecd41","category":"Cycling"}
