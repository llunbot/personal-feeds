The top difficulty is Mythic, where the semi-pro hardcore guilds compete. Below that is Heroic, where serious, capital-G gamers coordinate with friends in weekly raid schedules to progress. Then there's Normal, which still requires some coordination but isn't nearly as challenging and can typically be completed by a pick-up group within a few tries.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050728#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050728&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bfc9add69b8be146daedf36be9735cc86a9155b3b182dc3b7ec9a43f5066c54d","category":"Tech"}
