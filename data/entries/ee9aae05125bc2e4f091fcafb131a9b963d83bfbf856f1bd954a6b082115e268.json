Apple verdict clears the way for app creators to\nchoose an alternative to Apple’s payment system (and its 15-30%\nfee!). But choose the wrong provider and you’ll be burdened with\nmanaging payment and subscription logic, taxes, fraud, and buyer\nsupport.</p>\n\n<p>Paddle In-App Purchase will let app creators replace Apple’s\nIn-App Purchase without worrying about any of that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Paddle is charging a 10 percent commission for transactions under $10, and 5 percent plus $0.50 per transaction at or above $10.</p>\n\n<p>It’s unclear to me exactly how Paddle’s SDK works. They’re calling it “in-app purchase”, but <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/07/developers-building-ways-to-skirt-apples-cut-of-in-app-purchases.html\">it sounds like it redirects to Paddle’s website</a> in Safari (or whatever your default browser on iOS is). If it redirects to a website, I think it might be allowed; if they’re processing transactions in-app, it’s not going to be allowed.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/10/07/paddle-in-app-purchase\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"ee9aae05125bc2e4f091fcafb131a9b963d83bfbf856f1bd954a6b082115e268","category":"Tech"}
