All of these AirPods models were previously on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/24/apple-releases-airpods-pro-2-firmware-7b19/\">firmware version 7B19</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/AirPods-Pro-Firmware-Feature.jpg\" width=\"2322\" height=\"1306\" />\r<br />\nIt is not immediately clear what new features or changes are included in firmware versions 7B20 and 7B21, but we will update this story if we find out.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLast month's firmware version 7B19 enabled new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/21/ios-18-1-hearing-aid-feature/\">hearing aid, hearing test, and hearing protection features</a> on AirPods Pro 2 when paired with an iPhone or iPad running iOS 18.1 or iPadOS 18.1 or later. Availability of these features <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/airpods-pro/feature-availability/\">varies by country</a>. Apple's release notes never indicated what that firmware version added to the AirPods 4.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere is no way to manually force the installation of a firmware update on AirPods. Firmware updates are generally installed over-the-air when the AirPods are in a charging case and connected to an iOS device or a Mac.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<strong>Update:</strong> Apple says firmware versions 7B20 and 7B21 include \"bug fixes and other improvements.\" No further details were provided.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods 4</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro\">AirPods Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/11/airpods-and-airpods-pro-firmware-update/\">Apple Releases Firmware Updates for AirPods Pro 2 and AirPods 4</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-firmware-updates-for-airpods-pro-2-and-airpods-4.2442653/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4fb10ac070f1d90092ffb76f788636a15b1709261199dd0a059464be0a6cfda3","category":"Apple"}
