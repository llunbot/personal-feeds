Isaac del Toro leads the way with teammate Juan Ayuso in second.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But behind the UAE Team Emirates pairing, a whole host of strong riders are within three minutes of the <em><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-d-italia-why-jersey-pink\">maglia rosa</a></em> and ready to pounce</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Isaac del Toro and Juan Ayuso (UAE Team Emirates XRG)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215626867-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215626867-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215626867-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215626867-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215626867-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215626867-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215626867-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215626867-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215626867.webp 1024w\" /><figcaption>Luca Bettini/AFP via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>UAE Team Emirates XRG find themselves in a brilliant position. Despite going into the race with Juan Ayuso and Adam Yates as co-leaders it was Isaac del Toro that stepped into the early spotlight, becoming the first Mexican to wear the pink jersey in the race’s 116-year history after his spectacular performance on the gravel of Stage 9.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the days tick by, questions have arisen on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/isaac-del-toro-2025-giro-ditalia\">whether the 21-year-old could win the Giro d’Italia</a> on debut – something verging on unthinkable at the start in Albania. After all, it’s only the second Grand Tour of his career, the first with leadership duties (planned or not), and the first with pressure on heading into the final week. He has answered everything thrown at him so far though and is still extending his lead bit by bit with bonus seconds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sitting behind him on the general classification is Juan Ayuso. A previous Grand Tour podium finisher, Ayuso is the more proven of the two despite only being a year older and is still expected to ‘take over the reigns’ if Del Toro struggles. The two also have teammates in Adam Yates and Brandon McNulty not far behind on GC should something go really wrong, but for now, they’re two of the best domestiques in the race.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Currently: 1st and 2nd overall (+38sec)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+4\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-4-970x300.webp\" alt=\"Cyclist banner saying 'the world's best cycling magazine, delivered to your door, click here to subscribe'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-4-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-4-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-4-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-4-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-4-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-4-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-4-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Antonio Tiberi (Bahrain Victorious)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214973816.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214973816.webp 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214973816-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214973816-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214973816-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214973816-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214973816-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214973816-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214973816-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Marco Zac/NurPhoto via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Italy’s hopes for their first Giro d’Italia winner since Vincenzo Nibali in 2016 rest on the shoulders of Antonio Tiberi. After 12th on the opening stage time-trial, Tiberi has been steadily making his way upwards on GC to now sit third overall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He placed fifth overall on his debut in 2024, winning the young rider classification in the process. He has the support of experienced teammates Pello Bilbao and Damiano Caruso to help him through the final week too.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Currently: 3rd (+1min 18sec)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-predictions-2025\">Cyclist’s Giro d’Italia 2025 predictions</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-favourites\">Who are the favourites for the Giro d’Italia 2025?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/how-to-watch-and-live-stream-the-giro-ditalia\">How to watch the Giro d’Italia 2025</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-watch-live-stages-route-riders-teams-start-list\">Giro d’Italia 2025 preview: Route, favourites, how to watch and start list</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Simon Yates (Visma-Lease a Bike)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215622512.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215622512.webp 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215622512-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215622512-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215622512-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215622512-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215622512-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215622512-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215622512-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Luca Bettini/AFP via Getty Image</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Simon Yates has been something of a silent assassin for the first two weeks of the Giro d’Italia. He has drawn little fanfare yet sits fourth overall, still well in contention for the title.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the attention has been on teammates Wout van Aert and Olav Kooij recently after their stage wins but aspirations heading into the decisive point of the race will be high to get Yates onto the podium. He has finished third here previously in 2021 and won the Vuelta a España back in 2018. In his first Grand Tour since moving to Visma-Lease a Bike from Jayco-AlUla, Yates probably couldn’t have asked for much more in the first two weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Currently: 4th (+1min 20sec)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Primož Roglič (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214973999.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214973999.webp 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214973999-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214973999-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214973999-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214973999-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214973999-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214973999-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214973999-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Marco Zac/NurPhoto via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Primož Roglič won the Giro d’Italia in 2023 by just 14 seconds over Geraint Thomas. This year, he has had two brief stints in the <em>maglia rosa</em> but the gravel stage was particularly unforgiving, sending him down the GC to tenth overall after a crash and a puncture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two time-trials have worked in his favour, with the second helping to cut the deficit to Del Toro to get the Slovenian back up into 5th, just a minute and a half down. Rather than taking small bits of time here or there, it feels as though Roglič will have to launch big attacks to take chunks out of his rivals and week three presents the race’s best opportunities to blow the race apart with the likes of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/mortirolo-cycling\">Mortirolo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/colle-delle-finestre-cycling\">Colle delle Finestre</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roglič has lost key lieutenant (and former Giro winner) Jai Hindley from a crash on Stage 6, and last year’s second place Dani Martínez hasn’t looked in top shape so far, so he is relying on Giulio Pellizzari to play a big role in the next week.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Currently: 5th (+1min 35sec)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Richard<strong> </strong>Carapaz (EF Education-EasyPost)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215649812.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215649812.webp 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215649812-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215649812-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215649812-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215649812-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215649812-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215649812-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215649812-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Luca Bettini/AFP via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Richard Carapaz became the first Ecuadorian to win the Giro d’Italia in 2019 and rode to second place in 2022, and after a couple of years outside the big GC action, he has big goals for this race and looks lively, springing a surprise attack on the field to win Stage 11. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He’s sitting comfortably in sixth place at the moment and it’s looking good for a run at the podium for La Locomotora de Carachi. The third week is where he came alive at the Tour de France in 2024 to win the mountains classification, and it’s safe to say we can expect more daring attacks, although he’ll become more of a marked man as the race progresses.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Currently: 6th (+2min 07sec)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Giulio Ciccone (Lidl-Trek)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"1024\" height=\"664\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215744437.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215744437.webp 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215744437-300x195.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215744437-970x629.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215744437-768x498.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2215744437-750x486.webp 750w\" /><figcaption>Dario Belingheri/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Sunglasses-thrower Giulio Ciccone leads the way on GC for Lidl-Trek. The team has been having a phenomenal Giro d’Italia so far thanks to Mads Pedersen, who, when not going for his own chances to win, has been in front of Ciccone wherever possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Italian has never finished inside the top ten of a Grand Tour and will be hoping to change that this time around. He’s adept in the mountains, winning the KOM classification at both the Tour de France and Giro d’Italia, and looks set to finish in Rome with his best GC result yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Currently: 7th overall (+2min 09sec)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Egan Bernal (Ineos Grenadiers)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216261844.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216261844.webp 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216261844-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216261844-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216261844-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216261844-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216261844-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216261844-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216261844-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Tim de Waele / Getty</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Egan Bernal has been showing sparks of the form that helped him win this race in 2021.
