All the wheels are available with either carbon or steel spokes.</p>\n<p>According to Ere Research, its carbon spokes are cured in a stretched state whereas other carbon spokes are cured in a ‘relaxed’ state. Ere’s spokes are said to be less liable to twisting during the wheel-building process as a result.</p>\n<p>The spokes also feature a Zylon fibre core. According to Ere, the inclusion of this super-strong synthetic fibre should prevent the spokes from splitting in two in the event of a crash.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Ere Research Genus wheels\" title=\"Ere Research Genus wheels\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The wheels pay tribute to Edie Van Halen.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>These are laced to the brand’s new Panama hub. The hub uses a 2:1 lacing pattern, which is similar to Fulcrum wheels. This is based on DT Swiss’ now out-of-patent Star Ratchet design.</p>\n<p>As a fun aside, the hubs are named ‘Panama’ as a tribute to the late Eddie Van Halen. Ere Research founder Piet van der Velde also incorporated laser-etched markings on the rim that match Van Halen’s signature Frankenstrat guitar.

According to the brand, this enables it to fine-tune the amount of nylon fibres in the shell to adjust comfort. The overall aesthetic of the saddles has also been updated.</p>\n<h2>Hunt 42 Limitless aero bikepacking wheels</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"New Hunt aero bikepacking wheels\" title=\"New Hunt aero bikepacking wheels\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Aero bikepacking wheels are now a thing (sort of).</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Hunt gave us a sneak peek of its new aero bikepacking/ultra-distance racing wheels.</p>\n<p>The wheels pair a higher spoke count version of the brand’s existing radical 42 Limitless rims with a new hub.</p>\n<p>Like the Ere Research wheels, these new hubs use a ratchet similar to DT Swiss’ Star Ratchet freehub, offering easier field serviceability.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Eurobike Hunt wheels\" title=\"Eurobike Hunt wheels\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Hunt is using a new (but familiar) freehub design.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The wheel was developed following feedback from Hunt’s sponsored athletes who wanted a reliable high-spoke wheel that could be more easily field-serviced than its existing wheels.</p>\n<h2>Merida Scultura Endurance GR</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Merida Scultura Endurance GR\" title=\"Merida Scultura Endurance GR\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Scultura Endurance GR is based on the existing Scultura Endurance frameset.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Nick Clark / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The Merida Scultura Endurance GR is a gravel race bike built around the existing <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/merida-scultura-endurance-rival-edition-review/\">Scultura Endurance</a> road bike.</p>\n<p>Merida says the bike is aimed at gravel racing and grand fondo riding and is specced with 35mm Continental Terra Speed tyre.</p>\n<p>Two versions of the carbon frame are available – the entry-level 5000 and the premium 8000.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Merida Scultura Endurance GR\" title=\"Merida Scultura Endurance GR\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The bike is compatible with mudguards.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Nick Clark / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>It is possible to mount a front and rear mudguard to the bike, with a removable bridge on the rear seat stays and mounting point on the fork.</p>\n<p>Merida’s Disc Cooler technology features on the front fork, which the brand says helps regulate temperature on long descents.</p>\n<p>The brand says the frameset is compatible with a 27.2mm dropper post, which can be set up using the internal cable routing.</p>\n<p>Merida has also given the bike flared handlebars for a more comfortable hand position.</p>","author":"Stan Portus","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"961bb8977dff4b523fc0b0bb2490ff170024aafdc7a1c3ce35a6eeb1bd58eb20","category":"Cycling"}
