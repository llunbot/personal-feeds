{"title":"You Can Select a Preferred Home Hub in iOS 18","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/14/ios-18-preferred-home-hub/","date":1718400120000,"content":"The Home app in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a> allows <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/\">HomeKit</a> users who have more than one device that serves as a home hub to select which one should be used as the preferred hub. It is a small but useful change because it prevents ‌HomeKit‌ from choosing a hub that is further away from most ‌HomeKit‌ products or that has a weaker connection. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/homekit-showdown-2-thumb.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nIn <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a> and earlier, there has been no way to select a home hub, and ‌HomeKit‌ has picked randomly. That can lead to connectivity issues in some situations. For those who do not care about which home hub ‌HomeKit‌ selects, Automatic Selection remains an option.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a> are able to serve as home hubs, but the option to set a preferred hub seems to be limited to the ‌Apple TV‌ as of right now, because Apple has not yet provided a ‌HomePod‌ beta to developers. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/preferred-home-hub-ios-18.jpg\" width=\"672\" height=\"767\" /><em><div><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeKit/comments/1df0nkg/new_preferred_home_hub_in_ios18/\">Image from Reddit</a></div></em>\r<br />\nOther features coming in ‌HomeKit‌ include Customize Access for managing how and when people access devices like alarm systems, door locks, and garage door openers, with support for guest schedules. There's also a new Express Mode for unlocking door locks automatically as you approach, and support for robot vacuum cleaners is set to come later this year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/\">HomeKit</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/14/ios-18-preferred-home-hub/\">You Can Select a Preferred Home Hub in iOS 18</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/you-can-select-a-preferred-home-hub-in-ios-18.2429237/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2da26adbfdba953c7af0b65483c0e11c38a406afb348d72a352004647dcd01d5","category":"Apple"}
