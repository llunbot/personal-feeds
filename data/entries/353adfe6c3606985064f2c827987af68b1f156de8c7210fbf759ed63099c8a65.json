Both new sizes will come in black and tan sidewall options, and they carry the same $75 price point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you haven’t tried them, ENVE’s tires are more than just a rebadged item to give them a matching logo around their wheels. They’re designed in the wind tunnel to enhance system aerodynamics when paired with their SES wheels, using both shape and tread pattern to reduce drag.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/enve-ses-tubeless-road-bike-tires-33-35mm-widths-2.jpg\"><img width=\"2257\" height=\"1102\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/enve-ses-tubeless-road-bike-tires-33-35mm-widths-2.jpg\" alt=\"new enve road bike tire sizes shown with black or tan sidewalls\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/enve-ses-tubeless-road-bike-tires-33-35mm-widths-2.jpg 2257w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/enve-ses-tubeless-road-bike-tires-33-35mm-widths-2-297x145.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/enve-ses-tubeless-road-bike-tires-33-35mm-widths-2-800x391.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/enve-ses-tubeless-road-bike-tires-33-35mm-widths-2-120x59.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/enve-ses-tubeless-road-bike-tires-33-35mm-widths-2-768x375.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/enve-ses-tubeless-road-bike-tires-33-35mm-widths-2-1536x750.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/enve-ses-tubeless-road-bike-tires-33-35mm-widths-2-2048x1000.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They use a natural-and-synthetic rubber compound with activated silica to improve grip. A Vectran barrier protects against punctures, and the tires work with hooked and hookless rims.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These two new sizes round out the portfolio, giving you 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, and 35-millimeter widths. Weights from 255g to 290g per tire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://enve.com/collections/accessories/products/ses-road-tire\" target=\"_blank\">ENVE.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/enve-ses-road-bike-tire-wider-sizes/\">ENVE SES Tubeless Road Tires Add 33 &amp; 35mm Widths</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"353adfe6c3606985064f2c827987af68b1f156de8c7210fbf759ed63099c8a65","category":"Cycling"}
