Yesterday, different security researchers published details on two different vulnerabilities, one affecting multiple generations of Intel processors and another affecting the newest AMD CPUs. \"<a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00828.html\">Downfall</a>\" and \"<a href=\"https://www.amd.com/en/resources/product-security/bulletin/amd-sb-7005.html\">Inception</a>\" (respectively) are different bugs, but both involve modern processors' extensive use of speculative execution (a la the original <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/01/meltdown-and-spectre-every-modern-processor-has-unfixable-security-flaws/\">Meltdown and Spectre bugs</a>), both are described as being of \"medium\" severity, and both can be patched either with OS-level microcode updates or firmware updates with fixes incorporated.</p>\n<p>AMD and Intel have both already released OS-level microcode software updates to address both issues. Both companies have also said that they're not aware of any active in-the-wild exploits of either vulnerability. Consumer, workstation, and server CPUs are all affected, making patching particularly important for server administrators.</p>\n<p>It will be up to your PC, server, or motherboard manufacturer to release firmware updates with the fixes after Intel and AMD make them available.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1959890#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1959890&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5ea118eeed25a9d963a5e8ee65b55a89b9b1726dfff9edc5b4ccfd1741337084","category":"Tech"}
