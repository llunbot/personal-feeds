The new feature marks a notable advancement in mobile audio recording, but it appears it will be unavailable for older iPhones or the standard iPhone 16.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/voice-memos-multitrack.jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nEssentially, the multitrack functionality allows iPhone 16 Pro users to layer one audio track on top of an existing recording, a capability that is likely to be particularly attractive to musicians and songwriters. Users can record an initial track, for example a guitar part, and then add a vocal or another instrument as an overdub.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe way it works is that the Voice Memos app plays the music track through the iPhone's speakers, while simultaneously recording the user's voice. It can then isolate the overdubbed part using what Apple calls \"advanced processing\" and cancel the background music, leaving a \"professional-sounding recording\" without the need for headphones. This means users can effectively separate the layers for individual use or editing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe update addresses a long-standing limitation of the Voice Memos app, which has been a popular tool for quickly capturing musical ideas despite its previously basic functionality. But the feature limitation to Apple's premium Pro models may come as an unwelcome surprise to some.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile Apple hasn't detailed the specific technical requirements that make it exclusive to iPhone 16 Pro models, it's likely that the feature leverages the enhanced processing power of the new A18 Pro chip and the devices' new four studio-quality microphones. The iPhone 16 series launches on September 20, with pre-orders starting on Friday, September 13, but the multitrack recording feature is expected to be available later in the year via a software update. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16-Pro\">iPhone 16 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/13/multitrack-recording-voice-memos-iphone-16-pro/\">New Voice Memos Multitrack Recording Feature Seemingly Exclusive to iPhone 16 Pro</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-voice-memos-multitrack-recording-feature-seemingly-exclusive-to-iphone-16-pro.2436148/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"22a71cd4d21f8fcd23a5c6537b38d3d6ca90b97a0aa2860583772270290f38d2","category":"Apple"}
