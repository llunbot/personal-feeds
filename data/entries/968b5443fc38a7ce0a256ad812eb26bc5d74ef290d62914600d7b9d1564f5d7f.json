We’ve written in the past about how the new structure <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2264246/apple-digital-markets-act-eu-app-store-rules.html\">feels hostile to both users and developers</a>, and the European Commission seemed unsatisfied, further investigating Apple over the summer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, Apple has announced a few changes to its rules for apps that offer payment methods outside the App Store, along with a new fee structure and fee calculator. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new rules were <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=szrqxadx\">announced on Apple’s Developer portal</a>. Apps can now link to offers wherever–another website, multiple websites, other apps, and so on. They are no longer restricted in the interface methods and language used to communicate these offers. Apps that seek to offer outside payment methods must still get and use the StoreKit External Purchase Link Entitlement, however.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rules are less restrictive, but the complex web of fees and commissions doesn’t seem much clearer—the complete terms can be found on <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/support/alternative-payment-options-on-the-app-store-in-the-eu/\">Apple’s developer site</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Developers have to pay a 5 percent “Initial Acquisition Fee” for any new user that makes any purchase. A “Store Services Fee” of 10 percent is charged for all purchases made on any platform, via Apple’s in-app purchases or an external site. In addition, Apple’s controversial “Core Technology Fee” applies to all new app installs. If you’re using Apple’s older standard business terms you don’t have to pay the Core Technology Fee, but the Store Services Fee jumps up to 20% for all payments made through a link out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has updated its <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/support/fee-calculator-for-apps-in-the-eu\">fee calculator</a> for developers with the updated terms to give a better understanding of how much they’ll take from developers in the EU who want to publish apps on iPhone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new terms seem less restrictive with regards to the methods Apple allows developers to use in apps to offer paid content or services, and the fees seem lower at first glance for those using outside payments. It still seems needlessly complex, and it is unclear if the new terms will satisfy the European Commission or developers who may simply want the ability to offer up apps on iPhone, and monetize them, without paying Apple for the privilege—just as they can on the Mac.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"968b5443fc38a7ce0a256ad812eb26bc5d74ef290d62914600d7b9d1564f5d7f","category":"Apple"}
