Jarrod Bunk, owner of Pennsylvania’s <a href=\"https://hopecyclery.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Hope Cyclery</a>, and Casey Clark, bike mechanic/potter extraordinaire who also owns and operates California’s <a href=\"https://www.greatbasinpottery.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Great Basin Pottery</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It turns out that building a small independent bike shop, like Hope Cyclery kept Jarrod too busy to do both, so Casey bought out Jarrod’s share and is now the sole operator of Camp and Go Slow.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a
