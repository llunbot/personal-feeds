The more road-relevant discipline of sports prototypes also began dabbling with electrified powertrains around the same time, with the first win for a hybrid car at Le Mans coming in 2012.</p>\n<p>The budgets involved for those programs were extravagant, though. Until it instituted a cost cap, F1 team budgets stretched to hundreds of millions of dollars a year. In endurance racing, Audi and Porsche spent comparable amounts on their hybrid WEC campaigns, and while Toyota managed to make do with much less, even it was spending more than $80 million a year in the mid-2010s.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/11/racing-turns-its-back-on-heavy-expensive-hybrids-for-sustainable-fuel/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/11/racing-turns-its-back-on-heavy-expensive-hybrids-for-sustainable-fuel/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
