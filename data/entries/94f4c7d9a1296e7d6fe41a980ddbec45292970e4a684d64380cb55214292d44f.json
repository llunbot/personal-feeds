But you'd be forgiven for thinking that some of them are a little samey as automaker after automaker releases yet another electric crossover. This makes sense—consumers mostly want crossovers, as they combine hatchback practicality and a more elevated driving position. But the sedan isn't quite dead yet, and now there's another electric one for your consideration: the 2023 Hyundai Ioniq 6.</p>\n<p>The Ioniq 6 is the latest in a series of new EVs to use Hyundai Motor Group's new <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/12/everything-we-know-about-hyundai-and-kias-new-electric-vehicle-platform/\">E-GMP architecture</a>. Designed from scratch, E-GMP lets Hyundai (and Kia and Genesis) build medium- and larger EVs with rear- or all-wheel drive powertrains. E-GMP battery packs operate at 800 V, which provides several benefits. The higher voltage means a lower current, which translates to thinner wiring, which reduces overall mass. And it's capable of very rapid DC charging—just 18 minutes to get from 10 to 80 percent when plugged into a 350 kW fast charger.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-Hyundai-Ioniq-6-3-scaled.jpg\"><img alt=\"Active shutters at the front let air into the car when it needs cooling and close when it's more important to be slippery through the air.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-Hyundai-Ioniq-6-3-980x735.jpg\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-Hyundai-Ioniq-6-3-scaled.jpg\">Active shutters at the front let air into the car when it needs cooling and close when it's more important to be slippery through the air.</a> (credit: Jonathan Gitlin)</p></div>\n<p>None of that will be news if you've read our reviews on other E-GMP EVs like the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/08/the-2023-genesis-gv60-is-a-strong-contender-for-ev-of-the-year/\">Genesis GV60</a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/01/kias-new-ev6-electric-crossover-goes-straight-to-the-head-of-the-pack/\">Kia EV6</a>, or the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/12/the-hyundai-ioniq-5-is-the-best-ev-weve-driven-in-2021/\">Hyundai Ioniq 5</a>.
