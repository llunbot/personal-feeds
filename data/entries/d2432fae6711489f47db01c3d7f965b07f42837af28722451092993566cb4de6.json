{"title":"Microsoft Introduces ‘Copilot+ PCs’","link":"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2024/05/20/introducing-copilot-pcs/","date":1716258936000,"content":"\n<p>Microsoft today held an event on the eve of their Build developer conference to introduce their new “AI first” class of PCs, which they’re calling Copilot+ PCs. The event video is not on YouTube (yet?), and the URL (<a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/event\">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/event</a>) is not a permalink.</p>\n\n<p>The most notable new Windows feature is Recall (which conceptually seems much like <a href=\"https://www.rewind.ai/\">Rewind</a>, which has been available as a third-party app for MacOS for a while now):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We set out to solve one of the most frustrating problems we\nencounter daily — finding something we know we have seen before\non our PC. Today, we must remember what file folder it was stored\nin, what website it was on, or scroll through hundreds of emails\ntrying to find it.</p>\n\n<p>Now with Recall, you can access virtually what you have seen or\ndone on your PC in a way that feels like having photographic\nmemory. Copilot+ PCs organize information like we do — based on\nrelationships and associations unique to each of our individual\nexperiences. This helps you remember things you may have forgotten\nso you can find what you’re looking for quickly and intuitively by\nsimply using the cues you remember. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Recall leverages your personal semantic index, built and stored\nentirely on your device. Your snapshots are yours; they stay\nlocally on your PC. You can delete individual snapshots, adjust\nand delete ranges of time in Settings, or pause at any point right\nfrom the icon in the System Tray on your Taskbar. You can also\nfilter apps and websites from ever being saved. You are always in\ncontrol with privacy you can trust.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Recall can “view” and remember everything that appears on screen because it’s integrated with the Windows 11 graphics system. That’s the sort of “AI feature” that truly benefits from being a first-party solution that can integrate at lower levels of the OS than third-party apps can.</p>\n\n<p>One of the more impressive demos they showed was using Copilot as a voice-driven assistant <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6LW8MCrUQ8\">that helps you cooperatively play Minecraft</a>. The game still gets the entire GPU for graphics because Copilot is running on the NPU.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/05/20/microsoft-introduces-copilot-plus-pcs\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d2432fae6711489f47db01c3d7f965b07f42837af28722451092993566cb4de6","category":"Tech"}
