While it is theoretically possible to offload fuel from these vehicles for a future launch attempt, multiple sources told Ars that such an activity would incur significant risk to the spacecraft.</p>\n<p>Forced to make a call on whether to fuel, NASA decided not to. Although the two spacecraft were otherwise ready for launch, it was not clear the New Glenn rocket would be similarly ready to go.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048029#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048029&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f4f9db3e97637352fc771cd5b0b8aaa64026dad563fee30218c7093cbb311a05","category":"Tech"}
