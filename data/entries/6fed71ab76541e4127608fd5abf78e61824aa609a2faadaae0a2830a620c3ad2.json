And with Black Friday </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple rarely discounts its own products–even during its annual <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672787/apple-black-friday.html\">Black Friday shopping event</a>, running Thursday, November 29, to Monday, December 1, it traditionally elects to give out gift cards rather than actual price reductions. It also offers <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670705/how-to-get-an-apple-student-discount-at-apples-education-store.html\">year-round discounts to students</a>, including a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673191/apple-back-school-sale.html\">Back To School event</a> where students can get up to $150 in gift cards when purchasing certain Apple products. There’s also the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Refurbished Store</a> where you can sometimes grab a bargain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you want a new Apple device right now, other stores often offer up Apple discounts worth grabbing. In this article, you’ll find real-time pricing at all major retailers for Apple’s current lineup, and we’ve also highlighted some of the top discounts each week. Plus, for even more deals, we’ve linked to our dedicated deals round-ups for each product category. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use the table of contents to jump to the best deals right now for the Apple product you want—including the new iPhone 16, Apple Watch Series 10, AirPods 4, iPad mini, and all the M4 Macs, which were announced this fall.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best AirPods deals</h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/airpods-pro2-hero.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"AirPods Pro 2\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/airpods-pro2-hero.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 5039w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/airpods-pro2-hero.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/airpods-pro2-hero.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/airpods-pro2-hero.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/airpods-pro2-hero.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/airpods-pro2-hero.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/airpods-pro2-hero.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/airpods-pro2-hero.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673885/airpods-pro-lite-release-date-price-specs-rumours.html\">New AirPods</a> were announced by Apple in September 2024.
