{"title":"Jason Snell: ‘The Mac Turns 40’","link":"https://www.theverge.com/24048479/apple-mac-40-anniversary","date":1706146351000,"content":"\n<p>Jason Snell, writing for The Verge:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Twenty years ago, on the Mac’s 20th anniversary, I <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/169580/themacturns20jobs.html\">asked Steve \nJobs</a> if the Mac would still be relevant to Apple in the age \nof the iPod. He scoffed at the prospect of the Mac not being \nimportant: “of course” it would be. </p>\n\n<p>Yet, 10 years later, Apple’s revenue was increasingly dominated by \nthe iPhone, and the recent success of the new iPad had provided \nanother banner product for the company. When I interviewed Apple \nexec Phil Schiller for the Mac’s 30th anniversary, I found myself \nasking him about the Mac’s relevance, too. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/222761/apple-executives-on-the-mac-at-30-the-mac-keeps-going-forever.html\">He also scoffed</a>: \n“Our view is, the Mac keeps going forever,” he said. </p>\n\n<p>Today marks 40 years since Jobs unveiled the original Macintosh at \nan event in Cupertino, and it once again feels right to ask what’s \nnext for the Mac. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The subhead on Snell’s piece at The Verge nails it:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple’s longest-running product is an increasingly small part of \nthe company’s business. And yet, it’s never been more successful. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Over at Six Colors, Snell has more from <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/01/mac-40-a-quick-qa-with-greg-joswiak/\">an interview with Greg Joswiak</a>, and, separately, a deep dive <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/01/mac-at-40-the-eras-tour/\">looking back at the major eras of the Mac’s history</a>, dividing them by processor architecture. From that piece:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The IBM PC and the emerging DOS PC clone standard weren’t the only \nenemies here. Plenty of other platforms existed in the early days, \nincluding the one that generated most of Apple’s revenue, the \nApple II. </p>\n\n<p>History tends to flatten everything into simple narratives, so you \nmight expect that the moment the Mac was introduced, Apple began \npivoting away from the Apple II. That did <em>not</em> happen. Apple \ndidn’t discontinue the last Apple II model until nearly a decade \ninto the Mac’s existence. After the Mac was introduced, Apple kept \nintroducing new Apple II models: The compact IIc three months \nlater and the 16-bit IIGS more than two years later. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Mac was a curiosity for me, growing up in the 1980s — intriguing, but it was the Apple II platform that had my attention (and heart) at the time. Then, when I finally got my first Mac in 1991 (a Macintosh LC with 4 MB of RAM and a 40 MB hard disk), I <em>got it</em>. It was like turning on a light in a dark room. I finally understood.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/24/snell-mac-40\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"4708d2daebdc7323db79f9beaa4bd6bd82b9fff8f97ef82ddac2b3d1fdce4410","category":"Tech"}
