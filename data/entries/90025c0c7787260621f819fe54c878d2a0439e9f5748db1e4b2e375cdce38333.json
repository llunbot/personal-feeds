Back then, the show was firmly attached to the webcomic Penny Arcade (also a Seattle creation), but the show's reputation grew quickly enough to become a multi-day, multi-building extravaganza.</p>\n<p>Ever since, the fest formula has been increasingly divorced from its comic origins. The PAX model has officially duplicated and been liberally borrowed in other regions. In recent years, of course, a little worldwide dilemma got in the way.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1791988#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1791988&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"90025c0c7787260621f819fe54c878d2a0439e9f5748db1e4b2e375cdce38333","category":"Tech"}
