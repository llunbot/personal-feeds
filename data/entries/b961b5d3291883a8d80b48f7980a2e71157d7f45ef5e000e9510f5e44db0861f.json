(Yes, before we get any further, Lenovo's ThinkPad generational designations don't align with Intel's processor designation, so a Gen 10 ThinkPad uses a 12th-gen Intel CPU, and the Gen 11 ThinkPad uses a 13th-gen CPU.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://howl.me/cj2M8A2AVDu\" target=\"_blank\">This year's Gen 11 X1 Carbon refresh</a> mainly has one job: retain all the good stuff about last year's refresh and the X1 Carbon lineup generally but get the battery life closer to where it was before. The Gen 11 partially does that job. That means the performance gains from last year are negligible (and sometimes even a small step backward). It's an acceptable sacrifice for improved battery life, and the X1 Carbon is still one of the best all-around portable laptops you can buy. It's just that the Gen 11 model still can't quite manage to feel like an across-the-board upgrade from the Gen 9 X1 Carbon from two years ago.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1948838#p3\">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1948838&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b961b5d3291883a8d80b48f7980a2e71157d7f45ef5e000e9510f5e44db0861f","category":"Tech"}
