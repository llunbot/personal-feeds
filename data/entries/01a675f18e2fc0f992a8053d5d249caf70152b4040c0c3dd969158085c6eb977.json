It has an 11-inch screen, a fingerprint reader, and an optional keyboard and stylus package. Usually, Fire tablets are cheap consumption devices, but now maybe you can be productive on one?</p>\n<p>The tablet starts at $229.99, with the \"productivity bundle\"—the tablet plus the keyboard and stylus—clocking in at $329.99, or exactly the price of a 9th-gen iPad. <a href=\"https://developer.amazon.com/docs/fire-tablets/ft-device-specifications-firehd-models.html?v=firemax11_2023\">For specs</a>, the display is an 11-inch, 2000×1200 60 Hz LCD, and it has 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage (with an option for 128GB), and a \"14-hour\" battery of unknown size with 15 W charging (you'll only get a 9 W charger in the box, though). The SoC is a Mediatek MT8188J. That's an 8-core chip with two Arm Cortex A78 CPUs (those are the \"medium\" size CPUs in 2021's Snapdragon 8 Gen 1) and six junky Cortex A55 CPUs for background duty. The GPU is an ARM G57 MC2.</p>\n<p>The fingerprint reader is on the side power button. There's also a MicroSD slot for extra storage. The keyboard connects to the tablet via pogo pins that power the keyboard and provide communication. The keyboard isn't backlit. It supports Wi-Fi 6 and sports front and back 8 MP cameras.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1941769#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1941769&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"01a675f18e2fc0f992a8053d5d249caf70152b4040c0c3dd969158085c6eb977","category":"Tech"}
