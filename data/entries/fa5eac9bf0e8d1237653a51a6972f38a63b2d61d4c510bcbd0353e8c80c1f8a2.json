According to PNW, the Range is the only dropper post that checks in at 200mm of travel for the $159 price tag. Better yet, you can pick up the Range bundle for $199 – that’s the dropper post, lever, and a full cable and housing kit, and it comes with a lifetime warranty. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-packaging.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"964\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-packaging.jpeg\" alt=\"PNW Compnents Range Dropper and Lever Bundle packaging\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-packaging.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-packaging-297x224.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-packaging-120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-packaging-768x578.jpeg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos / Ron Frazelle)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Range Dropper Post and Lever are an expansion into the PNW Components’ durable and affordable Range family.

So, let’s get to it. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Range Dropper Lever</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail: $54 (by itself with optional cable/housing kit) It comes in black with a black thumb pad. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-Lever-in-package-e1721088240341.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"684\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-Lever-in-package-e1721088240341.jpeg\" alt=\"PNW Compnents Range Dropper and Lever Bundle Lever in package\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-Lever-in-package-e1721088240341.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-Lever-in-package-e1721088240341-297x159.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-Lever-in-package-e1721088240341-120x64.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-Lever-in-package-e1721088240341-768x410.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Range Lever is a lot like its brother, the Loam Lever. In fact, you might be happy to know that the Range Lever uses the same fan-favorite silicone thumb pad that’s on the more expensive counterpart, the Loam Lever. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Differences from the PNW Loam Lever</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>The Loam Lever is made using a 5-axis CNC machine, which gives PNW more control over optimizing shaping, tolerances, and weight. The Range Lever is made using forging, a much more affordable process.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sporting more adjustments, the Loam Lever makes it easy to dial in your cockpit setup. The Range Lever doesn’t have the same amount of adjustments.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Lastly, the Loam lever is more expensive at $69 compared to the Range Lever at $49.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Forged out of durable, lightweight 6061 aluminum, the 45-gram Range lever looks very good, having a great fit and finish. The internal sealed pivot bearing allows for remarkably light action.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Installing the Range Lever</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-getting-the-lever-mounted.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"964\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-getting-the-lever-mounted.jpeg\" alt=\"PNW Compnents Range Dropper and Lever Bundle getting the lever mounted\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-getting-the-lever-mounted.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-getting-the-lever-mounted-297x224.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-getting-the-lever-mounted-120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-getting-the-lever-mounted-768x578.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The test bike for the Range dropper/lever bundle was the Salsa Moraine that I have in for review. At this point, I had already attached the housing and cable to the dropper post and carefully slid it into the frame. So, I then moved on to mounting the Range Lever. It was easy enough. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-Shimano-lever.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-Shimano-lever.jpeg\" alt=\"PNW Compnents Range Dropper and Lever Bundle Shimano lever\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-Shimano-lever.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-Shimano-lever-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-Shimano-lever-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-Shimano-lever-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-Shimano-lever-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-Shimano-lever-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-bar-ready-for-the-new-lever.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-bar-ready-for-the-new-lever.jpeg\" alt=\"PNW Compnents Range Dropper and Lever Bundle bar ready for the new lever\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-bar-ready-for-the-new-lever.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-bar-ready-for-the-new-lever-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-bar-ready-for-the-new-lever-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-bar-ready-for-the-new-lever-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-bar-ready-for-the-new-lever-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-bar-ready-for-the-new-lever-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Salsa uses an integrated Shimano I-Spec dropper lever that attaches directly to the left brake lever.

On the other hand, the Loam dropper is an optimized version of the Range. It’s a little bit lighter, it offers lower stack height so you can run a longer overall dropper length in your bike. The Loam Dropper also offers 25mm of travel adjustment so you can fine-tune how far your dropper drops.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>In Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-Dropped.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"964\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-Dropped.jpeg\" alt=\"PNW Compnents Range Dropper and Lever Bundle Dropped\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-Dropped.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-Dropped-297x224.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-Dropped-120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-Dropped-768x578.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So, far I really like the Range Dropper and Lever. The Range lever has easy-to-use actuation. The lever’s engagement is at the beginning of the lever stroke where it makes the most sense, it makes for quick lever actuation without needing to use the full throw of the lever.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-Lever-thumb-pad.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-Lever-thumb-pad.jpeg\" alt=\"PNW Compnents Range Dropper and Lever Bundle Lever thumb pad\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-Lever-thumb-pad.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-Lever-thumb-pad-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-Lever-thumb-pad-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-Lever-thumb-pad-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-Lever-thumb-pad-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-Lever-thumb-pad-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The lever’s thumb pad is comfortable and attractive, making it easy to locate and push even with gloves on. Over all the lever, is stealthy in the black-on-black, and branding is low-key.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-from-the-back.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"964\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-from-the-back.jpeg\" alt=\"PNW Compnents Range Dropper and Lever Bundle from the back\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-from-the-back.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-from-the-back-297x224.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-from-the-back-120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/PNW-Compnents-Range-Dropper-and-Lever-Bundle-from-the-back-768x578.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I think as a bundle for $199, the Range Dropper Post and Lever are a fantastic deal. There are lighter and fancier droppers out there, but for those who want to try a dropper but don’t want to drop $200, $300, or even $400 on just the dropper post alone, it’s a great way to drop in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would recommend this bundle to the newest of riders or the gnarliest of shredders. The PNW Range Dropper Post and Lever Bundle just make sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.pnwcomponents.com/\" target=\"_blank\">PNWComponents.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/pnw-components-new-range-dropper-post-200mm-199-lever-review/\">PNW Components’ New Range Dropper Post Goes to 200mm, Lever Completes the Set for $199</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"fa5eac9bf0e8d1237653a51a6972f38a63b2d61d4c510bcbd0353e8c80c1f8a2","category":"Cycling"}
