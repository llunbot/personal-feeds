{"title":"Warp’s Agent Mode: Natural Language for Terminal Commands","link":"https://www.warp.dev/blog/agent-mode","date":1718906636000,"content":"\n<p>Michelle Lim, writing for the Warp blog (Warp, I’ll note, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2023/07/warp_your_terminal_reimagined\">has previously sponsored DF</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Agent Mode raises the level of abstraction in the terminal. Using\nnatural language, you can ask the terminal to accomplish any high\nlevel task without worrying about the specific commands you need.</p>\n\n<p>Agent Mode knows when it needs more information to help you\ncomplete a task. It will ask permission to run commands on your\nmachine and use the outputs to guide you, step-by-step. It’s also\nself-correcting when it runs into errors.</p>\n\n<p>Because Agent Mode executes tasks through the CLI, it integrates\nwith practically any service with zero configuration. If the\nservice has a CLI, an API, or publicly available docs, you can use\nAgent Mode for the task. Agent Mode has inherent knowledge of most\npublic CLIs, and you can easily teach it how to use internal CLIs\nby asking it to read their help content.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Man (no pun intended?) is this cool. I just tried “How do I generate a random number between 0000 and 9999?” and got:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You can generate a random number between 0000 and 9999 using the\nfollowing shell command in the Fish shell:</p>\n\n<pre><code>  printf \"%04d\\n\" (random 0 9999)\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And when I followed up with “How can I use jot to generate a random number between 0000 and 9999?” I got:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You can use the <code>jot</code> command to generate a random number between\n0000 and 9999 using the following command:</p>\n\n<pre><code>  jot -w \"%04d\" -r 1 0 9999\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Both of which answers are correct. For <code>jot</code> — a tool I first learned about, of course, <a href=\"https://leancrew.com/all-this/2019/09/making-lists-with-jot-and-seq/\">from the inimitable Dr. Drang</a> — I think a simpler, and thus better, answer is:</p>\n\n<pre><code>jot -r 1 0000 9999\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>but Warp’s Agent Mode suggestion is certainly good enough.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/20/warp-agent-mode\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b62cddf544d339b050e46804ebdcaa779d6b7df35d0208dd072294005d1e7847","category":"Tech"}
