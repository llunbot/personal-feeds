{"title":"Apple Updates U.S. App Review Guidelines Following Injunction","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/01/apple-updates-u-s-app-review-guidelines-epic/","date":1746193768000,"content":"\n<p>Apple, in an email to developers yesterday (as reported by MacRumors):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>3.1.1: Apps on the United States storefront are not prohibited\n       from including buttons, external links, or other calls to\n       action when allowing users to browse NFT collections owned\n       by others.</p>\n\n<p>3.1.1(a): On the United States storefront, there is no prohibition\n          on an app including buttons, external links, or other\n          calls to action, and no entitlement is required to do\n          so.</p>\n\n<p>3.1.3: The prohibition on encouraging users to use a purchasing\n       method other than in-app purchase does not apply on the\n       United States storefront.</p>\n\n<p>3.1.3(a): The External Link Account entitlement is not required\n          for apps on the United States storefront to include\n          buttons, external links, or other calls to action.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This does not mean apps can now use alternative payment processing in-app. It doesn’t even mean apps are no longer required to offer Apple’s IAP in-app for purchases and subscriptions. All it means is that apps (in the US for now, but Apple really ought to make this worldwide, but I suspect Tim Cook wants to fight this on appeal in federal court) are free to inform users about offers available on the web, and to link to those offers on the web. Those links must open outside the app, in the user’s default web browser.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>In-app: must use IAP. No alternative payments in-app. No webviews in-app for purchases.</p></li>\n<li><p>Link to web, in default web browser, for anything else. But the same offerings — but not at the same prices — must be available in-app too.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In other words, plainly and obviously, in-app purchases must compete with purchase offerings on the web. Which is exactly how the policy should have been for at least the last 10 years. It’s been incredibly frustrating and baffling that Tim Cook has refused to see that this is the obvious and correct path for everyone involved, including Apple itself.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/02/updated-app-review-guidelines-us\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"6f31f5b20893c793ee42db44c0aebe2fb5e0f8daa1dbae4ab81486eb43318abe","category":"Tech"}
