The companies <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/apple-tv-shows-amazon-prime-video-subscription\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> today that Apple TV+ will soon be available via <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/what-you-need-to-know-about-prime-video\" target=\"_blank\">Prime Video</a> in the U.S. as an add-on subscription for $9.99 per month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There doesn’t appear to be any benefit to signing up through Prime Video other than the convenience of accessing both services through the same app. “We want to make Apple TV+ and its award-winning library of series and films from the world’s greatest storytellers available to as many viewers as possible,” said Eddy Cue, Apple’s SVP of Services, in a press release. “We’re thrilled that Prime Video will now offer Apple TV+, giving viewers an incredible breadth of viewing options.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who don’t subscribe, that’s the same price Apple charges directly through the Apple TV app. The monthly price increased from $6.99 to $9.99 last October.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has been pushing to make Apple TV+ available to more users as it works to grow the service beyond Apple users. Earlier this year, it <a href=\"https://corporate.comcast.com/press/releases/comcast-introduces-peacock-netflix-and-apple-tv-streaming-bundle\" target=\"_blank\">announced a partnership with Comcast</a> that bundles Apple TV+ with Peacock and Netflix for $30 a month. That bundle is only available to new and existing Xfinity Internet and TV customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To sign up for Apple TV+ through Prime Video, log into your account and click on the <em>Subscriptions</em> tab. Amazon says Apple TV+ will be available later this month.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"01450db12ac1c77c6ca6245b68b091aa5cdc757679e0c6d76a06135dd856aad1","category":"Apple"}
