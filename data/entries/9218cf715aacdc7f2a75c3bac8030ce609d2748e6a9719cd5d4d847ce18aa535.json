Players can trade those items with other players in an \"open market\" and compete in in-game competitions for \"leaderboard positions and big prizes\" (denominated in the game's own LegacyCoin cryptocurrency).</p>\n<p>To participate in that in-game economy, though, you'll have to be a <em>Legacy</em> landowner. Currently, that means purchasing one of <a href=\"https://playlegacy.game/store/land\">4,661 available plots of land</a> in a virtual recreation of London using <a href=\"https://app.gala.games/games/legacy/\">the Gala Games marketplace</a> (it's unclear how many more plots of <em>Legacy</em> land will eventually be made, if any).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1821172#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1821172&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9218cf715aacdc7f2a75c3bac8030ce609d2748e6a9719cd5d4d847ce18aa535","category":"Tech"}
