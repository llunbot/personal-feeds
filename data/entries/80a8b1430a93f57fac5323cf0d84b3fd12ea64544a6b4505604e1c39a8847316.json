And they’ve quietly become one of the largest bicycle manufacturers in the USA.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stinner-Manufacturing-drill.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"854\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stinner-Manufacturing-drill.webp\" alt=\"Stinner Manufacturing drill\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stinner-Manufacturing-drill.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stinner-Manufacturing-drill-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stinner-Manufacturing-drill-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stinner-Manufacturing-drill-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stinner-Manufacturing-drill-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stinner-Manufacturing-drill-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in 2024, we saw the launch of Stinner Stock, a line of high-quality complete bicycles ready to ship. And now, Stinner says their “<em>capacity currently sits at 3000 complete bikes and [they] can scale with demand</em>“.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tariffs &amp; What Aaron Stinner Says?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>As a U.S. manufacturer, we’ve developed our business around flexibility, ensuring our supply chain remains adaptable and resilient</em>.<em> While tariffs can alter the landscape for some, they have minimal impact on our operations</em>. <em>Our primary focus has always been sourcing as much domestic material as possible</em>,” states Aaron Stinner, CEO of Stinner Manufacturing.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stinner-Manufacturing-yokes.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"854\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stinner-Manufacturing-yokes.webp\" alt=\"Stinner Manufacturing yokes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stinner-Manufacturing-yokes.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stinner-Manufacturing-yokes-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stinner-Manufacturing-yokes-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stinner-Manufacturing-yokes-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stinner-Manufacturing-yokes-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stinner-Manufacturing-yokes-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>He continues, “<em>We’ve been expanding our capabilities over the past few years, emphasizing efficiency and quality. While tariffs may influence global sourcing decisions for some companies, our greatest advantage has always been our capacity to adapt</em>. <em>We’ve narrowed the pricing gap with overseas production through automation and lean manufacturing, making U.S.-based manufacturing a competitive choice. We believe the future of mobility manufacturing should be here, and we’re demonstrating that it can be achieved at scale.</em>”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stinner-Manufacturing-machine.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"854\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stinner-Manufacturing-machine.webp\" alt=\"Stinner Manufacturing machine\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stinner-Manufacturing-machine.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stinner-Manufacturing-machine-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stinner-Manufacturing-machine-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stinner-Manufacturing-machine-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stinner-Manufacturing-machine-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Stinner-Manufacturing-machine-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Stinner is also capable of full “black-label” production at any scale. They also want you to know that it’s the same team that completes all fabrication in Santa Barbara, including crafting their own Stinner Custom and Stonner Stock lines of bicycles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stinner Manufacturing is accepting work for their 2025 and 2026 production calendar years.
