There are no known reports of those versions being incorporated into any production releases for major Linux distributions, but both <a href=\"%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://www.redhat.com/en/blog/urgent-security-alert-fedora-41-and-rawhide-users\">Red Hat</a> and <a href=\"%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2024/msg00057.html\">Debian</a> reported that recently published beta releases used at least one of the backdoored versions—specifically, in Fedora 40 and Fedora Rawhide and Debian testing, unstable and experimental distributions. A stable release of Arch Linux is also affected. That distribution, however, isn't used in production systems.</p>\n<p>Because the backdoor was discovered before the malicious versions of xz Utils were added to production versions of Linux, “it's not really affecting anyone in the real world,” Will Dormann, a senior vulnerability analyst at security firm Analygence, said in an online interview. “BUT that's only because it was discovered early due to bad actor sloppiness. Had it not been discovered, it would have been catastrophic to the world.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013674#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013674&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"edde05f4aa054eaa070b944839cb42ba7e10c61429c043a5badfc59398f2c0ac","category":"Tech"}
