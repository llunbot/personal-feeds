This new program is designed to “maximize payouts to sellers”, with the post mentioning that the seller kept 70% of the selling price. They will still be offering the safety and convenience that TPC has provided in the past. The consignment bikes will be thoroughly inspected, refurbished, and certified, just like any other bike that is sold through TPC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TPC says that it will “build upon its proven model while making important adjustments to improve the sustainability of the business and better serve customers, retailers, and the cycling community”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TPC will also be offering a “Dealer TradeUp Program and Dealer Portal”. This will help give local bike shops an easy way to help customers trade in their bikes, to get something new. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/The-Pros-Closet-is-Back-Missys-Yeti-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"900\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/The-Pros-Closet-is-Back-Missys-Yeti-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"The Pro's Closet is Back Missy's Yeti\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/The-Pros-Closet-is-Back-Missys-Yeti-jpeg.webp 900w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/The-Pros-Closet-is-Back-Missys-Yeti-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/The-Pros-Closet-is-Back-Missys-Yeti-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/The-Pros-Closet-is-Back-Missys-Yeti-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/The-Pros-Closet-is-Back-Missys-Yeti-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/The-Pros-Closet-is-Back-Missys-Yeti-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Missy “The Missle” Giove’s Yeti!</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s TPC Have to Say?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“As we look toward the future, our focus is on staying lean, scrappy, and sustainable without compromising the premium experience that we’re known for,” </em>said Jonathan Czaja, CEO of The Pro’s Closet.<em> “Our Dealer TradeUp program will connect more riders with local shops, and our new consignment option will ensure that cyclists get top value for their bikes. We’ve been given a rare opportunity to reboot this iconic brand, and we look forward to preserving and enhancing this business for everyone who shares our passion for cycling.”</em> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, TPC 2.0 says they are committed to “right-sizing its cost structure” and “unwinding many of the excessive expenditures” it made during the Covid bike boom. They are hoping that these measures will ensure that TPC will be around for many years to come. Let’s hope so! </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.theproscloset.com/\" target=\"_blank\">TheProsCloset.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/the-pros-closet-2-0-is-live-and-just-sold-their-first-bike/\">They’re Back!
