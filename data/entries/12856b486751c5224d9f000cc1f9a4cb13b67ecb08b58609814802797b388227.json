It has been part of the Women’s WorldTour calendar since 2016, growing from one day to being a multi-stage race that is part of the wider RideLondon festival.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kopecky, recently victorious at Nokere Koerse and Strade Bianche after powering away on the final climb towards the Piazza del Campo in Siena, also won in the four-stage UAE Tour last month. Her main target this summer is the Olympic Games and she is not-so-steadily building winning momentum for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kopecky will be at the RideLondon Classique alongside the likes of teammate Lorena Wiebes, former winner Charlotte Kool (Team DSM) and home favourite Lizzie Deignan (Lidl-Trek),</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2023 race was bookended by wins for Kool, with Canyon-SRAM’s Chloé Dygert’s Stage 2 victory sandwiched between. Kool topped the GC standings by 11 seconds over Dygert as Deignan finished third on the podium.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/sportive-bike-maintenance-checks\">RideLondon bike check: 5 maintenance tips and what to avoid ahead of the big day</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/ridelondon-2024\">Get ready for RideLondon 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/ridelondon-organise\">Taking over London: Behind the scenes at RideLondon</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/ridelondon-classique-2023\">Gallery: Best RideLondon Classique yet?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/lotte-kopecky-ridelondon\">World Champion Lotte Kopecky confirmed for RideLondon Classique</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Robyn Davidson &#124; Editorial Assistant","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"12856b486751c5224d9f000cc1f9a4cb13b67ecb08b58609814802797b388227","category":"Cycling"}
