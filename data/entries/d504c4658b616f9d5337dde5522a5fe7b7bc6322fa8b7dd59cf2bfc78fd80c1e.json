Rigid forks. Outrageous paintjobs. Glorious, shining chrome.”</p>\n<p>The brand describes the Grizl CF SL 7 Throwback as “a tribute to all that was great and good during mountain biking’s pioneering decade.” It’s a bike, Canyon says, that “combines that iconic 90s MTB look with modern gravel bike design to give riders their old school kicks, 90s style.”</p>\n<h2>A conversation-starting paint job</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The pink splatters are a fitting touch.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Canyon</i></span></div>\n<p>Sitting alongside the racier <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/gravel-bikes/canyon-grail-6-review/\">Canyon Grail</a>, the Grizl CF SL is Canyon’s rowdier carbon gravel bike, with clearance for 50mm tyres and mounts for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bikepacking-bags/\">bikepacking bags</a> and accessories.</p>\n<p>Reminiscent of a lava lamp, this new model uses a gloss teal paint scheme for the majority of its front triangle and top section of the seatstays. This is then contrasted with gloss pink for the rear triangle, as well as the fork dropout area.</p>\n<p>The brand and model graphics are in white, with pink splatters here and there on the front end.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The pink stem faceplate is cool.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Canyon</i></span></div>\n<p>To complement the fetching frame colourway, Canyon further plugs into 90s nostalgia with the pink stem faceplate and the chrome Canyon HB50 handlebars.</p>\n<p>Arguably, though, Canyon has missed a trick not speccing a matching pink stem top cap.</p>\n<h2>A modern spec</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Grizl CF SL 7 Throwback pairs a retro aesthetic with modern components.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Canyon</i></span></div>\n<p>Mercifully, the 90s theme isn’t taken to its extreme with period-correct components (hot take – who needs cantilever brakes…?)</p>\n<p>In terms of the spec, SRAM takes care of the shifting and braking duties with its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/sram-rival-etap-axs-review/\">Rival XPLR eTap AXS</a> groupset. The bike is also specced with Schwalbe G-One Bite gravel tyres in a 45mm width.</p>\n<p>Adding some extra squish is the Canyon VCLS 2.0 leaf-sprung seatpost. The black Fizik Ergo Terra X3 saddle and bar tape are a sensible choice – they wouldn’t stay pink for long!</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A closer look at those beautiful DT Swiss GR 1600 wheels.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Canyon</i></span></div>\n<p>DT Swiss GR 1600 wheels complete the package with another 90s touch – brushed silver rims and hubs.</p>\n<p>The bike is available now for £3,649 / €3,799 and if you want to get your paws on one, you’d better be quick as there are only 250 bikes available worldwide.</p>\n<p><em>What do you make of this retro-inspired modern machine?
