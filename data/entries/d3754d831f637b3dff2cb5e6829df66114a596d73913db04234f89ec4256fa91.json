[...]</p>\n\n<p>Several arthouse films have been shot with iPhones, including Sean\nBaker’s <em>Tangerine</em> (2015) and the Steven Soderbergh drama\n<em>Unsane</em> (2018), but these movies were limited-release, low-budget\nofferings compared to <em>28 Years Later</em>. The new film’s $75 million\nbudget is only part of the franchise’s total, with <em>28 Years\nLater</em> being the first of a new trilogy; all three coming zombie\nfilms are being scripted by screenwriter Alex Garland, who is\nreuniting with Boyle and Mantle after helming <em>Civil War</em>,\nreleased earlier this year.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Right there, in your pocket, all day every day.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/20/28-days-later-iphone-camera\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d3754d831f637b3dff2cb5e6829df66114a596d73913db04234f89ec4256fa91","category":"Tech"}
