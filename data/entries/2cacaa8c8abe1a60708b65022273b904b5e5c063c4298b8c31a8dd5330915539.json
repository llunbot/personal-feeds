In addition to the newly released Motive line-up today, SRAM expands their previous mineral oil Maven and DB lines to offer powerful, low maintenance brakes at all price points. Now, a new Maven Base brakeset trickles down ‘Extreme Duty’ stopping power with simplified internals. Then, DB6 &amp; DB4 brakes do the same for all-rounder ‘Heavy Duty’ braking for everything from cross-country to all-mountain riders.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>SRAM MTB brakes all stop on mineral oil now!</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-MTB-brakes-all-stop-on-mineral-oil-now_bleed-kit.webp\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1650\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-MTB-brakes-all-stop-on-mineral-oil-now_bleed-kit.webp\" alt=\"SRAM MTB brakes all stop on mineral oil now, new bleed kit\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-MTB-brakes-all-stop-on-mineral-oil-now_bleed-kit.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-MTB-brakes-all-stop-on-mineral-oil-now_bleed-kit-297x272.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-MTB-brakes-all-stop-on-mineral-oil-now_bleed-kit-1536x1408.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-MTB-brakes-all-stop-on-mineral-oil-now_bleed-kit-120x110.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-MTB-brakes-all-stop-on-mineral-oil-now_bleed-kit-768x704.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/SRAM)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>First with the debut of budget 4-piston <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/sram-db8-mtb-disc-brakes-with-mineral-oil/\" target=\"_blank\">DB8s</a> three years ago, and then last winter’s super-powered <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/sram-maven-dh-disc-brake-initial-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Maven</a> brakes, SRAM committed to mineral oil. They described the transition away from DOT brake fluid as a user-friendly upgrade after refining their hydraulic &amp; seal designs to work with the new-to-them brake fluid. Then, today with all-new Motives, SRAM is all-in on mineral oil. And that means riders won’t have to bleed their brakes quite as often.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also means it was time for SRAM to fill out their brake line-up, bringing their new mineral oil mountain bike brake families to a broader audience and especially to lower price points.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Limited-edition-SRAM-Maven-Ultimate-Expert-Kit-brakeset-detail.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Limited-edition-SRAM-Maven-Ultimate-Expert-Kit-brakeset-detail.webp\" alt=\"SRAM MTB brakes all stop on mineral oil now, new limited edition Maven Ultimate Expert brakeset\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Limited-edition-SRAM-Maven-Ultimate-Expert-Kit-brakeset-detail.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Limited-edition-SRAM-Maven-Ultimate-Expert-Kit-brakeset-detail-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Limited-edition-SRAM-Maven-Ultimate-Expert-Kit-brakeset-detail-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Limited-edition-SRAM-Maven-Ultimate-Expert-Kit-brakeset-detail-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Limited-edition-SRAM-Maven-Ultimate-Expert-Kit-brakeset-detail-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Limited-edition-SRAM-Maven-Ultimate-Expert-Kit-brakeset-detail-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Limited-edition-SRAM-Maven-Ultimate-Expert-Kit-brakeset-detail-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter 3 new affordable mountain bike brakesets, plus a new premium limited edition.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-MTB-brakes-all-stop-on-mineral-oil-now_Maven-DB6-DB4-tech-specs.webp\"><img width=\"2500\" height=\"1522\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-MTB-brakes-all-stop-on-mineral-oil-now_Maven-DB6-DB4-tech-specs.webp\" alt=\"SRAM MTB brakes all stop on mineral oil now, Maven DB6 &amp;
