The video, titled \"I Made The Ultimate Cheating Device,\" demonstrates a custom hardware modification that allows users of the graphing calculator to type in problems sent to ChatGPT using the keypad and receive live responses on the screen.</p>\n\n<p>ChromaLock began by exploring the calculator's link port, typically used for transferring educational programs between devices. He then designed a custom circuit board he calls \"TI-32\" that incorporates a tiny Wi-Fi-enabled microcontroller, the <a href=\"https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeed-XIAO-ESP32C3-p-5431.html\">Seed Studio ESP32-C3</a> (which costs about $5), along with other components to interface with the calculator's systems.</p>\n<p>It's worth noting that the TI-32 hack isn't a commercial project. Replicating ChromaLock's work would involve purchasing a TI-84 calculator, a Seed Studio ESP32-C3 microcontroller, and various electronic components, and fabricating a custom PCB based on ChromaLock's design, which is <a href=\"https://github.com/chromalock/TI-32/\">available online</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051342#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051342&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a934dcf82c87eb2972a9af51e50e88675ad476a3823cd305863b779566df889e","category":"Tech"}
