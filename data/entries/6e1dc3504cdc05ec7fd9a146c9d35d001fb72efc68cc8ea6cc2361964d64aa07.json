{"title":"Close the gap: Meet the editorial panel for Issue 121","link":"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/close-the-gap-meet-the-panel","date":1691139291000,"content":"\n      <p><i><span>Rouleur’s</span></i><span> first women’s issue, released in 2021, wonderfully guest edited by Orla Chennaoui and our best-selling magazine ever, made history, opened eyes and broke records. Above all, it proved that there is a hunger for high-quality coverage of women’s sport. Build it and they will come. Two years on, women’s cycling has progressed immeasurably: we’ve seen the introduction of races like Tour de France Femmes and Paris-Roubaix Femmes, and the number of riders fighting for victory at the very top of the sport is bigger than ever before. At Rouleur, we knew now was the right moment to dedicate another magazine to women, but this time, we wanted to go bigger.</span></p>\n<p>The mission of this issue is to empower more women to take part not just in cycling, competitive and otherwise, but sport in general. From training through the menstrual cycle, to overcoming stereotypes and building welcoming communities, we want to help close the gap between men’s and women’s participation in sport. While progress has been made, there is still work to be done.</p>\n<p><i><span>Rouleur’s</span></i><span> own contingent of female staff and contributors has been burgeoning over the years, but we still wanted to call on the expertise of others to help us produce a second women’s issue that would hopefully make an even bigger impact on the world of sport than the first. Enter our Editorial Panel. </span></p>\n<p>We invited six inspiring and powerful women who have an incredible breadth of varied experience in sport to help us decide what should go in this magazine. They also gave their thoughts on how to narrow the gap between male and female participation in sport in the Close the Gap feature inside Issue 121.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/pages/subscribe\"><em><strong>Subscribe to Rouleur to receive your copy in print or download on our app</strong></em></a></p>\n<h3><b>Sydney Cassidy </b></h3>\n<p>Sydney Cassidy is a UK fitness content creator empowering women to embrace their own strength, get fit and lift through content creation on social media channels.
