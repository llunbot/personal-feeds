The test-firing of the Ariane 6 main engine on a launch pad at the Guiana Space Center in South America last week was the most significant test not yet accomplished on the rocket's preflight checklist.</p>\n<p>The test lasted 426 seconds—a little more than seven minutes—while a full-size test model of the Ariane 6 rocket remained on its launch pad. In order for the rocket to actually take off, it would need to light its four strap-on solid-fueled boosters. That was not part of the plan for Thursday's test.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1986653#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1986653&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ff4056df839189cb9fcf5bba3ab8642764798860d54956b4394561c20dbe3a89","category":"Tech"}
