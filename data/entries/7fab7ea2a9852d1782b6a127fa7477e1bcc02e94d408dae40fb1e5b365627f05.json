The thinking behind this is simple: the Pinecone would be able to run 27.5 wheels with rim brakes, be it cantilevers or v-brakes, or it could run 26″ through 700c wheels with disc brakes.</p>\n<p>Brother Cycles has a full gallery and blog post about the <a href=\"https://www.brothercycles.com/2025/01/introducing-the-pinecone\" target=\"_blank\">Pinecone</a>, so if you’re intrigued, roll on over to check it out.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/brother-cycles-pinecone/\">Brother Cycles Teases its Pinecone 27.5 Vintage Inspired Rigid MTB</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"7fab7ea2a9852d1782b6a127fa7477e1bcc02e94d408dae40fb1e5b365627f05","category":"Cycling"}
