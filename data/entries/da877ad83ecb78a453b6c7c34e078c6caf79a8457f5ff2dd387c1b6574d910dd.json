Its construction means that water beads off it, so unlike the majority of waterproof materials it never wets out and needs just a surface wipe down if it gets dirty – we explain below exactly how it works.</p>\n<p>The downside of Shakedry jackets is their elevated prices though – jackets made from Gore-Tex’s wonder-material are frequently among the most expensive we review.</p>\n<p>They are also more fragile than typical multilayer waterproof jackets. But if you ride frequently in wet conditions, maybe you can regard buying one as an investment in your comfort.</p>\n<p>Our expert team of testers have braved hours of rainy riding to find the best Gore-Tex Shakedry cycling jackets.

It paved the way for a wide range of fabrics all based on sandwiching a PTFE membrane with microscopic holes in it between two layers of fabric.</p>\n<p>The holes are large enough to let out water vapour, i.e. your evaporating sweat, but too small to let in droplets of liquid water. That keeps you more comfortable when you’re exercising in the rain.</p>\n<p>The outer surface of the fabric needs to be coated with a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/how-to-rejuvenate-your-waterproof-cycling-gear/\" target=\"_blank\">DWR (durable water-resistant) treatment</a> though, to stop it wetting out, as a wet outer face stops the transfer of water vapour from working and makes the garment heavier and colder.</p>\n<p>Over time, dirt and abrasion tend to wear off the DWR layer, so your jacket will wet out more easily. So you need to clean and reproof it periodically – see our post on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/how-to-rejuvenate-your-waterproof-cycling-gear/\">how to care for waterproofs</a>.</p>\n<h3>Why is Shakedry different?</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Shakedry is totally impervious to rain.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>With Shakedry, Gore turned the structure of membrane-based waterproofs inside out. Instead of sandwiching the membrane in the middle of a laminate, the membrane in Shakedry fabrics forms the outermost layer of the garment, supported by a single fabric layer.</p>\n<p>With one less layer, Shakedry jackets are thinner and lighter than a three-layer laminate. That means they are more packable and water-vapour transfer through the fabric is faster, keeping you drier.</p>\n<p>The membrane on the outside also repels water, without needing a DWR coating. So it’s permanently water-resistant, water beads off and – as its name says – it shakes dry when the rain stops.</p>\n<p>Originally launched in 2016 as a non-stretch fabric, Shakedry fabrics now include stretch for a more comfortable fit and there are lined jackets available to add warmth too.</p>\n<h3>Who makes Shakedry jackets?</h3>\n<p>When Shakedry was introduced, it was only available in Gore’s own line of clothing. That’s since changed and Shakedry jackets are now available from an increasing number of other top-tier cycling brands.</p>\n<p>So you can find Shakedry cycling jackets from the likes of Castelli, 7Mesh and Rapha. Harry Osborn, product designer at Rapha, attests to Shakedry’s qualities, telling us: “Rapha’s most advanced hardshell fabric is Gore-Tex Shakedry. Super lightweight, fully waterproof and the most breathable waterproof fabric on the market”.</p>\n<p>Shakedry jackets from a number of brands can be found for running, hiking and other outdoor sports, too.</p>\n<h3>What features can I expect in a Shakedry jacket?</h3>\n<p>Shakedry’s selling points are its lightweight, breathability and wet-weather performance. So don’t expect bells and whistles – many Shakedry jackets don’t even feature pockets, to help keep the weight low.</p>\n<p>The jackets make up for that with great packability, so they’re items you can take with you ‘just in case’ without bulging out your pockets. With their high breathability and windproofing, you’ll often be comfortable wearing a Shakedry jacket for your entire ride, even if it isn’t raining.</p>\n<p>The predominant colour is grey-black, but some Shakedry jackets leaven that with brighter panels and most will include reflectives.</p>\n<p>Full zips, often two-way, help with access to jersey pockets and heat modulation, while a high collar and stretchy cuffs help keep out rain and wind. And seams will be taped on the inside to stop rain from finding its way in there.</p>","author":"Paul Norman","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"da877ad83ecb78a453b6c7c34e078c6caf79a8457f5ff2dd387c1b6574d910dd","category":"Cycling"}
