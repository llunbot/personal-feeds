Well, the Hold Your Horses grips, or HYH for short, have just dropped in the brand’s webshop. The HYH grip has a comfortable ergonomic form, inspired by early BMX and MTB grips in the 1980s. This shape is comfy no matter if you’re riding two-hundred miles or two. It’s not a lock on, but its a thick rubber and a tight fit, so it grabs the bar and stays put. The benefits to it not being a lock on means they don’t cost $45, which is cool for everyone, and you get super cool moto-esque hand guard flanges on either side, which work really well. </p>\n<p>Check out more at <a href=\"https://crustbikes.com/products/crust-hyh-grips\" target=\"_blank\">Crust Bikes</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/crust-bikes-hyh-grips/\">Crust Bikes Hold Your Horses – HYH – Grips</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"2ac42e19f073df046cb750328aad80b3b4caa35fd2acb50d7d48133fee3e6156","category":"Cycling"}
