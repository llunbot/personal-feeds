{"title":"Everything New in iOS 17 Beta 4","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/26/everything-new-in-ios-17-beta-4/","date":1690363227000,"content":"Apple has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/25/apple-seeds-ios-17-beta-4-to-developers/\">released</a> the fourth beta of the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a> software release to developers for testing purposes, and like almost all new betas, the operating system brings a number of small tweaks and changes as Apple refines the software ahead of launch. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/General-iOS-17-Feature-Blue-Green.jpg\" alt width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" />\r<br />\nHere's everything new that we've found so far in the fourth beta of ‌iOS 17‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>NameDrop Toggle</h2>\r<br />\nIn the AirDrop menu in Settings, Apple has added a \"Start Sharing By\" section that includes a toggle called \"Bringing Devices Together,\" which allows users to manually switch NameDrop on and off. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/namedrop-settings-toggle.jpg\" alt width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nNameDrop is the new ‌iOS 17‌ feature that lets you hold your <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> near someone else's ‌iPhone‌ or Apple Watch to exchange contact information. Previously, there was no way to disable it.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>iMessage App Menu</h2>\r<br />\nIn ‌iOS 17‌, all Messages apps and tools like the camera and photo options can be accessed by tapping on the \"+\" button, which brings up a menu column. In fourth beta, Apple has tweaked the design of the icons. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/messages-apps-menu.jpg\" alt width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nThe Camera icon has changed from a shutter button to a traditional camera glyph. The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a> icon no longer shows the most recent picture taken, and is now just the standard ‌Photos‌ app icon. Cash, where it appears, now has a black circular background. The Audio icon has become a white waveform on a red background instead of a red waveform on a black background, and the Location icon is now encircled in green to look similar to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/\">Find My</a>. The More icon is also circular instead of an oblong shape.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Standby Notification Preview Toggle</h2>\r<br />\nIn the Standby menu in Settings, Apple has added a toggle called \"Show Preview on Tap Only,\" which when enabled causes Standby to hide the preview of a notification until you tap on it.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/standby-preview-toggle.jpg\" alt width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nWhen you're not using your ‌iPhone‌, you can put it horizontally on a charger to activate ‌iOS 17‌'s new StandBy mode, a full-screen display with information you can see at a glance. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Mental Wellbeing</h2>\r<br />\nApple has made minor design refinements to the Mental Wellbeing section of the Health app, with updated animations when logging your mood.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/log-mood-animations.jpg\" alt width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nThe animations have been made a little less angular, and are now softer, smoother, and slightly more florid. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>New Home Screen &amp; App Library Icon</h2>\r<br />\nApple has changed the Settings menu icon for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/\">Home Screen</a> &amp; App Library, which was previously a white outline of an ‌iPhone‌ showing a ‌Home Screen‌ on a blue background.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/home-screen-settings.jpg\" alt width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nIn the fourth beta, it is now represented by three rows of multicolored app-style icons on a purple background.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Tweaked Apple TV Remote Icon</h2>\r<br />\nIn Control Center, Apple has made a minor tweak to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> Remote button, which now has a black circle representing the click wheel, while the Standby button in the top-right corner has been removed.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/apple-remote-button.jpg\" alt width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Other New Features and Changes</h2>\r<br />\nFind something that we didn't mention here?
