The opening stages offer plenty of chances for the yellow jersey to change hands with sprint stages, punchy finales and a time-trial wedged in between on Stage 5. The second week of racing will see three Pyrenean mountaintop finishes back to back. From there, the Tour moves eastwards towards the Alps via <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/ventoux-sault-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">Mont Ventoux</a> before two final summit finishes at the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/col-de-la-loze-cycling-2\" target=\"_blank\">Col de la Loze</a> and La Plagne. After its <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/olympics\" target=\"_blank\">Olympics-forced omission</a> from the 2024 Tour, Paris is back on the map and will host the (likely) processional show closer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given that we now know where the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tour-de-france\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de France</a> is going next year, let’s reach for Cyclist’s cursed crystal ball. In this wildly early list of prognostics, we’ll predict how each of the 21 stages will go, plus who will be the winner of all four jerseys and the final GC podium.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Tour de France 2025: Who’s going to be there</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tour-de-france-photography-01-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Tour de France photography\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tour-de-france-photography-01-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tour-de-france-photography-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tour-de-france-photography-01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tour-de-france-photography-01-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tour-de-france-photography-01-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tour-de-france-photography-01-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tour-de-france-photography-01-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tour-de-france-photography-01-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/tour-de-france-photography-01.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Zac Williams</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it’s safe to say that we can expect the top three finishers from this year’s Tour to appear in Lille for the Grand Départ in 2025. With no Giro on his agenda next year, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tadej-pogacar\" target=\"_blank\">Tadej Pogačar </a>will try to defend his Tour title – of course, barring incident or injury. Someone who might be a Giro starter, on the other hand, is <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/jonas-vingegaard\" target=\"_blank\">Jonas Vingegaard</a>, but Visma-Lease a Bike <em>directeur sportif </em>Grisha Niermann has already shared that the Tour will be his main objective. Following a successful Tour debut last year, meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/remco-evenepoel\" target=\"_blank\">Remco Evenepoel</a> will be the protected rider in the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/soudal-quickstep\" target=\"_blank\">QuickStep </a>line-up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elsewhere,<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/primoz-roglic\" target=\"_blank\"> Primož Roglič</a> has also confirmed that the Tour will be on his 2025 schedule, although he dodged the question of whether it will be his core objective for the year or not. Vuelta runner-up Ben O’Connor will take the lead role at Jayco-AlUla at next year’s Tour and Carlos Rodríguez will most likely lead <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/ineos-grenadiers\" target=\"_blank\">Ineos Grenadiers</a> during their ‘rebuilding season’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/wout-van-aert/\" target=\"_blank\">Wout van Aert</a> will likely return to the Tour to reprise his role as domestique-cum-stage hunter. The first week suits him down to a tee and he has a real chance to claim the <em>maillot jaune</em> early on. His rival <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/mathieu-van-der-poel\" target=\"_blank\">Mathieu van der Poel</a>, however, is subject to rumours suggesting that he might skip the Tour in favour of a return to the mountain bike and a run-out at the<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/vuelta-a-espana\" target=\"_blank\"> Vuelta a España</a>. Biniam Girmay, the reigning green jersey holder, also confirmed at the route presentation that he will aim to come back to the Tour in 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of sprinters, the picture is slightly unclear. That said, the chance for them to pull on the yellow jersey shouldn’t be snuffed at. Jasper Philipsen has been at the Tour for the past four editions, so he should be in attendance in Lille. He was at the route reveal in Paris so that hints at a return to the race. Jonathan Milan might make his Tour debut – he worked in tandem with Mads Pedersen in the latter half of the 2024 calendar, so this might have been a test run for the upcoming Tour. Tim Merlier is likely to be side-tracked for Evenepoel’s GC helpers like this year, while a lack of DSM climbers could open the door to Fabio Jakobsen returning to the Tour.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n

are yet to publish <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\" target=\"_blank\">the full profiles of all the stages</a>. These predictions are based using the information we know so far.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Stage 1: Saturday 5th July, Lille Métropole – Lille Métropole, 185km</h3>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"796\" height=\"448\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/STAGE-1-TDF-25.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/STAGE-1-TDF-25.png 796w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/STAGE-1-TDF-25-300x169.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/STAGE-1-TDF-25-768x432.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/STAGE-1-TDF-25-750x422.png 750w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The Tour kicks off with a flat stage for the first time since 2019 or 2020 – that depends on what you consider a sprint stage to be. The strongest sprinters in the bunch should wrestle their way through the chaos so I’d pin my hopes on Philipsen or Milan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Opening stages are often chaotic, however, and rarely go to plan. The door could be open to a surprise stage winner <em>à la</em> Mike Teunissen in 2019. For this, consider longshots Gerben Thijssen or Arnaud De Lie. They’d need to show some improvement during the first half of 2025 before I can confidently back their chances though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Cyclist</em> prediction: </strong>Jasper Philipsen </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Stage 2: Sunday 6th July, Lauwin-Planque – Boulogne-sur-Mer, 209km</h3>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"891\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/TDF-25-STAGE-2.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/TDF-25-STAGE-2.png 891w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/TDF-25-STAGE-2-300x162.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/TDF-25-STAGE-2-768x414.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/TDF-25-STAGE-2-750x404.png 750w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Stage 2 is bound to end up like a Classic. The final 10km are undulating and filled with three spiky climbs. This includes the approach to the line, which will be at a 4% gradient. With that, I can say pretty confidently that the yellow jersey will change here – I can’t see Philipsen or Milan making it to the line at the front of affairs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Van Aert will be expected to lead the bookies’ odds, the finale suits the Belgian’s skills well.<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-biniam-girmay\" target=\"_blank\"> Girmay </a>and Van der Poel could spoil the party, particularly the Eritrean who will have the advantage on this 4% drag to the line. If you’re looking for historic parallels, Pogačar won on a similarly punchy finale in <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/gallery-2022-tour-de-france-stage-6\" target=\"_blank\">Longwy back at the 2022 Tour</a>. The final climb of that day has the same statistics as this one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t count out the chance of a group of attackers who may roll the dice over the final set of climbs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Cyclist </em>prediction: </strong>Wout van Aert</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Stage 3: Monday 7th July, Valenciennes – Dunkerque , 172km</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"741\" height=\"372\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/TDF-25-STAGE-3.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/TDF-25-STAGE-3.png 741w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/TDF-25-STAGE-3-300x151.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/TDF-25-STAGE-3-360x180.png 360w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>We re-enter familiar flat territory here. The exposed finale to Dunkerque could force some echelons, but this is optimistic. It’s always hard to predict how the wind will blow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The flattest stage outside of Paris, Stage 3 will come down to the likes of Philipsen and Milan again. If Jakobsen is back on top form, this is the kind of stage he could thrive on, however, his move to DSM seems to have hindered his ability to contest top-level sprints.

I wouldn’t count on Pedersen or Girmay to hang on. Instead, this looks like a job for Van Aert. He’ll be able to follow any crucial moves that go off over the penultimate climb and the 5% ramp up to the finish is no problem for him.

Look deeper and we see that 70% of the individual time-trials in the past <em>seven</em> Tours de France have been won by riders contesting the yellow jersey. History favours the overall favourites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s an obvious suspect for victory in Caen in Evenepoel. The double World Champion and Olympic champion is one of – if not <em>the </em>– strongest rider against the clock in the current peloton. He claimed a maiden Tour win last year in a time-trial of a similar distance and I believe he could end up in the <em>maillot jaune</em> by the end of the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Cyclist </em>prediction: </strong>Remco Evenepoel</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Stage 6: Thursday 10th July, Bayeaux – Vire, 201km</h3>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"1075\" height=\"616\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/TDF-2025-STAGE-6-V2.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/TDF-2025-STAGE-6-V2.png 1075w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/TDF-2025-STAGE-6-V2-300x172.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/TDF-2025-STAGE-6-V2-970x556.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/TDF-2025-STAGE-6-V2-768x440.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/TDF-2025-STAGE-6-V2-750x430.png 750w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Stage 6 is a bit of a wildcard stage through the deceiving Norman hills. Among the six categorised climbs on the day, two will come in the final 10km. They’re hardly Alps, but it could rule out the chances of the sprinters, particularly with the 10% average slope in the final 700m.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can I say something boring? This one looks pretty safe for Pogačar. He’s the strongest sprinter amongst the climbers and he thrives on finales like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other contenders for this stage could include Van Aert and Van der Poel. As for the latter, I have been underwhelmed by Van der Poel’s recent appearances at the Tour. He’s also not sure whether he’ll actually do the race next year. This opening week might be too tempting to miss, however.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of the overall standings, I doubt QuickStep will want to lose the yellow jersey here, so brace yourselves for another doomed breakaway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Cyclist </em>prediction: </strong>Tadej Pogačar</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Stage 7: Friday 11th July, Saint-Malo – Mûr-de-Bretagne, 194km</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"1062\" height=\"589\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/TDF-25-STAGE-7.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/TDF-25-STAGE-7.png 1062w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/TDF-25-STAGE-7-300x166.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/TDF-25-STAGE-7-970x538.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/TDF-25-STAGE-7-768x426.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/TDF-25-STAGE-7-750x416.png 750w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We cross the Mûr-de-Bretagne twice in the final 20km. You’re forgiven for having déjà vu, this was the case back in 2021 when Van der Poel claimed his first and only Tour stage win to date.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ‘wall of Brittany’ is 2km at an average of 6.9%. This is pretty tough, but the lull in between the two climbs could neutralise any chance for a thrilling Classics finale like I expect on Stages 2, 4 and 6.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, this might be the best chance for a breakaway in week one. To keep things exciting, however, I’ll say that the galacticos will go fist-for-fist again in the finale, much like in 2021. On that day, Pogačar and Roglič shone in the wake of Van der Poel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Cyclist </em>prediction: </strong>Benoît Cosnefroy</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Stage 8: Saturday 12th July, Saint-Méen Le-Grand– Laval, 174km</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/file-2024-10-30T112437.849-970x647.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/file-2024-10-30T112437.849-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/file-2024-10-30T112437.849-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/file-2024-10-30T112437.849-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/file-2024-10-30T112437.849-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/file-2024-10-30T112437.849-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/file-2024-10-30T112437.849-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/file-2024-10-30T112437.849-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/file-2024-10-30T112437.849-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/file-2024-10-30T112437.849-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/file-2024-10-30T112437.849.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Charly Lopez</figcaption><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We leave Brittany on Stage 8 and move into the bowels of western France. This part of the world is often home to your typical Tour sprint stage characterised by a small hopeless breakaway, swooping aerial camera shots of farms and a pretty formulaic finale. I’ll go on record to say that this will be the most boring stage of the 2025 Tour – a bold claim, I know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The arrival into Laval might be on a false flat like at the 2021 Tour de France. The Espace Mayenne is at the top of a 3% slope through Laval town centre, so I’d say this could favour the hardier sprinters. Much like he did in Limoges in 2023, I see Pedersen taking stage honours in a powerful run to the line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Cyclist </em>prediction: </strong>Mads Pedersen</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Stage 9: Sunday 13th July, Chinon – Châteauroux, 170km</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zw-tour-de-france-2024-10-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Jasper Philipsen celebrates stage win holding his fists up\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zw-tour-de-france-2024-10-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zw-tour-de-france-2024-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zw-tour-de-france-2024-10-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zw-tour-de-france-2024-10-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zw-tour-de-france-2024-10-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zw-tour-de-france-2024-10-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zw-tour-de-france-2024-10-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zw-tour-de-france-2024-10-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zw-tour-de-france-2024-10-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/zw-tour-de-france-2024-10-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Zac Williams/SWpix.com</figcaption><figcaption>Zac Williams/ZW Photography</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Châteauroux is a city with a rich Tour pedigree for sprint finishes.

I suspect that he’ll be the favourite to win in Toulouse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, given that few flat stages in the first week are likely to end in a breakaway victory, the escapees might have a chance here. Usually, there’s at least one flat stage that falls into the hands of a lucky break. This could be a candidate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The peloton is often a little sluggish after a rest day. The bump in the profile could hinder the peloton’s chase behind and a breakaway may marginally manage to stay out in front by the time the race returns to Toulouse.

The Col du Soulour won’t be too influential, it’s the first heavyweight climb of just two in the whole stage. This will surely help the chances of the lead group making it all the way to the line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vingegaard won on Hautacam in 2022. That was after three weeks of attritional racing and a much harder day. I do think the Dane will have a slight advantage here, however UAE Team Emirates might have more personnel left over to take control up the early slopes. Gaps are likely to be small in my opinion. Stages 13 and 14 will be the decisive days in the Pyrenees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Cyclist </em>prediction: </strong>Aurélien Paret-Peintre</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Stage 13: Friday 18th July, Loudenvielle – Peyregudes, 11km (ITT)</h3>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"624\" height=\"648\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/TDF-25-STAGE-13.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/TDF-25-STAGE-13.png 624w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/TDF-25-STAGE-13-289x300.png 289w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>A mountain time-trial? What is this, 2020? Well, this time we’re not at <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-mens-grand-tour-stages-of-the-2020s-so-far\" target=\"_blank\">La Planche des Belles Filles</a> and we’re far from being at GC crunch time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Peyregudes is a tough climb, particularly in the final 3km. We saw this in 2022. With that in mind, Stage 13 should favour Pogačar and Vingegaard far more than the time-trial world champ Evenepoel. I suspect that the two previous Tour winners will put around one minute into Evenepoel here. This kind of stage could also throw up some wild results so look out for domestiques or on-form breakaway riders in the top 20.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mountain time-trials often create pretty serious time gaps in the GC. This stage is, therefore, set to be the first major shake-up of the 2025 Tour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Cyclist </em>prediction: </strong>Tadej Pogačar </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Stage 14: Saturday 19th July, Pau – Superbagnères, 183km</h3>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"847\" height=\"652\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/TDF-2025-STAGE-14.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/TDF-2025-STAGE-14.png 847w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/TDF-2025-STAGE-14-300x231.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/TDF-2025-STAGE-14-768x591.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/TDF-2025-STAGE-14-750x577.png 750w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The jewel in the Pyrenean crown this year, Stage 14 could be the most exciting watch of the 2025 Tour de France up to this point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Team tactics are sure to affect the race dynamic. Satellite riders could play into the equation, particularly over the final two climbs of the Peyresourde and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/hc-climbs-superbagneres\" target=\"_blank\">Superbagnères</a>. I expect this to be a long-range tussle between Pogačar and Vingegaard in this case. Given that the day before is only 11km in length, they should be amped up and ready to fight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final climb could suit either one of them. If one of the Yates brothers is there – remember, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cycling-transfer-rumours\" target=\"_blank\">Simon has signed for Visma</a> – then that could change the outcome. I don’t think Evenepoel is familiar to this Tour de France rhythm we’ve become so accustomed to over the past two years, and with a weakened team, he might be caught out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m cautious to forecast a breakaway victory given that this is the last chance for the GC riders this week and the escapees have a strong chance the following day to Carcassonne.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Cyclist </em>prediction: </strong>Tadej Pogačar </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Stage 15: Sunday 20th July, Muret – Carcassonne, 169km</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/file-2024-10-30T112851.996-970x647.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/file-2024-10-30T112851.996-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/file-2024-10-30T112851.996-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/file-2024-10-30T112851.996-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/file-2024-10-30T112851.996-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/file-2024-10-30T112851.996-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/file-2024-10-30T112851.996-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/file-2024-10-30T112851.996-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/file-2024-10-30T112851.996-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/file-2024-10-30T112851.996-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/file-2024-10-30T112851.996.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Charly Lopez</figcaption><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Stage 15 is a paint-by-numbers transitional day. I fully anticipate a breakaway to make it all the way to the end. Especially after the trinity of Pyrenean stages, the fatigue will be setting in. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/uae-team-emirates\" target=\"_blank\">UAE Team Emirates</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/visma-lease-a-bike\" target=\"_blank\">Visma-Lease a Bike </a>will need a rest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The profile is fairly open, but the final climb of the Pas du Sant (5km at 7%) is not to be underestimated. To make it in a breakaway on a stage like this, you need to be a real tactician with some decent climbing legs. Michał Kwiatkowski, Matej Mohorič, Pello Bilbao and Magnus Cort are some of the names that sprint to mind on a profile like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the peloton, they’ll roll home around ten minutes in arrears all chit-chatting – an easy day out for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Cyclist </em>prediction: </strong>Magnus Cort</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Stage 16: Tuesday 22nd July, Montpellier – Mont Ventoux, 172km</h3>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"457\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/TDF-25-VENTOUX.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/TDF-25-VENTOUX.png 457w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/TDF-25-VENTOUX-212x300.png 212w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The return of the Mont Ventoux will fuel many ambitions on Stage 16. It’ll be a bun-fight to get into the day’s breakaway given the grandeur of a Mont Ventoux stage win. However, I expect them to be brought back in on the slopes around Chalet Reynard as the superteams motor onto their final helpers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will be <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pogacar-vingegaard-rivalry\" target=\"_blank\">a battle between Vingegaard and Pogačar</a>, no doubt. As we saw in 2021, the climb suited Vingegaard well. Now a couple of years older and more experienced, I’d give home the slight upper hand. He thrives on long brutal drags like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vingegaard takes the day and limits some of his GC deficit. For a moment, it feels as though the Tour isn’t a done deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Cyclist </em>prediction:</strong> Jonas Vingegaard</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Stage 17: Wednesday 23rd July, Bollène – Valence, 161km</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/file-2024-10-30T113144.617-970x647.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/file-2024-10-30T113144.617-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/file-2024-10-30T113144.617-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/file-2024-10-30T113144.617-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/file-2024-10-30T113144.617-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/file-2024-10-30T113144.617-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/file-2024-10-30T113144.617-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/file-2024-10-30T113144.617-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/file-2024-10-30T113144.617-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/file-2024-10-30T113144.617-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/file-2024-10-30T113144.617.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This will be the sprinter’s fist chance in over a week, and the last chance to bag a stage win before Paris. If the green jersey is close, then that’ll only motivate the peloton even more. However, sandwiched between two mountain stages, the hopes of the break will be high. I imagine that they’ll get caught late on and a sprinter will take the honours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello, Jasper Philipsen? The Belgian usually grows in form at the Tour and I expect this to be another win for him. He’s poached wins in the final week in two of the past three Tours and his Alpecin team will have fresh few goals in the surrounding mountain stages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Cyclist </em>prediction: </strong>Jasper Philipsen</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Stage 18: Thursday 24th July, Vif – Col de la Loze, 171km</h3>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"790\" height=\"631\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/tdf-25-col-de-la-loze.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/tdf-25-col-de-la-loze.png 790w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/tdf-25-col-de-la-loze-300x240.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/tdf-25-col-de-la-loze-768x613.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/tdf-25-col-de-la-loze-750x599.png 750w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>History suggests that Pogačar is not the biggest fan of the Col de la Loze. He shed time to Roglic up here in 2020, and in 2023 he completely exploded on the climb. We also have evidence from previous Tours that Pogačar can fall into difficulty on longer climbs. At 26km, there aren’t many climbs longer than this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I’m trying to say here is that Vingegaard has a real chance to make some real in-roads on the Slovenian on Stage 18. Factor in that Visma’s yearly altitude camps take place around the corner, I think that gives him an edge. The string of climbs building up to La Loze will most likely mean that teammates will be of high importance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I suspect a breakaway has little chance of making it. If you want a name to throw out there, though, Santiago Buitrago could thrive on the high altitude.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Cyclist </em>prediction: </strong>Jonas Vingegaard</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Stage 19: Friday 25th July, Albertville – La Plagne, 130km</h3>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"882\" height=\"687\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/TDF-2025-STAGE-19.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/TDF-2025-STAGE-19.png 882w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/TDF-2025-STAGE-19-300x234.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/TDF-2025-STAGE-19-768x598.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/TDF-2025-STAGE-19-750x584.png 750w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Based on vibes more than anything, I think Stage 19 swings in Pogačar’s favour.

For this, Alexander Kristoff can usually bear the brunt of the mountains, as can Pedersen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Cyclist </em>prediction: </strong>Jasper Philipsen </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The GC podium and jersey predictions</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T120638.025-970x647.png\" alt=\"tadej pogacar, remco evenepoel, biniam girmay and richard carapaz on podium at 2024 tour de france 2024\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T120638.025-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T120638.025-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T120638.025-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T120638.025-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T120638.025-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T120638.025-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T120638.025-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T120638.025-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T120638.025-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-22T120638.025.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In my opinion, this route suits Vingegaard more than the 2024 <em>parcours</em>. The Visma leader should relish the return of the Col de la Loze and Mont Ventoux. These will prove to be two big opportunities to gain time on Pogačar. On the other hand, I don’t think that’ll be enough to surpass him. If Vingegaard does ride the Giro as rumours suggest, that will only hamper his chances. Nonetheless, I reckon the time gap between the two will be a lot smaller than in 2024. Elsewhere, the remaining slot on the podium looks like a shoo-in for Evenepoel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To me, the green jersey should be a battle between Philipsen and Van Aert. The two previous winners have plenty of stages that suit them. Van Aert should thrive in the first week with its buffet of punchy finales. He’ll most likely score points in the time-trial in Caen and the selection of rolling breakaway stages could offer a chance for him to spring out of the pack and hunt points. I’m not saying it’s nailed on for Van Aert, however. Philipsen has at least seven stages that suit his strengths. He’s proved in the past three seasons that he is one of the fastest men around and his Alpecin-Deceunick team won’t need to sacrifice team support to chase this goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the white jersey, Evenepoel should be the overwhelming favourite. In his final year of eligibility (if my maths is correct), the Belgian could add another jersey to his collection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The polka-dots are far harder to predict. This is often the case at Grand Tours given that breakaways are dictated by the ongoing GC situation and the luck of the break. The number of points on offer on Stages 14, 18 and 19 should give the escapees a good chance of grabbing the most unique of the four jerseys. However, the mountain time-trial and four other summit finishes could mean that the balance of power could swing into the hands of Pogačar and Vingegaard <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/fix-king-of-the-mountains-polka-dot-jersey-tour-de-france\" target=\"_blank\">much like it has in the 2020s so far</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-21-best-mens-one-day-races-of-the-2020s-so-far\">The 21 best men’s one-day races of the 2020s so far</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-to-beat-tadej-pogacar\">How do you beat Tadej Pogačar?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-mens-grand-tour-stages-of-the-2020s-so-far\">The 21 best men’s Grand Tour stages of the 2020s so far</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-femmes\">Climb-heavy Tour de France Femmes 2025 route revealed</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\">Men’s Tour de France 2025 route revealed with Mont Ventoux, Superbagnères, La Plagne, Col de la Loze and a mountain TT</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cyclist-way-too-early-tour-de-france-2025-predictions\">Cyclist’s way too early Tour de France 2025 predictions</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Ewan Wilson &#124; Staff Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"ad7bcc54c731a31b2fabf2b76890f53c45739077e3facf70ee76a4df8544b303","category":"Cycling"}
