{"title":"Apple’s new $19 EarPods are a smarter purchase than the $549 AirPods Max","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2071761/earpods-airpods-max-lossless-audio-usb-c.html","date":1695035700000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>When Apple unveiled the iPhone 15 series with USB-C last week, the company didn’t forget about wired headphone fans. Apple updated its EarPods for the first time since 2016, giving them a USB-C connector too—and if you need a pair of headphones, you might want to give them a look.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>EarPods are very simple headphones reminiscent of the original iPod headphones featured in Apple’s iconic silhouette ads. They were <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2012/09/12Apple-Introduces-iPhone-5/&amp;xcust=1-1-2071761-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">redesigned in 2012</a> with “a breakthrough design for a more natural fit and increased durability, and an incredible acoustic quality typically reserved for higher-end earphones,” and the new version is identical save for the USB-C connector.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They’re actually quite comfortable and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CHXC5ZDX/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">at $19, incredibly cheap</a>. And if you subscribe to Apple Music, they’ll also play lossless audio. According to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macotakara.jp/accessories/entry-45311.html&amp;xcust=1-1-2071761-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">MacOtakara</a>, who tested the new EarPods using an Audio MIDI device, Apple’s newest buds play <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/346837/apple-music-lossless-hi-res-lossless-spatial-dolby-atmos-iphone-airpods-android-homepod-dac.html\">audio in lossless quality</a> thanks to a built-in DAC (digital-to-analog converter) that supports 48kHz. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That means Apple’s $19 earbuds play music at a higher bitrate (16bit/44.1kHz to 24bit) than its $549 high-end AirPods Max (256kbps/44.1kHz). Granted, the difference between the two devices is massive, with the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234986/airpods-max-review.html\">AirPods Max</a> offering spatial audio, active noise cancellation, and a slew of other features, but they’re also nearly three years old, still have a Lightning port, and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2002360/apple-needs-to-totally-rethink-airpods-max.html\">desperately need an update</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we wouldn’t recommend spending hundreds of dollars on a pair right now. However, for $19, the newest EarPods are a fantastic deal that will more than hold you over until Apple gets around to updating the AirPods Max.</p>\n\nHeadphones</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"b26772ad5e9e17298a7d1287ab1ea136eebbee31290edca47d90411cf08d6889","category":"Apple"}
