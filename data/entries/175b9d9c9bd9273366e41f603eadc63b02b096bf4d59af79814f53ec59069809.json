bearings</a></p>\n\n<p>FFWD has announced an update to its top-of-the-range RAW wheelset, with the new wheels dropping weight while gaining carbon spokes and new hubs with CeramicSpeed bearings in place of the previous generation’s DT Swiss hubs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the previous generation RAW wheelset was available in 44mm rim depth only, the new wheels are available with 33mm, 44mm and 55mm rims, all priced at £2,249 in the UK.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related

of RAW wheelset depths, with the lowest profile RAW 33 having claimed weights of 610g F, 740g R, 1,350g total. The claimed stats for the 44mm depth are 630g F, 765g R, 1,395g wheelset, down from the previous generation’s 1,420g. The 55mm depth weighs a claimed 660g F, 800g R, for a 1,460g wheelset weight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>FFWD says a new carbon layup has reduced the rim weight by 10%, while still keeping the brand’s same LAW Tech bulbous aerodynamic profile. LAW stands for laminar airflow wing. The profile was developed to be efficient with 25mm and 28mm tyres and replaced FFWD’s earlier DARC profile which was optimised for 23mm tyres. FFWD claims that the LAW profile in 44mm depth is 7.6% more efficient with 25mm tyres at a wind speed of 50kmh and over yaw angles from 0 to 10 degrees. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rims are <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-fit-tubeless-tyres\" target=\"_blank\">tubeless-ready</a>, although they can also be run with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/the-cyclist-guide-to-buying-the-right-inner-tube\" target=\"_blank\">inner tubes</a>. They have a 21mm internal width with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/hookless-rims\" target=\"_blank\">hooked beads</a> and a 31mm maximum external width for the 55mm depth. FFWD says they’re compatible with tyres from 23mm to 42mm wide. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A first for FFWD, the RAW wheelsets are built with carbon spokes with internal nipples, 21 front and rear, in place of the previous version’s steel. It says that this not only contributes to the reduced wheelset weight, but also moves the mass away from the periphery and increases stiffness by 17%, leading to a more responsive wheel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The carbon spokes specced are designed to be trueable and replaceable without needing to be returned to the factory.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"641\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/FFWD-RAW-wheelset-hub-970x641.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/FFWD-RAW-wheelset-hub-970x641.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/FFWD-RAW-wheelset-hub-300x198.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/FFWD-RAW-wheelset-hub-768x507.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/FFWD-RAW-wheelset-hub-750x496.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/FFWD-RAW-wheelset-hub-1140x753.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/FFWD-RAW-wheelset-hub.jpeg 1362w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, there’s a new custom-designed hub, in place of the predecessor wheels’ DT Swiss hubs. FFWD says the new design is needed to provide the anchor points for the carbon spokes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new hubs are equipped with custom CeramicSpeed bearings. The front hub bearings are larger than those in the DT Swiss 180 EXP hubs used in the previous generation wheels. FFWD says that this increases durability, as well as lowering rolling resistance. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Options and prices</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"649\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/FFWD-RAW-wheelset-hub-2-970x649.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/FFWD-RAW-wheelset-hub-2-970x649.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/FFWD-RAW-wheelset-hub-2-300x201.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/FFWD-RAW-wheelset-hub-2-768x514.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/FFWD-RAW-wheelset-hub-2-750x501.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/FFWD-RAW-wheelset-hub-2-1140x762.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/FFWD-RAW-wheelset-hub-2-465x310.jpeg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/FFWD-RAW-wheelset-hub-2-350x233.jpeg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/FFWD-RAW-wheelset-hub-2.jpeg 1346w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>FFWD offers the new wheels with rims in either matt or glossy finish, with the option to fit a Shimano, Shimano Micro Spline, SRAM XDR or Campagnolo N3W freehub.
