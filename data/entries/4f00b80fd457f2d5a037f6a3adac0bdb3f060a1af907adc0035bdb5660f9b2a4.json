Likewise, avoid seals on suspension components.</p>\n<p>If you’ve ridden through any animal excrement, be particularly careful when spraying this off your bike and seriously consider wearing eye protection because some can carry parasites that can cause blindness.</p>\n<h3>Step 3: Degrease</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A dirty drivetrain will slow you down and cost you money.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>Now you have the lion’s share of the grime removed, apply degreaser to the crankset, chain, derailleurs and cassette.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A stiff brush will loosen stubborn muck.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Will Jones / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Use a stiff brush to release stubborn grease and a chain cleaner to get those rollers running smoothly again.</p>\n<p>If you’re using a spray degreaser, be mindful not to get any on your disc rotors or braking surface.</p>\n<h3>Step 4: Cleaning products</h3>\n<p>If there is any degreaser left on your drivetrain, it will degrade and remove any chain lube you add on afterwards.</p>\n<p>Liberally apply cleaning products to the whole bike, especially the drivetrain.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Protect your disc rotors from any overspray.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Will Jones / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Use a dirty sponge for the drivetrain and a clean one for the frame, seatpost, saddle and bar. Again, be careful to avoid flicking any greasy suds onto the disc rotors.</p>\n<h3>Step 5: Second pass</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Use a final rinse to get all the soap off.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Will Jones / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Use the pressure washer again to remove any soapy residue from the whole bike, this time at a slightly greater distance than before.</p>\n<p>Any dirt should be loose and flow off easily by this point, so there’s no need to be close.</p>\n<h3>Step 6: Dry</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Finish the bike off with a microfibre towel or old (clean) rag.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Will Jones / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Using a clean rag, give the chain a quick dry before leaving the bike to dry fully.</p>\n<p>If you’re in a rush, an old towel will do the trick, but laying the bike driveside up in a sunny spot is just as effective if it’s not too cold.</p>\n<h3>Step 7: Lubricate and protect</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Once absolutely clean, add your preferred lube to your chain following the manufacturer’s instructions.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Zetland Cycles / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Nobody likes the sound of a dry chain (and it’s less efficient), so don’t forget to apply your favourite lubricant and wipe off any residue following the manufacturer’s instructions.</p>\n<p>It’s important you wipe off excess lube because it helps to stop your chain from getting contaminated with road grime or mud, which will put you straight back to square one.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A protector spray will mean less dirt clings to your bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Will Jones / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>As for the frame, prevention is better than cure.</p>\n<p>Applying a coat of protective compound before your next ride can save you precious washing time afterwards. It can also help keep your paint looking fresh.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Clean enough to eat your dinner off.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Will Jones / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Some protective compounds are aerosol-based (others are applied as a liquid with a microfibre cloth), which can contaminate your brake pads, so keep it away from your discs,</p>","author":"Will Jones","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"4f00b80fd457f2d5a037f6a3adac0bdb3f060a1af907adc0035bdb5660f9b2a4","category":"Cycling"}
