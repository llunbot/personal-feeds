{"title":"Wink Martindale Dies at 91","link":"https://www.latimes.com/obituaries/story/2025-04-15/wink-martindale-dead-game-show-host-tic-tac-dough-gambit","date":1744841884000,"content":"\n<p>Dennis McLellan, writing for the Los Angeles Times (<a href=\"https://apple.news/A9dkEvg1TRgmny9aNLdOi-w\">News+ link</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Over the decades, according to his website, Martindale either\nhosted or produced 21 game shows, including “Words and Music,”\n“Trivial Pursuit,” “The Last Word” and “Debt.” “That’s a lot of\nshows,” he acknowledged in a 1996 interview with the New York\nDaily News. “It either means everybody wants me to do their show\nor I can’t hold a job.”</p>\n\n<p>Martindale was best known for hosting “Tic-Tac-Dough,” the revival\nof a late 1950s show, which aired on CBS for less than two months\nin 1978 but continued in syndication until 1986.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike tic-tac-toe, in which two players simply try to get three\nXs or three Os in a row in a nine-box grid, “Tic-Tac-Dough”\nrequired contestants to select a subject category in each of the\nnine boxes, everything from geography to song titles. Each correct\nanswer earned the players their X or O in the chosen box.</p>\n\n<p>“Tic-Tac-Dough” achieved its highest ratings in 1980 during the\n88-game, 46-show run of Lt. Thom McKee, a handsome young Navy\nfighter pilot whose winning streak earned him $312,700 in cash and\nprizes and a spot in the Guinness Book of World Records.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s funny what you remember from childhood. I was only seven then, but I remember McKee’s winning streak. He was like the proto Ken Jennings. There was some kind of gimmick on the show where if you won ten games in a row — which almost never happened — you also won a car as a bonus. So McKee won eight cars. As I recall it — I was seven, so I could be wrong — all eight cars he won were exactly the same model, because that was the show’s current promotional partner. I remember thinking that was absurd, and my dad explaining to me that he could just sell them.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, in one of my programming classes in high school, we had to create a big final project. We had to work in pairs because there weren’t enough computers for every student in the class. My friend and I wrote a tic-tac-toe game in Applesoft BASIC. (To be honest, I wrote most of it, but he did the typing.) I remember three things about that game:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>We used the number pad keyboard layout for entering moves, with each numeral corresponding to a square on the board, which I thought (and still think) was a pretty clever UI for tic-tac-toe:</p>\n\n<pre><code>789\n456\n123\n</code></pre></li>\n<li><p>You could play two-player or against the computer, and while the computer was pretty good, it couldn’t play perfectly. I was very frustrated that while <em>I</em> could, of course, play perfect tic-tac-toe myself, I couldn’t figure out how to code an algorithm for unbeatable play in BASIC.</p></li>\n<li><p>Our name for the game: Wink.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/16/wink-martindale\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"48950be933a5a7892dcbf1ed2d98801fb668c6b403d8508ed711cd1198c518f4","category":"Tech"}
