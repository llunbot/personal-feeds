{"title":"No, Apple CEO Tim Cook Didn't Say He Prefers Logitech's MX Master 3 Over the Magic Mouse","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/17/tim-cook-didnt-say-that/","date":1731884634000,"content":"While the Logitech MX Master 3 is a <a href=\"https://x.com/rsgnl/status/1677333692593631234\">terrific mouse</a> for the Mac, reports claiming that Apple CEO Tim Cook prefers that mouse over the Magic Mouse are false.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/Magic-Mouse-Next-to-Keyboard.jpg\" width=\"1602\" height=\"901\" />\r<br />\n<em>The Wall Street Journal</em> last month published an <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/style/tim-cook-interview-apple-intelligence-vision-pro-48c59018\">interview with Cook</a>, in which he said he uses every Apple product every day. Soon after, <em>The Verge</em>'s Wes Davis attempted to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276142/tim-cook-wsj-interview-every-apple-product-every-day\">replicate using every Apple product</a> in a single day. During that day, Davis said he mostly used the MX Master 3, but sometimes switched to a Magic Mouse or Magic Trackpad.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn other words, it was Davis who said he himself used a Logitech mouse, not Cook.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUnfortunately, <em>The Mac Observer</em> misinterpreted <em>The Verge</em>'s article and ran a <a href=\"https://www.macobserver.com/news/apple-ceo-uses-15-apple-devices-per-day-but-prefers-logitech-mouse-over-apples-magic-mouse/\">since-deleted story</a> claiming that Cook prefers the MX Master 3 over the Magic Mouse. Mistakes happen, but the false claim has since <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/1gtmtnk/apples_mouse_is_so_bad_that_tim_cook_prefers/\">gained traction on Reddit</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/applesucks/comments/1gqlv4q/tim_cook_prefers_logitech_mx_master_3_over_magic/\">multiple times</a>, so hopefully this helps to clear up the situation before wrong information continues to spread.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt would be great if Cook did use the MX Master 3, though. Maybe he would love using a mouse with a front-facing USB-C port so much that he would make the Magic Mouse's port finally not be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/magic-mouse-usb-c-port-on-bottom/\">on the bottom</a>.
