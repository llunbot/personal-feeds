Then Apple introduced a titanium chassis to the iPhone 15 Pro, touting it as a major upgrade. However, Ma reports that with the ‌iPhone 17‌ lineup, Apple is planning to transition the entire range of devices back to aluminum. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nInstant Digital doesn't agree, though. \"Of course the iPhone 17 Pro will still use titanium,\" said the leaker in a <a href=\"https://weibo.com/5143897135/P30oFh2TL\">Weibo post</a> (machine translation). \"Why would anyone believe it would switch to aluminum? Think about it — it's just not possible. Looking back at recent iPhone models, Apple has consistently emphasized the premium frame materials of the Pro series as one of its key selling points, from 'surgical-grade stainless steel' to 'titanium.' If they switched to aluminum, how could they even market it?\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's unclear if the Weibo leaker has supply chain information to back up their claim, but as a standalone argument, it's not particularly water-tight. <em>The Information</em>'s Ma reported that the switch to aluminum is part of a major design change that includes an aluminum upper back with a \"rectangular camera bump made of aluminum rather than traditional 3D glass,\" with the bottom half of the device's back continuing to be made of glass to support wireless charging.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is also no stranger to touting breakthrough iPhone features only to remove them in later models. In 2015, for example, 3D Touch was introduced with the iPhone 6s as a revolutionary way to interact with the iPhone through pressure-sensitive gestures like Peek and Pop. Apple unceremoniously ditched 3D Touch and the capacitive sensors that enabled it with the iPhone 11 in 2019. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iphone-15-pro-titanium-ad.jpg\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" />\r<br />\nInstant Digital has a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instant-digital/\">mixed reputation</a> for accuracy with Apple rumors but has delivered some notably precise predictions.
