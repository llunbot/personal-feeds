At the time, Apple said that it would remain one of Ive's primary clients, but it's unclear which Apple products he has helped to design since then, if any. Apple did confirm that Ive was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/29/jony-ive-involved-in-24-imac/\">involved in the design of the colorful 24-inch iMac</a> released in April, but Apple did not confirm if any of that work occurred after Ive left the company.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIve reportedly <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/03/jony-ive-lovefrom-recruits-former-apple-designers/\">recruited at least four of his former Apple colleagues</a> to join LoveFrom.
