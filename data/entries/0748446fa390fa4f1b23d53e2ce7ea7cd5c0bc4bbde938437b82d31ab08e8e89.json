In a relatively new profession that is constantly changing with technological advances and the economy, Sarah has always found it challenging to navigate rates, contract protections, and deliverable expectations for brand partnerships. Through many conversations with colleagues, Sarah knew she wasn’t the only one frustrated by the opaqueness of the profession.</p>\n<p>In December 2022, when Sarah’s three-year contract with a long-term brand partner was abruptly terminated two years early with no explanation or recourse, Sarah created a sign-up form to gauge the interest of an outdoor ambassador collective. To her surprise, over 250 people signed up.</p>\n<p>Since Sarah launched her sign-up form, she has heard countless stories from professional outdoor ambassadors about their experiences when negotiating contracts with outdoor brands. These stories revealed a stark and disheartening reality: many ambassadors are far from fairly compensated for their work. All too often, Sarah has heard the same disturbing message from ambassador after ambassador–the brands are the ones reaping the most benefit from these contracts, while the ambassadors are left feeling taken advantage of and not adequately compensated for their efforts.</p>\n<p>To counter this alarming trend, Sarah is now working to help empower outdoor ambassadors and ensure they receive the pay and recognition they deserve. She hopes to level the playing field and make sure that each ambassador is treated fairly and compensated commensurate to the work they provide.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://emphaticsolutions.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Brian Doll</strong></a>, cyclist, marketer, and father of an accomplished mountain bike racer, volunteered his time and services immediately to help make this community the best it can be. As a result of Sarah and Brian’s collaboration, the Outdoor Ambassador Collective was born in April 2023.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/introducing-the-outdoor-ambassador-collective/\">Introducing The Outdoor Ambassador Collective</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"Josh Weinberg","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"0748446fa390fa4f1b23d53e2ce7ea7cd5c0bc4bbde938437b82d31ab08e8e89","category":"Cycling"}
