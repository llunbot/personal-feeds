The cases are available for purchase now <a href=\"https://speckproducts.com/pages/search?q=iphone%2015\">from Speck's website</a> and from BestBuy retail locations and <a href=\"https://www.bestbuy.com/\">the BestBuy website</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSpeck has three types of cases that users can choose from, including standard (with no <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a>), ‌MagSafe‌, and ClickLock for ‌MagSafe‌, which works with ClickLock accessories. Prices range from $25 to $50, and there are options for every aesthetic. The <a href=\"https://speckproducts.com/products/presidio2-pro-magsafe-with-clicklock-iphone-15-pro-cases\">Presido2 Pro</a>, for example, has Speck's Armor Cloud technology and protects the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> from drops as high as 13 feet while still looking stylish, plus it works with ‌MagSafe‌ accessories.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/speck-clicklock-clear.jpg\" alt width=\"1400\" height=\"1400\" />\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://speckproducts.com/products/presidio2-grip-magsafe-with-clicklock-iphone-15-cases\">Presidio2 Grip</a>, one of Speck's most popular options, has the same 13-foot drop protection while also offering no-slip inverted grips. This version is 20 percent slimmer than previous versions of the Grip case, it has ‌MagSafe‌, and it comes in a range of color options that look great with Apple's new iPhones.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/speck-presidio-grip-2.jpg\" alt width=\"1400\" height=\"1212\" />\r<br />\nIf you want protection but don't want to cover up the ‌iPhone‌'s design, Speck has the <a href=\"https://speckproducts.com/collections/iphone-15-cases-for-2023/products/presidio-perfect-clear-grip-magsafe-with-clicklock-iphone-15-cases\">Presidio Perfect-Clear Grip MagSafe case</a> with no-slip grips, 13-foot drop protection, and stylish grooves at the sides. If you're not a fan of that no-slip look, there's also a <a href=\"https://speckproducts.com/collections/iphone-15-cases-for-2023/products/presidio-perfect-clear-magsafe-with-clicklock-iphone-15-cases\">Presidio Perfect-Clear case</a> that has a smoother finish.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/speck-perfect-clear-grip.jpg\" alt width=\"1400\" height=\"1209\" />\r<br />\nThese cases all work with ClickLock, a technology Speck has designed to prevent accidental separation of iPhones and ‌MagSafe‌ accessories by adding a magnetic interlock mechanism. Speck this week came out with three new ClickLock options that work with its cases and the ‌iPhone 15‌ models, including the Car Vent Mount, the <a href=\"https://speckproducts.com/collections/magsafe-accessories/products/wallet-for-magsafe-with-clicklock?variant=43285595455619\">Wallet</a>, and the StandyGrip.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPriced at $30, <a href=\"https://speckproducts.com/collections/magsafe-accessories/products/wallet-for-magsafe-with-clicklock?variant=43285595455619\">Speck's MagSafe Wallet</a> is definitely a product where you want ClickLock because a wallet is the last thing you want to slip off of your ‌iPhone‌. Available in several colors, the Wallet holds 1-3 credit, debit, or ID cards.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/speck-iphone-15-wallet.jpg\" alt width=\"1400\" height=\"1037\" />\r<br />\nThe $30 <a href=\"https://speckproducts.com/collections/magsafe-accessories/products/standygrip-for-magsafe-stand-and-grip-combo-with-clicklock\">StandyGrip with MagSafe and ClickLock</a> holds the ‌iPhone‌ upright in a horizontal or vertical viewing position and it can be used to attach the ‌iPhone‌ to a MacBook so it can serve as a webcam, and that's also a situation where a secure attachment is crucial.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/speck-steadygrip.jpg\" alt width=\"1400\" height=\"895\" />\r<br />\nSpeck also has the $40 <a href=\"https://speckproducts.com/collections/magsafe-accessories/products/car-vent-mount-for-magsafe-with-clicklock\">Car Vent Mount for MagSafe with ClickLock</a> that attaches to a car vent and has a built-in cable holder.
