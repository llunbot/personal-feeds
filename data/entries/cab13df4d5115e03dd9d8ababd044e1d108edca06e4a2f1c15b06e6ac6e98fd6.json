But is that really the case? A new study by researchers at New York University examines how much medical information can be included in a large language model (LLM) training set before it spits out inaccurate answers. While the study doesn't identify a lower bound, it does show that by the time misinformation accounts for 0.001 percent of the training data, the resulting LLM is compromised.</p>\n<p>While the paper is focused on the intentional \"poisoning\" of an LLM during training, it also has implications for the body of misinformation that's already online and part of the training set for existing LLMs, as well as the persistence of out-of-date information in validated medical databases.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/its-remarkably-easy-to-inject-new-medical-misinformation-into-llms/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/its-remarkably-easy-to-inject-new-medical-misinformation-into-llms/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cab13df4d5115e03dd9d8ababd044e1d108edca06e4a2f1c15b06e6ac6e98fd6","category":"Tech"}
