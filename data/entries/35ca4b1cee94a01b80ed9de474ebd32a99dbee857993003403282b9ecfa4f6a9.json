Matter is a universal smart home standard that supports Apple's HomeKit, Google's Home, Amazon's Alexa, Samsung's SmartThings, and other smart home platforms all in one, meaning the Nest finally supports HomeKit.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn the Home app, users can adjust the Nest Thermostat's temperature, change the thermostat's mode, and more, according to Google. <em>The Verge</em> notes that iPhone users will need to be updated to iOS 16.4 or later in order to take advantage of this functionality.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGoogle is \"exploring\" adding Matter support to older Nest thermostats, according to <em>The Verge</em>, but they remain incompatible with HomeKit for now.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nest/\">Nest</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/\">HomeKit</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/matter/\">Matter</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/18/nest-thermostat-homekit-support-via-matter/\">Nest Thermostat Gaining Apple HomeKit Support Starting Today via Matter</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/nest-thermostat-gaining-apple-homekit-support-starting-today-via-matter.2387119/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"35ca4b1cee94a01b80ed9de474ebd32a99dbee857993003403282b9ecfa4f6a9","category":"Apple"}
