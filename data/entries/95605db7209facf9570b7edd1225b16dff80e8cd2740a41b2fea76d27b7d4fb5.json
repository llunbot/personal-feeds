NASA is now assembling a golf cart-size rover to drive into the dark polar craters to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/10/water-found-in-new-locations-on-the-moon-may-be-trapped-in-glass/\">search for ice deposits</a> that could be used by future astronauts to make their own rocket propellant and breathable air.</p>\n<p>“A large group of people have been working on this idea for 10-plus years,” said Anthony Colaprete, project scientist for NASA’s Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (VIPER) mission.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, engineers at NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston started building the rover’s chassis. In June, the space agency formally approved VIPER’s team to move into full-scale assembly and testing ahead of the rover’s scheduled launch in November 2024.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1954907#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1954907&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"95605db7209facf9570b7edd1225b16dff80e8cd2740a41b2fea76d27b7d4fb5","category":"Tech"}
