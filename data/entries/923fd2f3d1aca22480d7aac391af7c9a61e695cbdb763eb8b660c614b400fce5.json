However, it has been sure not to leave the SID SL behind because it’s clearly still very popular among pros and punters alike.</p>\n<h2>2024 RockShox SID specifications and details</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"RockShox revamp the SID and SID SL forks\" title=\"RockShox revamp the SID and SID SL forks - RS SID Ultimate\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> RockShox has revamped the SID for 2024, adding three-position damping adjustment and shaving weight.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>While the new SID fork has been designed with XC racing in mind, RockShox claims the changes for 2024 make it a far more capable fork on the trail outside of the race tapes.</p>\n<p>At a claimed 1,476g (110mm travel, 44mm offset), it’s fairly light too.</p>\n<h3>New Charger Race Day 2 damper with three positions</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"RockShox revamp the SID and SID SL forks\" title=\"RockShox revamp the SID and SID SL forks - 3P damper dial\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Just like the Flight Attendant system, the new SID and SID SL forks, and SIDLuxe rear shock now include a middle ‘pedal’ mode.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>According to RockShox, having studied how its forks worked during races, the brand realised it needed to expand damping adjustment options beyond just ‘open’ and ‘lock’ to provide more traction and a more forgiving ride.</p>\n<p>The new Charger Race Day 2 damper is featured on the Ultimate and Select+ SID forks. Similar to Scott’s TwinLoc system and RockShox’s own <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/rockshox-flight-attendant/\">Flight Attendant</a>, this gives riders three damping modes to choose from.</p>\n<p>Switching between ‘open’, ‘pedal’ and ‘lock’ alters the low-speed compression damping. This effectively firms up the fork and makes it bob less, and therefore, in theory, means it’s more efficient.</p>\n<p>The big talking point here is the inclusion of the ‘pedal’ mode – the halfway house between ‘open’ and ‘lock’.</p>\n<p>RockShox says the goal was to ensure riders could maintain traction and keep the front wheel tracking over bumps, but without the fork moving excessively when the rider puts the power down.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"RockShox revamp the SID and SID SL forks\" title=\"RockShox revamp the SID and SID SL forks - Air cap\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A simple Schrader air cap covers the spring valve and helps to cut down overall weight.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Another goal was to boost damper durability and ensure that when the fork is locked out, it really is locked out.</p>\n<p>Apparently, as SID forks aged, the lockout force on some models seemed to fade. RockShox has designed a new seal head, working closely with seal manufacturer, SKF, to help mitigate this issue.</p>\n<p>The new main seal, O-ring and bushing assembly add a touch more friction to the damper, but we’re told you’ll be hard pressed to feel it on the trail.</p>\n<p>If you’ve always been happy with just the two positions, though, the new SID will be available with a two-position damper option.</p>\n<p>For those with the previous-iteration SID or SID SL fork, you can, for £289/$269/€319, retro-fit the Charger Race Day 2 damper should you wish.</p>\n<h3>All new DebonAir+ air spring</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"RockShox revamp the SID and SID SL forks\" title=\"RockShox revamp the SID and SID SL forks - Top out spring\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> RockShox has moved to a new coil spring to handle top-out duties. This promises to help improve initial sensitivity and reduce any unpleasant top-out sensations.</span></figcaption><span> <i>SRAM / RockShox</i></span></div>\n<p>RockShox offers the latest SID fork with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/how-much-suspension-travel-do-i-need-on-my-mountain-bike/\">110mm or 120mm of travel</a>. This comes courtesy of the all-new DebonAir+ air spring, which features on all four SID models.</p>\n<p>With the last iteration of the SID being so progressive, RockShox wanted to ensure the new air spring enabled all riders to access the full amount of travel without having to huck off a cliff to achieve it.</p>\n<p>However, it was also important to ensure there was the support required through the mid-stroke for riders really looking to push the bike hard through turns or compressions. And, of course, it needed to remain sensitive and supple enough to keep the front wheel tracking the trail.</p>\n<p>In order to achieve this, RockShox has tweaked the positive and negative air volumes significantly.</p>\n<p>While the positive air volume jumps up by 16 per cent, the headline figure here is the 50 per cent increase in negative air volume.</p>\n<p>These changes should combine to help the SID sink easily into the first part of its travel, as well as lessen the progressive ramp up at the end of the stroke, enabling riders to access every single millimetre of bounce.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"RockShox revamp the SID and SID SL forks\" title=\"RockShox revamp the SID and SID SL forks - Bottom out bumper\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A new bottom-out bumper is designed to handle the very last few millimetres of travel in a controlled manner.</span></figcaption><span> <i>SRAM / RockShox</i></span></div>\n<p>Further boosting initial sensitivity and hopefully eliminating any unwanted top-out ‘thunk’ – another thing that could happen on the previous SID fork – is the use of a top-out coil spring, as opposed to the rubber bumper of old.</p>\n<p>The top-out coil spring (along with the larger negative volume) should help keep the initial bit of travel supple by reducing hysteresis (the lag experienced between switching from the compression to rebound phase as the fork moves in and out of its travel).</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"RockShox revamp the SID and SID SL forks\" title=\"RockShox revamp the SID and SID SL forks - Rebound adjuster\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This 2.5mm Allen key not only enables you to alter rebound damping, it can also be popped out of the fork and used to adjust the rebound damping of the SIDLuxe rear shock.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Should you manage to hit full travel, the small, conically shaped Jones bumper is there to cushion the bottom-out.</p>\n<p>Sadly, the new DebonAir+ air spring isn’t backwards-compatible, because many of the changes are linked to the chassis alterations.</p>\n<h3>Updated SID chassis</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"RockShox revamp the SID and SID SL forks\" title=\"RockShox revamp the SID and SID SL forks - New air spring\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Both the negative and positive air spring volumes grow significantly for 2024 in a bid to deliver a more sensitive, smoother fork with less of a pronounced ramp up at the end of its travel.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The 2024 SID also sees some significant changes to the chassis, though continues to use 35mm upper tubes, just as before.</p>\n<p>RockShox reduced material in key areas throughout the lower legs, which not only helped to shave weight but was also responsible for the positive and negative air spring volume changes.</p>\n<p>Naturally, RockShox was keen to ensure the SID remained stiff and accurate, though. By increasing the length of the upper tubes by 25mm, and spacing the bushings out more, overlap has been increased and, according to RockShox, helps to reduce side load on each bushing during impacts, limiting friction.</p>\n<p>RockShox says this also boosts overall durability.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"RockShox revamp the SID and SID SL forks\" title=\"RockShox revamp the SID and SID SL forks - SID Bushings\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Longer upper tubes and improved bushing spacing should keep the SID feeling stiff and accurate when pushed hard.</span></figcaption><span> <i>SRAM / RockShox</i></span></div>\n<p>Finally, the SID Ultimate gets a fresh crown. This is a new, heavily machined alloy number, which is said be to lighter than its predecessor.</p>\n<p>It’s so light, in fact, that when we quizzed RockShox as to why there isn’t a carbon option, it said it has achieved a stiffer crown at a comparable weight, so the added cost was unnecessary.</p>\n<p>All in all, these changes equate to a small weight saving of 30g.</p>\n<p>Working alongside Maxima Racing Oils, a new, proprietary blend of lubricant has been developed (Maxima Plush Dynamic Suspension Lube), which will now feature in the RockShox line-up.</p>\n\n<h2>2024 RockShox SLD SL specifications and details</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"RockShox revamp the SID and SID SL forks\" title=\"RockShox revamp the SID and SID SL forks - SID Ultimate crown2\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Careful removal of material in the right places helped RockShox save some grams over the older SID fork.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Although RockShox clearly ploughed a lot of time and energy into the overhaul of the SID fork, it was keen to boost performance in the very popular SID SL, too.</p>\n<p>While the changes aren’t as dramatic, they’re still worth noting.</p>\n<p>This lightweight fork continues to use skinny 32mm upper tubes to help save grams. In fact, according to the claimed weights, the SID SL Ultimate 3P fork in its 110mm-travel guise will save you around 100g, tipping the scales at 1,352g.</p>\n<p>Like the SID, the SID SL also moves to three-position damping for 2024, using the Charger Race Day 2 damper on both the Ultimate and Select+ level forks. And, like the SID, two-position damping options will be available, too.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"RockShox revamp the SID and SID SL forks\" title=\"RockShox revamp the SID and SID SL forks - Cable guide\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The push-in cable guide is simple, effective and light.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>If you already own an SID SL, you can fit the updated Charger Race Day 2 damper into the previous-generation fork.</p>\n<p>There’s now a 110mm-travel option for those looking for a little extra comfort over the standard 100mm, although the SID SL doesn’t feature the new DebonAir+ air spring.</p>\n<p>Instead, the air spring from the previous-generation SID SL stays put.</p>\n<p>And, just like the SID Ultimate, the SID SL Ultimate fork gets a new, machined alloy crown to help shave some weight. RockShox says its top-spec version weighs in at a claimed 1,352g.</p>\n<p>Like other <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/rockshox-suspension-fork-guide/\">RockShox forks</a>, the SID SL uses Maxima Plush Dynamic Suspension Lube in a bid to keep it moving smoothly.</p>\n<h2>2024 RockShox SIDLuxe specifications and details</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"RockShox revamp the SID and SID SL forks\" title=\"RockShox revamp the SID and SID SL forks - SIDLuxe shock\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The SIDLuxe shock gets some internal refinements for 2024 in a bid to create a smoother-riding shock than before.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Like the SID and SID SL forks, for 2024 the SIDLuxe shock moves to a new three-position damping system.</p>\n<p>Externally, the chassis remains more or less the same as the previous version, though receives a few alterations to the remotely operated damping dial, which now looks a little sleeker and more refined.</p>\n<p>RockShox has made changes, internally, though.</p>\n<p>The idea here was to create a shock that closely mimics the feel of the fork, avoiding any harshness and improving overall smoothness.</p>\n<p>To do this, the new SIDLuxe gets increased oil flow through the high-speed compression valve, enabling it to ‘blow off’ faster when slapping into really rugged terrain.</p>\n<p>RockShox says this will not only work when in the ‘open’ mode, but in the firmer ‘pedal’ mode also.</p>\n<p>Understandably, enabling the shock to use its travel more quickly and easily in these situations (due to the change in compression damping) means bottom-out resistance needed to be increased.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"RockShox revamp the SID and SID SL forks\" title=\"RockShox revamp the SID and SID SL forks - SIDLuxe damping adjust\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> To sync with the new SID and SID SL forks, the SIDLuxe moves to three-position damping for 2024.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The SIDLuxe now features a taller, tapered bumper to handle those bigger impacts in a controlled fashion. According to RockShox, it gives a similar feel to the ‘Hydraulic Bottom Out’ feature found on the Deluxe and Super Deluxe shocks.</p>\n<p>To further bolster bottom-out resistance, volume spacers can be fitted to alter the air spring curve, though these are different from those that could be used in the 2021 SIDLuxe shock.</p>\n<p>That’s due to the alterations to the air piston and seal head (done so, in part, to ensure the lockout remains consistent and firm as the SIDLuxe ages over time). That means if you’re keen on upgrading and often use spacers, you’ll need to invest in some new ones to fit the 2024 SIDLuxe model.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, the SIDLuxe remains largely familiar, with the same volume and minimalist design in order to help keep the weight in check (the 190x45mm shock weighs a claimed 246g).</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"RockShox revamp the SID and SID SL forks\" title=\"RockShox revamp the SID and SID SL forks - TwistLoc cable routing\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Cable routing is clean and neat as it exits the remote.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>You’ll still need a 2.5mm Allen key to alter the rebound damping (if you have the SID or SID SL fork, you can pop out the 2.5mm Allen key that doubles as the rebound dial and use that).</p>\n<p>RockShox has worked with an extensive list of brands to develop specific tunes for a number of bikes.</p>\n<p>These include the likes of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/bmc-fourstroke-01-two-axs-review/\">BMC Fourstroke</a> (2021+), Canyon Lux TR (2022+), Mondraker F-Podium (2020+), <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/bike-of-the-week/bike-of-the-week-mondraker-f-podium-dc-r/\">Mondraker F-Podium DC</a> (2020+), Santa Cruz Blur (2022+), Santa Cruz Blur TR (2022+), <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/specialized-epic-evo-expert-review/\">Specialized Epic Evo</a> (2021+), <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/transition-spur-x01-review/\">Transition Spur</a> (2020+) and<a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/trek-top-fuel-8/\"> Trek Top Fuel</a> (2020-2022), to name a few.</p>\n<p>The SIDLuxe Ultimate 3P shock will set you back £479-539/$439-509/€539-609.</p>\n<h2>2024 TwistLoc Ultimate remote specifications and details</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"RockShox revamp the SID and SID SL forks\" title=\"RockShox revamp the SID and SID SL forks - RS TwistLoc\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> RockShox has slimmed down the TwistLoc remote for 2024 and added the ‘pedal’ mode.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The handiest way in which to toggle through the fork and shock’s three-position (or two) settings is using the updated TwistLoc remote.</p>\n<p>This Grip Shift-inspired remote has been slimmed down somewhat for 2024, and now comes paired with two different push-on (rather than lock-on) grip options.</p>\n<p>There’s now smooth foam or textured grips to choose from, depending on your preference.
