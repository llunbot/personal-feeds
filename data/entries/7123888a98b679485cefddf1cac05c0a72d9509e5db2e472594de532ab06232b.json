The silent treatment was so bad that some questioned if Hyper was even a company anymore. Hyper tells Ars Technica that it, indeed, is still a company and that its support services are now back on track after facing technical difficulties amid a revamp following its 2021 acquisition by Targus.</p>\n<h2>The silent treatment</h2>\n<p>Various complaints about Hyper's support over the past few weeks are easily found online. A <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/UsbCHardware/comments/1345zad/beware_hyper_appears_to_have_shut_down_their/\">Reddit</a> thread from Monday, for example, urges people to stop buying Hyper products due to a lack of tech and RMA support. The user, \"eat_pb,\" claimed to have sent in a HyperJuice battery pack for replacement since one of its USB-C ports stopped working.</p>\n<p>\"Fast-forward 4 weeks and I've heard nothing from HYPER. No replacement battery pack has been shipped. I've sent several emails to their support address, asking about the status of my RMA, with no answer. I've tried calling the support phone numbers listed on their website, but both numbers have been disconnected,\" eat_pb wrote.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1936726#p3\">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1936726&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7123888a98b679485cefddf1cac05c0a72d9509e5db2e472594de532ab06232b","category":"Tech"}
