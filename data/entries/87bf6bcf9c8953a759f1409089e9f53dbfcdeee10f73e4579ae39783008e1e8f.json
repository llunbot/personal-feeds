{"title":"Rim brakes or disc brakes, 650b or 700c, geared or single speed – the Pine Cycles Rasa really can do it all","link":"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/new-pine-rasa-frameset/","date":1637766619000,"content":"<img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/11/@analogstrikesback_20211121__IWM8482-1-334e91c.jpg?quality=45&amp;resize=620,413\" />                                            <p>Pine Cycles’ new Rasa steel frame can be equipped for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/how-to-plan-your-first-road-bike-ride/\" target=\"_blank\">road cycling</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/what-is-gravel-riding/\" target=\"_blank\">gravel riding</a> and fixed-gear urban riding. The US-made frameset is compatible with four different forks, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/mtb/mountain-bike-wheel-sizes-26in-650b-and-29in-explained/\" target=\"_blank\">three wheel sizes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/road-disc-brakes-everything-you-need-to-know/\" target=\"_blank\">rim or disc brakes</a>. A 50 per cent $1,050 deposit secures you a frame and fork.</p>\n<p>According to Pine, the Rasa is inspired by <i>tabula rasa</i> – the idea that the human mind begins with a blank slate.</p>\n<p>The manufacturer says the bike’s maximum tyre clearances are 700c x 35mm, 650b x 48mm or 26in x 2.3in. You can switch between sizes on the same frame.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Pine’s Rasa can be set up for road riding with a carbon fork and 2× groupset.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Pine Cycles / @analogstrikesback</i></span></div>\n<p>Therefore, Pine claims the Rasa can be a road, gravel, cyclocross, touring or commuter bike and “anything in between”.</p>\n<p>Pine explains the Rasa’s attractive, slim Columbus Zona tubing is possible thanks to retro front-end geometry.</p>\n<p>The bike is built around a custom 1 1/4in head tube. These were seen commonly on mountain bikes in the nineties, but these days, most steel bikes use a tapered head tube – which can look a bit out of place compared to skinny steel tubes – or a straight 1 1/8in or 1in head tube.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Wide, knobbly treads can be fitted to the Rasa for exploring off-road.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Pine Cycles / @analogstrikesback</i></span></div>\n<p>The 1 1/4in head tube allows the Rasa to accommodate its matching straight steel or tapered carbon fork, but does require the bike to use a custom <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/the-ultimate-guide-to-headsets/\" target=\"_blank\">headset</a> from White Industries. Two other fork options are also available to purchase separately.</p>\n<p>The frame’s cable routing is external on the down tube and internal along the top tube.</p>\n<p>Pine says the biggest chainring the Rasa can take in a 1× guise is 44T, and 50/34 with a 2× setup.</p>\n<p>Its suggested gravel setup is based on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/campagnolo-ekar-groupset-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Campagnolo’s 13-speed Ekar groupset</a> and full Enve cockpit with flared drop bars.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Rasa in its single-speed guise.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Pine Cycles / @analogstrikesback</i></span></div>\n<p>Pine says its own dropouts – a collaboration with custom frame part maker Lichen Precision – underpin the Rasa’s adaptability.</p>\n<p>These dropouts allow the bike to use a 12×142mm <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/road-bike-axle-standards/\" target=\"_blank\">thru-axle</a> and flat-mount brakes for disc-brake builds.</p>\n<p>The bike is also compatible with a standard 130×10mm quick release for use with rim brakes, or 135×10 horizontal track ends for fixed gear and single-speed builds.</p>\n<p>All dropouts also have the option to add <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mudguards-fenders-a-buyers-guide/\" target=\"_blank\">mudguard</a> or rack mounts.</p>\n<p>The bike is available in five different handsome earth tones and comes with three bottle boss mounts as standard.</p>\n<h2>Example road build</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The road build is based on a carbon fork and rim brakes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Pine Cycles / @analogstrikesback</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>700c x 32mm tubeless tyres</li>\n<li>Carbon disc brake</li>\n<li>Allied all-road fork</li>\n<li>2x groupset</li>\n</ul><p>A carbon rim brake-compatible fork is sold separately.</p>\n<h2>Example gravel build</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The gravel build is intended to use a 1× groupset.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Pine Cycles / @analogstrikesback</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>650b x 48mm or 26in x 2.3in tyres</li>\n<li>Steel disc or rim brake</li>\n<li>Pine’s own segmented fork</li>\n<li>1x groupset</li>\n</ul><h2>Example commuter build</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> If tracklocross is more your thing, this bike could be for you.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Pine Cycles / @analogstrikesback</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>700c x 32mm tyres</li>\n<li>Carbon/alu rim brake</li>\n<li>Wound Up commuter fork</li>\n</ul><h3>Or single speed/fixed wheel</h3>\n<ul><li>Rim/no brake</li>\n<li>135/10 horizontal track insert</li>\n</ul>","author":"Jack Evans","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"87bf6bcf9c8953a759f1409089e9f53dbfcdeee10f73e4579ae39783008e1e8f","category":"Cycling"}
