But there’s probably nothing to worry about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The vulnerability is in the ACE3 USB controller, which Apple introduced with the iPhone 15 lineup in 2023. <a href=\"https://cybersecuritynews.com/apples-new-usb-c-controller-hacked/\">Cyber Security News</a> reports that researcher Thomas Roth used his knowledge of the previous controller, the ACE2, as the basis to hack the latest controller, using “a combination of reverse engineering, RF side-channel analysis, and electromagnetic fault injection.” Roth and his team were able to bypass the ACE3’s validation checks and install a modified patch into the CPU.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s controller is more complex than typical USB controllers, handling charging and data transfers, which makes it a target for hackers. However, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2025/01/13/apple-iphone-usb-c-hacked-what-you-need-to-know/\">Roth told Forbes</a> that when he reported the issue to Apple, the company told him that the attack was so complex that they didn’t see it as a threat, and Roth agreed with Apple’s stance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roth presented his findings at the <a href=\"https://events.ccc.de/congress/2024/infos/index.html\">Chaos Communication Congress</a> last December and it was recently reported by several security outlets. However, Roth presented his findings as early as last June at the <a href=\"https://www.offensivecon.org/speakers/2024/stacksmashing.html\">Offensive Security Conference</a>. A recording of Roth’s June presentation is <a href=\"https://youtu.be/QlaJQEa3_zQ?si=l53mbF1WGK6RO2cR\">available on YouTube</a>; it appears to be the same as the <a href=\"https://media.ccc.de/v/38c3-ace-up-the-sleeve-hacking-into-apple-s-new-usb-c-controller\">December CCC presentation</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to protect yourself from hacker attacks</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As Apple and Roth state, this attack is so complicated that users don’t need to be concerned about it. If a hacker were to exploit this vulnerability, they would need to have physical access to your iPhone. Apple has protections in place within its operating systems and the company releases security patches through OS updates, so it’s important to install them when they are available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Macworld has several guides to help, including a guide on whether <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672485/do-iphones-get-viruses.html\">iPhones are virus-proof</a>, h<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672563/how-remove-virus-iphone-ipad.html\">ow to remove a virus from an iPhone or iPad</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670537/do-macs-need-antivirus.html\">whether or not you need antivirus software</a>, a<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672879/list-of-mac-viruses-malware-and-security-flaws.html\"> list of Mac viruses, malware, and trojans</a>, and a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668850/best-mac-antivirus-software.html\">comparison of Mac security software</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"c4526798e82951d40648fa57f7ec446d58ef8acb33bdcaccef0e6e77867415e8","category":"Apple"}
