Up front is the FSA Vision Metron 5D ACR one-piece bar and stem that’s graciously free of the usual logo overload.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s quite stealthy, and even leaves the 3k fiber weave visible with a nice matte finish that somehow works very well with the gloss black frame. Depending on frame size, widths are 380mm to 400mm to 420mm, which <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/whats-coming-in-2024-bikerumor-staff-predictions-for-bike-tech-in-the-new-year/\">fits current trends</a> of skewing narrower for aero gains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may want some thicker tape, it comes with Lizardskins’ DSP 2.5mm, which is great but very thin, likely to save grams…the claimed weight for the complete bike is just 6.7kg (14.75lbs).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Orbea-Orca-2024-Lotto-Dsnty-team-replica-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1729\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Orbea-Orca-2024-Lotto-Dsnty-team-replica-2.jpg\" alt=\"front view of lotto dstny team replica orbea orca road race bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Orbea-Orca-2024-Lotto-Dsnty-team-replica-2.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Orbea-Orca-2024-Lotto-Dsnty-team-replica-2-260x300.jpg 260w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Orbea-Orca-2024-Lotto-Dsnty-team-replica-2-800x922.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Orbea-Orca-2024-Lotto-Dsnty-team-replica-2-104x120.jpg 104w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Orbea-Orca-2024-Lotto-Dsnty-team-replica-2-768x885.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Orbea-Orca-2024-Lotto-Dsnty-team-replica-2-1333x1536.jpg 1333w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Wheels are Oquo RP45LTD wrapped with Vittoria Corsa Pro G2.0 TLR 700×28 tires…further proof that even the pros have adopted wider tires and tubeless setups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MSRP for the complete bike is $11,999 (€11,499 / £12,499), available in seven sizes.
