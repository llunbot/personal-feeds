The company's consumer and automotive technology executive Richard Yu called it an \"epoch-making product.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Huawei event is scheduled for September 10 at 2:30 p.m. China Standard Time. That translates to 11.30 p.m. Pacific Time on September 9, so the same day of Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/apple-september-9-iphone-event/\">\"It's Glowtime\" event</a> for observers on the US West Coast. Apart from the foldable, new smartwatches and an electric car are also expected to be announced by Huawei on stage.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHuawei's recent resurgence has significantly challenged Apple's position in the Chinese smartphone market. According to research firm <a href=\"https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/china-smartphone-market-Q2-2024\">Canalys</a>, Apple's standing in China has notably declined, with the company falling out of the top five smartphone vendors by market share in the second quarter of 2023. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn stark contrast, Huawei has experienced a remarkable upswing during the same period. The company saw its smartphone shipments in China surge by 41% compared to the same quarter last year, marking the fastest growth rate among the top five brands in the country. \r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/01/iphone-16-launch-month-is-here-everything-we-know/\">iPhone 16 Launch Month Is Here: Everything We Know</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nApple is unlikely to release a foldable iPhone before 2027, according to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/03/foldable-iphone-unlikely-to-launch-before-2027/\">Taiwanese research firm TrendForce</a>.
