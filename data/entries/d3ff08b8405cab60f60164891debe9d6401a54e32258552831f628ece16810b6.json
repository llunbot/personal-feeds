The overall ‌iPhone 16‌ Pro Max device height would increase by approximately 5 mm to ~165.0 mm while the width would only increase by about 0.5 mm to ~77.2 mm.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's still very early in the rumor cycle for the ‌iPhone 16‌ lineup as we're well over a year away from launch, so the accuracy of the leaked CAD model remains uncertain. We'll undoubtedly hear much more in the coming months, so we'll see if future information lines up with this early claim.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/22/iphone-16-pro-max-taller-display-rendering/\">Alleged iPhone 16 Pro Max CAD Model Reveals Significantly Taller Display</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/alleged-iphone-16-pro-max-cad-model-reveals-significantly-taller-display.2390227/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Eric Slivka","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d3ff08b8405cab60f60164891debe9d6401a54e32258552831f628ece16810b6","category":"Apple"}
