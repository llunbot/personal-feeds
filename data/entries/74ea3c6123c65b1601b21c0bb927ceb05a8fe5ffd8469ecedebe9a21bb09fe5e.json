The two advocated for the use of semiconductor chips to power a wealth of consumer electronics, and made laptop computers affordable for hundreds of millions of people. Moore eventually became chairman and CEO of the company in 1979, and served as CEO for eight years.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn 2005, Apple transitioned the CPUs of its Mac and Xserve computers from PowerPC to the x86 architecture from Intel. The partnership lasted for 15 years until Apple announced that it would shift its Mac line to Apple silicon in 2020.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/intel/\">Intel</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/27/tim-cook-pays-tribute-gordon-moore/\">Tim Cook Pays Tribute to the Late Intel Co-Founder Gordon Moore</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tim-cook-pays-tribute-to-the-late-intel-co-founder-gordon-moore.2384915/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"74ea3c6123c65b1601b21c0bb927ceb05a8fe5ffd8469ecedebe9a21bb09fe5e","category":"Apple"}
