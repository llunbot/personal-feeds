Developed by Amazon Web Services (AWS), Q is designed to assist employees with tasks like summarizing documents, managing internal support tickets, and providing policy guidance, differentiating itself from consumer-focused chatbots. It also serves as a programming assistant.</p>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/28/technology/amazon-ai-chatbot-q.html\">The New York Times</a>, the name \"Q\" is a play on the word â€œquestion\" and a reference to the character Q in the James Bond novels, who makes helpful tools. (And there's apparently a little bit of Q from <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em> thrown in, although hopefully the new bot won't cause mischief on that scale.)</p>\n<p>Amazon Q's launch positions it against existing corporate AI tools like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/microsoft-365s-copilot-assistant-for-businesses-comes-with-a-hefty-price-tag/\">Microsoft's Copilot</a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/08/googles-30-per-month-duet-ai-will-craft-awkward-emails-images-for-you/\">Google's Duet AI</a>, and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/08/the-new-spreadsheet-openai-introduces-chatgpt-enterprise-for-businesses/\">ChatGPT Enterprise</a>. Unlike some of its competitors, Amazon Q isn't built on a singular AI large language model (LLM). Instead, it uses a platform called Bedrock, integrating multiple AI systems, including <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/generative-ai-comes-to-amazon-web-services/\">Amazon's Titan</a> and models from <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/new-chatgpt-rival-claude-2-launches-for-open-beta-testing/\">Anthropic</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/meta-launches-llama-2-an-open-source-ai-model-that-allows-commercial-applications/\">Meta</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1987059#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1987059&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2dde8a7d5e071a5b895d891322de63621623bc726a4f1f5e468d9f95abbaefe5","category":"Tech"}
