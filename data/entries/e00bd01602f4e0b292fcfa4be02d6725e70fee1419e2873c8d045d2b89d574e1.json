Be it backpacking or a bike tour, this common hack was popularized by lore in these circles and passed down from lightweight traveler to newcomer for decades.

It pops into the handle of a Toaks titanium long-handle spoon, short-handle spoon, spork, or fork, multi-purposing the spoon into a toothbrush. Neat. They’ll even throw in a teeny airline tube of Colgate for ya.</p>\n<p>Check it out, in stock at <a href=\"https://zpacks.com/products/trailbrush-w-5g-colgate-toothpaste\" target=\"_blank\">Zpacks</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/trailbrush-toothbrush/\">Ultralight Hacks: Trailbrush Toothbrush Attaches to a Titanium Spoon</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"e00bd01602f4e0b292fcfa4be02d6725e70fee1419e2873c8d045d2b89d574e1","category":"Cycling"}
