Whether it carries cargo or humans, Starliner's next flight will not occur until late this year or, more likely, sometime in 2026.</p>\n<p>Two things stand out in the new information provided by NASA. First, there remains a lot of work left to do this year before Starliner will fly again, including extensive testing of the vehicle's propulsion system. And secondly, it is becoming clear that Starliner will only ever fly a handful of missions to the space station, if that, before the orbiting laboratory is retired.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/03/nasa-to-put-starliners-thrusters-through-an-extensive-workout-before-next-launch/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/03/nasa-to-put-starliners-thrusters-through-an-extensive-workout-before-next-launch/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"085874ba42a3e9d499099e789d4aebc4c07ec315028e83fc5be000cc7d2fd4ed","category":"Tech"}
