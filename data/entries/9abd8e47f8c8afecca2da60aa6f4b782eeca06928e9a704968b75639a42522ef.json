{"title":"How Apple Built the iPhone 13’s Cinematic Mode","link":"https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/23/how-apple-built-the-iphone-13-pros-cinematic-mode/","date":1632428312000,"content":"\n<p>Great interview by Matthew Panzarino with Apple vice president Kaiann Drance and human interface designer Johnnie Manzari from Apple’s Camera team:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>That’s not even counting tracking shots, where a focus puller is\ncontinually adjusting focus as the camera moves and even the\nsubject moves in relation to the camera. It’s a highly skilled\noperation. To pull off a tracking shot, a focus puller must\npractice and train extensively for years. This, Manzari says, is\nwhere Apple sees an opportunity.</p>\n\n<p>“We feel like this is the kind of thing that Apple tackles the\nbest. To take something difficult and conventionally hard to\nlearn, and then turn it into something automatic and simple.”</p>\n\n<p>So the team started working through the technical problems in\nfinding focus, locking focus and racking focus. And these\nexplorations led them to gaze.</p>\n\n<p>“In cinema, the role of gaze and body movement to direct that\nstory is so fundamental. And as humans we naturally do this, if\nyou look at something, I look at it too.”</p>\n\n<p>So they knew they would need to build in gaze detection to help\nlead their focusing target around the frame, which in turn leads\nthe viewer through the story. Being on set, Manzari says, allowed\nApple to observe these highly skilled technicians and then build\nin that feel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Panzarino includes <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JcEG5Vjt-w\">this three-minute video consisting of nothing but Cinematic mode clips</a> from the trip to Disneyland he took with his family to test the new iPhones. There are some really neat shots in the video — I particularly like the one around the 1m:32s mark with his kids on the carousel. That change in focus is exactly what Cinematic mode was meant for.</p>\n\n<p>But the other thing that Panzarino’s video exemplifies is that you don’t have to <em>work</em> to use Cinematic mode. No help from someone else (let alone a crew), no extra lighting, no more difficult than just shooting a regular video mode clip. Something anyone could do — and might want to do — on a hectic day at a fun theme park. If you screw up the focus while shooting you can <em>easily</em> fix it — or just improve it — later.  </p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/23/panzarino-cinematic-mode\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"9abd8e47f8c8afecca2da60aa6f4b782eeca06928e9a704968b75639a42522ef","category":"Tech"}
