Those include Wisconsin, which just agreed with Foxconn to amend its former plan of investing $10 billion in the state -- a promise Foxconn made in 2017.</blockquote>At first, Foxconn will use the U.S. plant to build vehicles for its client Fisker, although there could be a potential expansion to serve Apple in the future.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple is widely reported to be working on its own vehicle and is thought to be looking for third-party companies to help it launch the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/\">Apple Car</a>.

Apple is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/13/apple-car-battery-united-states/\">reportedly committed</a> to ensuring that the battery used in the ‌Apple Car‌ is produced in the United States, but Foxconn does not produce batteries. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/\">Apple Car</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foxconn/\">Foxconn</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nikkei-com/\">nikkei.com</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8\">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/12/foxconn-plant-in-the-united-states/\">Apple Supplier Foxconn to Begin Building Electric Vehicle Factory in the U.S. Next Year</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-supplier-foxconn-to-begin-building-electric-vehicle-factory-in-the-u-s-next-year.2307337/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Wpn-5DYLreg:L94d0GmUdIA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Wpn-5DYLreg:L94d0GmUdIA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/Wpn-5DYLreg\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e7520fbce78f70b0cced2877010e60bdf8b061fa789170b5bad09a223cc0be3b","category":"Apple"}
