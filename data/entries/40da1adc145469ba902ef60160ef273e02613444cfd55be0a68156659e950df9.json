Today 7mesh announces their new Airmap collection for Fall 2023, an innovative line of air-permeable riding gear that includes pieces for MTB, road, and gravel riders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last winter I checked out <strong><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/7mesh-headquarters-tour-adapting-to-a-future-of-pfas-free-outerwear/\">7mesh’s headquarters</a></strong> and learned from their VP of product Ian Martin about why PFAS chemicals were being banned for use in water-resistant outdoor clothing.  At that time I got a sneak peek at the incoming Airmap clothing, which exemplifies 7mesh’s shift to making the best riding gear possible without PFAS chemicals.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have an Airmap Cache Anorak for testing, but it’s been too warm to wear it before the product launch: Keep an eye on Bikerumor for an upcoming review of the Cache Anorak and 7mesh’s Flightpath pants.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>7mesh Airmap Clothing – Technical Details:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/7mesh-Airmap-clothing-MTB-river.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/7mesh-Airmap-clothing-MTB-river-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"7mesh Airmap clothing, MTB, river\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/7mesh-Airmap-clothing-MTB-river-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/7mesh-Airmap-clothing-MTB-river-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/7mesh-Airmap-clothing-MTB-river-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/7mesh-Airmap-clothing-MTB-river-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/7mesh-Airmap-clothing-MTB-river-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/7mesh-Airmap-clothing-MTB-river.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Airmap clothing uses three different selectively placed permeable and breathable PFAS-free fabrics to regulate airflow and control both heat and water vapor management. Airmap clothing seeks to find an ideal balance between rain/wind protection and ventilation, which makes for versatile garments that should ride well in variable weather conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Airmap aims to control how air flows over various areas of your body; Panels are placed to block air from the direction of travel, exchange heat, and moisture, and manage water/perspiration on the inside and outside. 7mesh wants to save you the trouble of adding or removing layers during a ride, so the Airmap clothing regulates moisture and temperature as much as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/7mesh-Airmap-clothing-road-rider.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/7mesh-Airmap-clothing-road-rider-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"7mesh Airmap clothing, road rider\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/7mesh-Airmap-clothing-road-rider-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/7mesh-Airmap-clothing-road-rider-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/7mesh-Airmap-clothing-road-rider-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/7mesh-Airmap-clothing-road-rider-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/7mesh-Airmap-clothing-road-rider-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/7mesh-Airmap-clothing-road-rider.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>7mesh has developed three Airmap fabrics, with single, double and triple layer construction. The three-layer fabric offers weatherproof protection, the double-layer fabric provides wind resistance, and the single-layer fabric offers the most breathability and air permeability possible. By placing panels of each strategically, 7mesh can optimize weather resistance and breathability where each is required for the Airmap garments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sharing the same outer face, all three Airmap fabrics appear identical so the clothing looks completely uniform despite the use of several different fabrics.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/7mesh-Airmap-Cache-Anorak-on-woman.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/7mesh-Airmap-Cache-Anorak-on-woman-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"7mesh Airmap Cache Anorak, on woman\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/7mesh-Airmap-Cache-Anorak-on-woman-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/7mesh-Airmap-Cache-Anorak-on-woman-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/7mesh-Airmap-Cache-Anorak-on-woman-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/7mesh-Airmap-Cache-Anorak-on-woman-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/7mesh-Airmap-Cache-Anorak-on-woman-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/7mesh-Airmap-Cache-Anorak-on-woman.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All Airmap fabrics are not only PFAS/PFC-free, but they are also Bluesign and Oeko-Tex Standard 100 certified. Furthermore, the polyester and polyurethane used for Airmap clothing is recycled material. All of the new Airmap pieces are available in men’s and women’s styles. All garments come in men’s and women’s sizes XS-XXL.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>MTB/Gravel/Adventure Clothing:</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Cache Jacket – $300</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/7mesh-Airmap-Womens-Cache-Jacket.jpg\"><img width=\"934\" height=\"1097\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/7mesh-Airmap-Womens-Cache-Jacket.jpg\" alt=\"7mesh Airmap Cache Jacket, womens\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/7mesh-Airmap-Womens-Cache-Jacket.jpg 934w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/7mesh-Airmap-Womens-Cache-Jacket-255x300.jpg 255w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/7mesh-Airmap-Womens-Cache-Jacket-800x940.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/7mesh-Airmap-Womens-Cache-Jacket-102x120.jpg 102w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/7mesh-Airmap-Womens-Cache-Jacket-768x902.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cache Jacket is a hoodless style that uses 3-layer Airmap fabric on the body, and 2-layer fabric on the side panels and undersides of the sleeves. The jacket has a full front zipper with a Tricot chin guard, and for storage, you get two hand pockets and an internal chest pocket (all with zip closures).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An elastic drawcord at the waist lets you keep chilly winds at bay, and the jacket’s elastic cuffs slip over gloves easily.

A slim, low-profile elastic drawcord at the hem and elastics sewn into the cuffs help keep the elements out and your body warmth in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Anorak includes 7mesh’s Stash System straps so you can pack it up into itself and strap it to your frame. The large kangaroo pocket on the front offers zippered access from both sides.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cache Anorak provides an articulated but relaxed fit for on or off-bike comfort. 7mesh has added reflective details for rider visibility, and made the inside of the Stash pocket reflective as well.

Women’s choices are Butterscotch or Black.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Grit Pant – $300</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/7mesh-Airmap-Mens-Grit-pant.jpg\"><img width=\"934\" height=\"1097\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/7mesh-Airmap-Mens-Grit-pant.jpg\" alt=\"7mesh Airmap Grit Pant, mens\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/7mesh-Airmap-Mens-Grit-pant.jpg 934w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/7mesh-Airmap-Mens-Grit-pant-255x300.jpg 255w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/7mesh-Airmap-Mens-Grit-pant-800x940.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/7mesh-Airmap-Mens-Grit-pant-102x120.jpg 102w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/7mesh-Airmap-Mens-Grit-pant-768x902.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Grit Pant is 7mesh’s most durable pant, made mostly from 3-layer Airmap fabric with 2-layer panels on the back of the legs for ventilation. The seams are taped, but also offer stretch to ensure unrestricted movement. The Grit pants feature two zippered hand pockets with mesh sleeves to keep your phone separate from other items.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the waist you’ll find a zippered fly with a button closure and an ultra-suede hook and ladder adjuster. The Grit pants’ elastic cuffs keep you covered up and make it easy to slip your feet through. These pants offer a Trim fit but with ample room for kneepads. Men’s and Women’s Grit pants come in Black or Shale (grey).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Road/High-Performance Gravel Clothing:</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>S2S Jersey LS – $300</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/7mesh-Airmap-Mens-S2S-Jersey.jpg\"><img width=\"934\" height=\"1097\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/7mesh-Airmap-Mens-S2S-Jersey.jpg\" alt=\"7mesh Airmap S2S LS Jersey, mens\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/7mesh-Airmap-Mens-S2S-Jersey.jpg 934w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/7mesh-Airmap-Mens-S2S-Jersey-255x300.jpg 255w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/7mesh-Airmap-Mens-S2S-Jersey-800x940.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/7mesh-Airmap-Mens-S2S-Jersey-102x120.jpg 102w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/7mesh-Airmap-Mens-S2S-Jersey-768x902.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The long-sleeve S2S Jersey uses all three Airmap fabrics. The body uses 3-layer fabric, the sleeves and back utilize 2-layer Airmap, and the underarms get the most breathable single-layer fabric. The jersey uses a mix of sewn and stretch seams to allow for excellent mobility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This jersey offers a full two-way front zipper for additional climate control. On the back you’ll find 7mesh’s Anything pockets, which are sewn to resist sagging. The rear hem, sleeve, and chest all bear reflective details.

The body is made with 3-layer fabric, while the underarms and inside collar use 2-layer fabric. To make the vest more packable, single-layer Airmap is used for the vest’s Stash pocket. The vest can be packed into its side pocket, and strapped to your frame with 7mesh’s Stash System straps. The zippered Stash pocket remains useable for cargo when the vest isn’t packed away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The trim-fitting S2S Vest has a full-length two-way front zipper with a Tricot chin guard.
