Looking at the previous generation ERC with both 25 &amp; 28mm Conti tires, the difference is similar, suggesting a new ERC 45 with a 25mm tire (the smallest allowable) would probably be quite close to the new ARC 50.</p><p>It’s also interesting to note how the new and wider ERCs (<em>lighter reds)</em> compare to the original ERC (<em>blues</em>), with significantly lower drag straight into a headwind for either depth, even with wider tires. The new 45 (<em>medium red</em>) is faster almost across the board vs. the old 47 (<em>lighter blue</em>, with the same size 28mm tire), curiously except for +15° wind yaw. That variation from one side to the next suggests interaction of the hub (which appears unchanged), spokes &amp; disc brake, so the difference could even just be using a different rotor.</p><p>(All images we’ve seen from DT show the latest closed vented Shimano rotors, <em>like below</em>, or Campagnolo rotor, neither of which were around for the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2016/12/01/first-look-dt-swiss-erc-1100-aero-endurance-road-carbon-wheels-tease-come/\">2016 ERC launch</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/09025322/DT-Swiss-ERC-carbon-Aero-road-bike-wheels_reshaped-aerodynamic-all-rounder-all-road-wheelset_gravel-versatility.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/09025322/DT-Swiss-ERC-carbon-Aero-road-bike-wheels_reshaped-aerodynamic-all-rounder-all-road-wheelset_gravel-versatility.jpg\" alt=\"DT Swiss ERC carbon Aero road bike wheels, reshaped aerodynamic all-rounder all-road wheelset,&nbsp;gravel?\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/09025322/DT-Swiss-ERC-carbon-Aero-road-bike-wheels_reshaped-aerodynamic-all-rounder-all-road-wheelset_gravel-versatility.jpg 2000w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/09025322/DT-Swiss-ERC-carbon-Aero-road-bike-wheels_reshaped-aerodynamic-all-rounder-all-road-wheelset_gravel-versatility-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/09025322/DT-Swiss-ERC-carbon-Aero-road-bike-wheels_reshaped-aerodynamic-all-rounder-all-road-wheelset_gravel-versatility-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/09025322/DT-Swiss-ERC-carbon-Aero-road-bike-wheels_reshaped-aerodynamic-all-rounder-all-road-wheelset_gravel-versatility-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/09025322/DT-Swiss-ERC-carbon-Aero-road-bike-wheels_reshaped-aerodynamic-all-rounder-all-road-wheelset_gravel-versatility-768x576.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/09025322/DT-Swiss-ERC-carbon-Aero-road-bike-wheels_reshaped-aerodynamic-all-rounder-all-road-wheelset_gravel-versatility-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\"></a></p><p>The E in ERC stands for endurance, meaning those longest all-day road rides, and DT Swiss envisions this family of wheels to be their best &amp; most comfortable all-rounders for cyclists riding 28mm &amp; 30mm road tires.

From an aerodynamics perspective, DT says you’ll get the fastest performance with 28mm tires. And for the best mix of aero performance and comfort, they recommend a 28mm tire up front and a 30mm tire on the rear wheel.</p><p>Like the newly reshaped, second-generation ARC aero wheels, these new ERC wheels also go for a happy medium VU-shaped rim profile. While the blunt gen 1 U-shape was a reaction to the flat-sided V-shape of the earliest aero wheels, this new shape combines a more narrow nose and bulbous body that works well with wider rims, not constrained by rim brakes.</p><h3>Tech details</h3><p><a

Their key metric here is Steering Moment, the feeling of the wind trying to turn your handlebars as the wind shifts. Here, the new DT Swiss ERC wheels show a generally similar or flatter profile (<em>flatter is less wind-induced impact on steering overall, and smooth curves indicate less abrupt feeling as winds shift</em>) compared to that same set of competitor wheels. Outside of those Hunt 44s, the other four wheelsets all should perform similarly as the wind shifts.</p><h3>DT Swiss ERC Aero+ endurance road wheels – Pricing &amp; options</h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/09025329/DT-Swiss-ERC-carbon-Aero-road-bike-wheels_reshaped-aerodynamic-all-rounder-all-road-wheelset_line-up.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/09025329/DT-Swiss-ERC-carbon-Aero-road-bike-wheels_reshaped-aerodynamic-all-rounder-all-road-wheelset_line-up.jpg\" alt=\"DT Swiss ERC carbon Aero road bike wheels, reshaped aerodynamic all-rounder all-road wheelset,&nbsp;family\" width=\"1600\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/09025329/DT-Swiss-ERC-carbon-Aero-road-bike-wheels_reshaped-aerodynamic-all-rounder-all-road-wheelset_line-up.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/09025329/DT-Swiss-ERC-carbon-Aero-road-bike-wheels_reshaped-aerodynamic-all-rounder-all-road-wheelset_line-up-297x134.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/09025329/DT-Swiss-ERC-carbon-Aero-road-bike-wheels_reshaped-aerodynamic-all-rounder-all-road-wheelset_line-up-800x360.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/09025329/DT-Swiss-ERC-carbon-Aero-road-bike-wheels_reshaped-aerodynamic-all-rounder-all-road-wheelset_line-up-120x54.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/09025329/DT-Swiss-ERC-carbon-Aero-road-bike-wheels_reshaped-aerodynamic-all-rounder-all-road-wheelset_line-up-768x346.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/09025329/DT-Swiss-ERC-carbon-Aero-road-bike-wheels_reshaped-aerodynamic-all-rounder-all-road-wheelset_line-up-1536x691.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>DT offers their new ERC carbon Aero+ endurance road bike wheels in two depths – 35mm &amp; 45mm sold in matched pairs – and in two spec levels – ERC 1100 &amp; ERC 1400.

It’s hard to empirically compare incremental improvements, but these new wheels do feel fast. The biggest benefits we’ve seen are probably the improved comfort from the added tire volume that comes with a 3mm (+15%) increase in internal width and real weight reduction of 62g (-4%) vs. our first-generation ERC test wheels. In Europe 30€ savings is a nice touch, but exchange rates aren’t as friendly to the Americans who will have to pay $123 more than <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2016/12/01/first-look-dt-swiss-erc-1100-aero-endurance-road-carbon-wheels-tease-come/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">five years ago</a>. That said, as bike prices climb, that’s not so bad on a price hike.</p><p>We’re pretty convinced that the new&nbsp;DT Swiss ERC family of aero endurance wheels are even better all-rounders than before.
