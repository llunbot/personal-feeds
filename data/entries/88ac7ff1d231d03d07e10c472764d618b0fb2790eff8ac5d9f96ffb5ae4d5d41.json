Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who has long railed at the pharmaceutical price gouging in the US and pushed for policy reforms. After thanking Bancel for agreeing to testify, Sanders didn't pull any punches. He accused Moderna of \"profiteering\" and sharing in the \"unprecedented level of corporate greed\" seen in the pharmaceutical industry generally.</p>\n<p>Sanders contrasted a recent survey finding that 37 percent of Americans can't afford their prescription drugs to the billions of dollars in profits reaped by drug companies. He noted several times that Bancel became a billionaire overnight amid the pandemic. Bancel is now estimated to be worth over $4 billion, Sanders added.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1926141#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1926141&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"88ac7ff1d231d03d07e10c472764d618b0fb2790eff8ac5d9f96ffb5ae4d5d41","category":"Tech"}
