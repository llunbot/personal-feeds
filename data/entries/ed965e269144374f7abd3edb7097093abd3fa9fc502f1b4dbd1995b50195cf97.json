A new version of Xcode will apparently feature AI for code completion. It is also looking at integrating AI into <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a> to automate playlist creation, in addition using the technology for  troubleshooting problems with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/\">AppleCare</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHowever, Gurman believes that \"the totality of Apple's generative AI vision will take at least into 2025 to fully scale,\" suggesting that not all planned features will arrive this year, and competitors like Samsung will do everything they can to highlight Apple's current \"deficiency\" in the AI space in the coming months.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-gpt/\">Apple GPT</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/07/wave-of-apple-ai-tools-at-wwdc/\">Wave of Apple Generative AI Tools on Track for WWDC Debut</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/wave-of-apple-generative-ai-tools-on-track-for-wwdc-debut.2415693/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ed965e269144374f7abd3edb7097093abd3fa9fc502f1b4dbd1995b50195cf97","category":"Apple"}
