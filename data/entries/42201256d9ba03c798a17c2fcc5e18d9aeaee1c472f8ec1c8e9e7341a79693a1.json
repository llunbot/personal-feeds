Famous for an Easter Day egg rolling contest held on its slopes and for the fact that drivers have to park their cars at an angle to the street, rather than parallel to it, this is just the sort of challenge that draws in hill climbers.</p>\n<p>On approach, the road looks nigh on impossible, a wall of tarmac with a flight of steep steps running along each side for pedestrians. It’s not the sort of climb you just roll up and over, you need a plan of attack, you need to be primed, in the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/skills/technique/how-to-change-gears-on-a-bike/\">right gear</a> and committed to it 100 per cent.</p>\n<p>Starting on Park Street (itself a sprightly 20 per cent) that juts out from the A4 as you head east out of the city, you can either roll down then turn sharp right or climb up and turn sharp left.</p>\n<p>It’s arguably best to climb up and avoid mishaps on the abrupt change of gradient – spin a small gear from the bottom of Park Street then, once at the base of Vale Street, turn on the afterburners.</p>\n<p>The key to success is to ride on the right or ‘wrong’ side of the road, then divert back to the correct side at an angle to minimise the impact of the slope – get over the first 10 metres without the climb steering you into the gutter and you’ve cracked it.</p>\n<p>If you are feeling brave, you could lock horns with it on the left side, but it’s a tactic that many have tried and failed.</p>\n<h2>Trooper Lane, Halifax</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Cyclist riding up Trooper Lane, Halifax\" title=\"Monsterous Climbs - 03\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Cobbles add additional spice to this already challenging climb.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Jones / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Length:</strong> 769m</li>\n<li><strong>Height gain:</strong> 123m</li>\n<li><strong>Average gradient:</strong> 14.8 per cent</li>\n<li><strong>Maximum gradient:</strong> 27.7 per cent</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Unlike many of the other climbs here, Trooper Lane falls shy of the magic 30 per cent mark, but it has something none of the others do, something that makes it significantly harder to ride: cobbles.</p>\n<p>There are myriad such climbs around Halifax, from the better known Shibden Wall to the fearsome Old Lane, but Trooper Lane takes the cobbled climb to the next level.</p>\n<p>Starting on the giant smooth stones of Swan Bank Lane, it then returns to the comfort of tarmac for its first half. It’s still no stroll in the park, rarely dropping below 20 per cent as it thrashes back and forth up the valley side. 300 metres in and you hit the perilous cobbles, with added steepness for good measure.</p>\n<p>Round the bend and it gets silly. You’ll have no more sprockets to play with here and the only thing that you’ve got to lean on is brute force, a savviness to pick a good line across the increasingly rugged stones and your shrewd decision to ride here on a dry day.</p>\n<p>There’s a short period of respite as you pass a series of front doors and driveways on either side, before a return to madness for the finale, a stretch of climb that would make even the toughest of Flandrians weep.</p>\n<h2>Rosedale Chimney, North York Moors</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Male cyclist riding up the Rosedale Chimney, North York Moors\" title=\"Monsterous Climbs - 04\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Rosedale Chimney is one of the most recognisable climbs in the UK.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Jones / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Length:</strong> 1,340m</li>\n<li><strong>Height gain:</strong> 168m</li>\n<li><strong>Average gradient:</strong> 14 per cent</li>\n<li><strong>Maximum gradient:</strong> 33 per cent</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Taking its name from the Victorian smoke stack that once stood above the mines near the summit, Rosedale Chimney, or Chimney Bank, is arguably the most famous cycling climb in Britain, its legend cemented in the fabric of the sport thanks to its inclusion in the Milk Race and previous incarnations of the Tour of Britain.</p>\n<p>In a region famed for its steep roads, and where there seems to be a 1-in-3 sign around every corner, Chimney Bank stands apart. While many of the climbs here flirt with 30 per cent gradients, Chimney Bank wallows in it.</p>\n<p>When you arrive at the base, the warnings are writ large on a giant sign leaving you under no illusions that what you are about to face is terrifying.</p>\n<p>Creeping gradually upwards between tall hedgerows, the opening moderate part of the climb comes to an end as you cross a cattle grid. After that, it’s on. There’s a brace of steep bends, the first hard, the second all but impossible.</p>\n<p>On other climbs, this is where the impossible would end and a semblance of normality would return, but no, not on Rosedale Chimney. Instead of easing back, the slope takes on characteristics that one might associate with a wall.</p>\n<h2>Hardknott Pass, Lake District</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Cyclist riding on the Hardknott Pass, Lake District\" title=\"Monsterous Climbs - 05\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Long, steep or hard?

Employing a team of surveyors and suits at Guinness World Records, they took their measurements and duly proclaimed Ffordd Pen Llech steeper, even if they had somewhat tweaked the rules.</p>\n<p>The official measurement must be taken along 10 metres in the middle of the road, but they measured it across the apex of the steepest corner and it was therefore invalid. It did eventually post a figure of 28.6 per cent for 10 metres, but this was no match for Baldwin Street’s 34.8 per cent, and after holding the record for nine months it was returned to New Zealand.</p>\n<p>Not the steepest residential road, then, nor the advertised 40 per cent, as indicated by the street sign at the bottom – just inordinately steep, and vertiginous enough to make our list.</p>\n<p>Another danger here is that you’d be breaking the law in riding it, as it’s one way at the bottom to stop motorists getting into bother.</p>\n<p>Closed hill climbs have been held on it, however. The key to riding it is to hit the first corner with as much speed as you can carry, riding wide left, and giving it everything you have.</p>\n<p>Once around this bend, the slope soon recedes to a more agreeable gradient (more agreeable in the context of steep climbs, anyway!), then becomes positively placid as it weaves up through the village.</p>\n<p>The end is abrupt, mind you, and once you arrive there, prepare to be the focus of attention as tourists gawk while you sit slumped over your bars gulping in air in a bid to recover from one of the world’s steepest stretches of road.</p>\n<h2>Afon Ddu, Conwy Valley, Wales</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Cyclist riding the Afon Ddu, Conwy Valley, Wales\" title=\"Monsterous Climbs - 07\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> If you want a horrible day out on the bike, the Conwy Valley is for you.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Warren / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Length:</strong> 691m</li>\n<li><strong>Height gain:</strong> 156m</li>\n<li><strong>Average gradient:</strong> 22 per cent</li>\n<li><strong>Maximum gradient:</strong> 34.5 per cent</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Conwy Valley is home to a plethora of vicious roads, from the climb up to the Rowan Youth Hostel, to the evil Melin-y-Coed and the one and only Cowlyd.</p>\n<p>Putting them all in the shade, however, is Afon Ddu. Brought to our attention by local <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/how-to-become-a-hill-climbing-star/\">hill-climbing ace </a>Dan Evans, you can ride the road that it sprouts off many times before realising it’s even there.</p>\n<p>At the base, it just looks like a driveway, an old concrete service road with no indication of the horrors lurking further up. Right from the get-go, the slope is extreme as it ramps from bend to bend.</p>\n<p>Under your wheels, the concrete surface is rough and ridged, which somewhat impedes the progress of your front wheel, yet aids the traction of your rear.</p>\n<p>The 20-25 per cent ramps are punctuated by corners and the odd momentary easing of hostilities, where you can take a breather. Climbing higher through the dense trees at the end of the daunting middle stretch, there is a plateau on the last bend that allows you to glance upwards at the finale.</p>\n<p>At this point, religious riders will cross their chests and look to the heavens for divine intervention, as the road moves through the gears to nearly 35 per cent. It takes every ounce of effort, every sinew of muscle to beat this gradient into submission.</p>\n<p>Make it through and you will have conquered the forces of nature and defied the limits of what should be humanly possible.</p>","author":"Simon Warren","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"42201256d9ba03c798a17c2fcc5e18d9aeaee1c472f8ec1c8e9e7341a79693a1","category":"Cycling"}
