Meanwhile, the insurance behemoth reaps a \"financial windfall.\"</p>\n<p>The lawsuit, filed in the US District Court in western Kentucky, is led by two people who had a Humana Medicare Advantage Plan policy and said they were wrongfully denied needed and covered care, harming their health and finances. The suit seeks class-action status for an unknown number of other beneficiaries nationwide who may be in similar situations. Humana provides Medicare Advantage plans <a href=\"https://www.humana.com/about/impact/individual\">for 5.1 million people in the US</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1990918#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1990918&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4368e6d5125491740dee06ee92a47ba108ffab8c25081b8d72e80ad04ce856f8","category":"Tech"}
