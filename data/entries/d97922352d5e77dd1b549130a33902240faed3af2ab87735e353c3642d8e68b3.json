With the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a> launch, available models sold out quickly and Apple has been unable to keep up with demand, and the same goes for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 7</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nGoing forward, Cook said that he expects \"solid year-over-year revenue growth\" in the December quarter, but Apple will to continue facing supply problems. COVID related manufacturing problems have \"improved greatly,\" but Cook says that chip shortages \"linger on.\" According to Cook, older chips are the ones that are in short supply rather than newer A and M-series chips used in newer Apple devices. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nCook said that Apple primarily buys leading-edge nodes and is not having issues with those, but on legacy codes, there is competition from many different companies on supply. He said that he isn't sure when supply will improve as it is difficult to forecast when things will balance. Apple's operational team is working to cut down on cycle ties and improve yields to remedy the situation.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nDuring the quarterly earnings call, Apple CFO Luca Maestri confirmed that the impact of supply constraints will be greater in the December quarter. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> sales will drop year over year due to the supply constraints, but Apple expects revenue in all other categories will grow. <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/earnings/\">earnings</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/aapl/\">AAPL</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/28/apple-supply-constraints-6-billion-q4-2021/\">Supply Constraints Cost Apple $6 Billion in Q4 2021</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/supply-constraints-cost-apple-6-billion-in-q4-2021.2320351/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=rFuHK3mhXpg:RxOVUN0mVyw:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=rFuHK3mhXpg:RxOVUN0mVyw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/rFuHK3mhXpg\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d97922352d5e77dd1b549130a33902240faed3af2ab87735e353c3642d8e68b3","category":"Apple"}
