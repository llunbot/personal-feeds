Depending on where you live, riding in fall, winter, and spring requires protecting your legs, glutes, and midsection from the elements and cooler temperatures to maintain comfort and enhance your enjoyment on the bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditionally, winter tights were simple garments, worn over a favorite pair of cycling shorts. Most used a thin, fleecy fabric that didn’t protect well against moisture or wind. Today, with the help of advanced fabrics, construction techniques, and built-in pads, modern bib tights manage the temperature and movement of the lower body in a way that makes shoulder season and winter riding predictable and more pleasant. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To find the perfect pair of bib tights, it’s important to think about the specific conditions you will face, so you don’t end up with too much, or too little protection. The very best tights are versatile, and create a sensation of wearing flexible armor that can adapt to any riding position, any intensity level, and any weather condition without missing a beat. Of course, there are loads of options on the market to suit varying needs, temperature ranges, weather conditions, and budgets, so finding the right model for you can be a challenge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help, we tested 15 of the best cycling bib tights on the market side by side. You’ll find our top picks listed below, followed by the best of the rest which are also great options worthy of consideration.

Evo Thermal Bib Tight</a> is it. Why are the MAAP Team Evo special and worth the lofty asking price of $355? Simply put, they fit better than any other model we’ve tried and allow you to ride more efficiently and comfortably, all while looking pretty classy and refined. These tights will make you look forward to riding on cold days, they’re that good. If you’ve already got a handful of winter tights, you might find yourself giving them away because you just can’t pick them over the Team Evo when you get ready to ride. </p><p></p><p>The Team Evo uses a thermal fabric with a soft fleece interior that holds gently to just the right amount of body heat and also features an external water-resistant treatment to block light rain and road spray. Although the MAAP Team Evo are not as water-repellant as tights that use a water-resistant material on the front, they still work effectively to repel light rain and are simply more comfortable and flexible than models that use those types of fabrics. And, despite the “thermal” fabric, they’re breathable enough to work well into the lower 60s, so they can take the place of some mid-weight options as well, depending on the intensity level of your riding. </p><p></p><p>The 3D Thermo Molded triple-density chamois is not only supremely stable and comfortable but is positioned perfectly, and avoids the forward slippage that affects many other tights. This pad also transitions seamlessly into the rest of the Team Evo tight and is able to conform perfectly to the body and pedaling movements at all times. The straps lie perfectly flat and offer a nice balance of stretch and grab and the mesh back panel is designed for maximum breathability. The ankle cuffs are stretchy and thin, which works really well when wearing tights over socks, and we found the length of the legs to be perfect, with the cuffs grabbing just above the ankle joint, and with sufficient length above the knee to allow for a full range of motion with zero pulling or grabbing anywhere.</p><p></p><p>All the seams on the MAAP Team Evo are flatlocked, which means they don’t chafe. The paneling is also arranged to avoid seams coming into contact with areas around the knee that are vulnerable to irritation. Simply, put, the Team Evo has a second-skin fit that doesn’t restrict or distract in any way from enjoying your ride. </p><p></p><p>Another reason to love the MAAP Team Evo tight is that it’s manufactured to Bluesign-approved materials and manufacturing standards, so you can wear these tights knowing you’re not exposing yourself to any harmful substances. The Team Evo tights are also available in a whopping seven subdued colors inspired by the colors you’ll see in winter. The Bronze Green pair I tested exudes a classy confidence, and the Uniform Blue is another eye-catching option. </p><p></p><p>If you want one pair of tights that can carry you through all that winter has in store, in supreme comfort and elegance, the <a href=\"https://maap.cc/us/products/team-evo-thermal-bib-tight-olive-drab\">MAAP Team Evo Thermal Bib Tights</a> must be on your shortlist.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://maap.cc/us/products/team-evo-thermal-bib-tight-olive-drab\">Check Price at MAAP</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MAAP-Team-Evo-Thermal-Bib-Tight-1-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MAAP-Team-Evo-Thermal-Bib-Tight-1-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"MAAP Team Evo Thermal Bib Tight cycling action shot\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MAAP-Team-Evo-Thermal-Bib-Tight-1-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MAAP-Team-Evo-Thermal-Bib-Tight-1-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MAAP-Team-Evo-Thermal-Bib-Tight-1-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MAAP-Team-Evo-Thermal-Bib-Tight-1-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MAAP-Team-Evo-Thermal-Bib-Tight-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MAAP-Team-Evo-Thermal-Bib-Tight-1-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MAAP-Team-Evo-Thermal-Bib-Tight-1-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MAAP-Team-Evo-Thermal-Bib-Tight-1-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>MAAP’s Team Evo Thermal Bib Tights are not cheap, but they are our top choice for riding in cool and cold weather.

Factoring in the price of just $130 makes these an easy pick for riders on a budget or anyone who appreciates a good value. The fleece-lined material is easy to put on and remove, and regulates heat perfectly, by trapping warm air while simultaneously pulling away sweat vapor. This makes the C3 Thermo Bib Tights+ a versatile option for rides ranging anywhere from the high 30s up to the high 50s F. </p><p></p><p>The paneling of the supple Thermo-stretch functional fabric creates a seamless area around the knee, preventing irritation and lending a natural comfort to the C3 Thermo Bib Tights+. This fabric also ensures a complete range of motion throughout the pedal stroke, while allowing the pad to stay perfectly in place at all times, never riding forward. </p><p></p><p>The Gorewear <em>Active Comfort</em> seat pad insert is the entry-level insert in the Gore range and was chosen to help keep the price of the C3 Thermo affordable. Nonetheless, it is nicely sized, without excess bulk. The <em>Active Comfort</em> pad has a nice seamless feel where it transitions to the leg panels of the C3 Thermo. The density is on the soft side but still very comfortable and flexible while allowing it to remain comfortable up into the high 50s F. In front of the pad is the <em>GOREWEAR Cup</em> which is an anatomically pre-shaped insert in the front that protects from wind chill and is very breathable, according to Gore. While this might sound like a gimmick, it works effectively to keep the wind chill from reaching your sensitive bits. Additionally, Gore has positioned a wind and spray protection panel that extends along the groin and lower back, protecting this vulnerable area from road spray and harsh winter winds. </p><p></p><p>The straps are a standout feature of the C3 Thermo. They lie perfectly flat, offer excellent stretch and hold, and are joined together in the back by a super breathable mesh panel. The strap and back panel are a big reason why these can be used in warmer temps as they allow some heat and moisture to escape. </p><p></p><p>If you want a versatile, comfortable, and affordable pair of winter tights with some nice added features like the Gorewear Cup and a luxurious strap system, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=22233&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingbibtights&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gorewear.com%2Fus%2Fen-us%2Fc3-thermo-bib-tights-100648\">C3 Thermo Bib Tights+ </a>are worth a close look.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=22233&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingbibtights&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gorewear.com%2Fus%2Fen-us%2Fc3-thermo-bib-tights-100648\">Check Price at Gorewear</a><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingbibtights&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fgorewear-c3-thermo-bib-tights-mens\">Check Price at Competitive Cyclist</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Gorewear-C3-Thermo-Tights.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1365\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Gorewear-C3-Thermo-Tights.jpeg\" alt=\"Wearing the Gorewear C3 Thermo Bib Tights+\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Gorewear-C3-Thermo-Tights.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Gorewear-C3-Thermo-Tights-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Gorewear-C3-Thermo-Tights-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Gorewear-C3-Thermo-Tights-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Gorewear-C3-Thermo-Tights-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Gorewear-C3-Thermo-Tights-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Gorewear-C3-Thermo-Tights-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The Gorewear C3 Thermo Bib Tights+ don’t cost an arm and a leg while performing well and providing a high level of comfort on the bike.

Constructed of Ultra-high gauge compression lycra that Velocio calls “Luxe”, this bib tight has a second-skin fit that makes riding in cooler temperatures an absolute joy. </p><p></p><p>The Luxe bib tight is essentially Velocio’s fantastic Luxe bib short, extended down to the ankle. The Luxe fabric has an exceptional ability to regulate temperature. Even during 80°+ summer riding, the Luxe fabric never felt too warm, so we found it amazing that a pair of tights also made from this material could work well down into the upper 30s. </p><p></p><p>The paneling and articulation of the Luxe fabric allow Velocio to construct the Luxe bib tight with minimal seams. This eliminates chafing, which can be an issue for many tights, especially around the back of the knee. In this area, the Luxe bib tights feature a small panel that surrounds the back of the knee with perfectly positioned, seam-free compression. </p><p></p><p>The Luxe Bib Tight straps are exceptionally comfortable, laying perfectly flat and stretching enough to easily accommodate any riding position. Crossing in back to form an X means that the straps boost the lateral stability of the pad, keeping it stable and snug against the body at all times. The proprietary “Signature” chamois, developed in partnership with Cytech, is dense and supple, providing excellent breathability and never producing friction anywhere. The edges of the chamois transition seamlessly into the seat of the tights, which allows the chamois to flex and conform perfectly to your shape. Moving into different riding postures, or hopping on and off the saddle never caused the chamois to change position. </p><p></p><p>Branding on the Luxe Bib Tight is minimal, which gives it a classy look, and means it can pair well with tops from different brands. In addition to black, the Luxe Bib Tight is also available in brown and navy blue if you want something a bit different. </p><p></p><p>Versatility is key in a garment that costs $300, which is why I genuinely believe the Luxe isn’t overpriced, although it is expensive. It is breathable, stretchy, and lightweight enough to take the place of legwarmers in spring and fall. It’s also able to retain the heat generated from pedaling and create a warm barrier against cold and windy conditions in the dead of winter. In rainy conditions, the Luxe fabric repels moisture admirably and also dries very quickly if becomes wet. </p><p></p><p>If you can only have one pair of bib tights, the Luxe is an excellent choice. Other bib tights might outperform it marginally in specific situations like extreme cold or heavy rain, but none of those competitors are as versatile or comfortable across such a wide spectrum of conditions as the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=17985&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingbibtights&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvelocio.cc%2Fcollections%2Fmens-bibs-shorts-tights%2Fproducts%2Fmens-luxe-bib-tight\">Velocio  Luxe Bib Tights</a>.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=17985&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingbibtights&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvelocio.cc%2Fcollections%2Fmens-bibs-shorts-tights%2Fproducts%2Fmens-luxe-bib-tight\">Check Price at Velocio</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Velocio-Luxe-Bib-Tight-1-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Velocio-Luxe-Bib-Tight-1-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Velocio Luxe Bib Tight in use\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Velocio-Luxe-Bib-Tight-1-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Velocio-Luxe-Bib-Tight-1-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Velocio-Luxe-Bib-Tight-1-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Velocio-Luxe-Bib-Tight-1-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Velocio-Luxe-Bib-Tight-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Velocio-Luxe-Bib-Tight-1-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Velocio-Luxe-Bib-Tight-1-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Velocio-Luxe-Bib-Tight-1-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The Velocio Luxe Bib Tights have a streamlined design with minimal branding and excellent paneling and articulation.

Essentially, these are just summer bib shorts that continue down to the ankle. That sounds odd, but might make a lot of sense, depending on the climate and the intensity of your riding. If you ride in moderate temps at relatively high intensity, the Pro Team Lightweight Tights make the mid-50s feel like riding in the high 70s in shorts. There is zero bulk around the knee and hips, both areas that can feel constricted in thicker tights, especially at high intensity. </p><p></p><p>The Pro Team Lightweight Tights feature the size-specific Pro Team Training pad, which is dense and supportive, and an excellent product in and of itself. The transition from the pad’s edges to the lycra shell does not feel perfectly seamless, however, which is a very small nitpick of an otherwise perfect family of bibs. The pad had an occasional tendency to detach ever-so-slightly from my inner thighs when I would hop off the saddle. It’s something that I hope Rapha figures out in the future, because some other brands have, and those pads stay perfectly bonded to my body 100% of the ride. </p><p></p><p>The overall fit is snug without any pinching, rippling, or bunching. While some Pro Team items have a very specific body type in mind for the fit, the Lightweight Tights have such a nice amount of stretch, that they should work for a wide range of body types. There are no zippers on these or any other Rapha tights, and we think that’s a smart move. Zippers can fail and tend to irritate the skin and also affect fit around the lower calf. The lycra ankle opening of the Pro Team Lightweight is soft and flexible, making getting in and out a breeze. The same goes for the straps, which are well-executed and nearly identical to those on the Pro Team bib shorts. </p><p></p><p>We do wish there were a few more reflective accents where motorists can see them. The two large reflective Rapha logos on each thigh feel like branding more than anything that enhances visibility. That said, riding in low-light conditions requires a bright tail light and there are other opportunities to add visibility to a kit. </p><p></p><p>So, if you find leg warmers to be awkward or never seem to remove them, and you want a light, stretchy pair of tights with an excellent pad, check out the <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=18518&amp;awinaffid=723761&amp;campaign=&amp;clickref=brbgapparelcyclingbibtights&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rapha.cc%2Fus%2Fen_US%2Fshop%2Fmens-pro-team-lightweight-tights-with-pad%2Fproduct%2FAGT01XXDNW&amp;platform=pl\">Rapha Pro Team Lightweight Tight</a>.

With Gore-Tex Infinium fabric covering most of the front side of the legs, we’ve been able to ride through the worst of the worst winter can throw at us, without ever worrying about our joints or even feeling the conditions. The Polare 3 is warm enough to promote better circulation in the lower body, which has knock-on effects for the feet, which we noticed also stayed warmer. </p><p></p><p>Of course, the Polare 3 isn’t as versatile as other tights we tested and needs to be utilized in the right conditions and at the right intensity in order to shine. Ideally, the conditions would be absolutely frigid, near or even below freezing, and the intensity level would be low to moderate when using the Polare 3. The Gore-Tex Infinium is admirably flexible, and the fleece-lined interior does well to pull away sweat. However, the Polare 3 will feel clammy and cumbersome if the temperature rises significantly above 42 degrees F or the intensity level rises. So, we found ourselves using this bib tight on days when the risk of ice made riding high into the hills a bit risky and we just wanted to get out of the house and spin the legs. </p><p></p><p>The pad is Castelli’s Kiss Air 2 and while serviceable and comfortable, does leave a bit to be desired in terms of stability and moisture management, compared to Castelli’s range-topping Progetto X2, which is featured on other bib tights of similar cost. In fairness, pad comfort isn’t going to be the primary concern when riding in deep winter’s most frigid conditions. </p><p></p><p>Straps are a traditional mesh design that works well, and like the pad insert, wasn’t super important in rating the Polare 3, as riding in the appropriate conditions means that we always had on a burly base layer that isolated us from the straps. They certainly have plenty of stretch to be comfortable when standing and did the basic job of holding everything in place nicely. </p><p></p><p>The ankles are zippered, which is one potential question mark for the long-term durability of the Polare 3 bib tight. Zippers do make sliding in and out of the Polare 3 much easier, however, since the Gore-Tex Infinium lacks the stretch required to easily pull on and off. </p><p></p><p>If you like facing harsh winter conditions head-on and have other options for higher intensity or mild conditions, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingbibtights&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fcastelli-polare-2-bib-tight\">Castelli Polare 3</a> has you covered when the temperature drops and you’ve still got to ride.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingbibtights&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fcastelli-polare-2-bib-tight\">Check Price at Competitive Cyclist</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tBest Cargo Bib Tights\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=23377&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingbibtights&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ornotbike.com%2Fcollections%2Fmens-bibs-and-tights%2Fproducts%2Fthermal-cargo-bib-tight-burgundy%3Fvariant%3D39459112386625\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOrnot Thermal Cargo Bib Tight\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$208</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>300g (size M)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Claimed Temperature Range</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>38° to 60° F, 3° to 15° C</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Pad</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Oeko-Tex certified endurance pad made with recycled fibers</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Materials</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Bluesign-approved 83% Recycled Polyamide, 17% Recycled Elastane</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Available Sizes</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ornot-Thermal-Cargo-Bib.jpeg\">\n<img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2007\" height=\"1338\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ornot-Thermal-Cargo-Bib.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Cycling Bib Tights of 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ornot-Thermal-Cargo-Bib.jpeg 2007w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ornot-Thermal-Cargo-Bib-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ornot-Thermal-Cargo-Bib-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ornot-Thermal-Cargo-Bib-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ornot-Thermal-Cargo-Bib-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ornot-Thermal-Cargo-Bib-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ornot-Thermal-Cargo-Bib-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Four useful pockets</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Slightly less compressive fit</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Environmentally and socially responsible production</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>None</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>Ornot started with the phrase, “You could be a rolling billboard, Ornot,” and since then the concept of minimally-branded cycling apparel has resonated with countless cyclists, helping Ornot grow a large following. Beneath the surface, the performance and durability of Ornot apparel have always impressed us, and that continued with our test of the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=23377&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingbibtights&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ornotbike.com%2Fcollections%2Fmens-bibs-and-tights%2Fproducts%2Fthermal-cargo-bib-tight-burgundy%3Fvariant%3D39459112386625\">Thermal Cargo Bib Tight</a>.</p><p></p><p>The weather in San Francisco, where the Thermal Carbo Bib Tight is designed, is notoriously variable and compartmentalized. You could go from a foggy drizzle and 48 F to full sun and 60 F within 10 minutes, making it tough to stay comfortable at all times. So, it’s no surprise that The Thermal Cargo Bib Tight is a versatile bib tight that we found to be effective in temperatures ranging from the high 30s to the low 60s. </p><p></p><p>The fit of the Thermal Cargo Bib Tight fit is certainly snug, but compared to other tights we tested, it’s not the most compressive. That said, it easily accommodates the individual shaping of the knee area as it flexes and extends throughout the pedal stroke and we found it helped excess heat escape more easily when things warmed up and also made getting in and out of them easy. </p><p></p><p>The pad insert is made of Oeko-Tex-certified recycled fibers and provides a nice balance of support and flexibility. It’s an endurance-oriented pad that is dense and cushy, ready for big miles and the roughest surfaces. At the same time, the transition from the pad to the legs of the tights is smooth and the pad stays in able to flex as needed with each pedal stroke. The straps are soft and stretchy but strong enough to keep everything, including the contents of the rear pockets stable and in the right place. The straps terminate relatively high on the back, at the top of a fleece-lined panel that not only provides additional insulation to the lower spine but also pads it from objects stored in the rear pockets. </p><p></p><p>The pockets – four in total – are easy to access and balance flexibility with durability so you can focus on riding while you insert and remove items. The low-back pockets are a great touch. These allowed us to keep seldom-needed items (keys, wallet) stowed away neatly and freed up the two leg pockets for things like snacks, a phone, and gloves. </p><p></p><p>Small reflective tabs are sewn into the seam along the calf and are positioned high enough to never be concealed by shoe covers. The Mesa color that we tested received a lot of compliments on the road and certainly stood out against the ubiquitous black palette of most winter kit as it not only adds personal style but can also help motorists more quickly realize what they are approaching. </p><p></p><p>Ornot apparel is designed and manufactured in California, and the Thermal Cargo Bib Tight features Bluesign®-approved fabric, meaning that they are produced in an environmentally and socially responsible way.

This fabric zoning creates a nice feeling of support and weather protection around the thighs and hips from the heavier Nano Flex 3G, contrasted with a feeling of seamless freedom around the quad and calf muscles and ankles along with splash protection thanks to the Nano Flex Stretch. </p><p></p><p>The pad is Castelli’s top-shelf offering, the Progetto X2 Air Seamless. It’s a perfect mix of dense support and supple flex, and in our opinion is a must if you choose a pair of Castelli bibs for any season. The straps use minimal material to generate a secure hold that is noticeably more comfortable in the riding position than standing upright. These weren’t our favorite straps to get in and out of, but once they are positioned over a base layer, they are quickly forgotten. They also feature a rear pocket at the bottom of the straps to add a little storage if needed.</p><p></p><p>The feeling of two very different fabrics took some getting used to, but after a few rides, the design began to feel more natural and make sense. The feeling of easy mobility around the knee, shin, and ankle is something that no other bib tight could match, whilst also providing the level of overall protection as the Free Aero RC. </p><p></p><p>On the back side, Castelli has opted for a stitched rubber medallion featuring the scorpion logo, instead of the heat-transferred logos featured across the rest of the range. Two small reflective strips are heat transferred high on the back of the thigh. These add a little visibility, but we would’ve liked to see these not only larger but also stitched into the fabric. </p><p></p><p>If you want a versatile winter tight that offers support and weather protection around the upper thighs and glutes, but an amazing amount of mobility for the knees, shins, and ankles, and features a top-shelf pad insert, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingbibtights&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fcastelli-free-aero-rc-bib-tight-mens\">Castelli Free Aero RC</a> is worth a look.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingbibtights&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fcastelli-free-aero-rc-bib-tight-mens\">Check Price at Competitive Cyclist</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09Z22SGTN/brbgapparelcyclingbibtights-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Castelli-Free-Aero-RC-Bibtight-1-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Castelli-Free-Aero-RC-Bibtight-1-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Riding in the Castelli Free Aero RC Bibtight on a cool and wet day\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Castelli-Free-Aero-RC-Bibtight-1-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Castelli-Free-Aero-RC-Bibtight-1-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Castelli-Free-Aero-RC-Bibtight-1-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Castelli-Free-Aero-RC-Bibtight-1-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Castelli-Free-Aero-RC-Bibtight-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Castelli-Free-Aero-RC-Bibtight-1-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Castelli-Free-Aero-RC-Bibtight-1-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Castelli-Free-Aero-RC-Bibtight-1-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Castelli’s Free Aero RC Bibtight combines a stellar chamois pad with strategic weather protection for riding in wet and cold conditions.

Designed in Scotland, where wind and rain seem to be everpresent, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FPKD9KN/brbgapparelcyclingbibtights-20\">FS260-Pro Thermal Bib Tight II</a> continues this trend by keeping cold and moisture out, while achieving excellent comfort at just $180 US. </p><p></p><p>Although not quite a Scottish climate, the Pacific Northwest of the US gets plenty of rain, so we had plenty of chances to ride in the FS260-Pro Thermal II in wet conditions. We came away impressed with the water-repellent and PFC-free (Poly-fluorinated chemical) DWR treatment, which helps water bead up on the surface until it dries or gets blown away. </p><p></p><p>We also appreciate how high the FS260-Pro Thermal II extends into the midsection, helping keep hips and abdominal muscles warm and relaxed. A zipper also helps keep this extra coverage from requiring any extra work to get into the FS-260 Pro Thermal when you need to relieve yourself. Endura also chose to add zippers at the ankles, making the FS260-Pro Thermal II one of the easiest pairs of tights to slide on and off. </p><p></p><p>The FS260-Pro Thermal II features Endura’s 600 series pad which features gel inserts and a luxurious, dimpled surface, as well as a “Continuously Variable Profile” which Endura says enhances its ability to stretch. We found it up to the task of keeping us comfortable, motivated, and happy on long rides in nasty conditions. We found the straps to be a bit loose, due to how high they are positioned, atop the extended abdominal paneling in front, yet it never felt like they weren’t doing the job of holding the pad and tights securely in place. </p><p></p><p>Large reflective elements are placed high up on the back of the calf, which is smart, as they won’t be covered up by shoe covers. Silicone Endura logos grace the side of the thighs. Only time will tell if these thin, raised letters will hold up to harsh conditions on the road and in the laundry room.</p><p></p><p>If riding in wet conditions is part of your routine, and you want a bib tight that competes with tights at higher price points, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FPKD9KN/brbgapparelcyclingbibtights-20\">Endura FS260-Pro Thermal II</a> is a model that is definitely worth trying.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FPKD9KN/brbgapparelcyclingbibtights-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tWarmth without the Bulk\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10270&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingbibtights&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.evo.com%2Fpants%2Fpoc-thermal-vpds-bib-tights%23image%3D209764%2F853826%2Fpoc-thermal-vpds-bib-tights-.jpg\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPOC Thermal VPDS Bib Tights\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$200</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>290g (size M)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Claimed Temperature Range</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>41° to 59° F, 5° to 15° C</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Pad</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>VPDS (visco-elastic polymer dough)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Materials</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\"Windproof and water-resistant material\"</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Available Sizes</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/POV-Thermal-VPDS-Bib-Tights.jpeg\">\n<img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1621\" height=\"1081\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/POV-Thermal-VPDS-Bib-Tights.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Cycling Bib Tights of 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/POV-Thermal-VPDS-Bib-Tights.jpeg 1621w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/POV-Thermal-VPDS-Bib-Tights-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/POV-Thermal-VPDS-Bib-Tights-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/POV-Thermal-VPDS-Bib-Tights-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/POV-Thermal-VPDS-Bib-Tights-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/POV-Thermal-VPDS-Bib-Tights-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/POV-Thermal-VPDS-Bib-Tights-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Excellent pad</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Great Fit</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Warmth without excessive weight</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Heat-bonded logos could peel</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10270&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingbibtights&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.evo.com%2Fpants%2Fpoc-thermal-vpds-bib-tights%23image%3D209764%2F853826%2Fpoc-thermal-vpds-bib-tights-.jpg\">POC Thermal VPDS</a> tight takes a different approach to warmth versus many of the other options we tested. Instead of a fleecy interior, POC chose to use thin and light windproof material that offers a high level of protection despite being lightweight and stretchy. So, while plenty warm, the soft and luxurious feel that we typically associate with the term “thermal” doesn’t apply to these tights, despite their name.</p><p></p><p>The ‘VPDS’ acronym stands for “visco-elastic polymer dough”, which can be found inside the pad insert. The pad is one of the best we tested, combining a minimal thickness of only 2mm, with excellent cushioning and support. This pad was definitely the standout feature of the Thermal VPDS tights. </p><p></p><p>The waist of the Thermal VPDS tight is cut high, which helps keep the core and lower back muscles protected and more able to relax. Overall, the fit is very tidy, and although there are plenty of seams, they are intelligently placed to avoid irritation and bunching. Since the Thermal VPDS are not fleece-lined, they transition well into more mild temps, as high as the upper 50s. Breathability is excellent, and the svelte VPDS pad pulls away any moisture before it becomes an issue. </p><p></p><p>A large POC logo on the rear lower leg adds visibility, although it is heat-bonded which means it could be susceptible to cracking and peeling over time. At the ankle, a tall, stretchy cuff keeps the fit of the Thermal VPDS tight, smooth, and snug around the calf. </p><p></p><p>If you’re looking for a windproof and warm tight that doesn’t have the bulk that often comes from a thermal “Roubaix” style fabric, and also features an excellent pad, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10270&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingbibtights&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.evo.com%2Fpants%2Fpoc-thermal-vpds-bib-tights%23image%3D209764%2F853826%2Fpoc-thermal-vpds-bib-tights-.jpg\">POC Thermal VPDS</a> could be right for you.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10270&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingbibtights&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.evo.com%2Fpants%2Fpoc-thermal-vpds-bib-tights%23image%3D209764%2F853826%2Fpoc-thermal-vpds-bib-tights-.jpg\">Check Price at EVO</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HN8LYSH/brbgapparelcyclingbibtights-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tAnother Great Value\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingbibtights&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fcastelli-entrata-bib-tight-mens\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCastelli Entrata Bibtight\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$130</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>311g (size M)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Claimed Temperature Range</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>43° to 57° F, 6° to 14° C</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Pad</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Castelli Kiss Air 2</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Materials</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>86% Polyamide, 14% Elastane</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Available Sizes</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL, XXXL</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Castelli-Entrata-Bibtight.jpeg\">\n<img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2109\" height=\"1406\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Castelli-Entrata-Bibtight.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Cycling Bib Tights of 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Castelli-Entrata-Bibtight.jpeg 2109w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Castelli-Entrata-Bibtight-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Castelli-Entrata-Bibtight-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Castelli-Entrata-Bibtight-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Castelli-Entrata-Bibtight-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Castelli-Entrata-Bibtight-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Castelli-Entrata-Bibtight-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Castelli-Entrata-Bibtight-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Excellent value</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Great fit</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Heat-bonded logos will eventually crack or peel</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Not great for wet conditions</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>The term “entry-level” can be a bit misleading with some brands, Castelli certainly being one of them. Castelli’s Entrata line, as the name suggests, is the entry point into a family of highly technical cycling kit from the Italian brand that’s been supplying Tour De France-winning apparel to teams for decades now. With the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingbibtights&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fcastelli-entrata-bib-tight-mens\">Entrata Bibtight</a>, we came away impressed with how much performance Castelli was able to pack into such an affordable offering.</p><p></p><p>Starting with the pad insert, Castelli was able to save some cost here by opting to place the Kiss Air2 model. While not quite as heavenly as the top-tier Progetto X2 pad, the Kiss Air2 is still among the best pads available from any brand. This pad has a buttery-soft and subtly dimpled surface, and balances moderate density with excellent flexibility, taking the sting out of even the roughest roads. After testing this pad in so many pairs of bibs from Castelli, we’ve determined that really the only thing the Kiss Air2 gives up to the Progetto X2 is a marginal amount of breathability. In the context of tights designed for winter riding, this is much less of a concern because the temperatures are so much cooler. </p><p></p><p>The Entrata Bibtight is comprised of Thermoflex fabric, which is warm and stretchy, but does not have the same level of water repellency as Nano Flex fabric that Castelli uses on some of its higher-end options. So, when riding in the rain or in a group where few or none of the riders are using fenders, the Entrata can get a bit soaked and feel a tad heavy. That said, Thermoflex is burly enough to keep the legs warm even if a little moisture gets in. </p><p></p><p>Riding in cold and dry conditions was a joy with the Entrata Bibtight. The Thermoflex fabric has a natural, even stretchiness and the fleece backing was able to trap just the right amount of heat next to the skin across a wide range of temperatures from 35 to 60 degrees. </p><p></p><p>The legs are paneled with all seams positioned to avoid irritation and allow for maximum range of motion throughout the pedal stroke. The ankles have a couple of nice touches that help set the Entrata apart from other bib tights at this price point. First, the zippers help getting in and out much easier, and it is covered by a reflective strip that is sewn into the seam that runs up the back of the calf area. So, you get visibility without having to worry about it cracking or peeling over time, and the zipper is hidden, for a clean look. </p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingbibtights&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fcastelli-entrata-bib-tight-mens\">Castelli Entrata Bibtight</a> might be an affordable option, but it doesn’t give up much performance to its more expensive counterparts in the right conditions.

Each leg features one vertical seam running up the back, and another small seam extending just halfway around the outside of the knee. This design is called “Louvre Tec” by Assos, and results in less material being used around the knee, preventing bunching at the top of the pedal stroke. Indeed the Mille GT C2 has a second-skin fit which has allowed us to ride in our natural position on the bike with no restriction of the pedal stroke. </p><p></p><p>We felt a sensation of being wrapped into this bib tight, versus having the bib tight stretched over us. This wrapping sensation is exactly what Assos was after when they chose the <em>RX Evo Plus</em> fabric for the Mille GT C2 Bib Tight. According to Assos, this fabric features asymmetrical stretch, which is what allows it to be shaped to wrap the rider’s leg so nicely. Other nice benefits of the RX Evo Plus fabric are resistance to both abrasion and blanching, which means the black hue of the Mille GT C2 will remain deep and lustrous throughout its service life. This fabric is also supremely versatile, trapping heat close to the skin precisely until sweat vapor begins to develop, at which point the Mille GT C2 is evacuated of any excess heat and any associated moisture. </p><p></p><p>The Mille GT C2 pad insert is made up of compressive foam layers that combine to form an 11mm-thick endurance-ready platform. Thermoformed shaping of the pad reduces ridges and irritation, for a buttery smooth feeling that persists throughout long winter rides. The “<em>GoldenGate”</em> stitching pattern anchors the front and back but lets the insert’s body float, allowing the pad to move with your body. This design eliminates the most common point of chafing with pads from other brands, where the groin transitions to the glute. </p><p></p><p>Around the waist, the Mille GT C2 features a soft, highly elastic material to improve comfort and hold, minus any pressure or pinching. Again, this sensation of being wrapped into the bib tights can be felt. The waistline is laser cut for a perfectly flat fit against the midsection, helping to prevent the base layer worn below from bunching or irritating the skin. The <em>“X-frame”</em> bib straps limit sag on the lower back panel of the Mille GT C2, stabilizing the insert and main body panel. The straps have plenty of stretch and strength, so they resist wandering along the shoulders and graciously accommodate any riding position.</p><p></p><p>The Mille GT is better equipped to handle cold and dry conditions than it is wet conditions. While we never had any complaints about riding in them in a light drizzle, we feel there are better options for dealing with the spray coming up from soaking wet roads. So, for the dry-weather cyclist who wants a luxurious and warm bib tight with a top-shelf pad insert, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingbibtights&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fassos-mille-gt-winter-tight-mens\">Assos Mille GT Winter Bib Tight C2</a> is a winning choice.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingbibtights&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fassos-mille-gt-winter-tight-mens\">Check Price at Competitive Cyclist</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingbibtights&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2F7mesh-industries-mk3-cargo-bib-tight-mens\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t7Mesh MK3 Cargo Bib Tight\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$250</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>309g (size M)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Claimed Temperature Range</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>not specified</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Pad</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Men's Performance Space Chamois</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>62% Nylon, 38% Elastane</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Available Sizes</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>XS, S, M, L, XL, XXL</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/7Mesh-MK3-Cargo-Bib-Tight.jpeg\">\n<img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2292\" height=\"1528\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/7Mesh-MK3-Cargo-Bib-Tight.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Cycling Bib Tights of 2023\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/7Mesh-MK3-Cargo-Bib-Tight.jpeg 2292w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/7Mesh-MK3-Cargo-Bib-Tight-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/7Mesh-MK3-Cargo-Bib-Tight-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/7Mesh-MK3-Cargo-Bib-Tight-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/7Mesh-MK3-Cargo-Bib-Tight-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/7Mesh-MK3-Cargo-Bib-Tight-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/7Mesh-MK3-Cargo-Bib-Tight-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/7Mesh-MK3-Cargo-Bib-Tight-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Sublime comfort</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Ample storage</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Not suitable for severe cold or wet</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Bennett Shane</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>We were impressed by the 7Mesh MK3 bib short over the summer and were excited to test its full-length counterpart, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingbibtights&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2F7mesh-industries-mk3-cargo-bib-tight-mens\">MK3 Cargo Bib Tight</a>. The MK3 cargo bib tight is essentially the bib short extended down to the ankle, and that’s a good thing for the type of fall, winter, and spring riding we do a lot of, which is to say, riding when the conditions are cool but relatively mild. The MK3 Bib Tight material is not insulated, so its usefulness skews toward fall and spring when temps typically don’t dip far below 50 degrees and can rise during mid-day rides well into the 60s. </p><p></p><p>A big part of the appeal of the MK3 Cargo Bib Tight is storage. 4 pockets in total – one per leg and two at the lower back – can hold more kit than most 3-pocket jerseys or jackets. So, for rides in mild conditions where efficient storage is an important objective, a pair of non-insulated cargo tights might make more sense than cargo bib shorts with thermal leg warmers that will eventually need to be removed and carried. </p><p></p><p>A custom Elastic Interface® Space chamois insert is carried over from the MK3 Bib Short and is one of the best pad inserts available. The pad is sewn into a layer of material that floats freely inside the skin of the tights. This means that the pad can stay perfectly in place as you change position on the saddle. The pad stands on its own as a great feature of the MK3 Bib Tights, balancing dense support with supple pliability to always give us the perfect seat from which to pedal happily for long hours. </p><p></p><p>The overall fit of the MK3 is excellent and truly shines when out riding, as 7Mesh has placed all the seams away from action points, avoiding the feeling of there being any extra material at all, let alone irritation or chafing.

The thermal fleece fabric’s ample stretch allows for fewer panels which in turn reduces the number of seams, giving the Expedition Thermal a natural, luxurious comfort. </p><p></p><p>The straps are wide and laser-cut, so they lie perfectly flat. Pearl Izumi also designed the straps to allow drop-tail nature breaks should that need arise. We never had to put this design to the test, but we’ve been in that situation on all-day epics before and it’s nice to know it’s there. </p><p></p><p>Pearl Izumi added full <em>PI Dry®</em> water-shedding technology to protect from road spray and drizzle. There are also three reflective bars bonded to the fabric on each leg, around the outer calf. The placement of these reflective panels should be effective in helping motorists identify cyclists as they approach. Only time will tell how durable these panels are. Many heat-bonded panels like this end up cracking and peeling, but it’s variable from brand to brand. </p><p></p><p>The dual-density <em>Levitate<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" /> Plus</em> chamois provides an excellent balance of dense support and supple pliability, while also wicking away sweat to keep the seating area dry and comfortable. Whenever we stood up to accelerate or shifted position on the saddle in the Expedition Thermal Cycling Bib Tight, the pad stayed perfectly situated beneath our sit bones. </p><p></p><p>The pockets use a slightly different design than most, made of a simple sleeve of lycra sewn into the seams. We would like to see a little bit more volume available, but there’s still plenty of space for a phone plus a few small snacks. These pockets are very quick and easy to access and hold items securely over even the bumpiest terrain. Unlike the other cargo bib tights we tested, the Expedition Thermal Cycling Bib Tight does not have additional pockets built into the low back. So, storage is reduced by 50% compared to some competitors. </p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=20053&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingbibtights&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pearlizumi.com%2Fproducts%2Fmens-expedition-thermal-cycling-bib-tights-11112221%3Fvariant%3D42834446352555\">Pearl Izumi Expedition Thermal Cycling Bib Tight</a> is an excellent choice for endurance rides in cold weather, assuming the minimal storage capacity meets your needs.

Comfort is top-notch throughout. The <em>Total Comfort</em> pad insert is a highlight, with a nice balance of dense support and supple pliability. </p><p></p><p>The straps feel a bit grabby at first, but once in the cycling position, they melt away and leave no feeling of bulk between a base layer and jacket. The main fabric is fleece-backed and supremely stretchy, trapping just the right amount of heat against the skin while maintaining a sense of freedom during the pedal stroke. </p><p></p><p>Zippered ankles make getting in and out easy, but probably are not necessary, considering the stretch in this fabric. It’s a subjective preference, but since bib tights are put on in the privacy of one’s home and stay on throughout the ride, zippered ankles seem like something that can fail and doesn’t always have a clear benefit. </p><p></p><p>Somewhat disappointing in this $240 pair of tights is the lack of any reflective elements visible to motorists approaching from the rear. While a tail light can serve to alert motorists, the more visual cues the better, and this feels like a missed opportunity. </p><p></p><p>Putting those two minor gripes aside, riding in the Bodyfit Pro was great. It’s easy to see why Sportful says this bib tight is the choice of so many professional riders on their sponsored teams. Cold windy mornings and damp, mild afternoons were no match for the Bodyfit Pro Bibtight. Keep in mind that there is no water-resistant treatment applied to the Bodyfit Pro Bibtight, so rides on soaked roads or in heavy rainfall could test the limits of its ability to protect and maintain comfort. </p><p></p><p>For long rides in dry to damp conditions spanning anywhere from high 30s to low 60s F, the <a href=\"https://www.sportful.com/US/en/Men/Cycling/Bibtights/BODYFIT-PRO-BIBTIGHT/p/1120503_002\">Sportful Bodyfit Pro Bibtight</a> is a winning pick.

Nano Flex 3G fabric makes up a large portion of the Sorpasso, and you might already be familiar with this material from Castelli’s popular Nano Flex warmers. Inside the Sorpasso is a lightweight fleece that helps retain enough body heat to insulate from wind and cold. The front-facing panels of the Sorpasso are coated in a proprietary water-repellent finish which features a chemical DWR (durable water-repellent) coating as well as “millions of ultra-tiny nanofilaments that cause water droplets to bead up on the surface of the garment and run off instead of pooling on the fabric and soaking through.”  </p><p></p><p>The DWR treatment is necessary because while Nano flex is indeed flexible, and vents well, the fabric itself doesn’t resist moisture intrusion very well. So, in the areas most vulnerable to road spray, like the lower back and torso, Castelli opted to build the Sorpasso Bibtight with Nano Flex Xtra Dry fabric instead. The Xtra Dry type of Nanoflex features a tighter knit on the outside and gets a more robust DWR treatment. </p><p></p><p>The sizing of the Sorpasso is in keeping with everything Castelli makes, meaning that it runs a bit small. The actual fit is nicely balanced to accommodate any body type. The only small issue I found related to fit was that the seams around the pelvis could be better reinforced, as I did notice some fabric puckering in this area. </p><p></p><p>The Sorpasso Bibtight features Castelli’s top-shelf pad, the Progetto X2 Air Seamless. It’s a dense but cushy pad that moves excess heat and moisture out effectively, so your seating area remains dry and comfortable in any weather or at any intensity level. The pad is integrated perfectly into the structure of the Sorpasso tights so that the transition is smooth and the pad remains stable while flexing with your pedal stroke. </p><p></p><p>Reflective accents on the back of the ankle/calf area are a nice touch. The way the reflective strips slant inward looks a bit odd, and if the reflective material were placed higher it would be more effective, as it wouldn’t be concealed by shoe covers, </p><p></p><p>The Sorpasso is a great option for long rides, simply because they are so comfortable. Seams are out of the way of the knee joint, the straps are forgotten after a few minutes of riding, and the pad is one of the best available. The combination of Nanoflex, Nanoflex Xtra Dry, and DWR coating enables the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingbibtights&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fcastelli-sorpasso-ros-bib-tight-mens\">Sorpasso RoS Bibtight</a> to transition easily through the spectrum of fall, winter, and spring weather without ever leaving you unprotected or feeling dragged down.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingbibtights&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fcastelli-sorpasso-ros-bib-tight-mens\">Check Price at Competitive Cyclist</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BVDC7GR/brbgapparelcyclingbibtights-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cycling Bib Tights Comparison Chart</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Bib Tight Model</th><th>MSRP</th><th>Weight</th><th>Claimed Temp.

Sure, we ride our bikes all summer, but we also keep riding as the seasons change and temperatures drop. Turns out, most of us would rather keep riding outside for as long as possible before setting up the trainer for the darkest and coldest days of the year. Because of this, we know that having the right gear is critical to keeping the wheels spinning through the fall, winter, and spring. We’ve also had the opportunity to test the latest and greatest cool weather and winter riding apparel, including the best bib tights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For our cycling bib tights review, we recruited frequent Bikerumor contributor, Bennett Shane, to test and compare 15 of the best models on the market. Bennett is an avid road cyclist who has been riding for over two decades. Based outside of Portland, OR, Bennett spends a large part of the year riding in cool to cold temperatures and on wet roads throughout the often soggy Pacific Northwest. This experience has taught him the importance of dressing appropriately for the conditions in order to maintain comfort while keeping up his fitness through the fall, winter, and spring, and he has become very fond of riding in bib tights when needed. Over the years, Bennett has also worked for several prominent brands in the cycling industry, and he has unique insight into the design and materials of apparel, accessories, and components. His experience both behind the scenes and as a road cyclist/consumer has helped him develop a keen ability to scrutinize the products he tests and tease out their often subtle performance differences. Bennett has also contributed his expertise and knowledge of road cycling to a number of our other buyer’s guides including the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-cycling-bib-shorts/\">best cycling bib shorts</a>, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-road-bike-helmets/\">protective road bike helmets</a>, and our <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-road-bike-shoes/\">favorite road bike shoes</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After researching the best cycling bib tight on the market in 2023, we rounded up 15 models for testing and comparison. Over the course of several months, each pair of bib tights was put through its paces during crisp morning, evening, and all-day rides. As the days got shorter, leaves began to fall, and moist autumn weather gripped the Pacific Northwest, Bennett had the perfect conditions for testing bib tights on the picturesque mountain and country roads not far from his home. While riding, important factors like fit, comfort, warmth, pad comfort, straps, and weather/wind protection were assessed to see how each model performs in the real world. Additionally, each model’s construction, materials, seams, and features like pockets, ankle zips, and reflective elements were taken into consideration. When testing wrapped up, we zeroed in on our favorites and those that excel for specific reasons compared to the rest. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-tights-BG-Action-Shot-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-tights-BG-Action-Shot-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Testing the best cycling bib tights\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-tights-BG-Action-Shot-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-tights-BG-Action-Shot-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-tights-BG-Action-Shot-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-tights-BG-Action-Shot-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-tights-BG-Action-Shot-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-tights-BG-Action-Shot-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-tights-BG-Action-Shot-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-tights-BG-Action-Shot-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Being well-equipped can extend your riding season through the fall, winter, and spring.

They are full-length, form-fitting tights with bib straps. As with any piece of cycling apparel, there are several considerations when choosing bib tights. Not only are there many brands to choose from, but they come in a wide range of materials, designs, intended uses, and price points to choose from. It is important to consider the temperatures and weather conditions you’re most likely to encounter while riding and match your choice accordingly. As always, getting bib tights that fit properly is key to long-term comfort. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-tights-temps-and-weather-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-tights-temps-and-weather-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Action shot riding on a wet road in the fall wearing the Ornot Thermal Cargo Bib Tights\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-tights-temps-and-weather-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-tights-temps-and-weather-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-tights-temps-and-weather-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-tights-temps-and-weather-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-tights-temps-and-weather-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-tights-temps-and-weather-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-tights-temps-and-weather-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-tights-temps-and-weather-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Getting bib tights to suit the environmental conditions including temperature, water, and wind, is important to consider when searching for the right model for you.

It stands to reason that riders who will only be going in cool, mild conditions don’t need as much insulation as those trying to ride in very cold temperatures at or near freezing. Likewise, those riding in wet or rainy conditions have different weather protection needs than those who only ride when it’s dry. Thankfully, manufacturers make bib tights to cover the spectrum of temperatures and weather conditions. Castelli is a great example, as they offer nine different bib tight options as well as three bib kickers and two regular, non-bib tights. So, when choosing bib tights, consider your need for warmth as well as water and wind protection. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Rapha-Pro-Team-Lightweight-action-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Rapha-Pro-Team-Lightweight-action-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Testing the Rapha Pro Team Lightweight Bib Tights\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Rapha-Pro-Team-Lightweight-action-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Rapha-Pro-Team-Lightweight-action-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Rapha-Pro-Team-Lightweight-action-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Rapha-Pro-Team-Lightweight-action-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Rapha-Pro-Team-Lightweight-action-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Rapha-Pro-Team-Lightweight-action-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Rapha-Pro-Team-Lightweight-action-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Rapha-Pro-Team-Lightweight-action-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Our needs for warmth vary depending on the temperatures and the riding intensity. Fortunately, there are great options to suit varying needs and preferences, from well-insulated models to lightweight options like the Rapha Pro Team Lightweight Bib Tights pictured here.

Fortunately, bib tights come in a variety of materials to suit varying temperatures, your personal warmth needs, and riding intensity levels. If you’re among the hardcore group of cyclists who ride in temperatures at, or sometimes even below freezing, then you’ll probably benefit from a pair of thermal bib tights that employ an insulating material in their construction. These insulating materials vary, but often they are thicker and fleece-backed to create a barrier from the cold and maintain warmth. While riding outdoors in sub-freezing temperatures is some people’s cup of tea, most of us are more likely to be riding in the fall, winter, and spring when temperatures are a bit milder in the 40° to 60° F range. Cool temperatures like these typically don’t require as much insulation, so some of the models with thinner fabrics may be more appropriate. The good thing is there are plenty of options, so you should be able to find a pair that suits your needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Often, but not always, brands list a suggested temperature range for their bib tights and other apparel, so it makes it easier to zero in on the model you need. The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingbibtights&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fcastelli-polare-2-bib-tight\">Castelli Polare 3 Bibtight</a> is the warmest option we tested, built with an insulating fleece-lined thermal fabric and Gore-Tex Infinium protecting the front of the legs. With a suggested temperature range of 23° to 41° F, these tights are stellar for cold and nasty conditions, but they are overkill for milder temps. On the opposite end of the spectrum, the <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=18518&amp;awinaffid=723761&amp;campaign=&amp;clickref=brbgapparelcyclingbibtights&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rapha.cc%2Fus%2Fen_US%2Fshop%2Fmens-pro-team-lightweight-tights-with-pad%2Fproduct%2FAGT01XXDNW&amp;platform=pl\">Rapha Pro Team Lightweight Bib Tight</a> is much thinner and suggested for temperatures between 43° and 64° F and better suited to mild conditions and/or high-intensity riding, but won’t provide the warmth needed for properly frigid temperatures. We find the highest degree of versatility to be offered by models that fall in the middle of the temperature range, as they work well for the conditions that <em>most</em> riders are going to encounter. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-Tights-Weather-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-Tights-Weather-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Riding in bib tights on a wet road\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-Tights-Weather-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-Tights-Weather-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-Tights-Weather-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-Tights-Weather-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-Tights-Weather-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-Tights-Weather-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-Tights-Weather-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-Tights-Weather-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Whether you’re riding in the rain or just on wet roads, many bib tights feature materials that repel moisture to help keep you warm, dry, and comfortable for longer. (photo: Ben Guernsey)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Weather</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Weather is also very important to consider, as some models provide more protection from rain and/or road spray with water-resistant or water-repellant materials. Often, these materials are placed strategically on the tights, typically on the front and/or the back where falling rain or road spray is most likely to hit you while some also include it on the lower legs to protect from front tire spray. There is a wide range of fully waterproof fabrics and membranes on the market, though their application in bib tights is tricky given the stretch needed for them to fit right and perform well. If you are purposefully riding in heavy rain, you’ll do best to invest in some dedicated rain pants.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, riding in a heavy downpour anytime, but especially in cool to cold weather is pretty miserable regardless, and most of us try to avoid it. It’s more likely that you’ll experience a drizzle, light rain shower, or spray from wet roads, so many models of bib tights have fabrics that are treated with a Durable Water Repellant (DWR) finish to fend off minor amounts of moisture. These finishes work relatively well to bead up and shed light amounts of water, but they do break down over time and repeated washings, though they can be replenished with certain treatments. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-Tights-Wind-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-Tights-Wind-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Riding fast downhill in bib tights\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-Tights-Wind-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-Tights-Wind-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-Tights-Wind-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-Tights-Wind-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-Tights-Wind-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-Tights-Wind-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-Tights-Wind-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-Tights-Wind-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>When riding in the cold, the wind always makes it feel colder.

Whether from the wind blowing or your own speed riding on the road, the windchill almost always makes it feel colder than it actually is. To combat the chilling effect of the wind, many bib tights feature wind-blocking materials in their constructions to help keep it at bay. Most of the time, these wind-blocking fabrics and membranes are strategically placed in panels on the front of the tights with more breathable panels on the back to allow self-generated heat and moisture to escape.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-Tights-Fit-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-Tights-Fit-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Riding up a hill in the MAAP Team Evo Thermal Bib Tights\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-Tights-Fit-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-Tights-Fit-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-Tights-Fit-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-Tights-Fit-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-Tights-Fit-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-Tights-Fit-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-Tights-Fit-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-Tights-Fit-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Bib tights that fit well should feel like a second skin and go virtually unnoticed while riding. The MAAP Team Evo Thermal Bib Tights are some of the best-fitting and most comfortable we have ever used. (photo: Ben Guernsey)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fit and Comfort</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond getting bib tights that are geared toward the temperatures and weather conditions you’ll be riding in, getting a pair that fits well is one of the most important things you can do to be comfortable on the bike. There are a number of factors that go into this, of course, including getting the right size for your body, the pad or chamois, and the bib straps. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Sizing</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>It sounds obvious, but getting the right size is incredibly important for your bib tights to fit right and be comfortable. Ideally, you want them to be snug throughout without any bagginess or excessive pressure. Well-fitting tights should feel like a second skin that moves freely with your body while providing support and stability for the pad. Tights that are too small may put unpleasant pressure on your abdomen or the straps may be tight and uncomfortable over the shoulders. Tights that are too large may allow the pad to move around because the shoulder straps are too long or they are simply loose fitting. A loose or baggy fit is not ideal as it may negate the thermal properties of the fabrics or cause irritation with the tights moving independently of your body. Thankfully, most brands have detailed size charts on their websites so you hopefully figure out which size is best based on your waist size, inseam length, etc. Often, it is as easy as getting the same size as the bib shorts you wear in the summer months, especially if you are buying the same brand. If you’re unsure, trying a pair on is generally a surefire way to ensure you get the best fit. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Chamois-pads-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Chamois-pads-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Comparison shot of two chamois pads from bib tights we tested\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Chamois-pads-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Chamois-pads-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Chamois-pads-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Chamois-pads-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Chamois-pads-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Chamois-pads-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Chamois-pads-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Chamois-pads-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Comparing two pads, Gore on the left and Castelli on the right, from the bib tights we tested. (photo: Bennett Shane)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>The Pad or Chamois</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The seat pad, or chamois, is a critical element of a pair of bib tights that is largely responsible for our seated comfort while pedaling. These pads vary in their construction, materials, and padding levels, but they all intend to provide a slight cushion between your body and the saddle. One of the main goals is for this pad to remain stable under your body and resist shifting so that it stays in place to do its job most effectively. Bib tights, and bib shorts, aim to keep the pad stable through the use of bib straps that maintain light tension on the lower portion of the tights and hold it in place. Thankfully, most brands make great pads these days and many of them employ the exact same pads used in their comparable bib shorts. If you already know of a pad that works well for you, you can probably find the same one in a pair of bib tights as well. Along with finding tights with a comfortable pad, the right <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-road-bike-saddle/\">road bike saddle</a> can also be instrumental in enhancing your seated comfort on the bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-straps-comparison-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-straps-comparison-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Comparison shot of different bib strap materials and constructions\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-straps-comparison-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-straps-comparison-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-straps-comparison-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-straps-comparison-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-straps-comparison-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-straps-comparison-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-straps-comparison-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-straps-comparison-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Bib straps come in different materials, constructions, and designs, but most perform the duty of holding up your tights admirably and comfortably, assuming you get the right fit. (photo: Bennett Shane)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Bib Straps</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The straps are what separate bib tights from regular tights and they are a key element when it comes to fit and comfort. The straps should provide light tension over the shoulders to support the lower portion of the tights, holding them in place and keeping the pad positioned properly beneath you. The fact that tension is held over the shoulders also means that, unlike non-bib tights, they don’t require tension around the waist to keep them up and are generally more comfortable as a result. Ideally, the straps will have just light tension over the shoulders when seated and standing on the bike. Too tight, and they can dig into your shoulders or pull up too much on the lower portion of the tights causing discomfort. Too loose, and your tights may have a tendency to slide down, the pad can shift beneath you, or the straps may migrate or even slip off your shoulders. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bib straps come in a range of different styles and materials but they all strive to accomplish the same goal of keeping your bib tights in place. Some are made of mesh, some are made from the same material as the tights, some have trim sewn on the edges, and others have raw-cut edges. Regardless of their material and construction, they should feel comfortable when worn over a base layer or against the skin for extended periods.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ankle-zip-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1608\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ankle-zip-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Ankle zip on the Sportful Bodyfit Pro Bibtight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ankle-zip-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ankle-zip-297x187.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ankle-zip-800x502.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ankle-zip-120x75.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ankle-zip-768x482.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ankle-zip-1536x965.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Ankle-zip-2048x1286.jpeg 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>Ankle zips, like those on the Sportful Bodyfit Pro, are used on some bib tights to make them easier to put on and take off. (photo: Ben Guernsey)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Ankles</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Full-length bib tights vary somewhat in the design of their ankle cuffs. Some simply stretch to get over the heel and ankle, while others have short zippers on either the side or the back that make sliding them over the foot easier. Typically, the stretch available in the chosen fabric is the deciding factor in which style is used. Thicker, more insulated materials or those with water or wind-resistant membranes often don’t have as much stretch, so a zipper can make them easier to put on and take off. Thinner materials or those with more elastane or spandex in their composition often stretch more easily and can be slipped over the foot with little fuss or need for a zipper. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While they can certainly make your bib tights easier to put on and take off, zippered ankles can be problematic. The zippers themselves can break or get stuck rendering them useless. Additionally, they can be uncomfortable if pressed against the leg if you pull socks or shoe covers over the top of them. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Reflective-Visibility-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Reflective-Visibility-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Reflective elements on the Endura FS260-Pro Thermo Bibtights II\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Reflective-Visibility-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Reflective-Visibility-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Reflective-Visibility-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Reflective-Visibility-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Reflective-Visibility-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Reflective-Visibility-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Reflective-Visibility-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Reflective-Visibility-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Reflective elements, like the two stripes on the back of the Endura FS260-Pro Thermo Bibtights II can help you be seen in the more challenging light conditions often encountered while riding in the fall, winter, and spring.

Of course, a good set of lights is also recommended, especially if you’re flirting with low light at dawn and dusk, but some attention-grabbing reflective highlights can help you be seen by drivers. The features vary in their size and placement, but some are always better than none at all. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-tights-pockets.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1365\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-tights-pockets.jpeg\" alt=\"Pockets on the 7Mesh MK3 cargo Bib tights\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-tights-pockets.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-tights-pockets-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-tights-pockets-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-tights-pockets-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-tights-pockets-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-tights-pockets-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Bib-tights-pockets-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Pockets may be a useful feature on your bib tights depending on how you like to carry things while you ride.

While not everyone needs or wants pockets on their tights, they can be very useful for those who like to keep certain items easily accessible while riding. Keeping snacks or your phone in a thigh pocket can make them much easier to reach while riding or when stopped than fishing around in a jersey pocket under a jacket or in a bike-mounted bag. We tested several bib tights with pockets, including the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingbibtights&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2F7mesh-industries-mk3-cargo-bib-tight-mens\">7Mesh MK3 Cargo</a>, Ornot Thermal Cargo, and the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=20053&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingbibtights&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pearlizumi.com%2Fproducts%2Fmens-expedition-thermal-cycling-bib-tights-11112221%3Fvariant%3D42834446352555\">Pearl Izumi Expedition Thermal</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MAAP-Team-Evo-Thermal-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MAAP-Team-Evo-Thermal-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Maap Team Evo Thermal Bib Tights riding shot\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MAAP-Team-Evo-Thermal-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MAAP-Team-Evo-Thermal-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MAAP-Team-Evo-Thermal-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MAAP-Team-Evo-Thermal-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MAAP-Team-Evo-Thermal-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MAAP-Team-Evo-Thermal-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MAAP-Team-Evo-Thermal-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/MAAP-Team-Evo-Thermal-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>MAAP’s Team Evo Thermal Bib Tights are the best we’ve ever worn, which is a good thing considering they are also the most expensive.

Different materials, chamois pads, construction methods, and even brand names can play a role in the price. As with many things, you often get what you pay for, and our top-rated model, the MAAP Team Evo Thermal, also happens to be the most expensive. That said, you don’t have to shell out the big bucks to ride comfortably in cool conditions. In fact, the two least expensive models we tested, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=22233&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingbibtights&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gorewear.com%2Fus%2Fen-us%2Fc3-thermo-bib-tights-100648\">Gorewear C3 Thermo Bib Tights+</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingbibtights&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fcastelli-entrata-bib-tight-mens\">Castelli Entrata Bibtight</a>, both retail for $130 and have plenty to offer the rider on a budget or anyone who appreciates a good value. And, there are plenty of models that fall in the middle of that price range that fit well and provide excellent temperature regulation and protection from the elements. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Castelli-Entrata-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Castelli-Entrata-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Castelli Entrata Bibtight riding shot\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Castelli-Entrata-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Castelli-Entrata-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Castelli-Entrata-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Castelli-Entrata-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Castelli-Entrata-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Castelli-Entrata-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Castelli-Entrata-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Castelli-Entrata-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The “entry-level” Castelli Entrata Bibtight is super comfortable and gets the job done at a fraction of the cost of some of the high-end competitors.

In order to maintain comfort and enjoyment during these conditions, it’s important to dress appropriately. There are a few options when it comes to gearing up your lower body for winter riding, but bib tights are arguably the best. They come in a wide range of materials with varying levels of insulation and weather/wind protection to keep you spinning happily through the winter months. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>What about leg warmers?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Wearing <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-cycling-bib-shorts/\">bib shorts</a> with leg warmers is absolutely another good option and is especially great for changing seasons and days when you want to start warm but know you’ll overheat later. But in the winter, we like riding in full tights because they ensure full coverage, they won’t slide down, and frankly, they just look a little tidier. Bib tights tend to be a little more comfortable without grippers touching your thighs or being squeezed under your shorts. They also make getting dressed easier: one piece versus three! </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Bib tights vs regular tights?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>It depends on your preference. In general, we always recommend bibs over non-bib tights for waist comfort, since they don’t have a tight waistband that can press into your abdomen as you bend over the bike. Not surprisingly, most bib tights make peeing a difficult task, especially in cold weather; unless there’s a zip or flap at the back, you may need to disrobe entirely to pee. Bib tights also are a bit more cycling-specific and typically come with a chamois built-in, making them less useful for other activities.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Chamois vs no chamois?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>We always recommend riding with a pad/chamois for comfort purposes. More often than not, cycling-specific tights come with one. Some brands make tights and bib tights without a pad/insert/chamois, that is designed to be worn over a pair of padded shorts or <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-cycling-bib-shorts/\">bib shorts</a>. Wearing tights over a pair of padded shorts has the advantage of two layers which may be a benefit in colder temperatures, but can also lead to bunching with multiple layers of fabric involved. Tights and bib tights without a pad are also typically less expensive than those that come with one, and without the pad, they are more functional for other activities off the bike. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Can I wear underwear under my bib tights?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Wearing underwear is not recommended because bib shorts and tights with a chamois/pad/insert are designed to be worn against the skin. One of the primary concerns with introducing another layer of fabric is that it can cause issues as the material can bunch and cause chafing, irritation, or pressure points on a very sensitive part of your anatomy. Another issue is that underwear can trap and hold moisture that your pad might otherwise wick away, which can be unsanitary and potentially exacerbate the aforementioned irritation issues. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>\n\n\n<div><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-cycling-bib-shorts/?sce=post-related-link\"><div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BR-BuyerGuide_Guernsey_DSC08872-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Best cycling bib shorts lead photo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BR-BuyerGuide_Guernsey_DSC08872-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BR-BuyerGuide_Guernsey_DSC08872-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BR-BuyerGuide_Guernsey_DSC08872-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BR-BuyerGuide_Guernsey_DSC08872-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BR-BuyerGuide_Guernsey_DSC08872-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BR-BuyerGuide_Guernsey_DSC08872-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BR-BuyerGuide_Guernsey_DSC08872-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/BR-BuyerGuide_Guernsey_DSC08872-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></div><div><h2>The Best Cycling Bib Shorts of 2023</h2><p> <span>Read more…</span></p></div></a></div>\n\n\n<div><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-road-bike-helmets/?sce=post-related-link\"><div><img width=\"1874\" height=\"1249\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Omne-Air-MIPS-1.jpeg\" alt=\"POC Omne Air MIPS road bike helmet\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Omne-Air-MIPS-1.jpeg 1874w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Omne-Air-MIPS-1-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Omne-Air-MIPS-1-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Omne-Air-MIPS-1-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Omne-Air-MIPS-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Omne-Air-MIPS-1-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/POC-Omne-Air-MIPS-1-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></div><div><h2>The Best Road Bike Helmets of 2023</h2><p> <span>Read more…</span></p></div></a></div>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-cycling-bib-tights/\">The Best Cycling Bib Tights of 2023</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Bennett Shane","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"b3fcac83d2ce0081d7f9a919049558edf6e813f2be40d398fdebae9eba0528c6","category":"Cycling"}
