The patch for the first female human spaceflight showcased a dove flying above the letters designating the Soviet Union, CCCP.</p>\n<p>That patch was not publicly revealed at the time, and the use of specially designed patches was employed only infrequently by subsequent Soviet missions. NASA's first mission patch would not follow for two years, but the practice would prove more sticky for missions in the United States and become a time-honored tradition.</p>\n<p>The first NASA flight to produce a mission-specific patch worn by crew members was Gemini 5. It flew in August 1965, carrying astronauts Gordon Cooper and Pete Conrad on an eight-day mission inside a small Gemini spacecraft. At the time, it was the longest spaceflight conducted by anyone.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/12/after-60-years-of-spaceflight-patches-here-are-some-of-our-favorites/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/12/after-60-years-of-spaceflight-patches-here-are-some-of-our-favorites/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"82c3816626bfb96199133d4839862f3a6b34887978290c804c96a5c250462f36","category":"Tech"}
