As a result, many manufacturers offer test saddles that you can use to try out different shapes at participating cycle shops.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/sizing-and-fit/bike-fit-explained-what-is-a-bike-fit-and-should-you-get-one/\">professional bike fit</a> can also be helpful in finding the right fit, with many bike fitters having an array of saddles to choose from and some even having equipment to measure your sit bones.</p>\n<p>Width is the main measurement that will determine if you sit on your sit bones or not.  Short-nose saddles are thought to keep you fixed in a single position on your sit bones.</p>\n<p>Saddles for mountain biking will usually feature a concave shape, rising slightly at the rear for back support and to keep you from slipping off the back when climbing steep trails.</p>\n<p>They usually feature sides that taper downward to increase the clearance between the saddle’s edge and your thigh to minimise the chance of chafing.</p>\n<p>Mountain bike saddles are also less static these days thanks to the wide adoption of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-dropper-posts/\">dropper posts</a>. Because they are out of the way on the descents, most trail and enduro saddles are now more climbing-oriented.</p>\n<h3>How much padding should a mountain bike saddle have?</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"The Syncros Tofino saddle uses carbon rails.\" title=\"DSC00717\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Padding doesn’t mean comfort.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>While it seems logical that more padding should lead to more comfort, it’s often not the case.</p>\n<p>Too much padding can lead to chafing because there is more material blocking your movement, while thick padding on the sit bones can lead to your weight being forced toward the front of the saddle.</p>\n<p>The shape is more important than padding, hence why full-carbon saddles can be comfortable even with a solid exterior.</p>\n<p>The shape of the saddle usually aids compliance, with many brands building flex into their designs to avoid bulky padding.</p>\n<p>Rail material can also add comfort, with hollow tubes reducing weight and adding compliance.</p>\n<p>Many riders will opt for some form of padding, though it’s not uncommon to see downhill riders using saddles with little to none, because they only sit on the saddle when waiting in lift queues.</p>\n<h3>Robustness and strength</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Nukeproof's Horizon saddle on the Nukeproof Mega 290 Alloy Pro full suspension mountain bike\" title=\"Nukeproof Mega 290 Alloy Pro 13\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The best mountain bike saddles will put up with years of abuse.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Saddles are essentially made up of four parts: the rails, shell, padding and cover, all of which have to be built to withstand the rigours of mountain biking.</p>\n<p>While no component is completely crash-proof, good saddles will feature durable covers to fend off scratches and strong metal rails to cope with impacts from you, and from the ground.</p>\n<p>Some cross-country riders trade robustness for lightness.
