{"title":"Google will pay an absurd amount for your iPhone if you switch to a Pixel Fold","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/1915412/google-pixel-fold-iphone-trade-in-prices.html","date":1683910103000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re intrigued by the new <a href=\"https://www.techadvisor.com/article/742457/google-pixel-fold.html\">Pixel Fold</a> and have an iPhone, Google is making it very easy to switch. If you preorder a Pixel Fold, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://store.google.com/config/pixel_fold&amp;xcust=1-1-1915412-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Google is paying</a> up to $950 for a used iPhone, nearly as much as the original MSRP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get the maximum amount, you’ll need to trade in an iPhone 14 Pro Max ($950), iPhone 14 Pro ($900), or iPhone 14 Plus ($750). The iPhone 14 Pro has the least depreciation, with a trade-in value of just $99 less than the MSRP, though the other models hold their value too at just $149 less than Apple’s retail price. For whatever reason, the iPhone 14 only nets you $350 for a $799 phone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year’s Pro models will net you a fantastic rate as well. Google is offering $900 for the iPhone 13 Pro Max and $850 for the iPhone 13 Pro, but just $220 for the iPhone 13 and a paltry $180 for the iPhone 13 mini. For comparison, Apple offers up to $630 for the iPhone 13 Pro Max, $530 for the iPhone Pro, $400 for the iPhone 13, and $330 for the iPhone 13 mini. Note that these prices are only applicable if you buy a Pixel Fold. The same iPhone 14 Pro Max will get you just $500 if you buy a Pixel 7 Pro or 7a.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the rest of the trade-in values from Google:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>iPhone 12 Pro Max: $800</li><li>iPhone 12 Pro: $204.80</li><li>iPhone 12: $165.60</li><li>iPhone 12 mini: $106.40</li><li>iPhone 11 Pro Max: $168</li><li>iPhone 11 Pro: $112.80</li><li>iPhone 11: $240</li><li>iPhone XS Max: $96</li><li>iPhone XS: $73</li><li>iPhone XR: $77</li><li>iPhone X: $57</li><li>iPhone SE (2022): $80.80</li><li>iPhone SE (2020): $28.01</li><li>iPhone 8 Plus: $50</li><li>iPhone 8: $39</li><li>iPhone 7 Plus: $33.01</li><li>iPhone 7: $28</li><li>iPhone 6s Plus: $40</li><li>iPhone 6 Plus: $32</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These prices reflect the lowest storage tier for each model. For some, Google will give you an extra $10 for each extra storage tier. But even if you have the highest storage option, you’re still not getting that much for older phones. For instance, Apple will give you up to $350 for the iPhone 12 Pro and $300 for the iPhone 12.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The high prices for the latest iPhones tell us a couple of things: For one, Google is targeting high-end iPhone users with its new $1,799 Pixel Fold. And it knows how well the iPhone retains its value—consider that its own Pixel 7 Pro, which sells for $799, will only get you $380 toward a Pixel Fold. So if you’re tired of waiting for Apple to launch its own folding phone, consider swapping for a Pixel. Just be warned—you probably won’t get as much for your used Pixel when you switch back.</p>\n\niPhone</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"e7d3038f04367674670fa24ce78d624368a878abcaa96e666686994b9a6c0529","category":"Apple"}
