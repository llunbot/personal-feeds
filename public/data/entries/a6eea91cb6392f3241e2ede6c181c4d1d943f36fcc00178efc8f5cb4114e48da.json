{"title":"AWS Week in Review – February 20, 2023","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-week-in-review-february-20-2023/","date":1676916095000,"content":"<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/02/16/turkey-earthquake-amazon.jpg\" alt width=\"800\" height=\"575\" />Since the devastating earthquake in Türkiye and Syria, Amazon has activated disaster relief services to quickly provide relief items to impacted areas. The company and Amazon customers have donated nearly 100,000 relief items so far, and donations continue to come in.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/government-education/nonprofits/disaster-response/\">AWS Disaster Preparedness and Response team</a> is providing trained technical volunteers and solutions to Help.NGO, a United Nations standby partner assisting in the region.</p> \n<p>We continue to support field requests for winter survival equipment, clothing, hygiene products, and other items. If you wish to donate, check out <a href=\"https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/community/how-amazon-is-helping-communities-impacted-by-the-earthquake-in-turkiye-and-syria\">our blog post</a> to find your local donation site and to learn more about how we’ve supported relief efforts so far. Thank you for your support!</p> \n<p><strong><u>Last Week’s Launches</u></strong><br /> As usual, let’s take a look at some launches from the last week that I want to remind you of:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-graviton3-based-general-purpose-m7g-and-memory-optimized-r7g-amazon-ec2-instances/\"><strong>New Amazon EC2 M7g and R7g instances</strong></a> – Since we launched <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-amazon-ec2-c7g-instances-powered-by-aws-graviton3-processors/\">C7g instances</a> in May 2022, the General Purpose (M7g) and the Memory-Optimized (R7g) instances are generally available. Both types are powered by the latest generation AWS Graviton3 processors, and are designed to deliver up to 25 percent better performance than the equivalent sixth-generation (M6g and R6g) instances, making them the best performers in Amazon EC2.</p> \n<p>Here is my infographic to highlight the principal performance and capacity improvements that we have made available with the new instances:</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/02/15/2023-ec2-m7g-r7g-1.png\" alt width=\"1440\" height=\"720\" /></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/02/enable-aws-systems-manager-default-all-ec2-instances-account/\"><strong>Enable AWS Systems Manager across all Amazon EC2 instances</strong></a> – All EC2 instances in your account become managed instances, with a <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/managed-instances/dhmc-configuration\">single action</a> using the Default Host Management Configuration (DHMC) Agent without changing existing instance profile roles. DHMC is ideal for all EC2 users, and offers a simple, scalable process to standardize the availability of System Manager tools for users who manage many instances. To learn more, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/managed-instances-default-host-management.html\">Default Host Management Configuration</a> in the AWS documentation.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/02/19/2023-aws-systems-manager-dhmc.jpg\" alt width=\"2022\" height=\"958\" /></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/02/manage-enabled-disabled-opt-in-aws-regions-accounts/\"><strong>Programmatically manage opt-in AWS Regions</strong></a> – You can now view and manage enabled and disabled opt-in AWS Regions on your AWS accounts using AWS APIs. You can enable, disable, read, and list Region opt status by using the following AWS CLI commands in case of enabling Africa (Cape Town) Region:</p> \n<pre><code>$ aws account enable-region --region-name af-south-1\n$ aws account get-region-opt-status --region-name af-south-1 \n{ \n   \"RegionName\": \"af-south-1\", \n   \"RegionOptStatus\": \"ENABLING\" \n}</code></pre> \n<p>It will save you the time and effort of doing it through the AWS Management Console.

AWS MDC lets defense customers run low-latency applications in infrastructure-limited environments for scenarios like large-scale military operations, crisis response, and security cooperation.</p> \n<p>At this time, AWS MDC is now available in the AWS GovCloud Regions, and this service can only be purchased by the U.S. Department of Defense under the Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability (JWCC) contract.
