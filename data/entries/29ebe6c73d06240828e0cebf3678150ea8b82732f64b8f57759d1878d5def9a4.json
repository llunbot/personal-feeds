The report says the laptop is expected to be announced at Apple's annual developer conference WWDC, which <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/29/apple-announces-wwdc-2023/\">begins June 5</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/MacBook-Air-Multiple-Sizes-Feature.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nDespite the upcoming 15-inch MacBook Air launch, the sources believe that overall MacBook shipments will likely face a single-digit decrease in 2023 due to a \"disappointing\" first half of the year. The sources also said \"pull-in momentum\" for the 15-inch MacBook Air \"has not been as strong compared with previous new products.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman expects the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/01/gurman-15-inch-macbook-air-wwdc/\">15-inch MacBook Air to debut at WWDC</a>. Like the 13-inch MacBook Air, the 15-inch model will be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/20/kuo-15-inch-macbook-air-two-m2-chip-options/\">powered by the M2 chip</a> with multiple GPU configurations, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNo design changes have been rumored for the 15-inch MacBook Air beyond its larger display size. The 13-inch model is equipped with a notch housing a 1080p camera, a MagSafe 3 charging port, two Thunderbolt 3 ports, a 3.5mm headphone jack, a scissor switch keyboard with a Touch ID button, and a Force Touch trackpad.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe sources believe MacBook shipments could recover in the second half of 2023 if new MacBooks with 3nm chips are released, but Apple's chipmaker TSMC has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/25/tsmc-apple-3nm-chip-yield-struggles/\">reportedly faced 3nm yield issues</a>, so it's unclear when Apple's M3 chip will debut.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/\">WWDC 2023</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/\">DigiTimes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/15-inch-macbook-air/\">15-Inch MacBook Air</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">MacBook Air (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8\">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/04/15-inch-macbook-air-stockpiled/\">15-Inch MacBook Air Stockpiled by Suppliers Ahead of Rumored WWDC Launch</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/15-inch-macbook-air-stockpiled-by-suppliers-ahead-of-rumored-wwdc-launch.2388660/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"29ebe6c73d06240828e0cebf3678150ea8b82732f64b8f57759d1878d5def9a4","category":"Apple"}
