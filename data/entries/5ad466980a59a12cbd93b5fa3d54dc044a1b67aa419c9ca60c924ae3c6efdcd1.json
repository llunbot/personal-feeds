The company said it expects the pill will be available starting in the first quarter of 2024, though its pricing is not yet clear. For optimal efficacy, it needs to be taken consistently every day in the same three-hour window. Opill is estimated to be about 93 percent effective at preventing pregnancy in real-life use, higher than the real-life efficacy of other over-the-counter birth control methods, such as condoms, which are around 87 percent effective.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1953709#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1953709&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5ad466980a59a12cbd93b5fa3d54dc044a1b67aa419c9ca60c924ae3c6efdcd1","category":"Tech"}
