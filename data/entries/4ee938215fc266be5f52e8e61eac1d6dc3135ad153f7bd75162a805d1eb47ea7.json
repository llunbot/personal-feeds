However, the latest report about the iPhone 16 models suggests that might not be the case this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Haitong International Securities analyst Jeff Pu (<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://9to5mac.com/2024/01/14/iphone-16-specs-ram-5g-support-and-more/&amp;xcust=1-1-2203492-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">via 9to5Mac</a>), Apple is expected to make several big changes to the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus models this year. Most notably, the phones will get a version of the A18 processor, which essentially means the non-Pro iPhone will skip a generation. It will still likely have a lesser processor than the iPhone 16 Pro, which is expected to get the A18 Pro, but it will be the first time since the iPhone 14 that all new iPhones are on the same generation of chip.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pu also claims the iPhone 16 will get a bump to 8GB of RAM, matching the Pro models. The standard iPhone has had 6GB of RAM since the iPhone 13, while the Pros jumped to 8GB in 2023. Additionally, the iPhone 16 models will get <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/334313/wifi-6e-explained-spectrum-speeds-reliability-iphone-ipad-mac.html\">Wi-Fi 6E</a>, which also arrived on the iPhone 15 Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Add it all up and you’ve got a sizable upgrade—and that’s before any camera or display enhancements. So if you’ve been holding off for a couple of generations, this could be the one you’ve been waiting for. Of course, we’ve still about eight months until the next iPhone arrives, so stay tuned to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2007943/iphone-16-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">our iPhone 16 rumor roundup</a> all year long.</p>\n\niPhone</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"4ee938215fc266be5f52e8e61eac1d6dc3135ad153f7bd75162a805d1eb47ea7","category":"Apple"}
