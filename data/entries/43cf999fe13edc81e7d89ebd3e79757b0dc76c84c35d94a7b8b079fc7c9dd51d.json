The <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/users-say-googles-vpn-app-breaks-the-windows-dns-settings/\">Google One VPN service</a> we complained about last week is headed to the chopping block. Google's <a href=\"https://support.google.com/googleone/answer/7582172?hl=en-GB&amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop\">support documents</a> haven't been updated yet, but <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/vpn-by-google-one-shut-down-3433530/\">Android Authority</a> reported on an email going out to Google One users informing them of the shutdown. <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2024/04/11/google-one-vpn-discontinued/\">9to5Google</a> also got confirmation of the shutdown from Google.</p>\n<p>The Google One VPN <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/google-one/new-vpn-by-google-one/\">launched in 2020</a> as a bonus feature for paying Google One subscribers. Google One is Google's cloud storage subscription plan that allows users to buy extra storage for Gmail, Drive, and Google Photos. In 2020, the plan was exclusive to the expensive 2TB tier for $10 a month, but later, it was brought down to all Google One tiers, including the entry-level $2-per-month option.</p>\n<p>By our count, Google has <em>three</em> VPN products, though \"products\" might be too strong a word since they are all essentially the same thing—VPN market segments? There's the general Google One VPN for Android, iOS, Windows, and Mac—this is the one that's dying. There's also the \"<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.privacy.wildlife\">Pixel VPN by Google One</a>,\" which came with Pixel phones (the \"Google One\" branding here makes no sense since you didn't have to subscribe to Google One) and the Google Fi VPN that's exclusive to Google Fi Android and iOS customers.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016925#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016925&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"43cf999fe13edc81e7d89ebd3e79757b0dc76c84c35d94a7b8b079fc7c9dd51d","category":"Tech"}
