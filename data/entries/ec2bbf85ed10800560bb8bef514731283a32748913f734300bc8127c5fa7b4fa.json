It’s a fiber optic cable strung between three utility poles that then runs underground before feeding into an “interrogator.” This device fires a laser through the cable and analyzes the light that bounces back. It can pick up tiny perturbations in that light caused by seismic activity or even loud sounds, like from a passing ambulance. It’s a newfangled technique known as distributed acoustic sensing, or DAS.</p>\n<p>Because DAS can track seismicity, other scientists are <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/how-fiber-optic-cables-could-warn-you-of-an-earthquake/\">increasingly using it to monitor earthquakes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/scientists-spy-on-mount-etna-with-fiber-optic-cables/\">volcanic activity</a>. (A buried system is so sensitive, in fact, that it can <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/how-underground-fiber-optics-spy-on-humans-moving-above/\">detect people walking and driving above</a>.) But the scientists in Princeton just stumbled upon a rather … noisier use of the technology. In the spring of 2021, Sarper Ozharar—a physicist at NEC Laboratories, which operates the Princeton test bed—noticed <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jinsectscience/article/23/6/3/7425398\">a strange signal in the DAS data</a>. “We realized there were some weird things happening,” says Ozharar. “Something that shouldn’t be there. There was a distinct frequency buzzing everywhere.”</p>\n<p></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1987931#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1987931&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ec2bbf85ed10800560bb8bef514731283a32748913f734300bc8127c5fa7b4fa","category":"Tech"}
