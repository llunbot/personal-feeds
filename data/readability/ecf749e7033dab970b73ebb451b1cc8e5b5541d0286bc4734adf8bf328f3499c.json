Reach figures are drastically increased, the head angle goes slacker, and the seat tube sits <em>way</em> <em>more</em> upright than the Yelli Screamy of 2015. It’s not all change, though. Canfield have looked to keep the nimble ride feel of this 29er hardtail by maintaining the short chainstays it is known for. Here are the specifics, and how to get your hands on one.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/20065916/Canfield-Yelli-Screamy-Ride-gen3-29er-hardtail-mtb-cornering.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/20065916/Canfield-Yelli-Screamy-Ride-gen3-29er-hardtail-mtb-cornering.jpg\" alt=\"riding canfield yelli screamy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/20065916/Canfield-Yelli-Screamy-Ride-gen3-29er-hardtail-mtb-cornering.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/20065916/Canfield-Yelli-Screamy-Ride-gen3-29er-hardtail-mtb-cornering-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/20065916/Canfield-Yelli-Screamy-Ride-gen3-29er-hardtail-mtb-cornering-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/20065916/Canfield-Yelli-Screamy-Ride-gen3-29er-hardtail-mtb-cornering-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/20065916/Canfield-Yelli-Screamy-Ride-gen3-29er-hardtail-mtb-cornering-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/20065916/Canfield-Yelli-Screamy-Ride-gen3-29er-hardtail-mtb-cornering-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><h2>3rd Gen Canfield Yelli Screamy&nbsp;</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/20065853/Canfield-Yelli-Screamy-3rd-gen-29er-hardtail.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/20065853/Canfield-Yelli-Screamy-3rd-gen-29er-hardtail.jpg\" alt=\"2022 canfield yelli screamy 29er hardtail mtb\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/20065853/Canfield-Yelli-Screamy-3rd-gen-29er-hardtail.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/20065853/Canfield-Yelli-Screamy-3rd-gen-29er-hardtail-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/20065853/Canfield-Yelli-Screamy-3rd-gen-29er-hardtail-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/20065853/Canfield-Yelli-Screamy-3rd-gen-29er-hardtail-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/20065853/Canfield-Yelli-Screamy-3rd-gen-29er-hardtail-768x576.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/20065853/Canfield-Yelli-Screamy-3rd-gen-29er-hardtail-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>The big news for the Canfield Yelli Screamy is its new stretched out silhouette, bringing it’s geometry into the modern era.

A pretty dramatic change, but when you consider this bike hasn’t been updated since 2015, it’s not so surprising. That long reach <em>almost</em> puts this into the hardcore hardtail category, but its 130mm travel fork (can take 120mm-140mm) and 65.5° head tube angle make it more of a trail or all-mountain hardtail. Its definitely one of the longer short-travel 29ers on the market, for sure; complete geometry chart below.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/20065907/Canfield-Yelli-Screamy-headtube-welds.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/20065907/Canfield-Yelli-Screamy-headtube-welds.jpg\" alt=\"canfield yelli screamy headtube angle 65.5 tapered headtube welds\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/20065907/Canfield-Yelli-Screamy-headtube-welds.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/20065907/Canfield-Yelli-Screamy-headtube-welds-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/20065907/Canfield-Yelli-Screamy-headtube-welds-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/20065907/Canfield-Yelli-Screamy-headtube-welds-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/20065907/Canfield-Yelli-Screamy-headtube-welds-768x576.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/20065907/Canfield-Yelli-Screamy-headtube-welds-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>The Yelli Screamy is composed of a 6061 aluminium tubeset, chosen for the degree of compliance it offers. The rear end grows to boost spacing (148mm x 12mm). ISCG 05 tabs allow fitment of a chain guide and bash guard. Three sets of water bottle bosses mean this frame could be a worthy bikepacking companion. Cable routing is external, save for the dropper post where routing is internal.</p><div id=\"attachment_275545\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/20065903/Canfield-Yelli-Screamy-Gen-3-geometry-chart.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-275545\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/20065903/Canfield-Yelli-Screamy-Gen-3-geometry-chart.jpg\" alt=\"2022 canfield yelli screamy geometry chart 29er hardtail mtb\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1984\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/20065903/Canfield-Yelli-Screamy-Gen-3-geometry-chart.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/20065903/Canfield-Yelli-Screamy-Gen-3-geometry-chart-242x300.jpg 242w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/20065903/Canfield-Yelli-Screamy-Gen-3-geometry-chart-800x992.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/20065903/Canfield-Yelli-Screamy-Gen-3-geometry-chart-97x120.jpg 97w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/20065903/Canfield-Yelli-Screamy-Gen-3-geometry-chart-768x952.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/20065903/Canfield-Yelli-Screamy-Gen-3-geometry-chart-1239x1536.jpg 1239w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-275545\">Measurements in millimetres unless otherwise noted, based on 130mm fork, 541mm Axle to Crown</p></div><h3>Pricing &amp; Availability</h3><p>The 3rd Generation Canfield Yelli Screamy is available to pre-order now, with deliveries expected in January 2022.
