The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/gravel-bikes/2022-giant-revolt-advanced-pro-0/\">Revolt Advanced Pro 0</a> took home our coveted <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/bike-of-the-year/\">Bike of the Year</a> award in 2022, impressing with its comfort and quick handling.</p>\n<p>Here, a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-suspension-forks/\">suspension fork</a> is added to the mix, providing 40mm of bump-taming travel, as well as an optimised geometry to cater for it.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a closer look at the bike.</p>\n<h2>Sticking to a winning recipe</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> There are mounts on the top tube for a bento box.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>The Revolt X doesn’t veer too dramatically from the brand’s winning recipe on the Revolt.</p>\n<p>Giant continues to use its Advanced Composite carbon for the frame, with the front triangle assembled and moulded as one piece.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> There are also mounts under the down tube towards the bottom-bracket junction.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>Both the top tube and down tube are oversized, which Giant claims boosts stiffness and torsional rigidity.</p>\n<p>The top tube also slopes downward, making the front and rear triangles smaller. In turn, this creates a lighter and stiffer bike, according to the brand.</p>\n<div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/03/DSC00102-756fa43.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Giant Revolt X flip chip feature\" title=\"Giant Revolt X flip chip feature\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The flip chip offers two different positions. </span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/03/DSC00104-b7fc671.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"There's ample clearance around the 700c x 45mm tyres specced.\" title=\"DSC00104\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>There’s ample clearance around the specced 700c x 45mm tyres.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i></i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/03/DSC00109-d5cdf55.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Giant Revolt X flip chip feature\" title=\"Giant Revolt X flip chip feature\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The bike uses 12mm thru-axles. </span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Like the rigid Revolt, this new model incorporates a flip chip at the rear dropout with two selectable positions. The ‘Short Position’ reduces the wheelbase and chainstay length to sharpen reactions, whereas the ‘Long Position’ increases the wheelbase for improved stability.</p>\n<p>The Revolt X runs on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/700c-wheels/\">700c wheels</a>, although tyre clearance is dependent on the flip chip setting. In the longer setup, the Revolt X can accept up to a 53mm-wide <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-tyres/\">gravel bike tyre</a>. The maximum when run shorter is 42mm.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Revolt X can accept three different seatpost types.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>Although the bike ships with a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-dropper-posts/\">dropper post</a>, you can also run Giant’s proprietary D-Fuse <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/seatposts/\">seatpost</a> if you’re after more compliance from a rigid setup.
