Unfortunately, it has become clear in our ongoing discussions and planning for the future that we do not share the same vision and we have been unable to come to an agreement that works for both parties. Premier Tech is committed to the sport of cycling and will announce in the near future the next phase of its presence in the peloton and WorldTour scene.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is unclear what differences in “vision” have led to the impending split so soon after Premier Tech increased its investment in the partnership, but the departure of the co-title sponsor will represent another big change for a team whose longtime team principal, Alexandre Vinokourov, was dismissed from that role in June.</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/08/premier-tech-will-no-longer-be-a-co-title-sponsor-for-the-astana-team-after-2021/\">Read More</a>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"88dc16cadade3836f33a8d933271f6b1df009869d630cb91b4c9871c9c55d4d7","category":"Cycling"}
