However, that would not affect the UK order for backdoor access to the service in other countries, including the United States. Apple has previously <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/30/apple-deeply-concerned-uk-surveillance-law/\">said</a> it would consider pulling services such as FaceTime and iMessage from the UK rather than compromise future security.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe order came by way of a \"technical capability notice,\" a document sent to Apple by the Home Secretary, ordering it to provide access under the sweeping UK Investigatory Powers Act (IPA) of 2016. Critics have labeled it the \"Snooper's Charter,\" as it authorizes law enforcement to compel assistance from companies when needed to collect evidence.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAn Apple spokesperson declined to comment on the revelation, though the law actually makes it a criminal offense to reveal that the government even made such a demand. Likewise, the Home Office told the publication that its policy was not to discuss any technical demands. \"We do not comment on operational matters, including for example confirming or denying the existence of any such notices,\" a spokesman said.\r<br />\n<blockquote>One of the people briefed on the situation, a consultant advising the United States on encryption matters, said Apple would be barred from warning its users that its most advanced encryption no longer provided full security. The person deemed it shocking that the UK government was demanding Apple's help to spy on non-British users without their governments' knowledge. A former White House security adviser confirmed the existence of the British order.</blockquote>The order would compromise Apple's Advanced Data Protection feature, which the company launched in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/07/apple-advanced-data-protection/\">2022</a>, giving users the option to enable end-to-end encryption for many additional iCloud data categories, including Photos, Notes, Voice Memos, Messages backups, device backups, and more.\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/enable-advanced-data-protection-icloud/\">How to Enable End-to-End Encryption for iCloud Backups</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nThe IPA was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/30/apple-deeply-concerned-uk-surveillance-law/\">updated</a> in 2023 to allow the Home Office to outlaw certain encrypted services using a technical capability notice. Apple at the time called the then proposed amendments \"an unprecedented overreach by the government,\" saying that if the update was enacted, \"the UK could attempt to secretly veto new user protections globally preventing us from ever offering them to customers.\"<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-privacy/\">Apple Privacy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-security/\">Apple Security</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/encryption/\">Encryption</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-kingdom/\">United Kingdom</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/07/uk-government-orders-access-icloud/\">UK Authorities Demand Back Door Access to iCloud Backups Globally</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/uk-authorities-demand-back-door-access-to-icloud-backups-globally.2448927/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4d7c70e41bf30d743bc818443ea39e8281fddf2a700adf993aaa91aaa94177f0","category":"Apple"}
