Residents will be able to choose whether they want an AirTag or a Tile, <a href=\"https://mpdc.dc.gov/trackmystuff\">MPD said</a>, and once the device is installed, only the resident will have access to tracking information as the sole owner of the device, but they will be required to share data with police if their vehicle is stolen.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1982442#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1982442&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d46434f483f371f85aa75e1053100f5c2c164254c4b3567f460bf811d283c5d5","category":"Tech"}
