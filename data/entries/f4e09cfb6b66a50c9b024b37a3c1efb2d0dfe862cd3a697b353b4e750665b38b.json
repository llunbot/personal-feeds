Developing up and coming talent is now a real focus for this team, and it will be interesting to see how he grows over the coming seasons.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his relatively brief stint with Rally, Sheffield raced a program mostly focused on one-day events, which he noted he particularly enjoys. He expects to get a better idea of the events that best suit his skillset, however, as he acquires experience racing with his new team moving forward, saying, “The next couple years I’m looking forward to gaining as much experience as possible and really just trying to find the style of racing I like the most. Then also being able to help my teammates succeed.”</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/09/american-up-and-comer-magnus-sheffield-is-headed-to-the-ineos-grenadiers-next-year/\">Read More</a>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"f4e09cfb6b66a50c9b024b37a3c1efb2d0dfe862cd3a697b353b4e750665b38b","category":"Cycling"}
