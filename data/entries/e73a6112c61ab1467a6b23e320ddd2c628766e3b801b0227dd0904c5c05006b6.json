Unfortunately, it might be a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Mark Bloomberg’s latest Power On newsletter, the iPad mini won’t be updated “until the end of this year at the earliest.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPad mini has had something of a sporadic update schedule since its 2012 debut. After an annual update schedule for the first 4 years, Apple has released just two updates in the past nine years, including a three-and-a-half-year gap between the 4th and 5th generations:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>iPad mini (1st-gen):</strong> October 2012</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPad mini 2:</strong> October 2013</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPad mini 3:</strong> October 2014</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPad mini 4:</strong> September 2015</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPad mini (5th-gen):</strong> March 2019</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPad mini (6th-gen):</strong> September 2021</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A fall release would make it three years since Apple last updated the iPad mini and a spring 2025 release would rival the 5th-gen model for the longest time between updates. However, previous reports have claimed that Apple is planning to update the entire iPad line this year, so the new mini may very well make an appearance alongside the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2007943/iphone-16-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">iPhone 16</a> in September.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 7th-gen iPad mini is expected to be a similar refresh to the iPad Air, with a faster chip, new colors, and a landscape front camera.
