Beeler's order granted the SEC's application to enforce the subpoena and ordered the SEC and Musk to \"confer within one week and settle on a date and location for the testimony. If they cannot agree, then they may submit a joint letter brief with their respective positions, and the court will decide the dispute for them.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2002722#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2002722&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5742e0bae6eba7d31218e65c632027e379356b08a6c13de10c707d4bb6d1df2e","category":"Tech"}
