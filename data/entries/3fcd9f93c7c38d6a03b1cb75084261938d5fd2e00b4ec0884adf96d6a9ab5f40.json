Prominent industry analyst Benedict Evans wonders if the Apple Intelligence issues and the push to bring Vision Pro to market are a sign of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/20/apples-windows-vista-moment/\">Apple experiencing a \"Vista-like drift into systemically poor execution\"</a> similar to what Microsoft went through with Windows nearly 20 years ago.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Report: Apple TV+ Losing $1 Billion Annually as Apple Services Falter</h2>\r<br />\nApple is known to have been investing large sums of money into Apple TV+ in an effort to expand its services business, but it's never been revealed how well the service is performing for Apple.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/Apple-TV-Plus-Feature-2-Warm.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nA new report from <em>The Information</em> claims that Apple TV+ has around 45 million subscribers worldwide, making it a small player in the streaming video market, and that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/20/report-tv-losing-1-billion-annually/\">the service is losing roughly $1 billion per year</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has reportedly been trying to tighten up the purse strings a bit to move closer to breaking even on Apple TV+, but it's not the only Apple service that's not exactly pulling its weight in the high-margin services sector, as Apple Music interest seems to be plateauing while Apple News+, Apple Arcade, and Apple Fitness+ are also not seeing significant growth.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Next Year's iPhone 18 Pro Already Rumored to Have Five New Features</h2>\r<br />\nWe're still nearly six months away from the official unveiling of the iPhone 17 lineup, but that doesn't mean the rumor mill isn't already looking beyond to the 2026 models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iphone-16-pro-ghost-hand.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1785\" height=\"1004\" />\r<br />\nFor <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/18/iphone-18-pro-rumors/\">Apple's high-end iPhone 18 Pro models</a>, rumors have suggested we could see under-display Face ID for a much smaller Dynamic Island, a variable aperture main camera, Apple's next-generation C2 cellular modem, and an A20 chip with upgrades to benefit Apple Intelligence.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple's First Foldable iPhone Estimated to Cost Nearly Twice as Much as iPhone 16 Pro Max</h2>\r<br />\nApple has been rumored to be working on several foldable devices, with a foldable iPhone potentially being the first one out the door in late 2026 or early 2027. Based on supply chain checks, Barclays analyst Tim Long <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/foldable-iphone-price-estimate/\">believes the device could start at around $2,300</a>, representing a huge premium over Apple's traditional flagship phones.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Foldable-iPhone-2023-Feature-Iridescent-Search.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" />\r<br />\nA larger foldable device <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/16/apple-foldables-mass-production-2026/\">may not be far behind</a>, but <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/18/apple-foldable-ipad-or-mac/\">will it be considered a Mac or an iPad</a>? It may largely come down to whether its operating system is built off of iPadOS or macOS, with analyst Jeff Pu <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/apple-foldable-macos-prediction/\">believing it will be a flavor of macOS</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>MacRumors Newsletter</h3>\r<br />\nEach week, we publish an email newsletter like this highlighting the top Apple stories, making it a great way to get a bite-sized recap of the week hitting all of the major topics we've covered and tying together related stories for a big-picture view.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSo if you want to have <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/macrumors/mar-20-2025\">top stories</a> like the above recap delivered to your email inbox each week, <b><a href=\"http://eepurl.com/OHdUX\">subscribe to our newsletter</a></b>!<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/top-stories/\">Top Stories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/22/top-stories-iphone-17-air-rumors/\">Top Stories: iPhone 17 Air Rumors, Apple's Siri Problem, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/top-stories-iphone-17-air-rumors-apples-siri-problem-and-more.2453824/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"MacRumors Staff","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3fcd9f93c7c38d6a03b1cb75084261938d5fd2e00b4ec0884adf96d6a9ab5f40","category":"Apple"}
