New players will be required to connect the two starting Monday, May 6.</p>\n<p>Officially, this is happening because of the \"safety and security provided on PlayStation and PlayStation Studios games.\" Account linking allows Sony to ban abusive players, and also gives banned players the right to appeal. Sony writes that it would have done this at launch, but \"Due to technical issues … we allowed the linking requirements for Steam accounts to a PlayStation Network account to be temporarily optional. That grace period will now expire.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021773#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021773&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c57778fc413b4a455fa288df197f58cc86b27385dbe5b1d49cc60fae79976b3c","category":"Tech"}
