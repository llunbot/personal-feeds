In 2021, the company published its electrification plan, which called for it to sell only battery EVs from 2030, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588587/mercedes-benz-electric-ev-2030-caveat\">at least in countries with the infrastructure to support that</a>.

While it says it is taking the necessary steps to go all-electric, it also \"plans to be in a position to cater to different customer needs, whether it’s an all-electric drivetrain or an electrified combustion engine, until well into the 2030s.\"</p>\n<p>The change, evidently, has been percolating within Mercedes' board rooms for some time.
