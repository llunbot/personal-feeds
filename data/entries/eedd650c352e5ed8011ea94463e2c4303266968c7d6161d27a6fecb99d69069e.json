At this point, there are several different bike pump head designs, but for Fernando Tages, the Founder of Radian USA/Chainlift, there had to be a better way. It’s a classic story, man gets tired of an issue he faces every day, and decides to find a way to fix it. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/G-002.gif\"><img width=\"540\" height=\"304\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/G-002.gif\" alt=\"Zilch pump on valve\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Tired of struggling with existing pump heads and losing air when removing the chuck from the valve, Fernando decided to put his 30+ years of product design and manufacturing to use and Radian USA came up with Zilch. That is, a pretty interesting bike pump called the Zilch. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s worth pointing out that this isn’t Radian USA’s first rodeo. We wrote about the brand <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/chainlift-tool-does-the-dirty-work-of-wheel-removal-brake-tuning-better-than-your-hands-ever-will/\" target=\"_blank\">in 2020 with their Chainlift device</a>, which is a unique tool to help with bicycle maintenance. Now, with Zilch, Radian USA is poised to reach a lot more consumers with a patented pump design that looks like a home run. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/G-003-Zero-air-loss.gif\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/G-003-Zero-air-loss.gif\" alt=\"Zilch pump zero air loss\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The main goal of Zilch is to make tire inflation easier. Most pump heads either require you to force the valve through a rubber grommet or to use two hands to operate a locking mechanism on the chuck. Zilch uses a one-handed design that goes onto the valve with zero effort. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Zilch-Eploded-Final.webp\"><img width=\"1366\" height=\"1923\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Zilch-Eploded-Final.webp\" alt=\"Zilch pump diagram\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Zilch-Eploded-Final.webp 1366w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Zilch-Eploded-Final-213x300.webp 213w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Zilch-Eploded-Final-85x120.webp 85w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Zilch-Eploded-Final-768x1081.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Zilch-Eploded-Final-1091x1536.webp 1091w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s because until you lock the handle in place, there is nothing to touch the valve. The Zilch head uses a patented auto-locking lever with a diametral seal design with two sides that squeeze onto the (presta) valve. When you’ve inflated the tire, a squeeze of the lever unlocks it, and prevents any air from escaping from the valve. Again, there is nothing touching the valve at this point, so you can effortlessly remove the chuck from the valve–no more struggling to remove the pump, only have it release and jerk your hand into the cassette teeth. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What about Schrader valves?</strong> Zilch works with Schrader valves, but you must use one of the included adapters. These adapters thread onto the Schrader valve and can be left in place without air loss. The same is true for Dunlop valves. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Packing a lifetime warranty for the pump head, the Zilch head is also fully user-rebuildable with replaceable parts. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/G-004-Docking.gif\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/G-004-Docking.gif\" alt=\"Zilch pump docking\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/G-005-auto-centering.gif\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/G-005-auto-centering.gif\" alt=\"Zilch pump handle center\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Meganetic-dock-docked-final.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Meganetic-dock-docked-final-1536x864.png\" alt=\"Zilch pump dock\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Meganetic-dock-docked-final-1536x864.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Meganetic-dock-docked-final-297x167.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Meganetic-dock-docked-final-120x68.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Meganetic-dock-docked-final-768x432.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Meganetic-dock-docked-final-2048x1152.png 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Meganetic-dock-docked-final-1200x675.png 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P-007-base-alternate.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P-007-base-alternate-1536x864.webp\" alt=\"Zilch pump base\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P-007-base-alternate-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P-007-base-alternate-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P-007-base-alternate-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P-007-base-alternate-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P-007-base-alternate-1200x675.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P-007-base-alternate.webp 1920w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P-003-One-handed-white-background-final.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P-003-One-handed-white-background-final-1536x864.png\" alt=\"Zilch pump head\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P-003-One-handed-white-background-final-1536x864.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P-003-One-handed-white-background-final-297x167.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P-003-One-handed-white-background-final-120x68.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P-003-One-handed-white-background-final-768x432.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P-003-One-handed-white-background-final-1200x675.png 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P-003-One-handed-white-background-final.png 1920w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P-001-gauge-white-background.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P-001-gauge-white-background-1536x864.webp\" alt=\"Zilch pump gauge\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P-001-gauge-white-background-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P-001-gauge-white-background-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P-001-gauge-white-background-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P-001-gauge-white-background-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P-001-gauge-white-background-1200x675.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P-001-gauge-white-background.webp 1920w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Sold only as part of a complete floor pump or shop inflators, the floor pump has some interesting features as well. A quick docking feature for the pump head ensures that it stays in place on the pump handle and ready to grab at a moment’s notice. The pump handle also has an auto-centering feature to return it to the same position so the pump head dock is always there. A large triangular base helps to prevent tipping, and if it does tip, rubber ends on the handle should prevent damage. The handle also acts as storage for the included adapters for Schrader valves (2x) and a needle inflator. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P-006-pump-wide-shot-desktop-scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P-006-pump-wide-shot-desktop-1536x864.webp\" alt=\"Zilch pump\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P-006-pump-wide-shot-desktop-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P-006-pump-wide-shot-desktop-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P-006-pump-wide-shot-desktop-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P-006-pump-wide-shot-desktop-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P-006-pump-wide-shot-desktop-2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P-006-pump-wide-shot-desktop-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently holding three patents in the U.S. and with multiple patents pending internationally, the Zilch pump head has also been recognized with a 2025 Design and Innovation award. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To get the Zilch off the ground, <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/radianusa/zilch-the-easy-to-use-bike-pump-for-everyone/description\" target=\"_blank\">Radian USA is using Kickstarter and has already surpassed its initial goal of $40,000</a>.
