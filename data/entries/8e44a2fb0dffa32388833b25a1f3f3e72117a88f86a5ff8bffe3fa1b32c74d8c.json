Although these don’t offer the fine, on-the-fly adjustability of dials or ratchets, the straps probably make the profile of the shoe slightly more aerodynamic (if that concerns you).</p>\n<p></p><div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/07/20210722_SB_5DMKII_MG_7415-d6eab6a.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The Motion uses Velcro straps instead of ratchets or dials.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/07/20210722_SB_5DMKII_MG_7419-4bdeb1b.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The sole has a cheaper and heavier fibreglass construction, but the cleat bolt holes are adjustable.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/07/20210722_SB_5DMKII_MG_7422-4c66956.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The synthetic leather uppers are perforated and mesh panels have been inserted to improve ventilation.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\nTo find cost savings, the Motion uses a fibreglass, rather than carbon, sole construction.
