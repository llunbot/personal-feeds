{"title":"What makes baseball’s “magic mud” so special?","link":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/what-makes-baseballs-magic-mud-so-special/","date":1730999274000,"content":"<p>Since the 1940s, baseball players have been spreading a special kind of \"magic mud\" on new baseballs to reduce the slick, glossy shine and give pitchers a firmer grip. Now, scientists at the University of Pennsylvania have identified just what gives that magic mud its special properties, according to a <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2413514121\">new paper</a> published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</p>\n<p>Before magic mud came along, baseballs were treated with a mix of water and soil from the infield or, alternatively, tobacco juice or shoe polish. But these substances stained and scratched up the ball's leather surface. Lena Blackburne was a third-base coach for the Philadelphia Athletics in the 1930s when an umpire complained about that, so he hunted for a better mud. Blackburne found that mud in a still-secret location purportedly near Palmyra, New Jersey, and a baseball dynasty was born: Lena Blackburne Baseball Rubbing Mud. Once harvested, the mud is strained, skimmed of excess water, rinsed with tap water, and then subjected to a secret \"proprietary treatment\" before being allowed to settle.</p>\n<p>Yet there hasn't been much scientific research on the magic mud apart from one<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43246-022-00317-4\"> 2022 study</a>. We do know quite a bit about the complex behavior of soil in general, including mud. Per the authors, mud is essentially \"a dense suspension of predominantly clay and silt particles in water,\" sometimes with a bit of sand in the mix, although this has little effect on how mud behaves under shearing forces (rheology). Technically, it falls into the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/03/this-stretchy-electronic-material-hardens-upon-impact-just-like-oobleck/\">non-Newtonian fluid</a> category, in which the viscosity changes (either thickening or thinning) in response to an applied strain or shearing force, thereby straddling the boundary between liquid and solid behavior.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/what-makes-baseballs-magic-mud-so-special/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/what-makes-baseballs-magic-mud-so-special/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"700ff89fe9e7eec85854556f57818dc580fcb6bea78b397008fcab0a8ef5eded","category":"Tech"}
