The PC version of the game, which was expected to launch this month, is now targeting a May 30 release date on Steam, GOG, and the Epic Games Store, according to <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/482400/view/3675538825746573847\">an announcement</a> that came in the voice of series antagonist AI Shodan. Nightdive added that the PC release will be followed by versions for PlayStation and Xbox consoles \"in due course.\"</p>\n<p>\"We had hoped to bring the game to market by the end of March, but that turned out to be just beyond our reach,\" the developers wrote. \"We are after all merely human (unlike Shodan!).\"</p>\n<p>The long road to this <em>System Shock</em> remake started back in 2016, when Nightdive <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1598858095/system-shock/description\">raised $1.35 million via Kickstarter</a> for what it called \"a complete remake of the genre-defining classic from 1994, rebuilt from the ground up with the Unity Engine.\" Active development later moved to the Unreal Engine but was <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1598858095/system-shock/posts/2115044\">put on hiatus in early 2018</a>, shortly after the team missed its initial December 2017 target.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1923855#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1923855&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f30de1fc5dd9225307d21e8f8ff0fd4f3ede232055aa542fea51f6346071fa64","category":"Tech"}
