The remaining 85 percent of the threads became displaced, and many of the threads that were left receiving little to no signals have been shut off.</p>\n<p>In a May 8 blog post, Neuralink had disclosed that \"a number\" of the chip's 64 thinner-than-hair threads <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/05/elon-musks-neuralink-reports-trouble-with-first-human-brain-chip/\">had retracted</a>. Each thread carries multiple electrodes, totaling 1,024 across the threads, which are surgically implanted near neurons of interest to record signals that can be decoded into intended actions.</p>\n<p>Neuralink was quick to note that it was able to adjust the algorithm used for decoding those neuronal signals to compensate for the lost electrode data. The adjustments were effective enough to regain and then exceed performance on at least one metricâ€”the bits-per-second (BPS) rate used to measure how quickly and accurately a patient with an implant can control a computer cursor.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025511#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025511&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"29e7ae9b8e620fc442108dd89685864fac4d0fde6e45999b2f4f961cb0fedcda","category":"Tech"}
