Alongside the grandstand elite men’s and women’s races, the World Championships showcase the next generation of cycling in the men’s and women’s junior and under-23 competitions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For these young riders, the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/uci-world-championships\" target=\"_blank\">World Championships</a> is the one time of the year the world gets to tune into youth racing. It is a great place to catch the eye of sponsors, talent scouts and fans alike. For some riders, it’s the beginning of something big. The likes of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/mathieu-van-der-poel\" target=\"_blank\">Mathieu van der Poel</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/remco-evenepoel\" target=\"_blank\">Remco Evenepoel</a> have won teenage rainbow jerseys on the way to their current greatness. For others, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-is-the-curse-of-the-rainbow-jersey\" target=\"_blank\">the rainbow curse</a> seemed to kick in from a young age.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, we’re going to wind the clock back to the 2014 UCI Road World Championships in Ponferrada, Spain and take a look at how the field of hopeful riders ten years ago are getting on nowadays. A decade on from their under-23 and junior successes, have they managed to build on their achievements, or did they peak too soon?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>The time-trials</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-532592844-970x646.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-532592844-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-532592844-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-532592844-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-532592844-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-532592844-2048x1363.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-532592844-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-532592844-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-532592844-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-532592844-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-532592844-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Tim de Waele/Corbis via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Men’s under-23 time-trial</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Campbell Flakemore, Australia (retired since 2015)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ryan Mullen, Ireland (active on WorldTour level at Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stefan Küng, Switzerland (active on WorldTour level at Groupama-FDJ)</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Gold medalist <strong>Campbell Flakemore</strong> retired just one year after winning the under-23 time-trial title. The Tasmanian was scooped up by BMC after his Worlds success but was left unconvinced by life in the pro peloton. He moved back to Australia after retiring and went on to become a landscapist in Hobart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ireland’s <strong>Ryan Mullen</strong> missed out on gold by a matter of just half a second in 2014. Mullen, like bronze medalist <strong>Stefan Küng</strong>, would go on to ride on the UCI WorldTour. Of the three, Küng has been the most successful, winning the European time-trial championship in 2020 and 2021 and the final stage of this year’s Vuelta a España.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Men’s junior time-trial</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Lennard Kämna, Germany (active on WorldTour level at Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Adrien Costa, USA (retired since 2017)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Michael Storer, Australia (active on ProTeam level at Tudor Pro Cycling)</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Men’s junior time-trial champion <strong>Lennard Kämna</strong> was something of a cycling wunderkind, particularly against the clock. As a fully-fledged pro, Kämna grew into a breakaway specialist at Bora-Hansgrohe. In 2023 he won at stage of the Vuelta to complete his set of victories at all three Grand Tours. Third place finisher in 2014 <strong>Michael Storer</strong> has also cracked into the top flight of cycling. He has a Giro top ten and a Vuelta stage win to his name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>American <strong>Adrien Costa</strong>, the silver medalist ten years ago, has had a more tumultuous story. The Californian podiumed the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-l-avenir-success\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de l’Avenir</a> and Tour of Utah in 2016 as a teenager, then moved to QuickStep as a stagiaire for a while but no WorldTour contract would follow. In 2017, he retired from cycling while at the Axeon squad. He decided to pursue his studies in Outdoor Leadership and Tourism at Oregon State University, however a rock climbing accident in 2018 resulted in Costa receiving an above-the-knee amputation of his right leg.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Women’s junior time-trial</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Macey Stewart, Australia (retired since 2018)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pernille Mathiesen, Denmark (retired since 2022)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Anna-Leeza Hull, Australia (retired)</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>2014’s junior time-trial champion <strong>Macey Stewart </strong>was a multi-discipline wonder as a world champion on both the track and road. With this, she signed for Orica-AIS in 2015 but would take a year out of the professional peloton to spend time with her terminally ill father. In 2018, the year following his death, Stewart returned to the Women’s WorldTour but would retire at the end of the following year with no further notable successes to her name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pernille Mathiesen</strong> of Denmark retired halfway through 2022 citing her mental health. In six years as a pro, Mathiesen rode for Jumbo-Visma, Team Sunweb and Cofidis, with top results including a podium finish at both the Madrid Challenge (the predecessor to the Vuelta Femenina) and the Thüringen Ladies Tour. In her retirement statement, she wrote, ‘It is now time to find happiness in other things in life.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for third-placed <strong>Anna-Leeza Hull</strong>, she now lives in New Zealand and has studied Clinical Exercise Physiology. After dabbling in the continental circuit, she retired from bike racing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Men’s under-23 road race</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-532596830-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"sven erik bystrom world championships 2014\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-532596830-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-532596830-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-532596830-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-532596830-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-532596830-2048x1363.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-532596830-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-532596830-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-532596830-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-532596830-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-532596830-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Tim de Waele/Corbis via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Norway played a blinder in the men’s under-23 road race, finishing with three riders inside the top five. This included the eventual race winner Sven Erik Bystrøm who broke away from the pack over the final climb to take the win. Some riders to finish outside the top ten included Mads Pedersen, Mike Teunissen, Jack Haig, Fernando Gaviria and Marc Soler.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The top ten</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Sven Erik Bystrøm, Norway (active on WorldTour level at Groupama-FDJ)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Caleb Ewan, Australia (active on WorldTour level at Jayco-AlUla)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Kristoffer Skjerping, Norway (active on domestic level as staff and rider)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tiesj Benoot, Belgium (active on WorldTour level at Visma-Lease a Bike)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sondre Holst Enger, Norway (retired since 2020)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Iuri Filosi, Italy (retired since 2021)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hernando Bohórquez, Colombia (active on domestic level)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ilya Davidenok, Kazakhstan (serving doping ban until 2028)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Silvio Herklotz, Germany (retured since 2018)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mathieu van der Poel, Netherlands (active on WorldTour level at Alpecin-Deceuninck)</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sven Erik Bystrøm</strong> is a slightly enigmatic talent at the WorldTour level. It was never quite certain what kind of rider he was – he was deemed a bit of a Swiss Army Knife and would settle into an all-round domestique role at first Katusha, then UAE Team Emirates. His only senior win has come in the form of a national road race title for Norway in 2020. Bystrøm worked closely with Alexander Kristoff for a number of years, and followed him across to Intermarché for the 2022 season, but moved over to Groupama this year, ending the decade-long tie they had together.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The runner-up in Ponferrada, <strong>Caleb Ewan</strong> was at one point one of the best – if not <em>the </em>best – sprinter on the WorldTour. Just a year after this race, Ewan would claim his debut Grand Tour stage win at the 2015 <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/vuelta-a-espana\" target=\"_blank\">Vuelta</a>. It would prove to be the first of 11 Grand Tour stage successes, including five at the Tour de France. Third placed Norwegian <strong>Kristoffer Skjerping </strong>briefly rode on the WorldTour with Cannondale-Drapac before setting for racing on the Norwegian domestic scene. Skjerping rode for Uno X before retiring from the Continental level at the end of 2019 and continues to ride domestically and is a sports director for the Lillehammer CK Continental Team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lower half of the top ten is padded out by some names that you may have forgotten about. <strong>Iuri Filosi</strong> was Italy’s promised hope around the mid-2010s, but only made it as far as the ProTeam level with Bardiani. He rode the 2016 <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/giro-ditalia\" target=\"_blank\">Giro d’Italia</a>, but later retired with the team in 2021. Seventh place <strong>Hernando Bohórquez</strong> of Colombia rode the 2017 Vuelta for Manzana Postobon. He was then picked up by Astana for two seasons, but has fallen out of the pro peloton since then. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After him, we find Kazakh <strong>Ilya Davidenok</strong>, who has had an interesting career, let’s say. A couple of weeks after this race, Davidenok tested positive for anabolic androgenic steroids. This resulted in a two-year suspension, ending his newly signed contract with Astana’s WorldTour team. When he returned, Davidenok was dodged by all WorldTour teams and instead had to make do with dominating central and east Asian races. He would later receive another doping ban in 2021 after an adverse sample from the 2019 Tour of Fuzhou was found. This would be retrospectively applied from 2019 up until 2028. According to his LinkedIn profile, Davidenok is now a fitness trainer in Kazakhstan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Silvio Herklotz</strong> was a much-promised German talent. Bora-Hangrohe picked him up, but an early retirement was forced upon him by a lyme’s disease diagnosis. He now works in business. Rounding out the top ten is <strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/mathieu-van-der-poel\" target=\"_blank\">Mathieu van der Poel</a></strong>, who needs no further desription, as we’re sure you’re all aware of his future exploits and wardrobes filled with rainbow jerseys.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Women’s junior road race</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-532595906-min-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"amalie dideriksen wins\n\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-532595906-min-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-532595906-min-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-532595906-min-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-532595906-min-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-532595906-min-2048x1363.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-532595906-min-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-532595906-min-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-532595906-min-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-532595906-min-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-532595906-min-350x233.jpg 350w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The junior women’s race would be the only road race for the female youngsters. There wasn’t – and there still isn’t – an under-23 women’s race. Regardless, Kim Le Court, Alexandra Manly and Katia Ragusa all participated alongside some big names who finished in the day’s top ten. Yes, unlike in the men’s race, this top ten is stacked with riders currently at their A-game in the women’s sport. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The top ten</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Amelie Dideriksen, Denmark (active on WorldTour level at Uno X)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sofia Bertizzolo, Italy (active on WorldTour level at UAE Team ADQ)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Agnieszka Skalniak-Sójka, Poland (active on WorldTour level Canyon-SRAM)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Nikola Nosková, Czech Republic (active on Continental level at Cofidis)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Lisa Klein, Germany (active on WorldTour level at Lidl-Trek)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Greta Richioud, France (active on Continental level at Cynisca Cycling)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jeanne Korevaar, Netherlands (active on WorldTour level at Liv-AlUla-Jayco)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Jelena Erić, Serbia (active on WorldTour level at Movistar)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Saartje Vandenbroucke, Belgium (active on domestic level)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mathilde Cartal, France (retired)</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Amelie Dideriksen</strong> was a real wunderkind in the women’s peloton. By the time the World Championships in 2014 rolled around, she was already the Danish national road champion at the elite level. For context, she was 18 years old at the time. Dideriksen’s sprint victory in Ponferrada spelled great things to come, and she went on to take a surprise victory at the 2016 World Championships in the women’s road race. This catapulted her to stratospheric levels, but she never quite lived up to the hype once expected of her as an early-blooming rider and hasn’t won a Women’s WorldTour event since 2018. That said, she is still on the Women’s WorldTour and has just signed a new contract with Cofidis for the years to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The silver medal went to UAE Team ADQ’s <strong>Sofia Bertizzolo</strong>, a stage winner on last year’s Tour de Romandie Féminin. The Italian has also finished on the podium of women’s quasi-Monument Trofeo Alfredo Binda. Bronze medallist from ten years ago, <strong>Agnieszka Skalniak-Sójka</strong> has a handful of wins to her name. She also rode in support of her countrywoman and teammate Kasia Niewiadoma at the recent <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-femmes-2024-gallery\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de France Femmes</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just off the podium in the junior race a decade ago, Czech rider <strong>Nikola Nosková</strong> is still kicking about at the top level of cycling. She hasn’t won a race outside of the Czech Republic since 2017, but she was briefly picked up by SD Worx in 2021 and the cursed Zaaf project in 2023. She now rides for Cofidis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lisa Klein</strong> is perhaps the most recognisable name on this list. The Lidl-Trek rider since won two Baloise Ladies Tour titles and became a real staple of the Women’s WorldTour towards the end of the 2010s and early 2020s. Seventh place <strong>Jeanne Korevaar</strong> is a solid helper with one Belgium Tour victory to her name while Serbia’s <strong>Jelena Erić</strong> has won two stages of the Baloise Ladies Tour as well as 17 Serbian national titles in both the elite road race and time-trial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Saartje Vandenbroucke</strong> was Belgium’s highest finisher in this race, but she hasn’t raced on the WorldTour since 2019. Tenth placed <strong>Mathilde Cartal</strong>, on the other hand, doesn’t have a single pro result <a href=\"https://firstcycling.com/rider.php?r=142738\" target=\"_blank\">registered online</a> since early 2015.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Men’s junior road race</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-532597136-970x646.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-532597136-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-532597136-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-532597136-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-532597136-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-532597136-2048x1363.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-532597136-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-532597136-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-532597136-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-532597136-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-532597136-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Tim de Waele/Corbis via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The men’s junior road race was open to riders under the age of 19. In 2014, Stevie Williams, Eddie Dunbar, Dani Martínez, Michael Storer and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cyclist-magazine-podcast-episode-15-jai-hindleys-giro-ditalia\" target=\"_blank\">Jai Hindley</a> all took part in the race, however none of them cracked the top ten despite their WorldTour pedigree these days. Instead, a young German by the name of Jonas Bokeloh outsprinted the pack in a hectic rush to the line after the breakaway was caught just 1km from the finish line.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The top ten</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Jonas Bokeloh, Germany (retired since 2019)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Alexandr Kulikovskiy, Russia (retired since 2020)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Peter Lenderink, Netherlands (retired since 2018)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Edoardo Affini, Italy (active on WorldTour level at Visma-Lease a Bike)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Magnus Bak Klaris, Denmark (active on Continental level at Airtox-Carl Ras)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Izidor Penko, Slovenia (retired since 2018)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Lucas Eriksson, Sweden (active on ProTeam level at Tudor Pro Cycling)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Lorenzo Fortunato, Italy (active on WorldTour level at Astana Qazaqstan)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Léo Danès, France (active on Continental level at CIC U Nantes Atlantique)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sjoerd Bax, Netehrlands (arrive on WorldTour level at UAE Team Emirates)</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Frankfurter <strong>Jonas Bokeloh</strong> was just 18 when he took the junior title, continuing a German gold rush at the 2014 championships. After winning the rainbow bands, Bokeloh moved to SEG Racing, one of the most promising development teams of the 2010s. For context, the team also brought through Fabio Jakobsen, Kaden Groves, Jordi Meeus and Alberto Dainese during its prime years. Bokeloh didn’t quite hit the ground running at the elite level, however. He only scored two wins following his year in the rainbow jersey, one at the Baltic Chain Tour and one at the Trofej Umag. The German eventually retired halfway through the 2019 season while at the third-division Team Hrinkow Advarics Cycleang squad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second and third placed finishers, Russia’s <strong>Alexandr Kulikovskiy</strong> and Dutchman <strong>Peter Lenderink</strong>, have also both retired, in 2020 and 2018 respectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fourth, we have <strong>Edoardo Affini</strong>, a more familiar name to many. Now a mainstay at Visma-Lease a Bike, Affini is the newly crowned European time-trial champion. The Italian has been up there in Grand Tour stages and has supported some of the biggest riders in the world en route to WorldTour success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Behind him in Ponferrada ten years ago was Denmark’s <strong>Magnus Bak Klaris</strong>. Also swept up by SEG Racing after his stellar 2014 season, Klaris never quite reached the highs expected of him. A junior Paris-Roubaix winner, the Dane’s best results at the elite level have come this year with a top five overall at the Tour of Istanbul. At least he’s still riding, unlike the podium finishers. You can find him at the Airtox-Carl Ras team nowadays.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rest of the top ten is a mix of current pros and some talents that never quite broke through. Slovenia’s <strong>Izidor Penko</strong> retired in 2018 just after winning a medal in the under-23 category at the European Championships.<strong> Lucas Eriksson</strong> currently rides for Tudor Pro Cycling and rode Strade Bianche earlier this year. <strong>Lorenzo Fortunato</strong> is the only Grand Tour stage winner in this top ten, while <strong>Léo Danès</strong> now rides for a domestic French team sponsored by supermarket Super U. Rounding out the top ten is<strong> Sjoerd Bax</strong> who rode as domestique for Tadej Pogačar at the 2023 Tour of Flanders and has just <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cycling-transfer-rumours\" target=\"_blank\">signed with ProTeam Q36.5 for next year</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/how-to-watch-uci-world-championships-road-race\">How to watch the UCI World Championships road races 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/2024-tour-de-l-avenir-riders\">Who are the rising stars to watch at the Tour de l’Avenir 2024?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cat-ferguson-interview\">‘I’m just excited to race my bike for a living’: Cat Ferguson interview</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-l-avenir-success\">Is winning the Tour de l’Avenir actually indicative of future success?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/where-are-they-now-2014-world-championships\">Where are the rising stars of the 2014 UCI World Championships now?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Ewan Wilson &#124; Staff Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"cbc32fa37e26414073ca599f3032658e41b92c055cde81aed7f565e9b2c21da5","category":"Cycling"}
