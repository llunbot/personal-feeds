{"title":"Putin Rival Alexei Navalny Dies in Siberian Prison","link":"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/02/16/alexei-navalny-dies-russia-putin/","date":1708120199000,"content":"\n<p>Robyn Dixon, David M. Herszenhorn, and Catherine Belton, reporting for The Washington Post:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, the defiant \nanti-corruption crusader and democracy champion who was President \nVladimir Putin’s despised nemesis, died suddenly in an Arctic \nRussian prison colony on Friday, penitentiary officials said, \nremoving the most prominent figure inside Russia willing to \nchallenge the Kremlin’s rule. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Referring to Navalny as Putin’s “nemesis” — which description the Post also uses in its headline — whitewashes just how despicable his attempted assassination, yearslong imprisonment, and now (presumed) actual assassination were. It’s a <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dysphemism\">dysphemism</a> — the opposite of a euphemism. Navalny was a political rival and staunch proponent of democracy. Putin was Navalny’s nemesis, but not the other way around.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>His death — foretold as almost inevitable, including by \nNavalny himself — sent shock waves across Russia and was \nquickly condemned by global leaders, some of whom joined \nRussian opposition figures in calling it a state-sponsored \nmurder. Navalny, 47, had appeared a court hearing by video link \nthe day before, seemingly in good health and with his trademark \nhumor intact. </p>\n\n<p>Navalny’s family and his team, who continued to run his political \noperation in exile, had warned that his life was in danger since \nhis arrest in January 2021, when he returned to Russia <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/russian-opposition-leader-navalny-leaves-berlin-hospital-month-after-poisoning/2020/09/23/3bac3e8c-fd6d-11ea-b0e4-350e4e60cc91_story.html?itid=lk_inline_manual_5\">after \nrecovering in Germany</a> from being poisoned with a banned \nnerve agent. An investigation led by Navalny and Bellingcat, an \ninvestigative journalism organization, had identified a team of \nRussian federal security agents as responsible for the \nassassination attempt, and his supporters noted that in prison he \nwas in the clutches of the very government that had already tried \nto kill him several times. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Until 2017, Navalny’s death would have been met with bipartisan, near-universal condemnation here in the United States. No more. But it shouldn’t be surprising that a political party that has <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/03/politics/cnn-poll-republicans-think-2020-election-illegitimate/index.html\">turned against fair democratic elections</a> — a party whose undisputed leader has, just weeks ago, argued in court <a href=\"https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/4398223-trump-team-argues-assassination-of-rivals-is-covered-by-presidential-immunity/\">that the president of the United States could not be prosecuted in court for ordering the assassination of his political rivals</a> — sees Vladimir Putin’s Russia as a model to follow, not an enemy to defeat.</p>\n\n<p>Nearly 250 years after the founding of our nation, genuine democracy remains a radical — and alas, fragile — idea.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/02/16/navalny-rip\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"93dae2d7730673702f705516805e91be64ded471d9735e671d6a7323076fafde","category":"Tech"}
