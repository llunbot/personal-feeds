Following a four-year wait, Apple reportedly plans to release an AirTag 2 this year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/AirTag-Backpack.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nA few months ago, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said Apple was aiming to release the AirTag 2 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/24/airtag-2-mid-2025-rumor/\"><strong>around the middle of 2025</strong></a>. While he did not offer a more specific timeframe, that means the AirTag 2 could be announced by the end of June.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBelow, we recap what to expect from the AirTag 2:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<ul><li>With a second-generation Ultra Wideband chip, the AirTag 2 is expected to have <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/15/airtag-2-longer-range-rumor/\">up to 3Ã— longer range</a> compared to the current AirTag. The chip debuted in the iPhone 15 and the Apple Watch Ultra 2. On the iPhone 15 and iPhone 16 models, there is a Precision Finding for People feature that can help you to find your friends in crowded places, and it offers a range of up to 200 feet/60 meters.</li>\r<br />\n<li>The new AirTag's built-in speaker is expected to be more difficult to remove, as a stalking-related safety measure.</li>\r<br />\n<li>The new AirTag is rumored to have <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/02/kuo-new-airtag-production-late-2024/\">improved integration with the Apple Vision Pro</a>, but there are no specific details about this.</li>\r<br />\n<li>No major design changes <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/24/airtag-2-mid-2025-rumor/\">or rechargeable battery</a> are expected.</li></ul>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn the U.S., a single AirTag costs $29, while a pack of four AirTags costs $99. However, the AirTag is frequently on sale on Amazon. It is unclear if the AirTag 2 will cost more, but it should remain one of Apple's more affordable products.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airtag/\">AirTag</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags-2/\">AirTags 2</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/09/airtag-2-release-date/\">When to Expect the AirTag 2 to Launch This Year</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/when-to-expect-the-airtag-2-to-launch-this-year.2447045/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3aab0aa4f9d1cb9c36ab5a226e959840ca11e91db5547a83139441c872116b4a","category":"Apple"}
