After their batteries are (hopefully) removed, the shredded boards pass through magnets, water, and incineration to pull specific minerals and metals out of the boards. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FR-4\">woven fiberglass and epoxy resin</a> the boards were made from aren't worth much after they're sliced up, so they end up as waste. That waste is put in landfills, burned, or sometimes just stockpiled.</p>\n<p>That's why, even if it's still in its earliest stages, something like the Soluboard sounds so promising. <a href=\"https://www.jivamaterials.com/\">UK-based Jiva Materials</a> makes printed circuit boards (PCBs) from natural fibers encased in a non-toxic polymer that dissolves in hot water. That leaves behind whole components previously soldered onto the board, which should be easier to recover.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1957869#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1957869&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"34017389912b4a82b7fc792f069c78a174380c8adb43a3978b90c5253cd47174","category":"Tech"}
