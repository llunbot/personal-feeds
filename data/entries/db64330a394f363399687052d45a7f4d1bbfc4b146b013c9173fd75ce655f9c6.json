{"title":"From the DF Archive: ‘Life as a Facebook Moderator’","link":"https://daringfireball.net/2019/03/life_as_a_facebook_moderator","date":1736299848000,"content":"\n<p>I mentioned earlier today Casey Newton’s remarkable 2019 piece for The Verge, “<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18681845/facebook-moderator-interviews-video-trauma-ptsd-cognizant-tampa\">Bodies in Seats</a>”, an eye-opening look at the lives of content moderators at a large Facebook contractor in Tampa.

The problem is that some people\nshouldn’t be connected, and some messages should not be amplified.</p>\n\n<p>There is something fundamentally wrong with a platform that — while operating exactly as designed — requires thousands of\nemployees to crush their own souls.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Holds up.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/07/from-the-df-archive-life-as-a-facebook-moderator\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"db64330a394f363399687052d45a7f4d1bbfc4b146b013c9173fd75ce655f9c6","category":"Tech"}
