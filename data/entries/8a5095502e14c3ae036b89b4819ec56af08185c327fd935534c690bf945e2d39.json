This led Apple to partner directly with Baidu, a Chinese company, to deliver ‌Apple Intelligence‌ features in the country expediently.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCiting two individuals said to be familiar with the situation, the report claims that Apple and Baidu are racing to adapt the latter's most advanced large language model, Ernie 4.0, to work well for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> users both via the cloud and on-device. Apparently, the models have had difficulty understanding prompts and providing accurate responses to common scenarios.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile Baidu wants results to be driven by data used to train its model, Apple wants it to provide a more personalized answer based on a user's ‌iPhone‌ usage. Likewise, the two companies have clashed over the use of ‌iPhone‌ user data to train and improve the AI models. Baidu reportedly wants to save and analyze data from ‌iPhone‌ users, but this is forbidden under Apple's privacy commitments. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe issues are particularly notable since Apple hopes to use ‌Apple Intelligence‌ to rejuvenate ‌iPhone‌ sales in China, where revenue has declined for three consecutive years due to heightened competition from local smartphone brands such as Huawei that tout a wide array of AI features.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUnlike its collaboration with OpenAI, which reportedly comes at no cost to either company, Apple is actively paying Baidu a fee to use its AI models and has agreed to cover computing costs.
