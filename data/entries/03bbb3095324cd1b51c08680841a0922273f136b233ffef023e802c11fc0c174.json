It helps with correct posture and uses functional movement patterns to maintain flexibility.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This 20-minute routine has been devised by Attenburrow to prevent injury, enhance flexibility, improve muscle strength and help to correct muscle imbalances. It can be done at home and doesn’t require any specialist equipment (if you don’t have a stretch band you can always use a spare inner tube). Nor does it require you to have any previous Pilates experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It’s easy to do and accessible to anyone,’ says Attenburrow. ‘My aim with Pilates is to build functional strength so you can go faster for longer. It’s easy to spot a tiring cyclist. As fatigue sets in their body starts to roll from side to side. In contrast, riders who are still moving efficiently will have their legs turning the pedals smoothly while their head, shoulders and body remain still and secure.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aim to perform this routine once or twice a week. You can shorten or lengthen the session to suit your fitness level by changing the number of reps for each exercise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It will take time for the benefits to become apparent,’ says Attenburrow, ‘but by rebalancing yourself you are eventually going to make yourself a more efficient cyclist – giving you more power for less effort.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n
