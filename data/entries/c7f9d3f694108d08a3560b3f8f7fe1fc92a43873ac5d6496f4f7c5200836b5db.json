But beta testers still haven't been able to use any of these features for themselves, even though Apple has released four developer beta builds and two public beta builds of all of these updates at this point.</p>\n<p>Bloomberg's Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-28/apple-intelligence-to-miss-initial-release-of-upcoming-ios-18-ipados-overhauls\">reports</a> that Apple still plans to release a preview of these features this summer, but the Apple Intelligence features will actually be \"later than anticipated.\" Apple Intelligence reportedly won't be ready when the initial versions of these operating systems launch in the fall—usually mid-to-late September—and Apple currently plans to launch them to the general public in an update in October, the report says.</p>\n\n<p>Gurman says that Apple will still have a preview of the Apple Intelligence features available for beta testers this summer as promised. But they'll be available in beta versions of iOS 18.1 and iPadOS 18.1 updates that will be released and tested separately from the 18.0 updates that are currently available in Apple's developer and public beta programs. (Gurman doesn't specifically mention macOS 15 Sequoia, but hopefully a 15.1 update with the Apple Intelligence features will be available for Macs, too.)</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039693#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039693&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c7f9d3f694108d08a3560b3f8f7fe1fc92a43873ac5d6496f4f7c5200836b5db","category":"Tech"}
