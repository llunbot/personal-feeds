The day prior, the Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) that greatly expanded the number of vaccinated people who could receive a booster shot. That set the stage for the CDC to determine whether the FDA approval should be adopted as formal health policy.</p>\n<p>A key step in the CDC's policymaking process is approval by its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). While the CDC director isn't bound to follow ACIP's advice (and notably didn't in an earlier booster decision), overruling ACIP is unusual. Given that ACIP has now voted unanimously to expand booster use to Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine recipients, the CDC director will likely follow its guidance.</p>\n<h2>FDA sets the stage</h2>\n<p>On Wednesday, <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-takes-additional-actions-use-booster-dose-covid-19-vaccines\">the FDA announced</a> that it was expanding its EUA for COVID-19 vaccine booster shots. Earlier this month, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/10/fda-advisors-unanimously-greenlight-moderna-boosters-for-people-65-high-risk/\">the FDA approved</a> Pfizer/BioNTech boosters for people who are six months out from receiving their initial doses and are at risk of exposure (like health care workers) or severe COVID cases (the elderly and those with health conditions). The CDC <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/09/cdc-director-overrules-experts-allows-pfizer-boosters-for-health-workers/\">approved this guidance</a>Â despite a split vote against it from its advisory committee.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1806546#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1806546&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1d84fbad9e65f1aaedb56cf086ea5115a6a0e32bdc47ed2ee2dc1febc8b28c65","category":"Tech"}
