The range has also expanded by 2 to 14Nm (the previous Range topped out at 10Nm).</p>\n<p>Feedback says it has also worked on the tool’s ergonomics and ensuring a shop-quality finish.</p>\n<p>The Range ships with 10 short 1/4in bits made from S2 steel:</p>\n<ul><li>2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8mm hex</li>\n<li>T10, T25 and T30 torx.</li>\n</ul><p>There are also three 50mm-long 4mm, 5mm and T25 bits, which should be useful for hard-to-access saddle mounting bolts or shifter clamps.

The brand doesn’t offer an in-house calibration service.</p>\n<p>Early impressions suggest the improvements make for a fine tool. The expanded torque range is appreciated because it means you can now torque Shimano crank pinch bolts and a greater range of saddle bolts.</p>\n<p>While it’s not quite as defined as options from Wera, Park Tool or Effetto Mariposa, there’s a noticeable click on reaching the desired torque.</p>\n<p>According to Feedback, each click of the rotating handle equates to 0.17Nm. The scale only features integers, with the gaps between them quite small, and you do occasionally need to torque bolts at decimal figures.</p>\n<p>The tool also has a relatively short handle compared to its competitors. This means it could be a nifty travel option, although it’s too large to carry with you on a ride.</p>\n<h2>Facom E-Protwist 16pc Screwdriver</h2>\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Facom E-Protwist 16pc Screwdriver\" title=\"Facom E-Protwist 16pc Screwdriver\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Facom’s E-Protwist is a pretty comprehensive electric screwdriver.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£149/$190/€173/AU$285</li>\n</ul><p>Electric screwdrivers can save time in a busy workshop and Facom’s latest option comes with a vast array of bits, producing up to 0.9Nm of torque. This makes it perfect for initial fastening and you can then use a torque wrench for final adjustments.</p>\n<p>The electric screwdriver charges via USB-C and is claimed to reach full capacity in 70 minutes. Five LEDs provide illumination.</p>\n<p>You get 16 1/4in bits:</p>\n<ul><li>PH1, PH2, PZ1, PZ2 and T10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 in 70mm lengths</li>\n<li>4/5.5mm flatheads</li>\n<li>3, 4, 5 and 6mm hex.</li>\n</ul><p>The bits insert into the tool using the brand’s ‘Quick Lock Mechanism’. Simply lift the end of the tool up and insert the bit, which then locks everything in place.</p>\n<p>The electric screwdriver is claimed to be IP54 water resistant and everything’s stored in a soft pouch. The pouch features loops for the 16 bits and there’s even a pocket to house the charge cable in.</p>\n<p>I’ve found the tool to be quite the time-saver, particularly when tightening stem bolts, and it even got put to use dismantling and rebuilding furniture on a home move.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Two new tools from Park</h2>\n<h3>Park Tool BK-UK</h3>\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Park Tool BK-UK against a stone surface\" title=\"Park Tool BK-UK against a stone surface\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Hats off to Park Tool for bringing out this upgrade kit for BKM-1 and BKD-1 owners.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£29.99, international pricing TBC</li>\n</ul><p>Even BikeRadar is not immune from <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/bike-supply-issues-when-will-the-industry-return-to-normal/\">cycling industry supply shortages</a>, with this kit taking the best part of nine months to arrive.</p>\n<p>Park Tool recently brought out its updated BK-M-1.2 and BKD-1.2 bleed kits, but if you own <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/park-tool-2020-tools/\">the original BKM-1 or BKD-1</a>, you can effectively upgrade it with the BK-UK upgrade set.</p>\n<p>Although the full bleed kits are pricey at £114.99 each, I’ve found them to be worth the investment. I appreciate the large number of adaptors that make them versatile across a number of different brake systems compared to a brand-tidy option.</p>\n<p>It’s also refreshing to see a brand offer an upgrade option for owners of older-series kits.</p>\n<p>The BK-UK contains six new parts, allowing for greater compatibility with the ever-increasing number of brake systems in circulation.</p>\n<p>The M4 x 0.7 gold adaptors are designed to work with SRAM’s DB8, TrickStuff and Campagnolo mineral oil brake systems. Correct me if I’m wrong but, as far as I’m aware, this is the second premium offering on the market for working on Campagnolo brakes, other than its own.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Park Tool BK-UK against a stone surface\" title=\"Park Tool BK-UK against a stone surface\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This little insert makes me very happy.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>Next, the thin-walled compression sleeve is not only designed for use with the internal bleed nipples on the latest-generation Shimano disc brakes, but also its older calipers.</p>\n<p>Shimano’s hoses of old didn’t have a particularly stable connection, with some kits featuring hose clips to keep them in place. It was incredibly frustrating when the hose would fall off the insert part way through bleeding a brake.</p>\n<p>Shimano introduced an integrated bleed insert on its catchily named ‘TL-BR001 bleed syringe unit’, which proved revolutionary and now Park Tool has brought out an equivalent.  The insert simply plugs into the caliper’s bleed nipple.</p>\n<p>The 11mm bleed blocks are for use with Hayes Dominion and SRAM DB8 brakes.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Park Tool IR-1.3 Internal Cable Routing Kit</h3>\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Park Tool IR-1.3 Internal Cable Routing Kit against a stone surface\" title=\"Park Tool IR-1.3 Internal Cable Routing Kit against a stone surface\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Park’s updated IR-1.3 should take some of the frustration away from internal cable routing.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£69.99, international pricing TBC</li>\n</ul><p>Specific internal cable-routing kits can save a lot of time from what can be a seriously brain-cell-depleting task.</p>\n<p>The IR-1.3 is an update to the IR-1.2 and includes five 188cm guide cables (down from 250cm) with attached magnets and unique fittings.</p>\n<p>The barbed adaptor threads onto the end of brake and shift cable housing, as well as hydraulic hose. There’s a rubber adaptor for holding electronic wires, such as those found on Shimano Di2 and Campagnolo EPS.</p>\n<p>There’s a Di2-specific adaptor for EW-SD50 wires, as well as an adaptor for the thinner EW-SD300 wires found on the brand’s latest 12-speed <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/road-bike-groupsets-everything-you-need-to-know/\">road bike groupsets</a>.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Park Tool IR-1.3 Internal Cable Routing Kit against a stone surface\" title=\"Park Tool IR-1.3 Internal Cable Routing Kit against a stone surface\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> All the fittings for everything you’d ever need.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>Like previous kits, the IR-1.3 includes a reverse polarity magnet to feed into the opposite end of the frame, so the cables can meet in the middle.</p>\n<p>As well as a guide magnet, you also get a double-threaded barb in the box.</p>\n<p>This is not a new design – SRAM and Campagnolo have similarly designed adaptors in their range and it’s particularly useful for attaching new to existing housing so you can just pull it through the frame.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the biggest update is the brand putting a round tool in a round container! There was nothing more frustrating than having to carefully coil the cables back up at the end of a day in the workshop and stuff them into the original rectangular box.</p>\n<p>I’m yet to test the new tool, but the old IR-1.2, in conjunction with Jagwire’s Pro Internal Routing Tool, are my kits of choice.</p>\n<p>I’d use the IR-1.2 for the vast majority of jobs but the short, flexible head of the Jagwire tool is appreciated when you have to route a cable or hose over the top of a threaded bottom bracket shell.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>A trio of tools from Pedro’s</h2>\n<p>Pedro’s has brought out three new tools – a hex key set, a bit-based stubby T-handle and a new cassette lockring tool.</p>\n<p>As is typical for the yellow brand, the tools are priced at the mid-to-high end of the market, appealing to both shop mechanics and the home enthusiast.</p>\n<h3>Pedro’s Pro T/L Hex and Torx Set II with pouch – 10-piece</h3>\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pedros Pro T/L Hex and Torx Set II with pouch - 10 piece\" title=\"Pedros Pro T/L Hex and Torx Set II with pouch - 10 piece\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Pedro’s is looking to reinvent the P-handle.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Kaden Gardener / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£118.99/$114.99/€132</li>\n</ul><p>Although it’s not brand-spanking new, Pedro’s has sent me its 10-piece metric hex and torx set to test.</p>\n<p>Pedro’s says the P-handle hex wrenches feature a new handle shape with slimmer profiles.
