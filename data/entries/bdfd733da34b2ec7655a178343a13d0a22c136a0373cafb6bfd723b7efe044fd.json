The second public beta comes two weeks after Apple released <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/15/apple-releases-ios-18-public-beta-1/\">the first public beta</a>. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/Generic-iOS-18-Public-Beta-Feature-Real-Mock.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nPublic beta testers who have <a href=\"https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/\">signed up for Apple's beta testing program</a> can download the ‌iOS 18‌ and ‌iPadOS 18‌ updates by opening up the Settings app, going to General, tapping into the Software Update section and selecting the ‌iOS 18‌ Public Beta option.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌iOS 18‌ introduces Apple Intelligence, which are AI features deeply integrated into the operating system. Not all functionality is available at this time, but it brings Writing Tools for rewriting, polishing, proofreading, and summarizing text across apps, and you can generate custom images with Image Playground. There are custom emoji available through the Genmoji feature, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> is getting entirely overhauled. Note that Apple Intelligence isn't yet live in the betas. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/ipaos-18-image-playground.jpg\" width=\"2150\" height=\"1210\" />\r<br />\nAlong with the AI features (which will be limited to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models and M-series iPads), ‌iOS 18‌ brings a redesigned <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/\">Home Screen</a> with the option to rearrange app icons and widgets with open spaces, plus there's a tint option and new darker colors for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-dark-mode/\">Dark Mode</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/iOS-18-Home-Screen-Feature-1.5.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nControl Center has been revamped and you can pick and choose what you want to have front and center from the new Controls Gallery.
