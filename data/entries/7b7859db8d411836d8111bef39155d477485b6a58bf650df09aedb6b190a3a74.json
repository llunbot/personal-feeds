The M2 iPad Air just got its biggest discount ever","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2502599/wow-the-m2-ipad-air-just-got-its-biggest-discount-ever.html","date":1730135180000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Black Friday may be one month away, but we’re already getting an early glimpse into some amazing deals we’re going to see then. Today’s bargain is the new M2 Apple iPad Air is on sale right now for its brand-new<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Air-11-inch-Intelligence/dp/B0D3J5WGD6\"> best price of $500</a>, a savings of $100 off and the best price we’ve ever seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We loved the 11-inch M2 iPad Air in our testing, giving it a 4-star rating. We appreciated the extra speed that comes with the processor upgrade, as well as the fact that the base model came with 128GB of storage space, which is definitely a more appropriate option considering how much space apps and pics take these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Unsurprisingly, the upgrade from an M1 to an M2 chip was noticeable in our test results. The Air M2 recorded CPU scores of 2,617 for single-core and 10,074 for multi-core in Geekbench 6.3, numbers which are in the same range as the iPad Pro M2 and significantly higher than those of the iPad Air M1. The same can be said of the Air M2’s excellent GPU (Metal) score of 41,902,” our review reads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Liquid Retina Display will deliver vivid colors and deep contrast for a perfect image. There are also 12MP cameras on this tablet, allowing you to take video calls when needed or snap pics of your pets and garden. And since the screen has a max brightness of 500 nits, you’ll be able to have tons of fun even when you’re using the tablet outdoors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Air-13-inch-Intelligence/dp/B0D3J7GPRX\">13-inch version of the M2 iPad Air</a>, you can get that model for a $100 discount too, with the 128GB version costing $700 right now. Other than the size, the two models are identical.</p>\n\n\n<span>Get the new iPad Air for $500</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Air-11-inch-Intelligence/dp/B0D3J5WGD6\" target=\"_blank\">Buy it now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"7b7859db8d411836d8111bef39155d477485b6a58bf650df09aedb6b190a3a74","category":"Apple"}
