It also includes ESR's \"CryoBoost\" fan and heat dissipation technology integrated into the charging surface to help keep your device cool, protecting battery health and letting your phone charge at the fastest speeds for longer.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nThe integrated 5-watt Apple Watch charger supports the same speeds as Apple's official chargers, including fast charging for the Series 7, Series 8, and Ultra. The AirPods wireless charging surface also runs at 5 watts, allowing for full-speed charging.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen it comes to wired charging, you'll find the two USB-C ports and single USB-A port lined up along the right edge of the device, and the power available to each depends on how many are in use.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/esr-6-in-1-station-2.jpg\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nThere are obviously a lot of possible combinations of devices, but in order to get 100-watt charging out of either of the USB-C ports, you'll need to have only a single device connected. If you're using any of the wireless charging surfaces, that drops the single USB-C maximum to 65 watts. And of course adding more devices to the mix will reduce the power available to each one.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA fully utilized charging station will be able to provide 40 watts to the first USB-C port, 20 watts to the second USB-C port, 5 watts to the USB-A port, and then 25 watts divided among the wireless chargers to maintain full charging speeds on those.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nESR is using the latest GaN technology for efficiency and to minimize the bulk of the charging station, and there is no additional power brick needed, only a removable 1.8-meter power cord specific to the socket type in your region.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://worlds-1st-apple-certified-6.kckb.st/0b82cd1f\">Kickstarter campaign is live now</a> and has already met its funding goal but will run through September 1. Shipments to the U.S., Canada, and select European countries will begin in October, as will sales through Amazon. ESR is offering a couple of discounted pricing tiers for the Kickstarter campaign, including a limited Super Early Bird tier priced at ~$143 and an Early Bird tier at ~$154. The retail price once it officially launches will be $179.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Kickstarter/ESR.
