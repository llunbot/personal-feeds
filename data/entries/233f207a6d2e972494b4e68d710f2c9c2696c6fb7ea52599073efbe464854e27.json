The new AI model is said to have more than ten times the computing power of its predecessor and outperforms leading competitors, including OpenAI's GPT-4o and Google's Gemini.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/grok-ai-logo.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nThe latest iteration of xAI's flagship model introduces new \"reasoning\" capabilities through two distinct modes: \"Think,\" which displays the AI's reasoning process while resolving requests, and \"Big Brain\" for handling more computationally intensive tasks.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAlongside the model update, xAI announced Deep Search, which the company describes as a \"next generation search engine.\" The new feature is designed to analyze information from the internet and X (Twitter) to provide comprehensive answers to user queries.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGrok-3 will be available to X Premium Plus subscribers, which now costs $40 per month, up from $22 â€“ the second such price hike in as many months. The company is also launching a new subscription tier called SuperGrok, priced at $30 per month, offering \"the most advanced capabilities and earliest access to new features.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMusk said that Grok-3 is designed to be a \"maximally truth-seeking AI,\" even when such truth might conflict with political correctness. The model has faced previous criticism for spreading election misinformation and having fewer restrictions on text-to-image generation.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGrok-3's reasoning capabilities are available in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/09/grok-now-available-as-standalone-app-in-the-us/\">Grok app</a>. In the future, xAI says it plans to add synthesized voice capabilities to the Grok chatbot and intends to make the previous version, Grok-2, open source in the coming months.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/18/xai-launches-grok-3-ai-model/\">xAI Launches Grok-3 AI Model, Claims Superior Performance Over GPT-4</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/xai-launches-grok-3-ai-model-claims-superior-performance-over-gpt-4.2449600/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"233f207a6d2e972494b4e68d710f2c9c2696c6fb7ea52599073efbe464854e27","category":"Apple"}
