The Radar for Icy Moons Exploration, or RIME, is an important scientific instrument on the spacecraft because its ground-penetrating radar will allow for examinations of the interior of intriguing moons such as Europa and Ganymede.</p>\n<p>On Friday, the <a href=\"https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Juice/Work_continues_to_deploy_Juice_RIME_antenna\">European Space Agency said</a> the long antenna remains stuck to its mounting bracket and is only extended about one-third of its full length. Engineers at the spacecraft's mission control center in Darmstadt, Germany, are working to solve the issue.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1935233#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1935233&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a7704f8f2e5c433fe7ee5e93773b5f495f900e1eed9c065ed7154bb241bc1a66","category":"Tech"}
