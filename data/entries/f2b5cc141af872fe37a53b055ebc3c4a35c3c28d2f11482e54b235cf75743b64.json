{"title":"FTC Lawsuit Alleges Adobe’s Cancellation Fees Are Illegal","link":"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/06/ftc-sues-adobe-over-hefty-hidden-fees-manipulative-sign-ups/","date":1718842084000,"content":"\n<p>Ashley Belanger, reporting for Ars Technica:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The government’s <a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/FTC-v-Adobe-Complaint-6-17-2024.pdf\">heavily redacted complaint</a> laid out Adobe’s\nalleged scheme, which starts with “manipulative enrollment\npractices.”</p>\n\n<p>To lock subscribers into recurring monthly payments, Adobe would\ntypically pre-select by default its most popular “annual paid\nmonthly” plan, the FTC alleged. That subscription option locked\nusers into an annual plan despite paying month to month. If they\ncanceled after a two-week period, they’d owe Adobe an early\ntermination fee (ETF) that costs 50 percent of their remaining\nannual subscription. The “material terms” of this fee are hidden\nduring enrollment, the FTC claimed, only appearing in “disclosures\nthat are designed to go unnoticed and that most consumers never\nsee.” [...]</p>\n\n<p>Because Adobe allegedly only alerted users to the ETF in fine\nprint — by hovering over a small icon or clicking a hyperlink in\nsmall text — while the company’s cancellation flows made it hard\nto end recurring payments, the FTC is suing and accusing Adobe of\ndeceptive practices under the FTC Act.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Adobe is too good a company to push dark-pattern subscription schemes like this. They should concede, apologize, and eliminate every subscription that isn’t a simple straightforward annual or monthly plan.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/19/ftc-adobe-lawsuit\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f2b5cc141af872fe37a53b055ebc3c4a35c3c28d2f11482e54b235cf75743b64","category":"Tech"}
