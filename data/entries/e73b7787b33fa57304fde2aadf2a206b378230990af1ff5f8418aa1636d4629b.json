Here are four key things to consider.</p>\n<h3>Lumens</h3>\n<p>We set a lower limit of 1,500 claimed lumens when testing mountain bike lights, which is more than ample to provide safe and well-lit shredding. You could get away with less, but how suitable that is will depend entirely on how fast you want to go and how technical the trails are.</p>\n<p>In the same way that claimed battery life, weight and a host of other things vary from their real-life measures, the number of lumens a manufacturer claims their light has, compared to how many it actually has, can vary significantly.</p>\n<p>Don’t fret, though. While claimed lumens is relatively important, what really matters is how that light is projected, not necessarily how bright it is.</p>\n<h3>Run times</h3>\n<p>The same goes for run times. In our tests, te timed each of the lights on their max setting to find out just how long the juice will last.</p>\n<p>Obviously, if the LEDs push out lots of light, more battery power is required. All of our lights have at least one-hour of run time at the 1,500-lumen minimum requirement, but most offer considerably more burn time at their max output, so it’s unlikely you’ll get caught short.</p>\n<p>Battery and LED tech is improving all the time, and although lights with dedicated, separate battery packs will last longer than combined all-in-one units, the gap between the two is narrowing.</p>\n\n<h3>Beam pattern</h3>\n<p>Light output isn’t the only factor to consider, beam patterns are just as important. Some lights project their output into one specific area, illuminating everything within that space with exceptional detail, but that’s frequently at the expense of broader coverage.</p>\n<p>Lights that flood their output illuminate more of the trail’s surroundings, giving a better sense of where you are and highlight details easily missed with a more focused beam. This wider beam spread means it’s easier to see around turns, too – something that needs to be considered if you’re not running a dual-bar and lid-mounted setup.</p>\n<p>Lights with multiple lenses or beam reflectors can combine spot and flood outputs, with the further option to toggle between them. In theory, lights with both beam patterns are the best of both worlds.</p>\n<h3>Extras</h3>\n<p>It’s also important to check out what extras are included with the light such as remotes, extra-long cables to connect battery and head unit, multiple mounting brackets, and whether they’ve got a certified waterproof rating, are shock-resistant and have battery or mode indicators.</p>\n<p>The lights on test range widely in budget, from around £130 to north of £350. Although it’s possible to spend even more or a bit less, with a 1,500-lumen lower limit this is the sort of price bracket you’re looking at unless you’re considering buying an eBay special.</p>\n<h2>Beam comparison</h2>\n<p>Scroll through the gallery below to compare the beams of the top-rated lights (each in its most powerful setting) from our 2019 and 2020 tests.</p>\n<p>While every effort has been made to provide fair comparison (our 2019 and 2020 images were shot using the same camera settings), these images should be viewed as illustrative of each light’s beam pattern.</p>\n<div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img

Beam spread is equally impressive, encompassing ample peripheral vision to attack the trail.</p>\n<p>An OLED screen displays current mode, battery charge and run time, and is complemented by coloured LEDs that indicate mode and battery charge.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/accessories/lights/front-light/exposure-maxx-d-mk13-light-review/\">Read our full review of the Exposure MaXx D MK13</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Gloworm XSV</h2>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Gloworm’s XSV is part of a larger light ecosystem.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Georgina Hinton</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><b>RRP:</b> £289 / $320 / AU$389 as tested</li>\n<li><b>Claimed max output:</b> 3,400 lumens</li>\n<li><b>Run time (max power):</b> 1 hour 50 minutes</li>\n<li>Long battery life</li>\n<li>Good mix of flood and spot lighting</li>\n</ul><p>With a great amount of power and plenty of range, the Gloworm XSV impressed us with its ability to highlight the trails as if it were daytime.</p>\n<p>The spot is fairly focused on the front of the bike, but it’s good power output means beam spread is okay (though not amazing) with the standard lenses installed.

The optics create a fantastic mix of flood and spot lighting, and side-to-side lighting is also great. The only drawback to its lack of pure horsepower is that the range isn’t amazing, but this is only a real problem when you’re going at top speed on fast fireroad descents.</p>\n<p>Battery life is impressive and although the mode and battery indicators are a bit vague it’s an easy to use unit overall. The big problem however is the price, it’s an expensive light and at this price point you might fancy a little more power.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/accessories/lights/front-light/light-and-motion-seca-enduro-with-6-cell-battery-review/\">Read our full review of the Light &amp; Motion Seca Enduro</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Ravemen PR1600</h2>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Ravemen’s PR1600 is well priced and good for less technical trails.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Georgina Hinton</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><b>RRP:</b> £130 as tested</li>\n<li><b>Claimed max output:</b> 1,600 lumens</li>\n<li><b>Run time (max power):</b> 1 hour 35 minutes</li>\n<li>Enough power to get you out on the trails</li>\n<li>Great price</li>\n</ul><p>For the price, the Ravemen PR1600 is an incredible light.

They’re connected using a cable and the battery can be mounted to your frame or stem with Velcro straps or similar.</p>\n<h3>Bar mount</h3>\n<p>All of our lights on test are bar-mounted. Usually the mount is tightened to the bars using an Allen key because head units can be quite heavy. Some lighter options use a rubber O-ring, while other systems have a bespoke ratchet strap system.</p>\n<h3>Lens</h3>\n<p>As the light from the LED and reflector shines through the lens it’s either focused or spread depending on the characteristics of the lens. Lights with multiple lenses will give a greater range of beam patterns, illuminating the trail more.</p>\n<h3>Waterproof rating</h3>\n<p>It’s a fact, electronics and water aren’t best friends. While most light manufactures have worked hard to avoid short circuits by waterproofing their lights, some have gone the extra mile and have been awarded an official IPXX (International Protection) rating.</p>\n<p>The first number ranges from 0 to 6 (0 lowest, 6 highest) and denotes how dust-proof it is, the second is the waterproof rating ranging from 0 to 9 (0 lowest, 9 highest). If you’re being picky and are worried about the sorts of conditions you’re going to be riding in then pick a light with the highest rating. It is possible to have a dust rating and no waterproof rating and vice versa.</p>\n<h3>Weight</h3>\n<p>With great power comes more weight. Generally speaking, if your light is putting out enough lumens to cast shadows during the day then it’s going to require more power to generate that brightness and last for any significant amount of time. Bigger lithium-ion batteries are heavier and if the light is bar-mounted then this is something you’ll need to consider.</p>","author":"Alex Evans","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"e73b7787b33fa57304fde2aadf2a206b378230990af1ff5f8418aa1636d4629b","category":"Cycling"}
