At the time, the space agency said the Artemis I mission had successfully met its goals and paved the way for humans to follow suit.</p>\n<p>This week, after carefully reviewing data from that Artemis I mission since splashdown, space agency officials reiterated that although there were a few minor issues with the flight, overall it bolstered confidence. As a result NASA's chief of human exploration for deep space, Jim Free, said the agency is targeting \"late November\" of 2024 for the Artemis II mission.</p>\n<p>During this flight, four astronauts—likely including a Canadian—will spend a little more than a week in deep space. After checking out the performance of Orion in low-Earth orbit, the spacecraft will fly into what is known as a \"free return trajectory\" around the Moon, which will bring them as close as 7,500 km to the surface of the Moon before swinging back.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1922492#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1922492&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"23e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"77f9df94c0c7dc8541f4b6abed71ec291cd61faea8d629ff9d3950","category":"Tech"}
