This beta release was an\nunannounced surprise. Prior to this, everyone assumed that what we\nwere doing was going to be a standard for-sale product where you\nsent off your $35 and then some time later got a disc in the mail\nwith a license key. That we just said, “Here’s our FTP site, come\nget it, go crazy” was, at the time, <em>shocking</em> to people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The thing that confuses people sometimes about new platforms is that while the platform and its clients are different things, you usually need both to be great for the whole thing to succeed. The World Wide Web, as conceived by Tim Berners-Lee, was and remains a remarkable, world-changing platform. But it really didn’t take off until Netscape hit. It was just such a great app, including on the Mac. It was the browser the web needed.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/13/netscape-released\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d2c0aa8fdea1d9e179f5820a67202575c2b5a39490ada81a82e787842014b215","category":"Tech"}
