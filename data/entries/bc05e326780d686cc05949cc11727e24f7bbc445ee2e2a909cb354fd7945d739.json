A packet inspection device sitting on a cellular network in Egypt kept an eye out for connections from the phone of the targeted candidate and, when spotted, redirected it to a site that delivered the exploit chain, according to Citizen Lab, a research group at the University of Toronto’s Munk School.</p>\n<h2>A cast of villains, 3 0-days, and a compromised cell network</h2>\n<p>Citizen Lab said the attack was made possible by participation from the Egyptian government, spyware known as Predator sold by a company known as Cytrox, and hardware sold by Egypt-based Sandvine. The campaign targeted Ahmed Eltantawy, a former member of the Egyptian Parliament who announced he was running for president in March. Citizen Lab said the recent attacks were at least the third time Eltantawy’s iPhone has been attacked. One of them, in 2021, was successful and also installed Predator.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1970625#p3\">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1970625&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bc05e326780d686cc05949cc11727e24f7bbc445ee2e2a909cb354fd7945d739","category":"Tech"}
