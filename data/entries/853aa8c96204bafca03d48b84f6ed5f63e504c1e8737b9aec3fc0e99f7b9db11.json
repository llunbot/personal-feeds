but no one would’ve believed you. The first week at the Vuelta a España has been… interesting to see the least. Issues arose on the first stage – a team time trial won by DSM-Firmenich in Barcelona – when a later start combined with rain plunged the Vuelta into darkness. Defending champion <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/remco-evenepoel\" target=\"_blank\">Remco Evenepoel</a> (Soudal-QuickStep) said they ‘couldn’t see anything’ and Lotto-Dstny’s Thomas De Gendt revealed to CPA (Cyclistes Professionnels Associés – the riders’ union) president Adam Hansen that riders had to take a 6km trip through heavy traffic and without lights back to the team buses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The heavy rain continued on Stage 2. Initially, organisers planned to take GC times from the summit of the Category 3 ascent to Montjuic, around 4km from the finish line to essentially neutralise a potentially dangerous descent. But rider protests prevailed and the marker for GC times was moved to 9km to go, cutting out the final climb completely for GC timings. But how exactly were commissaires taking times at this section? By asking for videos on fans’ phones to see when the riders passed through. Now that’s the kind of professionalism you expect from a longstanding WorldTour race. </p>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><p>Confusión para conocer el orden de paso en el punto bonificado. El comisario de carrera pregunta a aficionados si han grabado la llegada de los ciclistas. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/LaVuelta23?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">#LaVuelta23</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/CMca3ASPJy\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/CMca3ASPJy</a></p>— Raúl Banqueri (@raulbanqueri) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/raulbanqueri/status/1695826032136261855?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">August 27, 2023</a></blockquote> </div>\n\n\n\n<p>To make it even worse, tacks had also been thrown into the road on Stage 2. Juan Ayuso (UAE Team Emirates) was rightfully frustrated, saying: ‘I want to say thank you to this person for being an idiot and I wish the same thing happens to him what he wished for us. I wish him worse.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn’t end there. The National Police Corps in Spain arrested four people in connection with a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/2023-pro-cycling-vuelta-espana-1\" target=\"_blank\">plan to pour 400 litres of oil onto the peloton</a> from a bridge during Stage 3. At that day’s finish in Andorra, Remco Evenepoel won ahead of Jumbo-Visma’s Jonas Vingegaard and very briefly celebrated before crashing into the press officer of the Andorran police force. His head was left covered in blood, which was then washed away to thankfully reveal a much smaller cut on his forehead. All of this, plus the mud and gravel that forced organisers to take timings from 50m outside the 2km mark on Stage 9 and rest day flights being redirected due to bad weather, and you can begin to see how chaotic this year’s Vuelta has been so far. Hopefully there won’t be too much disturbance in the second week…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>GC Kuss</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/GettyImages-1655022099-970x647.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/GettyImages-1655022099-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/GettyImages-1655022099-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/GettyImages-1655022099-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/GettyImages-1655022099-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/GettyImages-1655022099-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/GettyImages-1655022099-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/GettyImages-1655022099-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/GettyImages-1655022099-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/GettyImages-1655022099.jpg 1417w\" /><figcaption>Tim de Waele/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A Jumbo-Visma rider in the red jersey and it’s not <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/primoz-roglic\" target=\"_blank\">Primož Roglič</a> or <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/jonas-vingegaard\" target=\"_blank\">Jonas Vingegaard</a>? Yes, superdomestique Sepp Kuss has been making headlines for his stint atop the general classification as he became the first American in a decade to wear the leader’s jersey at a Grand Tour. The last was Chris Horner in 2013, when he won it aged 41.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kuss got himself in a big breakaway and rode away from his rivals to win on Stage 6, high-fiving fans across the line, and rode his way into red on Stage 8. It’s a great achievement for a man who is always in the service of others. Kuss has taken part in all three Grand Tours this year and played an essential part in Roglič and Vingegaard winning the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/giro-ditalia\" target=\"_blank\">Giro d’Italia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tour-de-france\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de France</a> respectively. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Lennard Kämna completes Grand Tour set</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/lennard-kamna-vuelta-win-2023-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"cyclist in green and red celebrates winning race\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/lennard-kamna-vuelta-win-2023-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/lennard-kamna-vuelta-win-2023-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/lennard-kamna-vuelta-win-2023-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/lennard-kamna-vuelta-win-2023-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/lennard-kamna-vuelta-win-2023-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/lennard-kamna-vuelta-win-2023-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/lennard-kamna-vuelta-win-2023-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/lennard-kamna-vuelta-win-2023-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/lennard-kamna-vuelta-win-2023-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/lennard-kamna-vuelta-win-2023-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Alexander Hassenstein/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of all three Grand Tours, Lennard Kämna (Bora-Hansgohe) became the latest rider to complete the ‘Grand Tour triple’ at just 26 years old with his solo victory on Stage 9 at the Vuelta.
