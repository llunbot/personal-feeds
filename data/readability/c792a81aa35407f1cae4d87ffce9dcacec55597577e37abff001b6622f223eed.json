Now, those Privacy Zones get a new name with Edit Map Visibility, giving riders more control over their privacy settings.</p><p>Essentially, you’ll now have the ability to control the visibility of the entire map with three different ways to keep your location private. You can hide the first mile from the start/end of a specific location (same as the current setting), but now you can also hide the first mile of the start/end of a ride from any location for every ride, or you can completely hide the map of the entire activity. That last one will also hide it from the global heatmap or anywhere on Strava for that matter.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12132551/Strava-Privacy-edit-map-visibility-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12132551/Strava-Privacy-edit-map-visibility-1.jpg\" alt=\"hide your location on strava\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1200\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12132551/Strava-Privacy-edit-map-visibility-1.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12132551/Strava-Privacy-edit-map-visibility-1-297x297.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12132551/Strava-Privacy-edit-map-visibility-1-800x800.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12132551/Strava-Privacy-edit-map-visibility-1-120x120.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12132551/Strava-Privacy-edit-map-visibility-1-768x768.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12132551/Strava-Privacy-edit-map-visibility-1-696x696.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12132551/Strava-Privacy-edit-map-visibility-1-1068x1068.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12132551/Strava-Privacy-edit-map-visibility-1-420x420.jpg 420w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12132551/Strava-Privacy-edit-map-visibility-1.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12132551/Strava-Privacy-edit-map-visibility-1.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12132551/Strava-Privacy-edit-map-visibility-1-297x297.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12132551/Strava-Privacy-edit-map-visibility-1-800x800.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12132551/Strava-Privacy-edit-map-visibility-1-120x120.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12132551/Strava-Privacy-edit-map-visibility-1-768x768.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12132551/Strava-Privacy-edit-map-visibility-1-696x696.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12132551/Strava-Privacy-edit-map-visibility-1-1068x1068.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/12132551/Strava-Privacy-edit-map-visibility-1-420x420.jpg 420w\"></a></p><p>Note that hiding a specific address is also retroactive, applying to all activities past and future.
