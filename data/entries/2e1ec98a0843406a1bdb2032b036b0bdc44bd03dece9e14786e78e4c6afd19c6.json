Ad fatigue, only worsened by a trend that sees streaming providers trying to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/netflix-is-kicking-us-subscribers-off-its-cheapest-ad-free-plan-soon/\">force customers</a> into subscriptions <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/prime-video-subs-will-soon-see-ads-for-amazon-products-when-they-hit-pause/\">with commercials</a>, is understandable. We’re at the point where someone would rather use a <a href=\"https://carltheperson.com/posts/earlgreytv/\">broken laptop dangling off a TV</a> than be subjected to the watchful eye of the TV's native operating system.</p>\n<p>Earlier this month, as spotted by <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/software/linux/custom-linux-powered-smart-tv-breaks-free-from-ads-and-tracking-enables-ultimate-customizability-earlgreytv-straps-a-laptop-to-the-back-to-unlock-unlimited-control\">Tom’s Hardware</a>, a blogger named Carl Riis, who says he’s a software engineer, shared his DIY project, a <a href=\"https://carltheperson.com/posts/earlgreytv/\">Linux-based “smart TV.”</a> Riis’ project doesn’t stand out because it’s the most unique, clever, or clean. In fact, if you’re the type of person willing to pay a lot for TVs with strong aesthetic appeal, like TVs that can<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/18/24201121/hisense-canvas-tv-samsung-frame-price-sizes\"> look like artwork</a> or appear <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/lg-oled-t-is-a-transparent-77-inch-tv-that-will-arrive-in-2024/\">transparent</a>, you’ll be put off by the EarlGreyTV. The system uses an old Lenovo laptop that has a broken keyboard and is attached to a TV by a string. As Riis wrote: “This may look a little insane, but it has been a great way to keep things neat while retaining access to the laptop.\"</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/earlygreytv-back.jpg\"><img alt=\"The backside of the DIY smart TV.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/earlygreytv-back-640x378.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/earlygreytv-back.jpg 2x\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/earlygreytv-back.jpg\">The backside of the DIY smart TV.</a> (credit: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=836VlTPxnFc\">Carl the Person/YouTube</a>)</p></div>\n<p>The laptop is broken because Riis spilled tea onto the keyboard years ago. The keyboard stopped working, making it hard to turn the laptop on and off. “I have to short two specific pins where the keyboard connects to the motherboard. For this reason, I have the back removed, which probably also helps it run less hot,” Riis wrote.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038479#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038479&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2e1ec98a0843406a1bdb2032b036b0bdc44bd03dece9e14786e78e4c6afd19c6","category":"Tech"}
