This result is his second victory on Spanish soil just this August, bringing his career count up to nine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It’s been a long wait. It means a lot,” Bardet said after the stage. “I’ve been second too many times. Today I went full gas to be in the good break. I know that taking the polka-dot jersey it’d be a double victory. It’s fantastic.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After ending a three-and-a-half year drought on stage 3 of the Vuelta a Burgos earlier this month, Bardet is having a wonderful first year with Team DSM. It’s a move he’s described as “a breath of fresh air” after a nine-year spell at AG2R where he felt the pressure of being tipped as ‘France’s next big GC hope’. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After an <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/08/bardet-finishes-over-12-minutes-down-after-crashing-on-vuelta-stage-5/\">up-and-down start</a> to the Vuelta, Bardet – now a stage hunter – got into the 18-strong breakaway that escaped early in the stage. With the peloton happy to leave the stage to the leaders, the gap was over ten minutes by the first categorised climbs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2016 Tour de France runner-up played a smart game throughout the stage, staying out of the way until it mattered. He made a few appearances on the earlier climbs as he hunted down KOM points, but after helping to chase down a few moves, he made only a couple of probing accelerations before his last punishing attack inside the last 6 km.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I had a hard time catching the other guys in front of me because I had the feeling that no one really wanted to commit in the break,” Bardet said. “I think we played it smart with my sports director [Matt Winston] and he told me exactly when to attack on the steepest part of the climb and go for it as if the finish was there in front of me. I opened a good gap and made it to the finish.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Team DSM came into the Vuelta a España with just five wins in 2021, but they now tie with Deceuninck-QuickStep as the ‘winningest’ team at the Vuelta so far. Tour de l’Ain winner Michael Storer took both stages 7 &amp; 10, and Bardet brought the tally to three with Saturday’s victory. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Everyone is tired but the spirit is so high in the team, we’ve had three stage wins and a podium, so the morale is high,” Bardet said. “We’re all focused and I’m so happy to be part of a good group of guys. We’re enjoying ourselves and trying to do our best for the team. It’s an amazing Vuelta.”</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/08/bardet-ive-been-second-too-many-times/\">Read More</a>","author":"Kit Nicholson","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"ba35ef6cd8de0d890b7b792bc221a66618be47a9810a4918b65b55bd19ed292d","category":"Cycling"}
