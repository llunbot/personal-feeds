Seven years later, our attitude toward such driver assists is a little more sober. Drivers <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/10/drivers-woefully-overestimate-hands-free-driver-tech-study-shows/\">are often more confident</a> about such systems than they ought to be, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/08/from-rain-sensors-to-wireless-charging-the-10-tech-features-car-buyers-want/\">and that's when they even care</a> about such features in the first place.</p>\n<p>That said, Super Cruise remains one of the better implementations of what the industry has inelegantly labeled \"level 2+\" driver assists: in plain English, a system that lets the driver go hands-free for long stretches, as long as they're paying attention to the road. Which, in Super Cruise's case, is achieved via an infrared camera that faces the driver and follows their gaze, even if they're wearing sunglasses.</p>\n<p>Better yet, it's also tightly geofenced, as it's only meant to be used on restricted access, divided-lane highways.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/how-gms-super-cruise-went-from-limo-driving-to-lane-changes-and-towing/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/how-gms-super-cruise-went-from-limo-driving-to-lane-changes-and-towing/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
