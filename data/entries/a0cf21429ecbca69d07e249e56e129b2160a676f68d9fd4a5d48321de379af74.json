{"title":"Sebastiaan de With’s iPhone 15 Pro Max Camera Review","link":"https://www.lux.camera/iphone-15-pro-max-review/","date":1696548195000,"content":"\n<p>Sebastiaan de With:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I will not quit until I have shown you an inordinate amount of \ncomparisons between the main camera and its new, long 5× telephoto \ncounterpart. Not because it’s just fun to see how much it zooms, \nbut also to show you how differently you have to look at the world \naround you. [...] </p>\n\n<p>This has a funny psychological effect: once I shoot at 5× for a \nwhile, the Main lens feels... wider somehow. I’ve had to \ndouble-check a few times if I am not accidentally shooting at \n0.5×. I suspect that this is what led to Apple adding the 28- and \n35mm “lenses” to the camera — once you are going between such \nextreme ranges, the change is just a bit jarring. </p>\n\n<p>Is it a great lens? </p>\n\n<p>It is, hands down, the sharpest telephoto lens Apple has ever \nshipped. “Of course!”, you could argue. “Why wouldn’t it be? It’s \n2023 and technology gets better. Why wouldn’t it be sharper than \nthe last one?” </p>\n\n<p>Well, it’s a long lens. It is truly remarkable how nicely this new \nlens captures detail <em>despite that length</em>. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Illustrated with dozens of terrific photos. I had a similar experience testing the 15 Pro Max’s 5× lens: it requires an entirely different way of looking at the world. Consider my fingers crossed that this lens makes it way down to the regular-sized iPhone 16 Pro next year.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/05/sdw-iphone-15-pro-max\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"a0cf21429ecbca69d07e249e56e129b2160a676f68d9fd4a5d48321de379af74","category":"Tech"}
