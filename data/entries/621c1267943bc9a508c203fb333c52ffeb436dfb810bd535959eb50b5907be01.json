But amid the global public health crisis in 2020, the vaccination rate fell to 83 percent, and then to 81 percent in 2021â€”the lowest since 2008.</p>\n<p>According to a new joint report by WHO and the CDC published this week, coverage of first-dose measles vaccines recovered slightly in 2022, rising to 83 percent. But of 194 WHO countries, only 65 (34 percent) reached a target vaccination rate of 95 percent or above for the first measles vaccine. Further, two doses are needed to stop the disease, and the estimated coverage rate for two doses was only 74 percent in 2022, up from 71 percent in 2021. Overall, the gains in vaccination weren't enough to prevent a comeback from the highly contagious and sometimes deadly virus.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984844#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984844&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"621c1267943bc9a508c203fb333c52ffeb436dfb810bd535959eb50b5907be01","category":"Tech"}
