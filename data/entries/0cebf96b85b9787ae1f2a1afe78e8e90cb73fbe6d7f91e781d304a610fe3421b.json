The company is an offshoot of Selle Royal, a saddle manufacturer founded in 1956 and now regarded as the biggest in the world, with more than 80 design patents to its name and a proactive approach to new technology that means it should be able to enter any category it wants. But consumer perception is a funny old thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite a desire to enter the performance market, Selle Royal had become synonymous with recreational cycling, so its team knew they needed to rebrand. So in 1996 Fizik was born – or fi’zi:k, to give it its proper spelling – and since then it has become one of the most recognised names in cycling.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/fizik-one-to-one-custom-saddle-review\">Fizik One-to-One custom 3D printed saddle review </a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-womens-saddles\">Buyer’s guide: Best women’s bike saddles 2024, reviewed by women</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-the-best-road-bike-saddles\">Buyer’s guide: the best road bike saddles</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>‘The brand was able to hit the ground running,’ says Giovanni Fogal, Fizik’s brand manager. ‘We could leverage Selle Royal’s expertise to produce quality saddles while our reputation and image were being built. Selle Royal’s initial need for Fizik meant we’ve always been conscious of branding and marketing, but it’s all backed by manufacturing. Our HQ is probably a good metaphor for this.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-02-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Fizik insider\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-02-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-02-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-02-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-02-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-02-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-02-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-02.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>He’s not wrong. Situated near Vicenza, the industrial manufacturing heartland of northeast Italy, the brand’s premises are nestled sleekly among lush grounds. The building’s clean, angular metal frontage contrasts stylishly with the sprawling trees and jungly bushes all around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a similar story when you first walk inside: dark walls and bold decor is balanced with high ceilings and the clever use of natural light to create elegant, modern spaces. Yet go through some heavy, double-height doors and the facility’s beating heart is revealed via a series of gargantuan manufacturing halls. Style is subtly supported by substance.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-03-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Fizik insider\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-03-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-03-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-03-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-03-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-03-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-03-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-03.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Every module makes a different saddle model. They sit on a huge carousel that rotates, with different components added and production processes occurring at different points in the rotation.</figcaption><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h3>Technological progression</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The layout of the manufacturing space broadly charts the development of the company,’ says Fogal. Plenty of space is given over initially to the production of Selle Royal’s saddles. Subcomponents are carried in yellow boxes that move around the building on rails like a rollercoaster. They weave above and around walkways, converging on a carousel that contains a ring of metal ‘modules’. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every module moulds a different saddle shape and the yellow boxes get diverted to the appropriate module so that the complete saddle can be assembled. The setup has clearly been in use for decades; still perfectly functional but everything looks well worn-in. Rhythmic hissing and clanking provides a ponderous soundtrack to production.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-04-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Fizik insider\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-04-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-04-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-04-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-04-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-04-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-04-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-04.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Further down the facility there’s an altogether more refined collection of machinery. This system is more modern and makes Fizik’s saddles. It’s also more automated, and its parts move more precisely. Huge robot arms shift complex mould modules, each the size of a person, from one place to another to expedite production. The noises change from clanks and hisses to clipped buzzes and whirs. That said, human finesse is still yet to be mechanically outdone here, so the final assembly of Fizik’s saddles is often done by hand. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fizik’s operatives work with the efficiency of the machines we’ve just passed but can sign off on quality control at the same time. In one self-contained chamber, however, there is technology that outperforms even the most skilled human: Fizik’s 3D printers. 3D printed padding is seen as the cutting edge of saddle technology and Fizik is now taking it one step further by producing padding that is custom-printed to the individual (see box left).</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-05-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Fizik insider\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-05-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-05-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-05-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-05-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-05-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-05-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-05-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-05.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘Though we are a long-standing company, we are always looking to the future,’ says Fogal. ‘For example, these days sustainability has to go hand in hand with performance. We’ve given much of the roof space over to solar panels, meaning our factory can run off-grid for most of the year. Plus we now use recycled saddles in some of our more conventional foam padding, which I think is a nice way to close the circle.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ups and downs</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Fogal takes us away from the bustle of the factory floor back into Fizik’s front of house. In a cavernous meeting room he begins to lay out how Fizik got to where it is today, because while Selle Royal’s resources gave it an auspicious start, the brand has long since followed its own path.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Collaboration with teams and athletes has been crucial in us developing independently,’ he says. Fizik sponsors a number of WorldTour teams, such as Movistar and Visma-Lease a Bike. It was a long-time partner of Ineos Grenadiers (formerly Team Sky), and both Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome used Fizik saddles through most of their careers. Fizik’s Arione shape, introduced in 2003, is an iconic racing saddle.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-06-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Fizik insider\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-06-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-06-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-06-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-06-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-06-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-06-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-06-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/fizik-insider-06.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The brand’s success in the saddle game prompted it to delve into how every bike contact point interacts with the body, which led into developing its own shoes in the early 2010s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We had no industrial expertise to leverage this time, so it was much harder to start, but we had the clout by that point to recruit the talents and resources we needed.

Even at an industrial scale, 3D printing each piece of padding is a discreet process, so Fizik reasoned that each printing occasion could be made unique with little additional complexity in production.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fizik partnered with gebioMized, a German bikefit and pressure mapping specialist, which licensed the use of its pressure sensor mat – a saddle cover containing 64 sensors – so Fizik could gather the requisite pressure data. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fizik then worked with a software developer to build an algorithm into an app that translates the pressure data into a printing protocol. Custom padding, added to a best-fit base shape, should equal the perfect saddle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>• This article originally appeared in issue 156 of Cyclist magazine. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to </a><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\">subscribe</a></em></strong></p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/fizik-one-to-one-custom-saddle-review\">Fizik One-to-One custom 3D printed saddle review </a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-womens-saddles\">Buyer’s guide: Best women’s bike saddles 2024, reviewed by women</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-the-best-road-bike-saddles\">Buyer’s guide: the best road bike saddles</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/fizik-saddles-insider\">Best seat in the house: behind the scenes at Fizik</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"0cebf96b85b9787ae1f2a1afe78e8e90cb73fbe6d7f91e781d304a610fe3421b","category":"Cycling"}
