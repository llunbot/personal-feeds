The ViewFinity S9 can also be pivoted to a portrait orientation using the included stand.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/samsung-viewfinity-s9-4.jpg\" alt width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" />\r<br />\nThe ViewFinity S9 features a Thunderbolt 4 port, three USB-C ports, and a Mini DisplayPort, and it includes 90 watts of power for machines connected through the Thunderbolt 4 port. A removable 4K SlimFit webcam supports tilt adjustments, as well as Auto Framing of subjects in the shot, similar to Apple's Center Stage feature. Built-in speakers with an Adaptive Sound+ option to automatically adjust noise levels are also included.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBuilt-in Smart TV apps and a remote control allow the display to function as a TV without being connected to a computer, with support for popular streaming apps and the Samsung Gaming Hub for playing cloud-based games from Xbox, NVIDIA, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<small><em>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Samsung and Amazon.
