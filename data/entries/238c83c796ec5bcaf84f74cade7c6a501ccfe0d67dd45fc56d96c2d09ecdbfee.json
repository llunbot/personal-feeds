Fair-usage limits of 25GB of roaming data a month apply.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nBefore the U.K. formally exited the European Union, mobile customers generally didn't have to worry about roaming charges when using their phone in the EU, with most phone tariffs counting calls, texts, and data used in EU countries as equivalent to domestic use since 2017.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, when the EU trade deal was signed in December 2020, mobile operators were once again able to charge customers when traveling in Europe with \"transparent and reasonable rates.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nEE was the first operator to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/24/ee-charge-customers-roaming-within-eu/\">announce new roaming charges in June</a>. EE's charges go into effect in January 2022, and at first, only apply to new EE customers or customers upgrading their plan and contract from July 7, 2021. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOriginally, EE, O2, Three, and Vodafone, representing the largest mobile operators in the U.K., stated they had no plans to reintroduce roaming charges after Brexit, but all have since announced changes, some under a \"fair use\" clause. O2 allows a roaming limit of 25GB, with any data used over that charged at £3.50 per gigabyte, while Three has cut its data limit from 20GB a month to 12GB.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/\">European Union</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-kingdom/\">United Kingdom</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/10/vodafone-brings-back-eu-roaming-charges-uk/\">Vodafone to Bring Back EU Roaming Charges for UK Customers Abroad</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/vodafone-to-bring-back-eu-roaming-charges-for-uk-customers-abroad.2307069/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=oEwxIa4CThA:qQ6mViOGNDg:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=oEwxIa4CThA:qQ6mViOGNDg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/oEwxIa4CThA\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"238c83c796ec5bcaf84f74cade7c6a501ccfe0d67dd45fc56d96c2d09ecdbfee","category":"Apple"}
