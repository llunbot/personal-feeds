{"title":"The Bell Labs Holmdel Complex","link":"https://www.abandonedamerica.us/bell-labs","date":1689450696000,"content":"\n<p>Matthew Christopher at Abandoned America:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Bell Labs Holmdel Complex in Holmdel, New Jersey was created\nas a new research and development facility for Bell Telephone when\nthey decided to move operations out of Manhattan. Constructed\nbetween 1959 and 1962, it was the swan song of architect Eero\nSaarinen, who also designed the Gateway Arch in St. Louis and the\nTWA Flight Center at John F. Kennedy International Center.\nSaarinen died a year before Holmdel was completed and six years\nbefore the six story complex would be named Laboratory of the Year\nby R&amp;D Magazine. The outside curtain wall of mirrored glass that\nallowed in 25 percent of the sun’s light while blocking 70 percent\nof its heat led to the Holmdel Complex being christened “The\nBiggest Mirror Ever” by Architectural Forum, and the complex was\nused in universities as example of one of the crowning\nachievements of the modernist architectural style. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Architect Alexander Gorlin allowed me to photograph Bell Labs\nshortly before the renovation began. Much of the interior had been\nstripped to the basic elements and the plants in the atrium were\ngone, but the architecture was still mesmerizing. I had visited\nthe building when it was open many years ago but it was unfamiliar\nto me now. Many of the rooms were entirely anonymous after\neverything in them had been removed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Fans of <em>Severance</em> will recognize that stunning atrium immediately — this building serves as the set for Lumon Industries’s headquarters.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/15/bell-labs-holmdel-complex\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"0020b3c3629de6fb8313af6f5509b2680965fea3395cc30e121a593470754987","category":"Tech"}
