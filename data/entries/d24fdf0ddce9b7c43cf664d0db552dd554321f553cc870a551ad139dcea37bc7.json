So far, Europol has arrested 25 people in a large-scale ongoing probe called Operation Cumberland and confirmed that more arrests are expected in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/25-arrested-in-global-hit-against-ai-generated-child-sexual-abuse-material\">press release</a>, Europol said that the 24 arrests occurred simultaneously on February 26 after Danish law enforcement arrested a main suspect in November. That suspect is accused of running \"an online platform where he distributed the AI-generated material he produced\" for others willing to pay to \"watch children being abused,\" Europol alleged. The network was hidden from casual lurkers and required a \"symbolic payment\" to access, Europol said.</p>\n<p>While fully AI-generated images may not depict real kids, at least one <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/nonprofit-scrubs-illegal-content-from-controversial-ai-training-dataset/\">AI model (now scrubbed) has been trained on actual CSAM</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/07/ai-trains-on-kids-photos-even-when-parents-use-strict-privacy-settings/\">images of real kids</a>, so child safety experts fear outputs could potentially depict or resemble a known victim or actual child. And there's growing consensus globally that, in general, AI-generated CSAM harms kids by normalizing child sex abuse through the increased prevalence of CSAM online.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/25-arrested-so-far-for-sharing-ai-sex-images-of-minors-in-largest-eu-crackdown/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/25-arrested-so-far-for-sharing-ai-sex-images-of-minors-in-largest-eu-crackdown/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d24fdf0ddce9b7c43cf664d0db552dd554321f553cc870a551ad139dcea37bc7","category":"Tech"}
