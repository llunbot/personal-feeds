{"title":"Silo S2 expands its dystopian world","link":"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/11/silo-s2-expands-its-dystopian-world/","date":1731769769000,"content":"<p>The second season of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silo_(TV_series)\"><em>Silo</em></a><em>,</em> Apple TV's dystopian sci-fi drama, is off to a powerful start with yesterday's premiere. Based on the trilogy by novelist Hugh Howey, <em>Silo </em>was one of the more refreshing surprises on streaming television in 2023: a twist-filled combination of political thriller and police procedural set in a post-apocalyptic world. It looks like S2 will be leaning more heavily into sci-fi thriller territory, expanding its storytelling—and its striking cinematography—beyond the original silo.</p>\n<p><strong>(Spoilers for S1 below as well as first five minutes of S2 premiere.)</strong></p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/10/rebellion-brews-underground-in-silo-s2-trailer/\">previously reported</a>, <em>Silo</em> is set in a self-sustaining underground city inhabited by a community whose recorded history only goes back 140 years, generations after the silo was built by the founders. Outside is a toxic hellscape that is only visible on big screens in the silo's topmost level. Inside, 10,000 people live together under a pact: Anyone who says they want to \"go out\" is immediately granted that wish—cast outside in an environment suit on a one-way trip to clean the cameras. But those who make that choice inevitably die soon after because of the toxic environment.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/11/silo-s2-expands-its-dystopian-world/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/11/silo-s2-expands-its-dystopian-world/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"aff2b77bd6ff211eb85bb2fd573399dc95d864ce050602cb7ed1ecd6d23fb423","category":"Tech"}
