Unlike the ‌iPad Air‌, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> apparently remains abundantly available, which suggests that Apple might be planning to sell through its current stock even after introducing an upgraded model. Historically, Apple has managed its inventory to align with the release cycles of its products, reducing shipments of older units to make room for the latest offerings. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nExpected changes coming to the next-generation ‌iPad Air‌ include the more powerful <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> chip and an additional 12.9-inch display size option, while the ‌iPad Pro‌ is rumored to receive OLED display technology, the M3 chip, and new accessories. The refreshed ‌iPad Air‌ and ‌iPad Pro‌ models are now <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/07/gurman-new-ipads-first-week-of-may/\">expected to be announced</a> during the second week of May.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air </a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air\">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/22/ipad-air-stock-running-low/\">iPad Air Stock Running Low Ahead of New Model Introduction</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-air-stock-running-low-ahead-of-new-model-introduction.2424670/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"47583c4ddc9747c7d7b63d1b895d3878286875a5fb02b849a32ddeb68f68cd1d","category":"Apple"}
