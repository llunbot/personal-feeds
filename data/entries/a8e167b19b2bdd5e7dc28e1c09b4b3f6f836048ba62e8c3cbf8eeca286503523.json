The latest series of images, shared across X (formerly Twitter) and Weibo, depict the same one-to-one replicas but with a USB-C charging port.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe entire <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> lineup is expected to move away from Lightning and feature a USB-C charging port for the first time, and Apple is expected to bring USB-C to other devices and accessories <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/08/usb-c-airpods-and-airpods-max-2024/\">over the next year</a>. It is not clear if Apple plans to release a new version of the ‚ÄåMagSafe Battery Pack‚Äå with a USB-C port, but it is expected to do so with other accessories such as the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a>'s ‚ÄåMagSafe‚Äå Charging Case alongside the release of the ‚ÄåiPhone 15‚Äå models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<blockquote><p>All new Apple accessories will have to follow USB C standards, this means that even older models will be updated.

The transition will apparently be relatively fast, mirroring the transition to the Lightning connector following its introduction in 2012.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"They're going to need to do a new ‚ÄåMagSafe‚Äå Duo with USB-C,\" Gurman said, and Apple \"certainly can update the ‚ÄåMagSafe‚Äå battery pack\" to add USB-C. It is not entirely clear if these refreshed accessories will be introduced at its \"Wonderlust\" event on Tuesday, September 12, but the proliferation of images of fakes could hint that Apple is preparing to launch some of them next week.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<blockquote><p>mangetic wireless power bank charges <a href=\"https://t.co/BvWaxKOEzn\">pic.twitter.com/BvWaxKOEzn</a></p>‚Äî fix Apple üçè (@lipilipsi) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lipilipsi/status/1700491406589284687?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 9, 2023</a></blockquote> \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition, Gurman explained that an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/09/multiple-usb-c-apple-accessories-planned/\">all-new MagSafe Battery Pack</a> is in development, but it is not yet ready to be introduced. The next-generation battery pack apparently involves a new concept that allows users to \"daisy-chain\" multiple battery packs together by stacking them and wirelessly charge multiple devices at the same time. For example, it will be possible to charge two iPhones at the same time, with one placed on either side of the battery pack.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/usb-c/\">USB-C</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe Battery Pack</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/majin-bu/\">Majin Bu</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/10/counterfeiters-preparing-for-usb-c-magsafe-battery/\">Counterfeiters Preparing for Launch of USB-C MagSafe Battery Pack</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/counterfeiters-preparing-for-launch-of-usb-c-magsafe-battery-pack.2400972/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a8e167b19b2bdd5e7dc28e1c09b4b3f6f836048ba62e8c3cbf8eeca286503523","category":"Apple"}
