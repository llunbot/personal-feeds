The film will give us the backstory for Georgiou's evil Mirror Universe counterpart, where she was a despotic emperor who murdered millions of her own people.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/07/star-treks-comic-con-panel-debuts-teaser-for-lower-decks-final-season/\">previously reported</a>, Yeoh's stylishly acerbic Georgiou was eventually written out of <em>Discovery</em>, but fans took hope from rumors of a spinoff series featuring the character. That turned into a spinoff film, and we'll take it. Miku Martineau plays a young Phillipa Georgiou in the film. Meanwhile, Yeoh's older Georgiou is tasked with protecting the United Federation of Planets as part of a black ops group called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_31_(Star_Trek)\">Section 31</a>, while dealing with all the blood she's spilled in her past.</p>\n<p>Any hardcore Star Trek fan will tell you that Section 31 was first introduced as an urban legend of sorts in <em>Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</em>. Apparently Ira Steven Behr—who came up with the idea of a secret rogue organization within Starfleet doing shady things to protect the Federation—took inspiration from Commander Sisko's comment in one episode about how \"It's easy to be a saint in paradise.\" The name is taken from Starfleet Charter Article 14, Section 31, which allows Starfleet to take extraordinary measures in the face of extreme threats—including sabotage, assassination, and even biological warfare.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/12/michelle-yeoh-is-ready-to-get-messy-in-star-trek-section-31-trailer/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/12/michelle-yeoh-is-ready-to-get-messy-in-star-trek-section-31-trailer/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"180e2de2a0c1dbeea3001952718c63c9c5368c2ee1cf754366f56be8eedd90a2","category":"Tech"}
