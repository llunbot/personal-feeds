Google notes that locking your phone when watching in picture-in-picture mode will pause the video, but you can resume it by using the Lock Screen media controls.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/youtube-picture-in-picture.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nGoogle in June <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/18/youtube-pip-support-rolling-out/\">announced</a> that picture-in-picture support would be rolling out to both premium and non-paying YouTube app users in the U.S., but some people outside the U.S. have been able to get the experimental feature working, so it could be globally available. \r\n<br />\r\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/picture-in-picture/\">How to Use Picture in Picture Mode on iPhone</a></li></ul>\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, Google says the feature is only available until October 31. The company doesn't explain what happens after that, but hopefully that's when support rolls out to both paying subscribers and non-paying users, as originally promised. Whether it will still be available globally outside of its \"experimental\" context remains to be seen, though.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>(Via <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2021/08/24/youtube-picture-in-picture-iphone/\">9to5Google</a>.)</em><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/youtube/\">YouTube</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/picture-in-picture/\">Picture in Picture</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/25/youtube-premium-users-ios-picture-in-picture/\">YouTube Premium Subscribers Can Now Use iOS Picture-in-Picture: Here's How</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/youtube-premium-subscribers-can-now-use-ios-picture-in-picture-heres-how.2308599/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=HlzSGXT_0AY:ePmWFEc-YbY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=HlzSGXT_0AY:ePmWFEc-YbY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/HlzSGXT_0AY\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0d5f918bdb15d6e50dbcbd5cbc797d05fc24d7ab302a8cccaa4569443aaa319b","category":"Apple"}
