The agency is also losing $11.4 billion in funding for responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, which was largely doled out to chronically underfunded state health departments.</p>\n<p>This afternoon, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/cdc-public-health-susan-monarez-3f0d76219a02163b0c46ded0f3901d73\">the Associated Press reported</a> that five high-level leaders are departing the agency, which was announced today during a senior staff meeting. The departures, which were described as retirements, follow three other high-level departures in recent weeks.
