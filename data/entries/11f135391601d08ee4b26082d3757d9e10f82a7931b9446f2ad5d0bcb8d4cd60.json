Thus far, though, these competitors have all been missing one of the Steam Deck's best features: integration with the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/steam-deck-system-update-greatly-improves-older-lcd-displays-too/\">increasingly robust</a><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/steam-deck-the-comprehensive-ars-technica-review/\">, </a><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/linux-on-steam-deck-what-you-need-to-know-what-currently-works/\">Linux-based SteamOS 3</a><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/steam-deck-the-comprehensive-ars-technica-review/\">.</a></p>\n<p>That's finally set to change with <a href=\"https://www.ayaneo.com/article/806\">the just-announced Ayaneo Next Lite</a>, the first non-Valve portable hardware set to come with SteamOS pre-installed. We can only hope this is the start of a trend, as Valve's gaming-focused operating system brings many advantages over gaming portables (and maybe desktops) that run a full Windows installation.</p>\n<h2>A bespoke, portable gaming OS</h2>\n<p>Ayaneo's <a href=\"https://www.ayaneo.com/article/806\">announcement</a> highlights a few vague-ish features of the Next Lite, including a 7-inch 800p screen, a 47 Wh battery, and drift-resistant hall-effect joysticks.
