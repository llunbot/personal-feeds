The 6th-generation iPad mini sports a complete redesign with a bigger display, Touch ID on the power button, USB C instead of Lightning, and an upgraded front camera. This represented the first major change to the design since the iPad mini was first introduced back in 2012. The mini celebrated its 10-year anniversary in 2022 without an update, but a new iPad mini 7th generation is rumored to be in the works and could be here soon. Here‚Äôs what we know.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPad mini 7 release date: When will the new iPad mini arrive?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It‚Äôs been nearly two years since the 6th generation iPad mini launched, and, based on the dates when other iPad mini models have launched, a fall update for the iPad mini would make sense. But with the 7th generation iPad mini a no-show at <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/831417/apple-september-iphone-event-date-time.html\">Apple‚Äôs event on September 12</a> it looks like we will have to wait a little longer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Could we see the iPad mini 7th gen in October 2023? Possibly, based on when the last few models made their debuts:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668142/ipad-mini-6-2021-review.html\">iPad mini 6th generation</a>: September 2021</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/667891/ipad-mini-2019-review.html\">iPad mini 5th generation</a>: March 2019</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/667283/ipad-mini-3-review.html\">iPad mini 4th generation</a>: September 2015</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad mini 3: October 2014</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad mini 2: October 2013</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad mini: October 2012</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20230922VL207/digitimes-research-pc-ce-tablet.html&amp;xcust=1-1-678361-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">report in September 2023</a> from DigiTimes, which has a mediocre track record to say the least, claimed that ‚Äúa new small-size iPad‚Äù is due in the fourth quarter of 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, rather than October, a spring 2024 launch looks more likely. Even back in December 2022, respected Apple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1443654/ipad-mini-7-release-folding-screen-processor.html\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said the new iPad mini won‚Äôt arrive until late 2023 or early 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>(3/3)<br />Additionally, Apple is currently working on a new version of the iPad mini equipped with a new processor as the main selling point, and the mass shipment is expected to start by the end of 2023 or in 1H24.</p>‚Äî ÈÉ≠ÊòéÈå§ (Ming-Chi Kuo) (@mingchikuo) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1607714641987407872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-678361-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">December 27, 2022</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Although a tweet from <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/vnchocotaco/status/1686388141136257025&amp;xcust=1-1-2016929-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/2016929/ipad-mini-fall-2023-release-processor-design.html\">ShrimpApplePro</a> in August 2023, indicated that a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2016929/ipad-mini-fall-2023-release-processor-design.html\">7th-generation iPad mini is coming</a>. They mentioned it in the context of other products they predict will arrive in the fall. They said they would elaborate further and then on August 17 promised an update would come soon. We are still waiting for an update on the fate of the iPad mini. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>I‚Äôm seeing at least one new iPad coming. Probably mini 7. Will reserved that for the next post.</p>‚Äî ShrimpApplePro üç§ (@VNchocoTaco) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/VNchocoTaco/status/1686388141136257025?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-678361-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">August 1, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There are also rumors that Apple is working on a next-gen iPad Air and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1835319/14-inch-ipad-pro-release-specs-features-price.html\">iPad Pro</a>, possibly including a 14-inch version, for 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPad mini 7 price: How much will the new iPad mini cost?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The arrival of the redesigned iPad mini 6th generation saw a $100 increase in price over the previous model to $499. That price increased even further outside the U.S. including in the U.K. where the price increased another ¬£90. Here‚Äôs how the price of the 6th and 5th generations compared:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPad mini 6th generation: $499/¬£479 (Now ¬£569 in the U.K) </li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad mini 5th generation: $399/¬£379</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As the iPad mini 7 will be similar to the iPad mini 6 we think it‚Äôs likely that the price will stay the same for the 7th generation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPad mini 7 specs: What features will the iPad mini have?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You‚Äôll have noticed from Kuo‚Äôs tweet above that there is an expectation the new iPad mini will feature a more impressive processor than it does currently. We are also hoping for some small internal improvements. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Improved processor </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPad mini 6 offers the A15 Bionic chip as found in the iPhone 13, mini, Pro and Max, however, this chip is down-clocked compared to the one inside the iPhone 13 series. Here‚Äôs how that chip compares to the rest of the range: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPad Pro: M2</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad Air: M1</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad min (6th gen): A15 chip (also found in iPhone 13 series)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad (10th gen): A14 chip (also found in iPhone 12 series)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPad (9th gen): A13 (also in iPhone 11 series)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Kuo reported in December that the iPad mini‚Äôs ‚Äúmain selling point‚Äù would be the new processor. He elaborates no further, but it is feasible that this could indicate that the new mini could offer the A17 Pro, which arrived in the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1351959/iphone-15-plus-pro-ultra-rumors-specs-release-price.html\">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1487037/iphone-15-pro-max-ultra-design-display-camera-price-rumors.html\">Pro Max</a> this September.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, we think it is more likely that the iPad mini 7th gen will offer the A16 chip found in the iPhone 14 Pro and Max and this year‚Äôs iPhone 15 and 15 Plus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may be looking at the iPad Air and wondering if the iPad mini might get an M1 chip like that found in the iPad Air. Perhaps it‚Äôs something Apple might consider down the line, but the rumors around the launch of the iPad Air indicated that Apple‚Äôs reason for using the M1 was actually the reduced of availability of the A16 at the time, as per this tweet from Mark Gurman. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>Could also be another explanation for why the iPad Air got the M1 (supply). <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://t.co/lrvuVR0QkW&amp;xcust=1-1-678361-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">https://t.co/lrvuVR0QkW</a></p>‚Äî Mark Gurman (@markgurman) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1503060913527558144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-678361-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">March 13, 2022</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also a possibility that the next iPad mini model will offer an enhanced A15 like the iPhone 14, but we don‚Äôt think that this would be the main selling point Kuo refers to.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Increased storage</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On the current iPad mini 6th generation, the base model starts off with a rather paltry 64GB of storage. For a device like an iPad, where you can store movies, TV shows, books, comics, magazines, games, and a wide range of apps, that amount can often become a problem, especially if you want to take your iPad away on holiday or use it for your commute without needing to manage the storage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Apple has something of a history of giving base models low storage capacities, we think it would be a wise move to upgrade the entry-level iPad mini 7th generation to at least 128GB. File sizes are growing all the time, due to higher-quality cameras and software, so doubling the existing 64GB would be a very consumer-friendly solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along these lines, there‚Äôs also the possibility that the upper limit of the storage could be increased. At the time of writing, the most storage available on the iPad mini 6th generation is 256GB. Moving up to 512GB would be the logical step, especially if the baseline storage moves to 128GB.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPad mini 7 design: Will the iPad mini have a new look?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It‚Äôs been surprisingly quiet on the rumor front, which probably means the iPad mini 7 design will be largely the same as the 6th-gen model. Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôve managed to uncover.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Screen size</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPad mini screen was 7.9-inches up until the current iPad mini 6th generation launched in 2021. The iPad mini 6th generation screen is 8.3-inch thanks to the removal of the Home button, and this isn‚Äôt expected to change for the 7th generation iPad mini. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Folding display</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has been rumored to be working on an iPad with a folding display, but it‚Äôs unlikely to come to this model. In December 2022, Ming-Chi Kuo said that reports of a folding iPad mini in development were wrong ‚Äúbecause a foldable iPad will have a markedly higher price than an iPad mini, so such a replacement is not reasonable.‚Äù (See tweet above).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>ProMotion</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The screen isn‚Äôt expected to change from the current 8.3-inch, but there may be new screen technology. A post on a South Korean forum in November 2021 indicated Apple had ordered 8.3-inch displays from Samsung that support <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678043/next-ipad-mini-will-get-120hz-screen.html\">120Hz maximum refresh rates</a>. If true, the post on Clien (<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www-clien-net.translate.goog/service/board/park/16657430?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en-US&amp;_x_tr_pto=wapp&amp;xcust=1-1-678361-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">translated here</a>) could mean the next mini offers the ProMotion ultra-smooth scrolling feature currently seen on the iPad Pro, iPhone 13 Pro models, and 14- &amp; 16-inch MacBook Pro. This would address the minor issue of ‚Äú<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/677851/apple-ipad-minis-jelly-scroll-is-normal.html\">jelly scrolling</a>‚Äù that some users have complained about with the current iPad mini.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>I would be surprised since it is currently an a-Si LCD which isn't compatible with ProMotion. Only their Pro models support ProMotion as they use an Oxide LCD.</p>‚Äî Ross Young (@DSCCRoss) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/DSCCRoss/status/1541613225631895552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-678361-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">June 28, 2022</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it‚Äôs not looking that this particular rumor is accurate. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/DSCCRoss&amp;xcust=1-1-678361-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Analyst Ross Young</a>, CEO of Display Supply Chain Consultants, doesn‚Äôt believe that Apple will be giving the iPad mini a ProMotion display yet. He indicates that doing so would require significant hardware changes. This would require a ‚Äúwhole new level of engineering,‚Äù according to Young. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We remain skeptical of a ProMotion upgrade as it‚Äôs one of the main differentiators between the standard and Pro devices Apple sells.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Colors</h3>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.techadvisor.com/cmsdata/reviews/3809323/apple_ipad_mini_2021_review_12.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"iPad mini front and back\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>The iPad mini will likely keep the same design for several generations.</p></figcaption></figure><p>IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most obvious changes to the iPad mini 6th generation was the new palette of colors that Apple made available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While you can currently select between space gray, pink, purple, and starlight, there are several interesting hues available on the iPad Air when it received its new look in fall 2021, including silver, rose gold, green, and sky blue. It would therefore seem reasonable to assume that some of these make it to the mini. Plus now that the iPad 10th generation brought a bold selection of colors, the iPad mini may get a completely new palette. However, the iPhone 15 introduced an extremely light palette of colors so it‚Äôs unclear which direction Apple will go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We‚Äôll update this article as more details become available, but until then, be sure to read our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670670/which-ipad-best.html\">iPad buying guide</a> to see which models we‚Äôd recommend if you want to buy one of Apple‚Äôs tablets today.
