Lindsey and his team determined the optimal thumb distance from the center of the disc to increase launch speed and distance, according to a <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0229599\">new paper</a> published in the journal AIP Advances.</p>\n<p>Disc golf first emerged in the 1960s, but \"Steady\" Ed Hendrick, inventor of the modern Frisbee, is widely considered the \"father\" of the sport since it was he who coined and trademarked the name \"disc golf\" in 1975. He and his son founded their own company to manufacture the equipment used in the game. As of 2023, the Professional Disc Golf Association (PDGA) had over 107,000 registered members worldwide, with players hailing from 40 countries.</p>\n<p>A disc golf course typically has either nine or 18 holes or targets, called \"baskets.\" There is a tee position for starting play, and players take turns throwing discs until they catch them in the basket, similar to how golfers work toward sinking a golf ball into a hole. The expected number of throws required of an experienced player to make the basket is considered \"par.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/how-physics-can-improve-your-disc-golf-game/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/10/how-physics-can-improve-your-disc-golf-game/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f6a15c6b4594b5a92c2e1745d5abf11bbcd5502b4a561c7b9ccd93786df5f2f9","category":"Tech"}
