Apple is expected to announce watchOS 10 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/29/apple-announces-wwdc-2023/\">at WWDC on June 5</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/watchOS-grid-mockup.jpeg\" alt width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" /><div><em>Apple Watch mockup shared by @analyst941</em></div>\r<br />\nThe source claimed the new layout would be easier to navigate and have more iOS-like aspects, including folders for apps. However, they are unsure if the new layout would be enabled by default or available as a secondary option. The source did not share any additional information, but said they will provide more details soon.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn his newsletter last weekend, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said watchOS 10 will be the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/16/watchos-10-major-update-gurman/\">Apple Watch's biggest software update since 2015</a>. Notably, he said one of the planned enhancements for the Apple Watch is an \"updated interface,\" which would align with a redesigned Home Screen. Apple Watch apps have been organized in a honeycomb grid since the device launched in 2015, with a scrollable list view also available.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe anonymous source behind this rumor leaked accurate information <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/08/31/iphone-14-pro-camera-cutout-indicators/\">about the iPhone 14 Pro's Dynamic Island</a> on the MacRumors Forums before the device was announced last year. However, they do not have a long-term track record with rumors yet, so there is no guarantee the latest information they shared will prove to be accurate.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 8</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/analyst941/\">Analyst941</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/18/watchos-10-new-home-screen-layout-rumor/\">watchOS 10 Rumored to Feature New Home Screen Layout With Folders</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/watchos-10-rumored-to-feature-new-home-screen-layout-with-folders.2387142/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"51b4fdc327e6878bb5c4b8ee0174695c8baba48d4aa709ad110fe1cf25a0e144","category":"Apple"}
