{"title":"ESR Crowdfunding World's First Wallet With Built-In 'Find My' Support","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/23/esr-geo-wallet-find-my/","date":1721743660000,"content":"Last year, ESR was one of the first companies to launch a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/14/esr-halolock-geo-wallet-stand/\">MagSafe wallet accessory</a> with full support for Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/\">Find My</a> network, using an on-board rechargeable module to tap into the network of hundreds of millions of Apple devices to help you keep tabs on your wallet. ESR has returned today with a <a href=\"https://waymeet-limited.kckb.me/774f288a\">new crowdfunding campaign</a> for what it says is the first full-fledged wallet with integrated ‌Find My‌ support.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nAvailable in seven color options, ESR's Geo Wallet is a traditional bifold wallet with a thin ‌Find My‌ module that allows you to keep track of your wallet's real-time location via the Items tab in Apple's ‌Find My‌ app. While some wallet makers have introduced wallets that allow you to attach an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/\">AirTag</a> and other accessory companies have launched thin card-style ‌Find My‌ trackers, ESR appears to be the first to put the tracker right into the wallet itself, helping to reduce weight and bulk.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nESR says the battery for the ‌Find My‌ module in the Geo Wallet lasts up to five months, and with a magnetic charging cable the battery can be recharged in just two hours.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/esr-geo-wallet-specs-colors.jpg\" width=\"680\" height=\"705\" />\r<br />\nWith windowed slots for two ID cards, four additional slots for bank or membership cards, and a divided compartment for organizing your cash, the Geo Wallet also offer RFID-blocking technology to help keep your cards safe.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Geo Wallet is available in seven colors: carbon fiber, opal gray, elephant gray, twilight black, cocoa, aged leather, and tangerine. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs with most crowdfunding campaigns, there are <a href=\"https://waymeet-limited.kckb.me/774f288a\">multiple reward tiers available</a> with varying pricing. The $38 Super Early Bird tier has already sold out, but there are still some slots left in the $41 Early Bird tier, and if you miss out on those it jumps to $44 at the Kickstarter Special tier. Multipacks are also available.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs a Kickstarter campaign, the Geo Wallet is not available for immediate delivery, but ESR is aiming to start production in August and begin shipping in January, and the company has a track record of delivering on its campaigns.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<small><em>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Kickstarter/ESR.
