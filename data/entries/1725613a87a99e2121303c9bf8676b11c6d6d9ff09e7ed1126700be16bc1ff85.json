They were designed with 42-48 mm tires in mind, are double walled for durability, but slimmed down where they can be to keep them as light as possible. For rear spacing, there are two options: 130 mm and 135mm. The driver in each rear hub has 3 pawls with 3 teeth each that provide a nice, crisp engagement. You can also choose between a dynamo with Shutter Precision for $100 more or non-dynamo front wheel.</p>\n<p>Check out more at <a href=\"https://crustbikes.com/products/650b-rim-brake-wheelset\" target=\"_blank\">Crust Bikes</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/crust-bikes-650b-wheels/\">Crust Bikes 650b Wheels</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"1725613a87a99e2121303c9bf8676b11c6d6d9ff09e7ed1126700be16bc1ff85","category":"Cycling"}
