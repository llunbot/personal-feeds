For 2025, the brand’s classic models have remained mostly the same with a few minor part spec tweaks but the entire lineup of classic Kona models received new colors. Let’s check them out below!</em></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/2025_Kona_ESD_Colors.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/2025_Kona_ESD_Colors.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/2025_Kona_ESD_Colors.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/2025_Kona_ESD_Colors.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://konaworld.com/products/honzo-esd-36sr\" target=\"_blank\">2025 Kona ESD Complete: Silver</a></p>\n<p>The Radical Slacker – Kona initially built the Honzo ESD as a test case for the long and low geometry the brand was developing for the Process X. Most hardtails tend to be somewhat conservative in their geometry. The Honzo ESD is anything but that. Its cromoly steel frame features a head and seat angle that would be right at home on a modern long travel full suspension bike.</p>\n<p>Read our <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/kona-esd-hardtail-review/\" target=\"_blank\">review of the Kona ESD</a> in our archives.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/2025_kona_Sutra_ltd_Color.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/2025_kona_Sutra_ltd_Color.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/2025_kona_Sutra_ltd_Color.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/2025_kona_Sutra_ltd_Color.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://konaworld.com/products/sutra-ltd-36sh\" target=\"_blank\">2025 Kona Sutra LTD: Bone</a></p>\n<p>The Sutra LTD is one of those bikes that just changes everything. You thought you were a mountain biker, but you find yourself sneaking off on adventures and enjoying the drop bars on the LTD. You thought you were a roadie but find yourself absolutely destroying singletrack when no one else is looking and suddenly getting rad is all you wanna do! That’s the best part about the Sutra LTD—it broke the mold of what a bike has to be. It’s got bigger tires, burlier construction, and enough mounts to hold a horse. But who needs a horse when this is your horse?</p>\n<p>Read our <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/kona-sutra-ltd-review-2023/\" target=\"_blank\">review of the Kona Sutra LTD</a> in our archives.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/2025_kona_sutra_color.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/2025_kona_sutra_color.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/2025_kona_sutra_color.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/2025_kona_sutra_color.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://konaworld.com/products/sutra-36sh\" target=\"_blank\">2025 Kona Sutra: Pistachio</a></p>\n<p>The Sutra is many things. It’s functional. It’s stylish. It’s incredibly versatile, and it comes ready for the long haul on the bike tour of your dreams. Our Kona Cromoly steel frame is outfitted with a Brooks saddle and matching microfiber bar tape, integrated shifter/brake levers, proper fenders, and a real Tubus Tara Big Apple low-rider front rack. It’s a modern take on the classic touring bike. It’s a grocery getter that’s easy on the eyes. It’s the feeling of steel across pavement that reminds you why you love turning the cranks on long rides. Just like its name suggests it’s the perfect guide for your every ride.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/2025_kona_unit_X_color.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/2025_kona_unit_X_color.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/2025_kona_unit_X_color.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/2025_kona_unit_X_color.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://konaworld.com/products/unit-x-36sh\" target=\"_blank\">2025 Kona Unit X: Copper</a></p>\n<p>The Unit X has become a cult favorite among die-hard Kona fans. Maybe it’s the Cromoly frame. Maybe it’s the fact that it’s a bikepacking monster, or its well-geared 12-speed drivetrain, or modular dropouts which give you the ability to run it as a single speed if that’s your thing. Maybe it’s because the rigid fork makes it that much more of a classic.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/2025_Kona_unit_color.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/2025_Kona_unit_color.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/2025_Kona_unit_color.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/2025_Kona_unit_color.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://konaworld.com/products/unit-36tk\" target=\"_blank\">2025 Kona Unit: Tan</a></p>\n<p>If the Unit were to put out a wanted ad for its ideal rider it might look something like this: Cromoly, single-speed badass ISO someone to adventure with. It can be converted to a 12-speed if that’s your thing.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/2025_kona_rove_color.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/2025_kona_rove_color.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/2025_kona_rove_color.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/2025_kona_rove_color.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://konaworld.com/products/rove-dl-36sr\" target=\"_blank\">2025 Kona Rove DL: Tan</a></p>\n<p>You’re looking for a smooth ride across mixed terrain.
