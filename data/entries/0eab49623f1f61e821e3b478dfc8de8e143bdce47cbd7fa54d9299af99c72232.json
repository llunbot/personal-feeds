Core engineering, the Google Assistant, and the hardware division all lost people. The report says that \"Google said that most of the hardware cuts affected a team working on augmented reality.\" AR cuts are eyebrow-raising since that's quickly going to be one of the highest-profile teams at the company this year, as Google, Samsung, and Qualcomm <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/qualcomms-xr2-gen-2-soc-sets-up-a-wave-of-apple-vision-pro-competitors/\">team up to battle</a> the Apple Vision Pro. FitBit was apparently also a big loser, with <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2024/01/10/google-reorganizing-hardware/\">9to5Google</a> reporting that Fitbit co-founders James Park and Eric Friedman and \"other Fitbit leaders\" have left Google.</p>\n<p>Over the years, Google has rarely laid off workers, but since January of last year, a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/08/google-ceo-calls-for-a-more-focused-and-efficient-google/\">new focus</a> on cost-cutting has made layoffs a regular occurrence at Google. The purge started with an announcement of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/google-cuts-12000-jobs-the-largest-layoff-in-the-companys-history/\">12,000 layoffs</a> in January, which took until <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/employees-say-google-is-botching-those-12000-layoffs/\">at least March</a> to complete. Then there were more layoffs at Alphabet companies <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/waymo-hit-by-second-round-of-layoffs-has-cut-8-percent-of-staff-this-year/\">Waymo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/alphabet-layoffs-hit-trash-sorting-robots/\">Everyday Robots</a> in March, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2023/06/waze-googles-other-mapping-app-gets-hit-with-layoffs/\">Waze layoffs</a> in June, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2023/09/even-more-google-layoffs-this-time-its-significant-cuts-to-recruiting/\">recruiting layoffs</a> in September, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/10/more-google-layoffs-google-news-cuts-dozens-of-jobs/\">Google News</a> cuts in October, and now these layoffs in January. There <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/12/report-google-ads-restructure-could-replace-some-sales-jobs-with-ai/\">are rumors</a> of more layoffs happening this month, too, focusing on the ad sales division.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995278#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995278&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0eab49623f1f61e821e3b478dfc8de8e143bdce47cbd7fa54d9299af99c72232","category":"Tech"}
