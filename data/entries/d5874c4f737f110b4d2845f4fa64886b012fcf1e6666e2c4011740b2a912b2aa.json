It is the most matte display type that Apple makes, and Apple claims that it is useful for high-end, color-managed workflows or demanding ambient lighting environments.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌iPad Pro‌ is the first <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> with nano-texture as an option, and it's previously been reserved for the Studio Display and Pro Display XDR. Nano-texture is a premium feature, so it costs an additional $100 over the standard glass. It's also only available on 1TB or 2TB ‌iPad Pro‌ models, so you do need to shell out at least $1,600 to get it on the 1TB 11-inch ‌iPad Pro‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNano-texture on the larger ‌iPad Pro‌ will cost at least $1,999, which is the price of the 1TB model plus an extra $100 for the glass upgrade. It is an upgrade targeted at pro users and those with specific needs, and not everyone is going to want to opt for the matte design. The grippier texture of the nano-glass does feel better for writing on with an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a>, but if that's a factor for you, you're better off checking out something like <a href=\"https://shop.astropad.com/products/rock-paper-pencil\">Astropad's Rock Paper Pencil</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile nano-texture does a good job cutting down on glare, it does impact the contrast and crispness of the display, so it is serving a specific purpose for select workflows where mitigating light is important.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs with the nano-texture versions of Apple's displays, the nano-texture ‌iPad Pro‌ requires some special care. Apple recommends only cleaning it with the polishing cloth that's included in the box as other cleaning cloths can cause damage.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGiven the caveats and the high price tag, the nano-texture display isn't for everyone, but it is a good option for those who know they need extra help addressing glare.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/27/ipad-nano-texture-glass-hands-on/\">Hands-On With the iPad Pro's Nano-Texture Glass - Is It Worth the Upgrade?</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/hands-on-with-the-ipad-pros-nano-texture-glass-is-it-worth-the-upgrade.2430232/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d5874c4f737f110b4d2845f4fa64886b012fcf1e6666e2c4011740b2a912b2aa","category":"Apple"}
