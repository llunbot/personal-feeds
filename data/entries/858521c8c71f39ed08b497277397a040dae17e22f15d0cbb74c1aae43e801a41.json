The simple explanation is that an EV is driven until the battery runs flat, providing the number that goes on the window sticker. In practice, it's a lot more complicated than that, with varying test cycles, real-world simulations, and more variables than a book of Mad Libs, all in an effort to give you a number that you can count on to be consistent and comparable with other vehicles on the road.</p>\n<h2>The start of EPA mileage testing</h2>\n<p>The EPA started testing vehicle fuel economy in 1971, and that initial testing still plays a major role in how modern cars are measured.</p>\n<p>The year before, President Richard Nixon signed the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (followed by the Clean Air Act of 1970) and established the EPA with a mandate that included lowering motor vehicle emissions. Part of the EPA's plan to reduce emissions was to let buyers know just how much fuel a car would use so they could cross-shop cars effectively.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1987157#p3\">Read 59 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1987157&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"858521c8c71f39ed08b497277397a040dae17e22f15d0cbb74c1aae43e801a41","category":"Tech"}
