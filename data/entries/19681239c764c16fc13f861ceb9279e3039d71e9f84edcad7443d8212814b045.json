While it’s decidedly a faster, stiffer gravel race bike, those aero and integrated upgrades will be welcome for almost any rider looking to ride fast on and off-road. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve been riding the new Grail for the past month, and its stiffer race bike vibe has grown on me…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2023 Canyon Grail CFR &amp; CF carbon gravel race bikes</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Canyon-CFR-prototype-gravel-race-bike_FNLD-GRVL-Lahti-FInland_raw-frame-only.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Canyon-CFR-prototype-gravel-race-bike_FNLD-GRVL-Lahti-FInland_raw-frame-only.jpg\" alt=\"Canyon CFR prototype gravel race bike at FNLD GRVL, bike build raw frame\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Canyon-CFR-prototype-gravel-race-bike_FNLD-GRVL-Lahti-FInland_raw-frame-only.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Canyon-CFR-prototype-gravel-race-bike_FNLD-GRVL-Lahti-FInland_raw-frame-only-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Canyon-CFR-prototype-gravel-race-bike_FNLD-GRVL-Lahti-FInland_raw-frame-only-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Canyon-CFR-prototype-gravel-race-bike_FNLD-GRVL-Lahti-FInland_raw-frame-only-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Canyon-CFR-prototype-gravel-race-bike_FNLD-GRVL-Lahti-FInland_raw-frame-only-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Canyon-CFR-prototype-gravel-race-bike_FNLD-GRVL-Lahti-FInland_raw-frame-only-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Canyon-CFR-prototype-gravel-race-bike_FNLD-GRVL-Lahti-FInland_raw-frame-only-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption><em>all photos by Cory Benson, c.

Now you can choose from light gravel/all-road, fast gravel/gravel racing, and adventure gravel. And each with its own specific bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That segmentation has allowed Canyon to refine their new Grail for a more narrow audience, creating a bike that I’d say better serves those gravel riders looking to go fast. And if all-road is your bag, pick the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?s=endurace\" target=\"_blank\">Endurace</a>; or if you prefer adventure &amp; bikepacking, go for the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?s=grizl\" target=\"_blank\">Grizl</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Carolin-Schiff-wining-Unbound.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Carolin-Schiff-wining-Unbound.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Canyon Grail all-new carbon gravel race bike, Carolin Schiff winning Unbound\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Carolin-Schiff-wining-Unbound.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Carolin-Schiff-wining-Unbound-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Carolin-Schiff-wining-Unbound-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Carolin-Schiff-wining-Unbound-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Carolin-Schiff-wining-Unbound-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Carolin-Schiff-wining-Unbound-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Carolin-Schiff-wining-Unbound-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Carolin Schiff winning Unbound, <em>c.

Hidden under a camouflaged paint job, it’s been ridden to numerous pro wins this season – capped off with a Gravel World Championship this past weekend under Polish rider Kasia Niewiadoma.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Canyon-CFR-prototype-gravel-race-bike_FNLD-GRVL-Lahti-FInland_Tiffany-Cromwell-complete.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Canyon-CFR-prototype-gravel-race-bike_FNLD-GRVL-Lahti-FInland_Tiffany-Cromwell-complete.jpg\" alt=\"Canyon CFR prototype gravel race bike at FNLD GRVL, complete\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Canyon-CFR-prototype-gravel-race-bike_FNLD-GRVL-Lahti-FInland_Tiffany-Cromwell-complete.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Canyon-CFR-prototype-gravel-race-bike_FNLD-GRVL-Lahti-FInland_Tiffany-Cromwell-complete-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Canyon-CFR-prototype-gravel-race-bike_FNLD-GRVL-Lahti-FInland_Tiffany-Cromwell-complete-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Canyon-CFR-prototype-gravel-race-bike_FNLD-GRVL-Lahti-FInland_Tiffany-Cromwell-complete-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Canyon-CFR-prototype-gravel-race-bike_FNLD-GRVL-Lahti-FInland_Tiffany-Cromwell-complete-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Canyon-CFR-prototype-gravel-race-bike_FNLD-GRVL-Lahti-FInland_Tiffany-Cromwell-complete-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We caught up with that same unique razzle dazzle prototype paint job at FNLD GRVL this summer, for a <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/canyon-gravel-cfr-gravel-race-bike-prototype-spotted/\" target=\"_blank\">detailed sneak peek</a>.

With hidden integrated internal cable routing through the headset as is the style of the times, yet not inside the bar for a bit more manageable at-home consumer-direct setup. But it still is quite creative in its new 1-piece handlebar+stem combo, greatly improving ergonomics and building in direct mount compatibility for everything from mobile phones &amp; GPS computers to aerobars adapted from triathlon. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canyon says a big driver was literally to reduce the frontal area and aero drag from the tall Hover bar. But it’s hard not to imagine that a more conventional setup is easier for more potential gravel riders to buy in.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_aerobars.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_aerobars.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Canyon Grail all-new carbon gravel race bike, aerobars\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_aerobars.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_aerobars-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_aerobars-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_aerobars-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_aerobars-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_aerobars-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption><em>c.

There apparently is also a pro-specific version with extra downsweep to get the hoods and drops lower, while keeping the ‘stem’ level with the ground. There you’ll find a new “Gear Groove” direct mount interface in the top and bottom of the ‘stem portion’ that allows a modified mono-riser to be installed for aerobar extensions taken from Canyon’s triathlon SpeedMax. Or you can mount more conventional integrated out-front GPS mounts (like I have) in the same position.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Aero upgrades</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_complete.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_complete.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Canyon Grail all-new carbon gravel race bike, complete\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_complete.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_complete-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_complete-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_complete-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_complete-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_complete-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_complete-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Frameset-wise, the new Grail is pretty much all-new compared to <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/canyon-rides-off-the-road-with-carbon-holy-grail-cf-gravel-bike-unique-hover-bar/\" target=\"_blank\">the original Grail</a> that debuted in 2018. The frame gets an unsurprising aerodynamic overhaul from tip to tail. According to Canyon, “<em>tested back-to-back in the wind tunnel with the first-generation GRAIL, the new generation saves a significant 9.1 watts at 45kph, tested bike only with identical specs</em>“.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_new-front-end.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_new-front-end.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Canyon Grail all-new carbon gravel race bike, updated front-end\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_new-front-end.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_new-front-end-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_new-front-end-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_new-front-end-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_new-front-end-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_new-front-end-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_new-front-end-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Up front, that means a move to deeper aero fork legs that increase front-end stiffness. But there’s also a longer axle-to-crown length to both smooth airflow over the front tire, and build in the possibility to mount a short travel gravel suspension fork, if so desired. The fork legs also get indentations molded into the carbon that allows for a secure Fork Load Sleeve adapter to add fork bag or water bottle mounting, without the need for conventional threaded mounts. The idea here is that most riders of this ‘race bike’ won’t ever mount anything to their fork, but it’s still possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Storage upgrades</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Load-internal-storage.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Load-internal-storage.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Canyon Grail all-new carbon gravel race bike, Load internal storage\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Load-internal-storage.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Load-internal-storage-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Load-internal-storage-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Load-internal-storage-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Load-internal-storage-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Load-internal-storage-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption><em>c. Canyon</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest change in the frame itself is the introduction of internal in-frame storage, and external integrated storage. For inside, the top 2 carbon frame specs add a glovebox door that Canyon calls the Load Downtube Storage. It’s pretty much what we’ve seen on a lot of recent mountain bikes, but here placed above the water bottles. Inside a thin snake-like neoprene bag can carry a spare tube, CO2, inflator, and tire levers. And mounted directly to the Load glovebox door you can secure the included multi-tool, plus an optional mini pump.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Load-Fidlock-Quickloader-bag.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Load-Fidlock-Quickloader-bag.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Canyon Grail all-new carbon gravel race bike, Load Fidlock Quickloader bag\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Load-Fidlock-Quickloader-bag.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Load-Fidlock-Quickloader-bag-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Load-Fidlock-Quickloader-bag-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Load-Fidlock-Quickloader-bag-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Load-Fidlock-Quickloader-bag-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Load-Fidlock-Quickloader-bag-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Load-Fidlock-Quickloader-bag-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As for outside, Canyon has created a sleekly integrated Load Fidlock Quickloader partial frame bag. It looks a lot like the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/apidura-aero-pack-system-aerodynamic-gravel-racing-bags/\" target=\"_blank\">Aero Pack System</a> that Apidura developed with Ridley for their gravel race bike. This one is all Canyon, though. A separate size bag to match each frame, the Quickloader snaps securely into place with magnetic Fidlock studs, and can be removed by pulling a release strap on its back. Canyon says it saves 1.5W vs. no bag, while having enough space inside to carry an extra layer like a jacket or some extra ride snacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To neatly integrate with the aero bag, the top of the downtube is quite boxy, while it transitions to a more conventional truncated aerofoil shape down by the water bottle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combined the Load system means you should be able to carry most of your ride spares on the bike, low, and out of the wind. No need for a saddle bag for most racing. And keep those cargo shorts pockets free for mobile phones and bananas.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Less comfort?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_D-shaped-seatpost.jpg\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_D-shaped-seatpost.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_D-shaped-seatpost.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_D-shaped-seatpost-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_D-shaped-seatpost-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_D-shaped-seatpost-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_D-shaped-seatpost-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_D-shaped-seatpost-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, most of the individual frame tubes are also deeper and more aero in profile, except for the toptube which is just now more straight than before. The seat cluster looks similar to the old bike, but now fits a D-shaped seatpost. It’s the same shape as on the Ultimate and promises 3W of aero savings (<em>at a gravel unrealistic 45kph</em>). But Canyon created a much more forgiving post than on their light road race bike – although still much less forgiving than the leaf-spring VCLS posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Pro-LTD.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Pro-LTD.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Canyon Grail all-new carbon gravel race bike, CFR LTD\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Pro-LTD.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Pro-LTD-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Pro-LTD-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Pro-LTD-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Pro-LTD-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Pro-LTD-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Pro-LTD-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption><em>c.

Yes, you could probably squeeze a 45mm tire in there, but if you need bigger than a 40/42mm tire, maybe a Grizl would be a better fit for you. This is a gravel race bike, after all.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_mounting-details.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_mounting-details.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Canyon Grail all-new carbon gravel race bike, mounting\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_mounting-details.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_mounting-details-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_mounting-details-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_mounting-details-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_mounting-details-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_mounting-details-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That tire limit also means the bike is still 1x or 2x compatible as many racers coming from the road prefer conventional road gearing combos.

Canyon</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All-new for the Grail is CFR-level ultralight carbon tech. Like they’ve done from road to DH to cyclocross in between, now gravel gets a Canyon Factory Racing level carbon layup. Ultralight CFR carbon fiber makes the Grail CFR frame &amp; fork 118g lighter than the new CF SLX. Plus, it means 10% more stiffness in the bottom bracket and headset, and a 4.5% stiffer fork both laterally and front to back. Because lighter and stiffer is better, if you’re into that kind of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Refined Gravel Race Geometry</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_geometry.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"850\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_geometry.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Canyon Grail all-new carbon gravel race bike, refined geometry\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_geometry.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_geometry-297x126.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_geometry-800x340.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_geometry-120x51.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_geometry-768x326.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_geometry-1536x653.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new bike does feature all-new geometry, but it’s really not so far different from the OG long-wheelbase Grail if you excuse the lack of a Hover bar. The headtube is a bit slacker at a still reasonably steep  71.5°. And the wheelbase is actually even longer, and extra 27mm across the board. But the real trick seems to have been playing with fork offset to keep the same 69mm fork Trail across most sizes (<em>the core S-L</em>) for a balanced stable but maneuverable ride over rough or smooth surfaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2023 Canyon Grail CFR &amp; CF – Pricing, Options &amp; Availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Canyon-CFR-prototype-gravel-race-bike_FNLD-GRVL-Lahti-FInland_parked-frameset-detail.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Canyon-CFR-prototype-gravel-race-bike_FNLD-GRVL-Lahti-FInland_parked-frameset-detail.jpg\" alt=\"Canyon CFR prototype gravel race bike at FNLD GRVL, alternative storage\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Canyon-CFR-prototype-gravel-race-bike_FNLD-GRVL-Lahti-FInland_parked-frameset-detail.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Canyon-CFR-prototype-gravel-race-bike_FNLD-GRVL-Lahti-FInland_parked-frameset-detail-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Canyon-CFR-prototype-gravel-race-bike_FNLD-GRVL-Lahti-FInland_parked-frameset-detail-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Canyon-CFR-prototype-gravel-race-bike_FNLD-GRVL-Lahti-FInland_parked-frameset-detail-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Canyon-CFR-prototype-gravel-race-bike_FNLD-GRVL-Lahti-FInland_parked-frameset-detail-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Canyon-CFR-prototype-gravel-race-bike_FNLD-GRVL-Lahti-FInland_parked-frameset-detail-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Canyon-CFR-prototype-gravel-race-bike_FNLD-GRVL-Lahti-FInland_parked-frameset-detail-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new carbon Canyon Grail comes in 8 build kits at three different carbon spec levels – the top-tier CFR, CF SLX &amp; CF SL.

Except for the CF SL 7 which will only arrive early in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>First Riding Impressions</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_riding-in-the-sun.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_riding-in-the-sun.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Canyon Grail all-new carbon gravel race bike, gravel riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_riding-in-the-sun.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_riding-in-the-sun-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_riding-in-the-sun-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_riding-in-the-sun-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_riding-in-the-sun-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_riding-in-the-sun-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_riding-in-the-sun-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve been riding the new Grail on and off for the past month – an 8.5kg build in the CF SLX 8 AXS build.  That includes some competitive riding, plenty of gnarly “gravel” bordering on enduro, and some quick but more casual riding. The new gravel race bikes really fills precise and more responsive, and makes me want to go fast. I definitely got the first impression that the front end feels much stiffer than I remember the previous Grail. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_rainy-Blinduro-scaled.jpg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1536\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_rainy-Blinduro-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Canyon Grail all-new carbon gravel race bike, Blinduro\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_rainy-Blinduro-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_rainy-Blinduro-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_rainy-Blinduro-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_rainy-Blinduro-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_rainy-Blinduro-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_rainy-Blinduro-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_rainy-Blinduro-2048x1229.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of that was going hard on some really technical tracks on 40mm tires with a few psi higher pressure than I probably should. Coming off a more adventure-ready gravel bike with 50mm tires, it was a quick shift. Even down to a sore wrist after 3 intense days of hammering the new bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Bohemian-Border-Bash.jpg\"><img width=\"1400\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Bohemian-Border-Bash.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Canyon Grail all-new carbon gravel race bike, Bohemia Border Bash\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Bohemian-Border-Bash.jpg 1400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Bohemian-Border-Bash-263x300.jpg 263w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Bohemian-Border-Bash-800x914.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Bohemian-Border-Bash-105x120.jpg 105w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Bohemian-Border-Bash-768x878.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-Canyon-Grail-all-new-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Bohemian-Border-Bash-1344x1536.jpg 1344w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But the new Grail is growing on me. Maybe the race-ready XPLR gearing is a bit steep for me coming off Eagle-equipped bikes. But it certainly makes sense from a race perspective. Then, I adapted after a week or so to how best to ride this bike. And that’s to ride it fast. Smash up the climbs, and fly down the other side. If I wanted to go bike adventure bikepacking, I’d surely pick a Grizl for the extra comfort. But when I want to go fast, it’s hard to beat the speedy feel of this new Grail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.canyon.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Canyon.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2023-canyon-grail-carbon-gravel-race-bike/\">All-new Canyon Grail Reshapes Carbon Gravel Bike for Racing around More Normal Cockpit</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"19681239c764c16fc13f861ceb9279e3039d71e9f84edcad7443d8212814b045","category":"Cycling"}
