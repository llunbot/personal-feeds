The feature originally launched in June 2019 and covered roughly 200 cities globally, using user-reported data similar to <a href=\"https://www.waze.com/\">Waze</a> to discover and predict overcrowded trains and buses. Google is expanding that 200-city initial rollout to (eventually) over 10,000 transit agencies in 100 countries, according to today's announcement.</p>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, Google Maps' mass transit predictions don't just rely on direct user-reported data. They utilize AI models <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/12/so-you-want-to-build-a-neural-network-the-cloud-can-help-with-that/\">trained</a> on that data.</p>\n<p>\"We apply world-class anonymization technology and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfAdemDkLsc\">differential privacy techniques</a> to Location History Data to make sure your data remains private and secure,\" the announcement declares—although we must point out that attempts to anonymize location data frequently <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/07/catholic-priest-quits-after-anonymized-data-revealed-alleged-use-of-grindr/\">fail</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1781989#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1781989&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6f3f88894495249bbe2432f0e060633a640540705158737323431cc9c0ea9223","category":"Tech"}
