Armed\nwith a 1.5GHz processor, a full gigabyte of RAM, and a limiting\n32-bit address space, I embarked on an experiment that actually\nyielded results. I have successfully managed to achieve LLM\ninference on this classic piece of Apple history, proving that\neven yesteryear’s hardware can have a taste of tomorrow’s AI.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A fun project, well-explained. Even a great choice of computer to run it on — the 12-inch PowerBook G4 is one of the best-looking computers ever made.
