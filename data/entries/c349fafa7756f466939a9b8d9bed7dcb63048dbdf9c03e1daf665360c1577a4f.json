In 2020 he left his job working on Google Assistant and also stopped backing up all of his images to <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/google-photos-ask-photos-gemini/\">Google Photos</a>. He feared that his content could be used to train AI systems, even if they weren’t specifically ones tied to the Pentagon project. “I don't control any of the future outcomes that this will enable,” Mohandas thought. “So now, shouldn't I be more responsible?”</p>\n<p>Mohandas, who taught himself programming and is based in Bengaluru, India, decided he wanted to develop an alternative service for storing and sharing photos that is <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/wired-guide-open-source-software/\">open source</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2014/11/hacker-lexicon-end-to-end-encryption/\">end-to-end encrypted</a>. Something “more private, wholesome, and trustworthy,” he says. The paid service he designed, Ente, is profitable and says it has more than 100,000 users, many of whom are already part of the privacy-obsessed crowd. But Mohandas struggled to articulate to wider audiences why they should reconsider relying on Google Photos, despite all the conveniences it offers.</p>\n<p></p><figure>\n    <div>\n                        <img width=\"218\" height=\"58\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/wired-logo.png\" alt=\"Wired logo\" />\n                  </div>\n      </figure>\nThen one weekend in May, an intern at Ente came up with an idea: Give people a sense of what some of Google’s AI models can learn from studying images. Last month, Ente launched <a href=\"https://theyseeyourphotos.com/\">https://Theyseeyourphotos.com</a>, a website and marketing stunt designed to turn Google’s technology against itself. People can upload any photo to the website, which is then sent to a Google Cloud <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/chatgpt-plus-image-feature-openai/\">computer vision</a> program that writes a startlingly thorough three-paragraph description of it. (Ente prompts the AI model to document small details in the uploaded images.)<p></p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/new-website-shows-you-how-much-google-ai-can-learn-from-your-photos/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/new-website-shows-you-how-much-google-ai-can-learn-from-your-photos/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Paresh Dave, wired.com","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c349fafa7756f466939a9b8d9bed7dcb63048dbdf9c03e1daf665360c1577a4f","category":"Tech"}
