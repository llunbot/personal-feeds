Note that an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/\">Apple ID</a> associated with a developer account is required to download and install the beta.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌iOS 18‌ introduces Apple Intelligence, a set of AI features that are built deeply into the operating system. Apple Intelligence won't be coming until later in the beta testing process, but it includes features for refining and editing writing, generating images and emoji, and most notably, improving <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> and search. ‌Siri‌ is gaining a better understanding of natural language, improved contextual awareness, and the personal assistant will integrate with ChatGPT to answer more complex queries.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple Intelligence features are limited to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models and iPads with an M-series chip, but there are a number of other features that are coming. Apple is allowing users to rearrange Home screen apps to have open spaces, plus there's a dark mode for app icons and tinting options.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Control Center is customizable and third-party developers can add controls for their apps, with the Lock Screen Flashlight and Camera icons able to be replaced or removed. Messages is gaining Rich Communication Services support to improve conversations with Android users, the option to schedule texts to be sent later, new text effects, messages over satellite when there's no cellular, and the option to use any emoji for Tapback responses.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere's a dedicated Passwords app for logins, passkeys, Wi-Fi passwords, and verification codes, and there's now an option to lock and hide apps, which means they can't be opened without secondary <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/\">Face ID</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a> authentication even when your phone is unlocked.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSafari has a highlights feature that summarizes articles and surfaces key information on websites, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a> app interface has been overhauled, and there's a new Tap to Cash feature for privately and securely transferring money using Apple Cash. Other features include equation solving and voice memo transcription in Notes, a game mode for improving game performance, and an option to respond to ‌Siri‌ on AirPods with head gestures.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌iOS 18‌ is only available to registered developers at the current time, but this revised third beta comes as we are expecting a public beta. Apple said in June that a public beta would be made available sometime in July. <div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/15/apple-releases-ios-18-revised-third-beta/\">Apple Seeds Revised Third Betas of iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 to Developers</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-revised-third-betas-of-ios-18-and-ipados-18-to-developers.2431400/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"665ba24ba61bd6daab455f8af33d166f835f09276c4a69bc18c4988512f89496","category":"Apple"}
