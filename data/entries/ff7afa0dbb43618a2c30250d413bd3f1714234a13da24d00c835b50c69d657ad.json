In his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-WhZT02ubg\">iPhone 16e review video</a> today, however, Dave Lee of the YouTube channel Dave2D said the device is equipped with a 3,961 mAh battery. That is more than a 10% increase in battery capacity compared to the regular iPhone 16 model's 3,561 mAh battery, provided that the iPhone 16e's battery voltage remains the typical 3.85V.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<ul><li><strong>iPhone 16 Pro Max:</strong> 4,685 mAh</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>iPhone 16 Pro:</strong> 3,582 mAh</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>iPhone 16 Plus:</strong> 4,674 mAh</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>iPhone 16:</strong> 3,561 mAh</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>iPhone 16e:</strong> 3,961 mAh</li></ul>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple says the iPhone 16e offers the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/iphone-16e-battery-life/\">longest battery life of any 6.1-inch iPhone</a> ever, in part due to Apple's new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/26/future-devices-with-apple-5g-modem/\">power-efficient C1 modem</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHow is the iPhone 16e's real-world battery life?\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLee evaluated the iPhone 16e's battery life with a test that continuously loads the Reddit website over Wi-Fi, and he found that the device achieved 12 hours and 54 minutes of battery life for this purpose. In the same test, the regular iPhone 16 lasted 11 hours and 17 minutes, so the iPhone 16e was the clear winner in this particular test.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iPhone-16e-Battery-Life-Dave2D.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3024\" height=\"1964\" /><em>iPhone 16e battery life test by Dave2D</em></div>\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/iphones/apple-iphone-16e-review#section-apple-iphone-16e-review-battery-and-charging\"><em>Tom's Guide</em> also tested</a> the iPhone 16e's battery life in a different way, and the device achieved similar results as the regular iPhone 16:<blockquote>In running Tom's Guide's battery benchmark test, the iPhone 16e puts up an average time of 12 hours and 41 minutes. That's only a couple of minutes shorter than the iPhone 16's average of 12 hours and 43 minutes. However, the best times recorded on both phones are 12 hours and 49 minutes for the iPhone 16e, and 13 hours and 19 minutes with the iPhone 16.</blockquote>The website said its test \"runs a script that simulates normal web surfing over cellular until the battery's depleted.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMore on the iPhone 16e's battery life <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/i-tested-the-599-iphone-16e-and-its-good-but-also-kind-of-odd/\">from <em>CNET</em>'s Patrick Holland</a>:<blockquote>I've had the 16E for six days and only had to charge it three times. I used a 30-watt wall charger, and the 16E went from empty to 59% in 30 minutes. And I've been using the phone heavily, testing the cameras, running Apple Intelligence tools and playing graphics intensive games.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe iPhone 16E can definitely make it through a day on a single charge and, depending on how you use it, it'll likely make it through a day and a half before needing to be plugged in.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn CNET's video streaming battery test with the battery charged to 100%, the iPhone 16E didn't drop a single percent after an hour. Compare that to the iPhone 16 and iPhone 15, each of which dropped to 97% after an hour in the same test. I have more battery tests to run, but so far the iPhone 16E has a great battery life.</blockquote>Here is Lee's review:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nApple is currently <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/21/iphone-16e-now-available-for-pre-order-ahead-of-february-28-launch/\">accepting iPhone 16e pre-orders</a>, and the device launches on Friday.
