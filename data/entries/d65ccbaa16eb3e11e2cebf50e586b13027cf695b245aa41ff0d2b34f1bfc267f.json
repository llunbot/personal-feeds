He said the doorbell would wirelessly connect to a compatible deadbolt lock.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/face-id.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1023\" height=\"573\" />\r<br />\nIn a <a href=\"https://x.com/Kosutami_Ito/status/1894391774929723753\">vague teaser post</a> on X today, a leaker known as Kosutami shared an alleged new feature that Apple is planning for the doorbell: MagSafe.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOn select iPhones, MagSafe lets you attach a charger or other accessories to the device magnetically. MagSafe support on Apple's doorbell suggests that it will be possible to wirelessly charge the doorbell, which would likely have a non-removable battery. It is unclear if the doorbell would also have a USB-C port for wired charging.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMagSafe charging would certainly be convenient, but smart home doorbells typically only need to be charged a handful of times per year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAnother thought we had was that Apple's doorbell could have a MagSafe backplate, allowing for the doorbell to be easily taken on and off. However, that would make the doorbell easy to steal, so that theory does not really make sense.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman said Apple's doorbell would launch in 2026 at the earliest, so hopefully additional rumors will paint a clearer picture over the next year or so.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's biggest competitor in this space would be Ring, acquired by Amazon in 2018.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple would likely tout the privacy and security benefits of its own smart home doorbell. Apple already offers a HomeKit Secure Video service with end-to-end encryption for storing footage in iCloud, and the doorbell could have a Secure Enclave.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple seemingly has plans to make a bigger push into the smart home space over the next few years. In addition to this doorbell, the company is expected to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/10/apple-home-hub-still-months-away/\">launch a smart home hub this year</a>, and it is also rumored to be planning its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/04/apple-smart-home-camera-rumor/\">own HomeKit-enabled indoor camera</a> that would compete with products like Logitech's Circle View.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKosutami is best known as a collector of prototype Apple hardware, but they have occasionally shared accurate information about Apple's future product plans. For example, they accurately revealed that the iPhone 16 Pro would be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/20/iphone-16-pro-leak-reveals-redesigned-battery/\">equipped with a metal-enclosed battery</a>, around 10 months before the device launched. They also provided an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/exclusive-first-look-finewoven-apple-watch-band/\">early look at an Apple Watch band</a> that uses Apple's controversial FineWoven material. On the other hand, Kosutami was wrong about <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/27/airpods-pro-3-much-better-anc-rumor/\">AirPods Pro 3 being imminent in August 2024</a>.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-doorbell/\">Apple Doorbell</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/face-id/\">Face ID</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kosutami/\">Kosutami</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/25/apple-face-id-doorbell-magsafe-rumor/\">Apple's Face ID Doorbell Rumored to Feature MagSafe</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-face-id-doorbell-rumored-to-feature-magsafe.2450167/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d65ccbaa16eb3e11e2cebf50e586b13027cf695b245aa41ff0d2b34f1bfc267f","category":"Apple"}
