Alongside the announcement, Apple began accepting submissions for the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/wwdc23/swift-student-challenge/\">annual Swift Student Challenge</a>, which tasks students with creating an innovative coding project using Apple's Swift Playgrounds app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/swift-student-challenge.jpg\" alt width=\"1700\" height=\"956\" />\r<br />\nSubmissions are open starting today, with Apple to accept projects through April 19 at 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time. Entrants must be at least 13 years old (in the U.S.) and need to be registered as a member of the Apple Developer Program. There's also an academic requirement, so those who enter must be students in some capacity.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nStudents will need to create an interactive scene in an app playground that can be experienced within three minutes. Entries are judged on technical accomplishment, creativity of ideas, and content of written responses explaining the project and other app development experience.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWinners will receive exclusive <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/\">WWDC 2023</a> outerwear (which has been a jacket in past years), <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a>, a customized pin set, and a one year membership in the Apple Developer Program.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere will also be a random selection process among winners to choose students to attend the special event that Apple plans to hold at <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-park/\">Apple Park</a> on June 5. Students can opt-in to this selection process when uploading their projects, and this lottery is separate <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/29/wwdc-2023-special-event-apple-park/\">from the main developer lottery</a> for the event. Travel and accommodations will <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/wwdc23/swift-student-challenge/policy/\">not be included</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple will inform students about their status by the end of the business day on Tuesday, May 9. Entries can be <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/wwdc23/swift-student-challenge/\">submitted through Apple's developer website</a>.
