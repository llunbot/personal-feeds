The lower-end model is pretty much what you expect: It gives you the same M4 Max processor Apple introduced in <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/apple/2024/11/review-the-fastest-of-the-m4-macbook-pros-might-be-the-least-interesting-one/\">the high-end MacBook Pro last year</a>. It has up to 16 CPU cores (10 P-cores, 4 E-cores), up to 40 GPU cores, and a 16-core Neural Engine.</p>\n<p>The $1,999 base model comes with 14 CPU cores (10 P-cores, 4 E-cores), 32 GPU cores, 36GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage. That model's RAM can't be upgraded until you step up to the fully-enabled M4 Max, which also gets you 48GB of RAM for $300. From there, the desktop can be upgraded with either 64GB or 128GB of RAM, same as the MacBook Pro.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/03/apple-intros-new-mac-studio-models-with-m4-max-and-m3-ultra/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/03/apple-intros-new-mac-studio-models-with-m4-max-and-m3-ultra/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"699a8258363093cba841dc394ddc71ba5118836e8e59e04727b2ad119b30245b","category":"Tech"}
