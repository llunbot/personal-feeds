Long after Ferrari added turbochargers to its powerplants, its Italian rival from Sant'Agata Bolognese opted to stick with larger-capacity lumps that sounded symphonic throughout their rev ranges. But those aren't entirely consistent with Lamborghini's goal of reducing its fleet emissions by half in 2025, or by 80 percent in 2030. To that end, the brand will bring hybrid versions of all its models to market, Lamborghini CEO Stephan Winkelmann said.</p>\n<p>\"Last year we celebrated our sixtieth anniversary with the presentation of our first plug-in hybrid car, the Lamborghini Revuelto,\" explained Winkelmann. \"We had the presentation in summer of our race car, the LMDh car, which is going to race in Doha the first weekend in March. And then Pebble Beach in August,\" he continued, where the brand showed off Lanzador, a concept of its first battery-electric car, which is due in 2028.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/10/raging-bulls-and-honey-bees-inside-lamborghinis-sustainability-efforts/\">In October</a>, Ars visited Lamborghini in Italy to learn more about how the supercar maker has been making its car production more sustainableâ€”including the increased use of rail for freight shipping, more use of reusable and recycling waste materials from production, and even a biomass reactor that generates natural gas that powers much of the factory. In addition to cutting the emissions of its cars, the company wants to reduce the CO<sub>2</sub> emitted during production by 40 percent by 2030.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2000160#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2000160&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
