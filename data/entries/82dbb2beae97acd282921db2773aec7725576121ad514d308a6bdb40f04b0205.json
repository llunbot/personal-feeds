And they have <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/lumos-firefly-smart-bike-lights/\" target=\"_blank\">an on-bike light kit</a>. Now, they’ve married the two for a higher performance helmet that’ll appeal to roadies without giving up a key safety feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lumos-ultra-fly-helmet-with-integrated-light-mount-3.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lumos-ultra-fly-helmet-with-integrated-light-mount-3.jpg\" alt=\"lumos ultra fly pro bike helmet with integrated tail light\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lumos-ultra-fly-helmet-with-integrated-light-mount-3.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lumos-ultra-fly-helmet-with-integrated-light-mount-3-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lumos-ultra-fly-helmet-with-integrated-light-mount-3-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lumos-ultra-fly-helmet-with-integrated-light-mount-3-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lumos-ultra-fly-helmet-with-integrated-light-mount-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lumos-ultra-fly-helmet-with-integrated-light-mount-3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lumos-ultra-fly-helmet-with-integrated-light-mount-3-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Lumos Ultra Fly helmet has a rear mount for their Firefly tail light. Just pluck it off your bike and stick it to the back of the helmet to elevate the light, making it more noticeable to motorists. Or, just add a second Firefly to your helmet, and synchronize the flash patterns with the ones on your bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lumos-ultra-fly-helmet-with-integrated-light-mount-1.jpg\"><img width=\"1373\" height=\"913\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lumos-ultra-fly-helmet-with-integrated-light-mount-1.jpg\" alt=\"lumos ultra fly bike helmet\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lumos-ultra-fly-helmet-with-integrated-light-mount-1.jpg 1373w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lumos-ultra-fly-helmet-with-integrated-light-mount-1-297x197.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lumos-ultra-fly-helmet-with-integrated-light-mount-1-800x532.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lumos-ultra-fly-helmet-with-integrated-light-mount-1-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lumos-ultra-fly-helmet-with-integrated-light-mount-1-768x511.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lumos-ultra-fly-helmet-with-integrated-light-mount-1-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Without the light, the Lumos Ultra Fly is a sharp-looking helmet, perfect for road and gravel cyclists who want something aero and sleek. Eleven vents move the air through to keep you cool. And at just 245g, it’s also competitively lightweight. Available in five colors (Stealth Black, Phantom White, Maverick Grey, Hyper Green &amp; Atomic Salmon)</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lumos-ultra-fly-pro-helmet-with-integrated-light-mount-1.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1153\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lumos-ultra-fly-pro-helmet-with-integrated-light-mount-1.jpg\" alt=\"lumos ultra fly pro bike helmet\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lumos-ultra-fly-pro-helmet-with-integrated-light-mount-1.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lumos-ultra-fly-pro-helmet-with-integrated-light-mount-1-297x190.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lumos-ultra-fly-pro-helmet-with-integrated-light-mount-1-800x512.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lumos-ultra-fly-pro-helmet-with-integrated-light-mount-1-120x77.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lumos-ultra-fly-pro-helmet-with-integrated-light-mount-1-768x492.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lumos-ultra-fly-pro-helmet-with-integrated-light-mount-1-1536x984.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A MIPS-equipped Ultra Fly Pro is also available, which adds three more vents across the top of the helmet for even better air flow. And, it gains MIPS rotational impact protection and a Fidlock magnetic buckle. It’s a few grams heavier, but comes in more colors (Shadow Black, Spectre White, Razor Grey, White Lime, Thunder Blue &amp; Daredevil Red)</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lumos-ultra-fly-helmet-with-integrated-light-mount-2.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1201\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lumos-ultra-fly-helmet-with-integrated-light-mount-2.jpg\" alt=\"lumos ultra fly pro bike helmet with integrated tail light\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lumos-ultra-fly-helmet-with-integrated-light-mount-2.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lumos-ultra-fly-helmet-with-integrated-light-mount-2-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lumos-ultra-fly-helmet-with-integrated-light-mount-2-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lumos-ultra-fly-helmet-with-integrated-light-mount-2-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lumos-ultra-fly-helmet-with-integrated-light-mount-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lumos-ultra-fly-helmet-with-integrated-light-mount-2-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lumos-ultra-fly-helmet-with-integrated-light-mount-2-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Both feature their FlexiFit retention mech, which has all the adjustments and is ponytail-friendly.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lumos-ultra-fly-helmet-with-integrated-light-mount-4.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lumos-ultra-fly-helmet-with-integrated-light-mount-4.jpg\" alt=\"lumos ultra fly pro bike helmet with integrated sunglasses holder\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lumos-ultra-fly-helmet-with-integrated-light-mount-4.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lumos-ultra-fly-helmet-with-integrated-light-mount-4-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lumos-ultra-fly-helmet-with-integrated-light-mount-4-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lumos-ultra-fly-helmet-with-integrated-light-mount-4-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lumos-ultra-fly-helmet-with-integrated-light-mount-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lumos-ultra-fly-helmet-with-integrated-light-mount-4-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lumos-ultra-fly-helmet-with-integrated-light-mount-4-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Small rubber grips on the edge of the front side vents hold your shades securely when you need to stow them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you got in on their pre-order, delivery is planned for December 2023 for the Ultra Fly, and February for the Pro. If not, you’ll have to get on their waitlist and MSRP is $175 for the Ultra Fly, and $215 for the Ultra Fly Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://preorder.ridelumos.com/products/lumos-ultra-fly\" target=\"_blank\">RideLumos.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/lumos-ultra-fly-helmet-lights-synchronize-w-bike-blinkies/\">Lumos Ultra Fly Helmet Lights Synchronize w/ Bike Blinkies</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"82dbb2beae97acd282921db2773aec7725576121ad514d308a6bdb40f04b0205","category":"Cycling"}
