The program's stringent hardware requirements—16GB of RAM, at least 256GB of storage, and a fast neural processing unit (NPU)—disqualify all but new PCs, keeping features like Recall from running on all current Windows 11 PCs.</p>\n\n<p>But the Copilot chatbot remains supported on all Windows 11 PCs (and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/microsoft-is-revisiting-windows-10-by-backporting-the-copilot-ai-assistant/\">most Windows 10 PCs</a>), and a change Microsoft has made to <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/06/14/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-22635-3785-beta-channel/\">recent Windows 11 Insider Preview builds</a> is actually making the feature less useful and accessible than it is in the current publicly available versions of Windows. Copilot is being changed from a persistent sidebar into an app window that can be resized, minimized, and pinned and unpinned from the taskbar, just like any other app. But at least as of this writing, this version of Copilot can no longer adjust Windows' settings, and it's no longer possible to call it up with the Windows+C keyboard shortcut. Only newer keyboards with the dedicated Copilot key will have an easy built-in keyboard shortcut for summoning Copilot.</p>\n<p>If Microsoft keeps these changes intact, they'll hit Windows 11 PCs when the 24H2 update is released to the general public later this year; the changes are already present on Copilot+ PCs, which are <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/06/windows-11-24h2-is-released-to-the-public-but-only-on-copilot-pcs-for-now/\">running a version of Window 11 24H2 out of the box</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032806#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032806&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d06c9922cda893fb4de5ed63f25b69fa88980d1c1e59fbb077c3f6a057a9ab41","category":"Tech"}
