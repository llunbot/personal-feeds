Many of these focus on hardware and software approaches that are pretty straightforward extensions of existing technologies. But a few technologies are much farther out there. One that's definitely in the latter category? Quantum computing.</p>\n<p>In some ways, quantum hardware is a better match for some of the math that underlies AI than more traditional hardware. While the current quantum hardware is a bit too error-prone for the more elaborate AI models currently in use, researchers are starting to put the pieces in place to run AI models when the hardware is ready. This week, a couple of commercial interests are releasing a draft of a paper describing how to get classical image data into a quantum processor (actually, two different processors) and perform a basic AI image classification.</p>\n<p>All of which gives us a great opportunity to discuss why quantum AI may be more than just hype.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/companies-take-a-step-toward-running-ai-on-quantum-hardware/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/companies-take-a-step-toward-running-ai-on-quantum-hardware/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ea767204294f91c768a29b023dbb955cc2e3fde4438c5b83d42e3902c7f5bfb4","category":"Tech"}
