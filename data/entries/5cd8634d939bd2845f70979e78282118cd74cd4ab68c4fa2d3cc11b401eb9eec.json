{"title":"Hang, Slide & Rotate Bikes Effortlessly with the Stashed SpaceRail Bike Storage System","link":"https://bikerumor.com/stashed-spacerail-bike-storage-system-review/","date":1687982518000,"content":"<p>Back in April, I wrote about a really <a href=\"https://www.stashedproducts.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">cool bike storage system</a> by Stashed Products that I saw at the Sea Otter Classic. The system is called the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/stashed-space-rail-bike-storage/\" target=\"_blank\">SpaceRail Bike Storage System</a>, and it’s a pretty ingenious concept that uses a weighted hook that can slide and rotate allowing the user to alternate the bikes in an ass-to-tea-kettle type of spacing, to get them as close together as possible. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, look…I don’t know what ass-to-tea-kettle is – it’s something my dad used to say… but, I think you get the gist. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-System-vanity-plate.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-System-vanity-plate-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Stashed SpaceRail Storage System vanity plate\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-System-vanity-plate-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-System-vanity-plate-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-System-vanity-plate-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-System-vanity-plate-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-System-vanity-plate-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-System-vanity-plate.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All of the parts that make up the Stashed SpaceRail System are 100% made in the UK, even the custom extrusion for the Space Rail itself.  They are expanding into the US and are very proud of their innovative packaging. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They use only cardboard when packaging and shipping their goods which was surprising to me when they told me that they have a 100% success rate on the delivery of the last 1000 systems that were sent “across the pond”. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stashed sent me two space rails and enough hooks for 6 bikes (4 of my own with 2 hooks left over for review bikes). The package came to me through DHL, and when I opened the box, I noticed there weren’t a lot of small, loose parts to deal with, and that the packaging was efficient, clean, and minimal. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, I had just moved, the garage was a mess, and I was very excited to try out the system if anything just to get the bikes out of the way. Anywho, to my disappointment, I got it all installed without snapping one pic of the clever packaging. Sorry guys. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The SpaceRail System </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-Systemmounted-on-the-ceiling.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-Systemmounted-on-the-ceiling-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Stashed SpaceRail Storage System vanity plate\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-Systemmounted-on-the-ceiling-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-Systemmounted-on-the-ceiling-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-Systemmounted-on-the-ceiling-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-Systemmounted-on-the-ceiling-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-Systemmounted-on-the-ceiling-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-Systemmounted-on-the-ceiling.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Stashed Products offers three different mounting options for their SpaceRail system with a <a href=\"https://www.stashedproducts.co.uk/products/bike-storage-ceiling-mounted-kit\" target=\"_blank\">Ceiling Mount</a>, <a href=\"https://www.stashedproducts.co.uk/products/copy-of-spacerail-bike-storage-system-a\" target=\"_blank\">Angled Mount</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.stashedproducts.co.uk/products/copy-of-spacerail-bike-storage-system-wall\" target=\"_blank\">Wall Mount</a>.

When that was done, I added the rail’s end cap on the far end that wasn’t getting the extension. It was easy to mount the first rail to the ceiling by myself. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-System-mounting-hardware-2.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-System-mounting-hardware-2-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Stashed SpaceRail Storage System mounting hardware 2\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-System-mounting-hardware-2-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-System-mounting-hardware-2-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-System-mounting-hardware-2-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-System-mounting-hardware-2-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-System-mounting-hardware-2-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-System-mounting-hardware-2.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The actual SpaceRails are one-piece aluminum and I found them light enough to hold in place while installing the mounting plates to the ceiling. But, that being said, I’m not sure if that would be the case if you were attempting to screw the long wood screws in with just a handheld screwdriver… if that were the case, you’d need another person to hold the SpaceRail.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did predrill pilot holes in the joists so that when using a drill to install the included wood screws, they installed quickly and easily without splitting the wood. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-System-end-cap.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-System-end-cap-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Stashed SpaceRail Storage System end cap\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-System-end-cap-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-System-end-cap-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-System-end-cap-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-System-end-cap-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-System-end-cap-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-System-end-cap.jpeg 1280w\" /></a><figcaption>Easily removable end cap.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-System-joining-kit.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-System-joining-kit-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Stashed SpaceRail Storage System joining kit\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-System-joining-kit-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-System-joining-kit-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-System-joining-kit-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-System-joining-kit-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-System-joining-kit-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-System-joining-kit.jpeg 1280w\" /></a><figcaption>SpaceRail Joining Kit</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I then added the end cap to one end and the SpaceRail Joining kit to the other end of the installed SpaceRail.

It took me approximately 30 minutes to get the two SpaceRails installed and ready to accept the six bike hooks. Hooks are easily installed by simply keeping one end free of the end cap and sliding them into the Space Rail. Once they are all slid in, install the end cap and it is ready to store your bikes. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>SpaceRail Performance</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-System-SpaceRail-Bike-Hook-with-spacers.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-System-SpaceRail-Bike-Hook-with-spacers-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Stashed SpaceRail Storage System SpaceRail Bike Hook with spacers\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-System-SpaceRail-Bike-Hook-with-spacers-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-System-SpaceRail-Bike-Hook-with-spacers-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-System-SpaceRail-Bike-Hook-with-spacers-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-System-SpaceRail-Bike-Hook-with-spacers-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-System-SpaceRail-Bike-Hook-with-spacers-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-System-SpaceRail-Bike-Hook-with-spacers.jpeg 1280w\" /></a><figcaption>the SpaceRail Bike Hook with spacers installed.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Once I got the SpaceRails installed on my ceiling, and ready to install the bike hooks, I noticed that the instructions stated that I should measure the width of the axel/fork leg width.

I love that you can swivel the bikes to stagger them and get them really close. I’ve got 5 bikes stored that only span 4’7″ wide… that’s impressive and an overall pretty small footprint considering one bike has the 810mm wide Tumbleweed Persuader Bar and another bike’s got the Redshift Sports 50cm Kitchen Sink Bar. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I found the system a snap to install and even easier to use on a daily basis as it’s a breeze to slide the bikes apart, pick your steed and pull it down for a ride. The quality of all of the parts seems top notch and I have zero reason to believe that they won’t last a good long time. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-System-soft-polymer-cover-e1686270604638.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"372\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-System-soft-polymer-cover-e1686270604638-800x372.jpeg\" alt=\"Stashed SpaceRail Storage System soft polymer cover\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-System-soft-polymer-cover-e1686270604638-800x372.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-System-soft-polymer-cover-e1686270604638-297x138.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-System-soft-polymer-cover-e1686270604638-120x56.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-System-soft-polymer-cover-e1686270604638-768x357.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stashed-SpaceRail-Storage-System-soft-polymer-cover-e1686270604638.jpeg 1257w\" /></a><figcaption>Replaceable protective Polymer insert</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The hooks have a replaceable protective polymer cover that doesn’t seem to be marring my rims.
