Ford, Stellantis, and General Motors have all reached tentative agreements with the UAW over the past 10 days. Now, the union wants to focus its attention on automakers like Toyota and Tesla, who have resisted unionization or opened plants in <a href=\"https://aflcio.org/issues/right-work\">right-to-work</a> states that are hostile to collective bargaining.</p>\n<p>The UAW began strike action <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/09/thousands-of-workers-go-on-strike-at-ford-gm-and-stellantis-plants/\">at three car factories in mid-September</a>, the first time in the union's history that it initiated industrial action against all three of the big US automakers simultaneously.</p>\n<p>After watching years of executive pay raise largesse, the union asked for a 36 percent pay increase spread over four years, the return of cost-of-living adjustments, and the return of defined-benefit pensions.
