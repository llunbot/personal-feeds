The feedback from Hunt’s gravel pros who raced on the wheels was that although they valued the aero performance and stability, they wanted lower weight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So Hunt set out to reduce its successor wheelset’s weight while maintaining or improving the aero performance. It has achieved the former by incorporating into the new 40 LGA gravel wheels much of the tech it introduced in the road-going <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/hunt-sub50-limitless-wheelset-review\" target=\"_blank\">Sub50 Limitless Aero Disc wheelset</a>, which was released in February 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Hunt 40 Limitless Gravel Aero\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-1-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-1-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-1-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-1-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-1-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-1-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Hunt Wheels</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That includes adopting carbon spokes – although steel spokes remain an option for the new wheels. The stronger carbon spokes have allowed it to reduce the spoke count to 20 from the steel-spoked variant’s 24 front and rear. At the same time, Hunt claims that the wheels are laterally stiffer, with the carbon spokes also transmitting less vibration to the rider than steel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hunt’s carbon spokes use conventional nipples, so the wheels can be trued or a spoke replaced if needed. The brand offers a lifetime crash repair/replacement warranty on all variants of the wheelset.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-2-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-2-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-2-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-2-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-2-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-2-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-2-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-2-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Hunt Wheels</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Further weight reduction comes from Hunt’s latest 314g per set H_Ratchet DBL alloy hubs, which have a 48-tooth <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-is-a-freehub\" target=\"_blank\">ratchet freehub</a> with 7.5-degree engagement.

optimised the 40 LGA wheels for 40mm and 45mm <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-the-best-gravel-bike-tyres\" target=\"_blank\">Schwalbe G-One Allround</a> and G-One R tyres, as it says that these are the most popular widths for its gravel pros. With knobblier tyres, the side knobs dominate the results of aero testing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It started its aero development with a set of 42 different rim profiles, performing around 2,500 hours of CFD simulations to whittle this starting set down to three front wheel and five rear wheel profiles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These it progressed to wind tunnel testing with a complete bike, first with 3D printed mock-ups then with carbon fibre prototypes. There’s a full white paper available on <a href=\"https://www.huntbikewheels.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Hunt’s website</a> if you want to dig into the details.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its testing concluded that the best aero performance, with good handling and stability, was achieved with a front wheel that’s 40mm deep, with a 36mm external/27mm internal width. At the rear it uses a slightly deeper 41mm profile that’s 35mm wide externally and 26mm internally. Although wide, that’s still quite a bit less than the width of the new <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/zipp-303-xplr-wheels\" target=\"_blank\">Zipp 303 XPLR gravel wheels</a>, which are 32mm wide internally, although they’re also heavier at a claimed 1,496g.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hunt says that aero performance is most important at the front wheel, where airflow is more laminar, while lower weight is a more significant consideration at the rear wheel, as airflow there is already turbulent.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-3-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-3-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-3-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-3-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-3-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-3-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-3-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-3-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-3-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Hunt-40-Limitless-Gravel-Aero-3-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Hunt Wheels</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Hunt has adopted a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/hookless-rims\" target=\"_blank\">hookless bead</a> design, as it says that this results in a better tyre profile, with straighter sidewalls.

Tests took place at the GST Windkanal wind tunnel in Immenstaad, Germany. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It claims that only the 3T Discus 45 / 40 wheels were more aero, but that this is achieved with 314g extra weight, so that once weight is taken into consideration its new wheels’ performance is best in class for aero gravel wheelsets.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Prices and availability</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The premium spec Hunt 40 LGA wheelset, complete with CeramicSpeed bearings and 20 carbon spokes front and rear has a list price of £2,449 / $2,989 / €2,898 and a claimed 1,328g weight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Swapping from CeramicSpeed to steel bearings, with the same carbon spokes, the weight remains the same, but the price decreases to  £1,849 / $2,279 / €2,279. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With 24 steel spokes and steel bearings, the claimed weight is 1,431g and the price is £1,479 / $1,849 / €1,849.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Hunt 40 Limitless Gravel Aero wheelset can be pre-ordered immediately, with a limited number of wheelsets slated for delivery in late November.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-tubeless-sealant\">Best tubeless sealant for road and gravel bike tyres</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/hookless-rims\">Hooked vs hookless rims: Pros, cons and which is right for you</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-gravel-bike-upgrades\">Best gravel bike upgrades for every budget</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/road-gravel-bike-rim-width\">Road and gravel bike rim width: What’s best and why?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/hunt-40-limitless-gravel-aero\">Hunt lowers weight, ups the aero on its new 40 Limitless Gravel Aero wheelset</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"pnorman","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"a151e9cb6c7943d4ec7725e8ff316bd6d37e5698849396a9dafc2b73cb684105","category":"Cycling"}
