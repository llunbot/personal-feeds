The California Theatre is a beautiful space, and I do so enjoy meeting the readers and listeners who attend. The enthusiasm from the audience is always palpable. All year long, as I write this website and record podcasts, I know, in the back of my mind, that I have a big audience out there. But man, when I walk out on stage at the WWDC live show, I can <em>feel</em> it. It’s quite a thing.</p>\n\n<p>I hope to see you there.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/03/tickets-for-the-talk-show-live-from-wwdc-2024\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f7e279cc68680fd29cf249af61d6873274550c636a1e3ab680270d65d1b62b76","category":"Tech"}
