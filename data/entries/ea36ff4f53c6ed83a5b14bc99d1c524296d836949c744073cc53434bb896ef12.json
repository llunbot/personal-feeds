Now, in a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the popular online forum has revealed that it will bring in $203 million from that and other unspecified AI data licensing contracts over the next three years.</p>\n<p>Reddit's Form S-1—<a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000162828024006294/reddits-1q423.htm\">published by the SEC</a> late Thursday ahead of the site's planned stock IPO—says the company expects $66.4 million of that data-derived value from LLM companies to come during the 2024 calendar year. Bloomberg previously reported the Google deal to be worth an estimated $60 million a year, suggesting that the three-year deal represents the vast majority of its AI licensing revenue so far.</p>\n<p>Google and other AI companies that license Reddit's data will receive \"continuous access to [Reddit's] data API as well as quarterly transfers of Reddit data over the term of the arrangement,\" according to the filing. That constant, real-time access is particularly valuable, the site writes in the filing, because \"Reddit data constantly grows and regenerates as users come and interact with their communities and each other.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005584#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005584&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ea36ff4f53c6ed83a5b14bc99d1c524296d836949c744073cc53434bb896ef12","category":"Tech"}
