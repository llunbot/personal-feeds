The special edition includes silver-striped graphics inspired by one of Markus’ tattoos, and killer custom-finished Campagnolo Super Record and Scope Artech components. While most bike brands celebrate their anniversary of building bikes, Storck likes to celebrate the birthday of their industry-innovating founder.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Storck 60th Signature road, gravel &amp; ebikes</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Limited edition Storck 60th Signature models include Markus’ favorite aero road Aerfast.5 60th, the lightweight road Aernario.3 60th, gravel race Grix.2 60th bikes, and the gravel &amp; all-road e:Grix 60th ebike. They all feature a “Satin Dragon Dark Silver” paint job, the highlight of which is a crest adorned with the dragon of Markus Storck’s first tattoo.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Storck-60th-Signature-road-gravel-ebikes_silver-dragon-logo-and-custom-ultralight-wheels-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Storck-60th-Signature-road-gravel-ebikes_silver-dragon-logo-and-custom-ultralight-wheels-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Storck 60th Signature edition bikes, custom dragon tattoo graphics\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Storck-60th-Signature-road-gravel-ebikes_silver-dragon-logo-and-custom-ultralight-wheels-jpg.webp 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Storck-60th-Signature-road-gravel-ebikes_silver-dragon-logo-and-custom-ultralight-wheels-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Storck-60th-Signature-road-gravel-ebikes_silver-dragon-logo-and-custom-ultralight-wheels-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Storck-60th-Signature-road-gravel-ebikes_silver-dragon-logo-and-custom-ultralight-wheels-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Storck-60th-Signature-road-gravel-ebikes_silver-dragon-logo-and-custom-ultralight-wheels-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Storck-60th-Signature-road-gravel-ebikes_silver-dragon-logo-and-custom-ultralight-wheels-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Storck-60th-Signature-road-gravel-ebikes_silver-dragon-logo-and-custom-ultralight-wheels-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Storck)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Each <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?s=storck\" target=\"_blank\">Storck</a> bike in the series is also numbered, with just 60 total being made.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Custom Signature details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Storck-60th-Signature-road-gravel-ebikes_custom-Campoagnolo-Super-Record-crankset-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Storck-60th-Signature-road-gravel-ebikes_custom-Campoagnolo-Super-Record-crankset-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Storck 60th Signature edition bikes, custom Campy Super Record crankset\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Storck-60th-Signature-road-gravel-ebikes_custom-Campoagnolo-Super-Record-crankset-jpg.webp 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Storck-60th-Signature-road-gravel-ebikes_custom-Campoagnolo-Super-Record-crankset-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Storck-60th-Signature-road-gravel-ebikes_custom-Campoagnolo-Super-Record-crankset-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Storck-60th-Signature-road-gravel-ebikes_custom-Campoagnolo-Super-Record-crankset-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Storck-60th-Signature-road-gravel-ebikes_custom-Campoagnolo-Super-Record-crankset-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Storck-60th-Signature-road-gravel-ebikes_custom-Campoagnolo-Super-Record-crankset-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Storck-60th-Signature-road-gravel-ebikes_custom-Campoagnolo-Super-Record-crankset-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, the limited edition “shiny sparkling silver stripes” paint is nice, but it’s the customization of components that really ties it all together. The highlight is probably the custom <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2023-campagnolo-super-record-wireless-road-bike-groupset/\" target=\"_blank\">Campagnolo Super Record Wireless</a> groupset offered for the two road bike builds. Similar to the new Campy <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/campagnolo-super-record-s-wireless-special-edition-road-bike-groupset-drops-in-price/\" target=\"_blank\">Super Record S</a>, this limited edition gives the original lighter wireless groupset a matte carbon finish.
