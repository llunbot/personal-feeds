Bringing Apple executives into\nspatial media wasn’t just a world first; it was a glimpse of how\nshared experiences can transcend screens,” said Adam Lisagor, CEO\nand founder of Sandwich Vision. “This year, we’re not just adding\nfeatures — we’re refining how people can feel connected, curious,\nand delighted together, again and again. Our goal is to make\npresence and participation the new standard for special events,\nwhere technology fades away, and what remains is the shared magic\nof being there.”</p>\n\n<p>The livestream will be available in both 2D and 3D formats. While\nthe 2D stream will be offered free of charge, the premium 3D\nimmersive experience will be available for $11.99 for tickets\npurchased in advance, increasing to $14.99 on the day of the\nevent. All ticket holders will receive permanent access to a\npristine 6K version of the event to watch forever.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Make your purchases right in the <a href=\"https://theater.sandwich.vision/\">Theater app</a>. I’m snarky in the press release linked above, but I actually thought doing this last year was incredibly cool. Afterwards it was like I got to watch myself perform my own show, which was a lot weirder than just watching myself on regular video.</p>\n\n<p>If you can make the show, <a href=\"https://ti.to/daringfireball/the-talk-show-live-from-wwdc-2025\">you really should attend</a>. Everyone tells me it’s fun. But if you can’t make the show, you definitely should watch live in Theater.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/06/05/theater-livestream-the-talk-show-live-from-wwdc-2025\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d530d4edc4eabdc7d1fd652018db9ef997a42a3ea52355e92b91f484e437d975","category":"Tech"}
