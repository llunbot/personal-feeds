Additionally, the move only affects vehicles that have been imported since May 2, which should only appear in dealerships in late June—any cars already in inventory are not subject to the price rise.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/ford-says-price-rises-on-mexican-made-cars-dont-cover-the-cost-of-tariffs/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/ford-says-price-rises-on-mexican-made-cars-dont-cover-the-cost-of-tariffs/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
