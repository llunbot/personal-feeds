There, I saw myself gripped by weekly installments of my new favorite TV series, itself based on Marvel's <em>Eternals</em>.</p>\n<p>This dream series felt like a more <em>Lost</em>-ified version of the old TV show <em>Heroes</em>, where mythological icons contended with a mix of global stakes and emotional bonds, then had to unite with both purpose and superpowers over a complicated span of thousands of years. Each episode focused on one or two of the lead characters—and juxtaposed those stars' current-day relationships with beautifully rendered, historically accurate callbacks to their adventures in other epochs.</p>\n<p>I was so disengaged and disappointed by the new Marvel film adaptation—premiering exclusively in theaters on Friday, November 5—that my mind wandered into a different kind of \"what if\" than <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/07/marvels-what-if-trailer-takes-the-mcu-to-a-weird-but-wonderful-place/\">Marvel Studios likely intended</a>. To its credit, <em>Eternals</em> regularly snapped me out of that daydream. I would still recommend it as an intriguing addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1809705#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1809705&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"86ee69c7ce99206bcfafb787fb54bc1e1b08d57e61a7152cba30211a76ab559f","category":"Tech"}
