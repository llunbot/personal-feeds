After his existing hardware was lost in a fire, Google stepped in to create an open source, highly configurable, low-cost alternative to expensive replacement hardware, powered by machine learning. While AI’s broader existence is proving divisive, we set out to discover whether AI, when used for good, could be the future of gaming accessibility.</p>\n<p>It’s important to <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/guide-artificial-intelligence/\">define AI, and machine learning</a>, to understand clearly how they work in Gameface. When we use the terms “AI” and “machine learning,” we’re referring to both the same and different things. </p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1952851#p3\">Read 28 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1952851&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fc7844c546f6aa0762d56b7bf74699fd9372816cdcc9cd7e7d47922a3d17ec49","category":"Tech"}
