The app offers exclusive drone views and stereoscopic footage of Balenciaga's Spring/Summer 2025 show, which was held in Shanghai on May 30.

The app provides high-resolution 3D models of Rimowa's products, enabling users to examine the craftsmanship and design from various angles. It also includes features like virtual try-ons, where users can see how different suitcase models look and function in a virtual space. Additionally, the app offers a virtual showroom experience, allowing users to customize their luggage with different colors and accessories, and view the changes in real time. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nBalenciaga and Rimowa's apps are part of a broader trend among luxury brands exploring the potential of the Vision Pro. Gucci, also a Kering-owned label like Balenciaga, released its own Vision Pro app in April, allowing users to access an immersive mini-documentary on creative director Sabato De Sarno and the creation of Gucci's Spring/Summer 2024 collection. Other retailers, including Mytheresa, J.Crew, and E.l.f.
