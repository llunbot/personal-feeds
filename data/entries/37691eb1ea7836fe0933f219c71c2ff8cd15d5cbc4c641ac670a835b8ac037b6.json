But the most disturbing sights aren't always the most grievous ailments—as a recent case in Ohio demonstrates. A man there developed a completely benign condition. His prognosis was excellent. He recovered in full, quickly. Yet, for any observer, a ghastly glimpse of his mild malady may cause acute discomfort and enduring trauma.</p>\n<p>The man briefly developed an unusual condition in which a shaggy carpet of green fibers covered his tongue, according to <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMicm2300789?query=featured_secondary\">a report</a> in the New England Journal of Medicine. (If you dare, <a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/nejmicm2300789_f1.jpeg\">an image of the man's tongue can be found here</a>.) The thick, plush mat of foul fur was a form of hairy tongue syndrome. The most common version of this condition is black—which is also pretty disturbing. But, in exceptional cases, the repulsive rug can also appear as tongue-colored, brown, yellow, blue, or green.</p>\n<p>The rare hue seemed to initially stump doctors, who prescribed him an antifungal medication after assuming the fuzzy eruption was a yeast infection. But, after a course of the drugs, his oral outgrowth remained in all its glory. After that, doctors at the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base medical center diagnosed it as hairy tongue syndrome.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1952298#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1952298&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"37691eb1ea7836fe0933f219c71c2ff8cd15d5cbc4c641ac670a835b8ac037b6","category":"Tech"}
