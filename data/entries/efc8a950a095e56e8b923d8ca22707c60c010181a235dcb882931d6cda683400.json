If you are too, I’m happy that among other resources available, the AWS community also has a <a href=\"https://community.aws/generative-ai\">space that I can access for generative AI tools and guides</a>.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Last week’s launches</strong></span><br /> Here are some launches that got my attention during the previous week.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-chat-experience-for-aws-glue-using-natural-language-amazon-q-data-integration-in-aws-glue-preview/\">Amazon Q data integration in AWS Glue (Preview)</a> – Now you can use natural language to ask Amazon Q to author jobs, troubleshoot issues, and answer questions about AWS Glue and data integration. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/q/\">Amazon Q</a> was launched in preview at AWS re:invent 2023, and is a generative AI–powered assistant to help you solve problems, generate content, and take action.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/announcing-cdk-migrate-a-single-command-to-migrate-to-the-aws-cdk/\">General availability of CDK Migrate</a> – CDK Migrate is a component of the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/home.html\">AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK)</a> that enables you to migrate <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/\">AWS CloudFormation</a> templates, previously deployed CloudFormation stacks, or resources created outside of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) into a CDK application. This feature was launched alongside the CloudFormation <a href=\"https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/iac-generator\">IaC Generator</a> to give you an end-to-end experience that enables you to create an IaC configuration based off a resource, as well as its relationships. You can expect the IaC generator to have a huge impact for a <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/import-entire-applications-into-aws-cloudformation/\">common use case</a> we’ve seen.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/new/\">For a full list of AWS announcements, be sure to keep an eye on the What’s New at AWS page.</a></p> \n<p><strong><span>Other AWS news</span></strong><br /> Here are some additional projects, programs, and news items that you might find interesting:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/02/05/catjockey.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/02/05/catjockey.png\" width=\"299\" height=\"299\" /></a></p> \n<p>Join the <a href=\"https://awspartyrockhackathon.devpost.com/\">PartyRock Generative AI Hackathon by AWS</a>.
