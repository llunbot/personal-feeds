(credit: <a href=\"https://a24films.com/\">A24</a>)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>The tale of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, immortalized in a 14th-century anonymous poem, is among the most popular of the Arthurian legends, second only to the quest for the Holy Grail. Yet I would argue that it has never been <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gawain_and_the_Green_Knight_(film)\">successfully adapted to film</a>—until now. Director David Lowery's new film, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Green_Knight_(film)\"><em>The Green Knight</em></a>, takes some necessary liberties with the source material. But he also artfully weaves in elements and symbols from that source material to create a darkly brooding fantasy quest that is just as richly textured and layered as the medieval poem on which it is based.</p>\n<p><strong>(Major spoilers for the 14th-century medieval poem below; some additional spoilers for the film are below the gallery.)</strong></p>\n<p>Let's lay out the basics of the original poem before discussing the clever ways in which Lowery (<em>A Ghost Story</em>, <em>Pete's Dragon</em>) has reimagined it. As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/05/an-arthurian-knight-embarks-on-a-daring-quest-in-the-green-knight-trailer/\">I've written previously</a>, <em>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight</em> falls into the chivalric romance genre, relating a well-known story from Arthurian legend in distinctively alliterative verse. (Alliteration was all the rage at the time. I highly recommend <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/0345277600/?tag=arstech20-20\">J.R.R. Tolkien's translation</a> from 1925 or Simon Armitage's 2008 translation, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/0571340164/?tag=arstech20-20\">recently revised</a>.)</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1783822#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1783822&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c4c434f6590de75ea4989e6e267e2a923397b1f75d0a43c1ecdb3ac89195c02d","category":"Tech"}
