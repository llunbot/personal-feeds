Over the past year, NYSOFA has partnered with Intuition Robotics to bring ElliQ to over 800 seniors struggling with loneliness. In a report last week, officials said they had given out hundreds and had <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/newyork/news/new-york-partners-with-robotics-company-to-pair-seniors-with-ai-companions/\">only 150 available devices</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://elliq.com/\">ElliQ</a> includes a tablet and a two-piece lamp-like robot with a head that lights up and rotates to face a speaker. Marketed as powered by \"<a href=\"https://www.intuitionrobotics.com/\">Cognitive AI technology</a>,\" it proactively engages in conversations with users, giving them reminders and prompts, such as asking them how they're doing, telling them it's time to check their blood pressure or take their medicine, and asking if they want to have a video call with family. Speaking with a female voice, the robot is designed to hold human-like conversations, engage in small talk, express empathy, and share humor. It can provide learning and wellness programs, such as audiobooks and relaxation exercises.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1990239#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1990239&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2d927af5a905f0c94c4971266e566c73c09695fcd30f42b3ef5b425985af738c","category":"Tech"}
