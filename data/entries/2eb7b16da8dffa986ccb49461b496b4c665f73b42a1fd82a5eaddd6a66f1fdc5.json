Customers and technology leaders are united on one point: hybrid complexity is growing, and enterprises need real solutions. AI needs data from every corner of the enterprise to be effective. With <a href=\"https://newsroom.ibm.com/2025-05-06-ibm-accelerates-enterprise-gen-ai-revolution-with-hybrid-capabilities\">one billion apps expected</a> by 2028, organizations are under increasing pressure to deliver hybrid cloud programs that scale. </p>\n\n<p>Armon Dadger, HashiCorp Co-Founder and CTO, spoke as part of the keynote on AI automation for hybrid enterprises, which spotlighted the growing need to address the challenges of hybrid cloud programs and the central role of infrastructure lifecycle management (ILM) and security lifecycle management (SLM). He addressed Day 0 concerns related to launching enterprise hybrid cloud programs and adopting automation workflows like infrastructure as code (IaC) and identity-based access control, through to Day 2+ concerns related to standardization, optimization, security, and compliance.</p>\n\n<p>Together with Peter Leukert, CIO &amp; Managing Director, Deutsche Telekom IT GmbH, Rob Thomas, Senior Vice President, Software and Chief Commercial Officer, IBM, and Madhu Kochar, Vice President, Automation, IBM Software, they explored how automation (centered around ILM and SLM) and intelligent integration (combining AI and real-time data to streamline workflows and connect systems across hybrid environments) are becoming essential for organizations navigating hybrid cloud environments to underpin their growing number of applications in the coming years</p>\n\n<h2>Technology for smarter hybrid cloud operations</h2>\n\n<p>At Think, IBM unveiled a series of hybrid technologies designed to eliminate long-standing barriers to scaling enterprise AI—signaling a new chapter in hybrid cloud automation where HashiCorp plays a foundational role.</p>\n\n<h3>Streamlining integration across hybrid environments</h3>\n\n<p>IBM announced the upcoming general availability of <strong>webMethods Hybrid Integration (GA in June)</strong>, a new solution that replaces rigid, manual workflows with API- and agent-driven automation. This technology helps enterprises simplify integration across diverse systems—including applications, gateways, and partner ecosystems—enabling faster innovation and reduced operational overhead.</p>\n\n<h3>Advancing automation with HashiCorp</h3>\n\n<p>As part of IBM’s hybrid cloud and automation strategy, HashiCorp is <strong>deepening synergies across the IBM portfolio</strong> to help enterprises simplify and scale their infrastructure operations. Customers can now take advantage of integrations that bring HashiCorp’s Infrastructure and Security Lifecycle capabilities into IBM’s broader hybrid ecosystem, enabling secure provisioning, consistent policy enforcement, and lifecycle automation for complex environments.</p>\n\n<h3>Strengthening resilience with AI-powered insights</h3>\n\n<p><strong>IBM also introduced Concert Resilience Posture</strong>, a new capability within IBM Concert that uses watsonx AI and Red Hat platforms to deliver real-time operational insights. By surfacing prioritized alerts and expert-informed recommendations, this solution helps organizations accelerate remediation and improve resilience across hybrid estates. </p>\n\n<h2>The path forward</h2>\n\n<p>For over a decade, HashiCorp has helped organizations adopt cloud operating models at scale. Together with IBM, we’re helping customers make the calculated, strategic decisions required to succeed in a world where AI and hybrid cloud are converging fast.</p>\n\n<p>As hybrid cloud adoption accelerates, HashiCorp and IBM remain focused on delivering the automation and security enterprises need to succeed - and do hybrid cloud right.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em><a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/think/videos/think-keynotes/ai-automation-hybrid-world?utm_source=hashicorp.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=26Q2_WW_BDM_IBM-Think&amp;utm_content=end-of-blog-cta&amp;utm_offer=video\">Watch the full keynote</a> and learn more about what organizations can do differently.</em></strong></p>\n","author":"Meghan Liese","siteTitle":"HashiCorp Blog","siteHash":"219aa6310b3388f2335eba49871f4df9581f2c58eaeb5e498363b54e835b7001","entryHash":"2eb7b16da8dffa986ccb49461b496b4c665f73b42a1fd82a5eaddd6a66f1fdc5","category":"Tech"}
