It does so many things, but because you have to log into it on so many devices, there’s always a risk of your account being compromised, even if you are careful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How can you tell if your Apple Account has been hacked? And if so, what can you do to get back control? Here are a few things you should know in case your Apple Account has been compromised.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Warnings that your Apple Account has been compromised</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple may alert you to any suspicious activity with your Apple Account, but depending on how it has been compromised, here are some warning signs that someone is making an unauthorized attempt to access your Apple Account:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Notifications</strong>. Apple sends a notification or an email when an attempt to log on from an unrecognized device, or when an attempt to change your password is made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Unsolicited two-factor authentication code</strong>. You get a code that you did not request, or you did not perform an action that triggers a code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Password failure</strong>. Your password stops working and messages appear that you need to input your password.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Unusual activity</strong>. You notice things are happening that you didn’t do, such as deleted files or sent emails or texts, or you may see an unfamiliar device in the Devices section of your Apple Account in Settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to check if someone is using your Apple Account</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from the above warnings, one surefire way to see if someone has accessed your Apple Account is to <strong>check the devices associated with your account</strong>. When signing into your <a href=\"https://account.apple.com\">Apple Account on the web</a>, you’ll see a <em>Devices</em> tab in the left column. Check it and you’ll see all devices that are connected to your Apple ID so you can check it for any unrecognizable ones. If you see any, you can click a device and click the “Remove from account button” to delete it. It’s a good practice to remove older devices as well in case you want to sell them or give them to a friend.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/apple-account-sign-in-security.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"apple account sign in security\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/apple-account-sign-in-security.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/apple-account-sign-in-security.jpg?resize=300%2C240&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/apple-account-sign-in-security.jpg?resize=768%2C614&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/apple-account-sign-in-security.jpg?resize=1200%2C960&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/apple-account-sign-in-security.jpg?resize=1536%2C1229&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/apple-account-sign-in-security.jpg?resize=2048%2C1638&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"960\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>Your <p>Apple Account information on the web at account.apple.com.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to regain control of your Apple Account</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can’t log into your Apple Account and think someone else has control of it, here is what you can do to take back the keys.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Reset your Apple Account password. </strong>If someone else is trying to access your account, you’ll want to immediately change your password. You can do that <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671530/how-reset-apple-id-forgot-password.html\">on your device in Settings</a> or by visiting <a href=\"https://iforgot.apple.com\">https://iforgot.apple.com</a>.

In Settings, your Apple Account info is at the very top. It should display your name, and when you tap it, you should see your name and the email address associated with the account.  In your Apple Account settings, check the <em>Sign-In &amp; Security</em> info and make sure the email and phone numbers match your info.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Set up two-factor authentication</strong>. In your <em>Apple Account Settings</em> &gt; <em>Sign-in &amp; Security</em>, you can activate two-factor authentication. When you log into your account, a notification on your trusted devices appears to alert you of the login. You’ll need to enter a six-digit code to authorize the action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Use a security key</strong>. For extra protection, you can use <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1666866/hardware-security-keys-apple-id.html\">a security key</a> that either plugs into the USB-C port on your iPhone or Mac or connects wirelessly via NFC. A security key is a keychain-sized hardware device that stores the credentials of your online accounts and connects to your device when you need to log into your Apple Account or other online account.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are more guides to help you with your Apple Account (Apple ID).</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671530/how-reset-apple-id-forgot-password.html\">How to reset an Apple ID password</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/233188/apple-id-how-to-change-your-email-address.html\">How to change your Apple Account primary email address</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671717/how-to-unlock-an-apple-id-thats-locked-or-disabled.html\">How to unlock an Apple ID that’s locked or disabled</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"a48475570045cba15f34d7cfc79d16a6b2faa4614826ac4b0a5925e006634e6c","category":"Apple"}
