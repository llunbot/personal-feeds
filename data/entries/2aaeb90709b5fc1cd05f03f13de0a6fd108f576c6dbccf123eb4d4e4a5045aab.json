Forget saggy, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-to-pack-your-cycling-jersey-pockets-like-a-pro\">overloaded pockets</a>, not taking enough carbs or sweaty phone screens; a top tube bag is a relatively inexpensive upgrade that can make a sizeable difference to your enjoyment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Top tube bags affix to your frame using either straps or bolts – though some are only compatible with frames that feature bottle bosses on the top tube, such as some <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-gravel-bike\">gravel bikes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-endurance-road-bikes\">endurance bikes</a>. The typical top tube bag has a capacity of 1L, but can range from around 0.8L to 2L. While most are relatively compact, some models extend further back along the top of the top tube, and some can also be fixed to the top tube near the seat post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Popularised in triathlon for nutrition storage, top tube bags are now a popular choice for road, gravel cyclists and bikepackers alike. They’re more aero than <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-handlebar-bag\">handlebar bags</a> and are more easy to reach on the go than a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-best-saddle-bags\">saddle bag</a>, or can be used in tandem with both as part of a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-best-bikepacking-bags\">bikepacking bag</a> set if you’re packing more kit for a longer ride. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever flavour of riding you have in mind, we’ve got a selection of picks to suit all tastes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Our pick of the best top tube bags</h2>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Tailfin Top Tube Bag – Flip 1.1L: £60</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Restrap Race Top Tube Bag Long: £74.99</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Ortlieb Toptube-Bag: £77</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Apidura Racing Bolt-On Top Tube Pack 1L: £54</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Wizard Works Go-Go Top Tube Bag 0.8L: £52</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Canyon Top Tube Bag Road: £28.85</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Rapha Explore 1L: £50</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Zefal Z Aero Frame Bag: £29</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Riverside 1 Litre Top Tube Bikepacking Bag ADVT 500:  £19.99</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Why trust Cyclist’s advice?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Anon-4-top-tube-bag-2-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Anon-4-top-tube-bag-2-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Anon-4-top-tube-bag-2-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Anon-4-top-tube-bag-2-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Anon-4-top-tube-bag-2-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Anon-4-top-tube-bag-2-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Anon-4-top-tube-bag-2-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Anon-4-top-tube-bag-2-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Anon-4-top-tube-bag-2-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Anon-4-top-tube-bag-2-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Anon-4-top-tube-bag-2-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Katherine Moore</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Here at <em>Cyclist</em> we’ve had our fair share of adventures on and off road over the years.

Both are available in either 1.1 or 1.5L sizes, with a further small 0.8L size in the zip configuration only.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tailfin recommends the 1.1L bag for road and gravel, and the larger 1.5L bag for MTB.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All top tube bags can be mounted either with the rubber cargo straps supplied or with bolts, with no steerer strap required. A longer strap is also supplied so that the bag can be used with a greater variety of frame shapes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than providing frame protection, the Tailfin top tube bags have been designed to eliminate frame damage, with their v-mount base preventing any movement and hence rubbing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The welded design means that the bag is totally waterproof too, so you can store more sensitive items such as a battery pack worry-free. For charging, there’s a cable port up front too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the shape has been designed to minimise knee rubbing (which can be an issue with some top tube bags), with a narrow base and taller shape for larger volume models.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://www.tailfin.cc/product/top-tube-cockpit/top-tube-bag-flip/?v=7885444af42e\" target=\"_blank\">Tailfin

Part of the Yorkshire-based brand’s Race range, the bag has been designed for audaxing and ultra-distance riding, but could be equally useful on your everyday rides for extra storage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plastic inserts help the large bag keep its shape, and it anchors not only to the top tube but also the head tube using a hook and bungee fastening, and the seat post with a webbing strap and clip. The top tube attachments are made of hypalon; a tough, durable material that sticks well to the frame with minimal slippage. The rear strap is also adjustable through four positions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as the main interior compartment, which is accessed via the quality, two-way YKK Aquaguard zip, there is also a stretchy mesh pocket at either side near the cockpit, perfect for stuffing in wrappers or a few easy-to-reach items.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bag, handmade in <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/restrap-bags-cycling\">Restrap’s Yorkshire factory</a>, is subject to a lifetime warranty, and is finished with reflective logo detailing for a little added low-light visibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ortlieb Toptube-Bag</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Ortlieb-top-tube-bag-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Ortlieb-top-tube-bag-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Ortlieb-top-tube-bag-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Ortlieb-top-tube-bag-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Ortlieb-top-tube-bag-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Ortlieb-top-tube-bag-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Ortlieb-top-tube-bag-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Ortlieb-top-tube-bag-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Ortlieb-top-tube-bag-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Ortlieb-top-tube-bag-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Ortlieb-top-tube-bag-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Katherine Moore</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>£77 | <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6821&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclestore.co.uk%2Fortlieb_bikepacking_fuelpack_toptube_bag_1_litre-ID_86834\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Generous 1.5L capacity</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Bolt-on or strap-on mount with quick release function, plus phone mount</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>258g including all fixtures</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For expedition-style cycling, it’s hard to beat Ortlieb’s decades of expertise, and the same goes for its roomy top tube bag. Some might call it over-engineered, but for a supremely stable addition to your setup that’s easy to use and also boasts a top-loading phone mount, it’s a clever bit of kit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bag attaches to your bike either directly to top tube bolts (direct mount) or using a pair of rubber O-straps. Both offer an easy-release function, with a plastic fixture on the bottom of the bag and another secured to the top tube.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bag is easily opened and closed with a top flap secured by a pair of very effective magnets, revealing a roomy main compartment and smaller side pocket. On the top, the daisy chain slots can be fitted with an elasticated attachment that holds a phone. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bag is totally waterproof, with a PU coating and welded rather than stitched seams. An internal plastic frame helps the bag to keep its cuboid shape. Choose between black or dark sand colourways, both covered by Ortlieb’s five year warranty.</p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apidura Racing Bolt-On Top Tube Pack 1L</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Apidura-top-tube-bag-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Apidura-top-tube-bag-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Apidura-top-tube-bag-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Apidura-top-tube-bag-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Apidura-top-tube-bag-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Apidura-top-tube-bag-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Apidura-top-tube-bag-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Apidura-top-tube-bag-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Apidura-top-tube-bag-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Apidura-top-tube-bag-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Apidura-top-tube-bag-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Katherine Moore</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>£54 | <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6821&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.condorcycles.com%2Fproducts%2Fapidura-expedition-bolt-on-top-tube-pack%3Fsiteid%3D122609%26variant%3D44487130710337\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>1L capacity </strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Bolt-on fitting, flip-top magnetic closure and waterproof construction</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>111g including bolts</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Apidura is highly regarded as one of the market leaders when it comes to performance bikepacking bags, and the Racing Bolt-On Top Tube Bag has been designed with ultra distance events and gravel racing in mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This bag is bolt-on only (strap attachment bag available separately), and provided with a handy cardboard guide to help you fit the bag optimally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apdiura’s bag is made from its proprietary Hexalon fabric, and is totally waterproof complete with welded seams.

interesting aesthetics than most. However, the webbing and buckle straps aren’t great, so you’re best off using the bolt-on function or upgrading the straps to rubberised ones, such as Voile straps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mid-sized bag has an internal pocket as well as a mesh pocket on either side externally, and a cable port up front. The front strap can also be moved in two positions, making it more adaptable for a range of setups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this entry-level price you do sacrifice waterproofing, as it is a stitched ripstop fabric bag with a standard zip. If waterproofing is a priority, Riverside also makes a waterproof top tube bag for £34.99.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you enjoy this design, there’s also a frame bag, saddle bag and handlebar bag in the range, plus a larger 1.4L top tube bag.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy now from<a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6821&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.decathlon.co.uk%2Fp%2F1-litre-top-tube-bikepacking-bag-advt-500%2F_%2FR-p-350617\" target=\"_blank\"> Decathlon (£19.99)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to choose the best top tube bag for you</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"648\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Restrap-Race-Top-Tube-Short-Lifestyle_2000x-970x648.jpg\" alt=\"Restrap Race Short Top Tube Bag\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Restrap-Race-Top-Tube-Short-Lifestyle_2000x-970x648.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Restrap-Race-Top-Tube-Short-Lifestyle_2000x-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Restrap-Race-Top-Tube-Short-Lifestyle_2000x-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Restrap-Race-Top-Tube-Short-Lifestyle_2000x-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Restrap-Race-Top-Tube-Short-Lifestyle_2000x-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Restrap-Race-Top-Tube-Short-Lifestyle_2000x-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Restrap-Race-Top-Tube-Short-Lifestyle_2000x-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Restrap-Race-Top-Tube-Short-Lifestyle_2000x-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Restrap-Race-Top-Tube-Short-Lifestyle_2000x.jpg 1321w\" /><figcaption>Restrap</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>What can you store in a top tube bag?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can put anything you like in a top tube bag, capacity permitting. However they are best suited for securely carrying smaller items which can otherwise take up a lot of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-to-pack-your-cycling-jersey-pockets-like-a-pro\">jersey pocket space</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>House keys will be much safer in a bag rather than on your person in case of a crash, and top tube bags are also in a really accessible place, so <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-energy-gels-bars-chews\">snacks and gels</a> can be easily reached here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re on a longer ride, or it’s wet, you might like to transfer electrical items such as your phone or a battery pack into the top tube bag. Just make sure you look out for waterproof options if you’re planning on stowing electricals.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Are top tube bags aero?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Some top tube bags are more aero than others. Smaller, lower profile and more tear-drop shaped bags are likely to be aerodynamic compared to bulkier bags. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As they run in line with the bike’s frame, top tube bags are a more aerodynamic alternative to a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-handlebar-bag\">handlebar bag</a> and are also popular with triathletes for this reason.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Which are best, bolt-on or strap-on top tube bags?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The best attachment style for you will depend on your bike. You’ll need a pair of mounts on the top tube in order to use a bolt-on style top tube bag, which you won’t find on all bikes (they’re typically more common on newer gravel bikes).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Strap-on style top tube bags are much more versatile for this reason, and can easily be transferred between bikes too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The advantage of bolt-on top tube bags goes beyond their minimalist aesthetic; it can also help to prevent paint damage from straps around the frame, which can cause abrasion, especially when dirt and grit work their way in behind the straps. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/frame-protection-road-gravel-bikes\">Frame protection</a> kits can help prevent this damage.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Top tube bag vs handlebar bag, which is best?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The main differences between top tube bags and<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-handlebar-bag\"> handlebar bags</a> lie in capacity and ease of access. While you will likely be able to fit more in a handlebar bag, such as an extra layer, they’re typically harder to access while riding along. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What size top tube bag is best?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The capacity of the top tube bag that’s best for you will depend on its intended use. Looking for a little snack storage on longer road rides? Perhaps a smaller bag under 1L capacity would work best. Going on a multi-day expedition and seeking a safe space for your phone, passport, snacks and gloves? A much larger model is likely to suit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do be aware that larger top tube bags may become less stable or even rub your legs when fully-loaded. Bigger isn’t always better! </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-top-tube-bags\">Best top tube bags 2025 reviewed: Easy-access (and aero) storage on the bike</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Pnorman","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"2aaeb90709b5fc1cd05f03f13de0a6fd108f576c6dbccf123eb4d4e4a5045aab","category":"Cycling"}
