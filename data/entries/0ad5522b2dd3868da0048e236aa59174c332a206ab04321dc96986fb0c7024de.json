{"title":"Safariâ€™s Crowded Toolbar in iOS 15 Beta 4","link":"https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1420084637926363136","date":1627437500000,"content":"\n<p>Federico Viticci, on Twitter:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Thereâ€™s a total of <em>six</em> different touch targets in the iOS 15\nbeta 4 tab bar in Safari.</p>\n\n<p>These exclude the ability to long-press the tab bar, swipe across\nit to change tabs, and swipe it up to open the Tabs view.</p>\n\n<p>Iâ€™m â€¦ starting to think a single, small toolbar just wonâ€™t do. ðŸ˜¬</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/gruber/status/1420134055799033859\">I responded</a> that there are actually <em>nine</em> tap targets in the new toolbar in beta 4â€‰â€”â€‰Viticci didnâ€™t count the left / right edges that can be tapped like buttons to switch to the previous / next tabs. Thatâ€™s nine tappable buttons (or effective buttons) on a single phone-width toolbar. (My tweet says eight, but there are two separate tappable areas to bring up the URL address bar, one on each side of the minuscule reload button.)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/adaptivity-and-layout/\">Appleâ€™s own example in the HIG</a> of a toolbar thatâ€™s too crowded has â€¦ <a href=\"https://twitter.com/samthegeek/status/1420157962350366722\">nine items</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/parrots/status/1420086381204934665\">Curtis Herbert</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I really do appreciate the experimentation, but the new Safari\nfeels like something Iâ€™d take to the UI Design Labs at WWDC and\ntheyâ€™d push me to use native controls that users expect and\nalready know, have better tap targets, and stop cramming too many\nthings in a small space.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/07/27/safari-15b4-toolbar-viticci\">Â â˜…Â </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"0ad5522b2dd3868da0048e236aa59174c332a206ab04321dc96986fb0c7024de","category":"Tech"}
