This also conceals the forward-looking sensors much more elegantly than the normal S-Class.

That's the question that Mercedes-AMG decided to answer with its latest plug-in hybrid, the S 63 E Performance. It's a rare example of direct technology transfer from racing to a road car, albeit one that indulges its occupants with massages and even a beverage fridge.</p>\n<p>This is the second S-Class we've tested recently; in 2022, we tried out the mild hybrid <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/03/tech-works-with-you-not-against-you-in-the-mercedes-benz-s-class/\">S500 4Matic</a>, which impressed us with its technology and its comfort. And this is actually the second plug-in hybrid S-Class to be offered on the W223 platform—the $123,700 S580e combines a straight-six gasoline engine and electric motor and should be starting to appear in dealerships already.</p>\n<p>This is not that car. No, this is a Mercedes-AMG, which means it's been worked over by the company's in-house tuning division to make it all a little bit... extra. AMG started as an independent tuning operation in 1971 and rose to fame by building hotted-up road and racing versions of Mercedes models. It's also not due out until the end of the year, so we can't tell you how much it will cost, though with options, you can probably expect to get close to (or exceed) $200,000.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1950695#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1950695&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
