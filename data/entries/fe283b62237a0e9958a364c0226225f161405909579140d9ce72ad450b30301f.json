We found both the six- and eight-quart sizes of the Instant Pot on sale, and regardless of the size you choose, we're confident that this humble tool will be worth the small investment.</p>\n<p>In addition to the Instant Pot, we've also found some terrific deals on other kitchen tech.

Use it to slow-cook a roast to perfection as a crockpot replacement, or if you're pressed for time, you can cut the cooking time on some foods with the pressure-cooking function. In my house, next to the oven, the Instant Pot is the most used appliance of all the countertop appliances that we own. The best part is that the Instant Pot is on sale for up to nearly 25 percent off.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1932989#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1932989&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Chuong Nguyen","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fe283b62237a0e9958a364c0226225f161405909579140d9ce72ad450b30301f","category":"Tech"}
