Just look at those route choices around/through the Alps. And at the pointy end of the race, the finishing straight is France. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TCRNo7?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TCRNo7</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/uiNu5PJtaW\">pic.twitter.com/uiNu5PJtaW</a></p>\n<p>— Kat Young (@KEYoung29) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KEYoung29/status/1158416035277680640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 5, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n</div>\n<h2>What is the appeal of dotwatching?</h2>\n<p>Dotwatching is the way to follow an ultracycling race, which usually spans a few thousand kilometres, and many find that watching a dot on a map transportive.</p>\n<p>'You can follow a rider on an epic race, wherever they are in the world, and all it requires is a bit of imagination,' explains Beccy Waters who works for <a href=\"https://dotwatcher.cc/\">DotWatcher</a>, a website dedicated to dotwatching.</p>\n<p>'It is so addictive; you won't want to leave the map alone and the community is great too.'</p>\n<p>Dotwatching maps, known as dot maps, are often filled with data such as how long a person has stopped for, and how much time they've spent on and off the bike.</p>\n<p>'For those who are detail-oriented, dotwatching is great as you can analyse all of a rider's decisions, route, and sleep time, and discuss with other dotwatchers whether you think they made the best choice' adds Waters.</p>\n<p>The dot map is also important for the riders as it is the only way most racers know where the others are.</p>\n<p>'There are varying strategies on how riders use the map,' says Waters. 'Some choose not to look at it at all, some prefer to wait until a few days into the race whilst others look at it all the time.</p>\n<p>'Where another rider's dot is on the map can really impact another rider's decision on whether to stop, sleep or carry on.'</p>\n<div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SilkroadMtnRace?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@SilkroadMtnRace</a> started this morning, looks like Sofiane has taken a quick lead.

'Some of our volunteers are very experienced and have been dotwatching for years, others are new and intrigued by the race.</p>\n<p>'Dotwatching is a really great introduction to the race as it gives you an idea of the competition and the kind of scrutiny that will be on you when you are racing.</p>\n<p>'People think they will just check the map briefly but hours later they are still there. You get totally hooked.'</p>\n<p>Notably the website DotWatcher has seen a massive increase in appetite for dotwatching women's racing.</p>\n<p>'We make sure we keep abreast of anything going on with the women in a race,' says Waters. 'All our commentators are volunteers, and we have to make sure they mention the women who are racing as people want to hear about it.'</p>\n<div>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/tcrno5?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#tcrno5</a> has only just started 30 mins ago, and already people are heading in totally different directions.
