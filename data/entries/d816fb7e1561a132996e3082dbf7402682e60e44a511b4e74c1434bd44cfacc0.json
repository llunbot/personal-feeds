Dolphins have been observed using sea sponges to protect their beaks while foraging for food, and sea otters will break open shellfish like abalone with rocks. Several species of fish also use tools to hunt and crack open shellfish, as well as to clear a spot for nesting. And the coconut octopus collects coconut shells, stacking them and transporting them before reassembling them as shelter.</p>\n<p>Birds have also been observed using tools in the wild, although this behavior <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/2010/09/for-crows-a-little-tool-use-goes-a-long-way/\">was limited</a> to corvids (crows, ravens, and jays), although woodpecker finches have been known to insert twigs into trees to impale passing larvae for food. Parrots, by contrast, have mostly been noted for their linguistic skills, and there has only been limited evidence that they use anything resembling a tool in the wild. Primarily, they seem to use external objects to position nuts while feeding.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/this-elephant-figured-out-how-to-use-a-hose-to-shower/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/this-elephant-figured-out-how-to-use-a-hose-to-shower/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d816fb7e1561a132996e3082dbf7402682e60e44a511b4e74c1434bd44cfacc0","category":"Tech"}
