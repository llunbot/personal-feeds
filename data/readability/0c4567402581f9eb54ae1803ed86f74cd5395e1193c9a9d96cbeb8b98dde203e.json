With each change of direction there was a bit of tension in the crosswind-wary peloton, but the wind wasn’t stiff enough to whip up any drama.</p><p>Diego Rubio (Burgos-BH) was the last man standing from the three-man breakaway, but it was all back together in time for the bonus sprint. Astana-Premier Tech led the charge in the sprint dress rehearsal, but Fabio Jakobsen (Deceuninck-QuickStep) had the edge over green jersey-wearer Alex Aranburu who picked up enough points to claim the jersey outright, albeit only for 16 km.</p><p>On the straight, fast run-in, a crash took down a number of riders outside 4 km to go, Bora-Hansgrohe worst affected, while Alpecin-Fenix and Deceuninck-QuickStep controlled the blistering pace at the front. A furious bunch gallop followed and Philipsen timed his sprint to perfection, beating Jakobsen and Michael Matthews (BikeExchange) in second and third place.</p><p>The GC top 10 stays the same for now, but the late crash held up a few key riders including Adam Yates (Ineos Grenadiers) and Hugh Carthy (EF Education-Nippo) who shipped 31 and 38 seconds each, while Max Schachmann (Bora-Hansgrohe) came off worst losing 2:35.</p><div><div><p>La Vuelta ciclista a España (2.UWT) <span>Caleruega → Burgos</span></p></div><p><img src=\"https://www.procyclingstats.com/images/riders/cw/cb/jasper-philipsen-2021.jpeg\"></p></div></div></div>","author":"Kit Nicholson","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"0c4567402581f9eb54ae1803ed86f74cd5395e1193c9a9d96cbeb8b98dde203e","category":"Cycling"}
