I wrote:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>So, what would <em>you</em> do if Steve Jobs was quoted in a viral blog\npost saying, “We think «<em>Your Name Here</em>»’s post is very\ninsightful and not negative”? I decided to just sit there with a\nsmug look on my face for a few days (which, arguably, isn’t all\nthat different from what I do most days) and pretend that it was\nno big deal. I didn’t link to it or mention it on Daring Fireball,\nand as far as I can tell, <a href=\"https://x.com/search?q=%22not%20negative%22%20(from%3Agruber)&amp;src=typed_query\">I didn’t even tweet it</a>. As best I\ncan recall, I thought I should just play it cool. I mean of course\nmy article about why Apple changed Section 3.3.1 was right. Why\nbrag? Given that Steve Jobs was reading Daring Fireball, I didn’t\nwant him to read a post from me acting like it was a big deal that\nhe’d recommended a piece I wrote and agreed with it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>About a dozen long-time readers recalled that I <em>did</em>, in fact, acknowledge it on Daring Fireball — and <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@gruber/114523770015232774\">as soon as I saw</a> the first message, it all came back to me. I never linked to the viral blog post where Jobs was quoted recommending my article. I never mentioned it in a post. But I <em>did</em> acknowledge it, in what is clearly the most Daring-Fireball-ish way possible: I made it the slogan under the logo banner. That it was only ever a slogan in a PNG logo graphic explains why I couldn’t find it by searching. And I still have that version of the logo (because I keep everything):</p>\n\n<div>\n  <img src=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/05/df_logo_insightful_not_negative_2010.png\" alt=\"The 2010 DF logo with the slogan “Insightful and Not Negative” underneath in small type.\" />\n</div>\n\n<p>I can’t remember if I omitted the <em>very</em> before <em>insightful</em> for aesthetic length, humility, or because I somehow thought it was punchier. But my 2025 self thinks it was a mistake to omit it. It surely looks blurry on your screen today, because it’s a 1× graphic scaled to the correct size. In April 2010, 2× retina resolution wasn’t yet a thing — remember, that was the very month that Gizmodo <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkK7_QEIJrg\">published details regarding a stolen iPhone 4 prototype</a>, which was the device that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hq8j5vsqCCo\">introduced “retina resolution” to the world</a>. At 50 percent, you can see it pixel-perfect (the slogan is rendered in <a href=\"https://kare.com/fonts/\">Susan Kare’s exquisite Kare Five Dots</a> pixel font), but small:</p>\n\n<div>\n  <img srcset=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/05/df_logo_insightful_not_negative_2010.png 2x\" alt=\"The 2010 DF logo with the slogan “Insightful and Not Negative” underneath in small type. Rendered at half-size to remain pixel-perfect on modern 2× retina resolution displays.\" />\n</div>\n\n<p>In the very early days, there was always a slogan under the DF logo. <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/design/1/\">Originally</a>: “Mac Punditry and Curmudgeonry”. Then, for several years, I’d mix it up, with descriptive slogans like “Mac + Web Nerdery, Etc.”, but also with ones that were just there for fun: “Now With Retsyn”, “Simple Tricks and Nonsense”, and, during the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBWg93q9qBA\">2008 World Series</a>, “Phillies Fever”. But for the last decade or so, I’ve left the logo banner slogan-less most weeks of the year.</p>\n\n<p>Feels like the right time to bring back a little whimsy, so I’ve put “Very Insightful and Not Negative” back as the slogan for now, and I’m thinking I should keep occasionally having some fun up there.</p>\n\n\n\n    ","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b29ca60221b6e4cda09207f2a9f01638fe110e258f24ec0a8e063c0240bbe02d","category":"Tech"}
