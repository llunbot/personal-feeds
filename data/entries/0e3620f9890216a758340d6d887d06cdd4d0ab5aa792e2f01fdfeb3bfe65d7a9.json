There are lossy compression standards like MP3, and Apple's own Advanced Audio Codec (AAC), which result in some data loss. Then, there are lossless compression standards like Apple Lossless Audio Codec (ALAC), which preserve all of the original data. The entire Apple Music catalog of more than 100 million songs is encoded in both AAC and ALAC.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn a <a href=\"https://x.com/gregjoz/status/1904286789021634670\">post on X today</a>, Apple's marketing chief Greg Joswiak said lossless audio and ultra-low latency audio are the \"ultimate\" audio upgrades for the AirPods Max, promising \"mind-blowing sound quality.\" However, this marketing claim appears to be at odds with what Apple states <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/118295\">in a support document</a> on its website.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn the document, Apple says AAC already delivers audio that is \"virtually indistinguishable\" from an original studio recording. Accordingly, the company also says \"the difference between AAC and lossless audio is virtually indistinguishable.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf lossless audio offers no major improvement over AAC, according to Apple, then calling it an \"ultimate\" upgrade is unjustified marketing hype.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs for lower latency, that does not directly impact sound quality.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll in all, lossless audio is far less significant of an upgrade than Joswiak is making it out to be, as Apple admits on its very own website.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>Greg, I mean this with all due respect, almost nobody can distinguish the difference using the AirPods Max and a man of your advanced age definitely cannot.</p>â€” Quinn Nelson (@SnazzyLabs) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SnazzyLabs/status/1904290676696916426?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 24, 2025</a></blockquote> </div><div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/\">AirPods Max</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Max\">AirPods Max (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/24/airpods-max-lossless-audio-overhyped/\">Don't Buy Into Apple's Hype About AirPods Max Gaining Lossless Audio</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/dont-buy-into-apples-hype-about-airpods-max-gaining-lossless-audio.2454002/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0e3620f9890216a758340d6d887d06cdd4d0ab5aa792e2f01fdfeb3bfe65d7a9","category":"Apple"}
