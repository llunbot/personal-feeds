According to Apple, at the time, affected models were sold between September 2017 and March 2018 in China, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Macau, New Zealand, and the U.S. The ‌iPhone‌ 8 Plus was not part of the program, and Apple had previously prompted customers to its support website to check if they were eligible for a free repair.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nNow, the program has officially ended, and Apple has removed it from its <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/service-programs\">repair program list on its website</a>. The program ran for more than three years, and while it has finished, customers still experiencing issues with their ‌iPhone‌ 8 should still contact Apple support as they may still be willing to help. <br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/02/iphone-8-logic-board-repair-program-ends/\">Apple Ends iPhone 8 Logic Board Repair Program That Started in 2018</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-ends-iphone-8-logic-board-repair-program-that-started-in-2018.2314975/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=56DD1fKOTig:xQxSGi4MQFs:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=56DD1fKOTig:xQxSGi4MQFs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/56DD1fKOTig\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3a4d5cf292a6e619d17e37c6f8e58b3575f8562b0d9e86b95cf008ef99491e8c","category":"Apple"}
