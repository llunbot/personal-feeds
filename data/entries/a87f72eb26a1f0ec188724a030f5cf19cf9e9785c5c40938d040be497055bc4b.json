There's damage that needs repairing immediately so missions can move forward to launch.</p>\n<p>But there's a deeper problem with NASA's infrastructure. Erik Weiser, director of NASA's facilities and real estate division, told a blue-ribbon National Academies panel Thursday that the agency's budget for maintenance and construction is \"wholly underfunded.\"</p>\n<p>In his presentation to the National Academies committee, Weiser described NASA's infrastructure as in an \"increasing state of decline.\" There's a mismatch between what NASA needs to maintain or upgrade its facilities and the dollars the agency devotes to those efforts. The maintenance gap is $259 million per year using NASA's most conservative estimate, or more than $600 million if NASA followed the maintenance practices of the commercial industry, Weiser said.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1961706#p3\">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1961706&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a87f72eb26a1f0ec188724a030f5cf19cf9e9785c5c40938d040be497055bc4b","category":"Tech"}
