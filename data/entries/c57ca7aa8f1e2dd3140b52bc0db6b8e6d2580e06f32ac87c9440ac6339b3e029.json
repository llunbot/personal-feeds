But they also want to avoid having to bond in an additional aluminum shell into a carbon frame. Not only does that process add weight, but it still provides a chance for misalignment and potential separation of the shell down the road. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bridge_Bike_Works_Bottom_Bracket_Hero_01_3024x-scaled.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bridge_Bike_Works_Bottom_Bracket_Hero_01_3024x-800x450.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bridge_Bike_Works_Bottom_Bracket_Hero_01_3024x-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bridge_Bike_Works_Bottom_Bracket_Hero_01_3024x-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bridge_Bike_Works_Bottom_Bracket_Hero_01_3024x-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bridge_Bike_Works_Bottom_Bracket_Hero_01_3024x-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bridge_Bike_Works_Bottom_Bracket_Hero_01_3024x-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bridge_Bike_Works_Bottom_Bracket_Hero_01_3024x-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bridge_Bike_Works_Bottom_Bracket_Hero_01_3024x-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bridge_Bike_Works_Bottom_Bracket_Hero_01_3024x-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bridge_Bike_Works_Bottom_Bracket_Section_02_1080x.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"571\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bridge_Bike_Works_Bottom_Bracket_Section_02_1080x-800x571.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bridge_Bike_Works_Bottom_Bracket_Section_02_1080x-800x571.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bridge_Bike_Works_Bottom_Bracket_Section_02_1080x-297x212.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bridge_Bike_Works_Bottom_Bracket_Section_02_1080x-120x86.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bridge_Bike_Works_Bottom_Bracket_Section_02_1080x-768x548.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bridge_Bike_Works_Bottom_Bracket_Section_02_1080x.jpg 1000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bridge_Bike_Works_Bottom_Bracket_Feature_02_720x.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bridge_Bike_Works_Bottom_Bracket_Feature_02_720x.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bridge_Bike_Works_Bottom_Bracket_Feature_02_720x.jpg 500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bridge_Bike_Works_Bottom_Bracket_Feature_02_720x-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bridge_Bike_Works_Bottom_Bracket_Feature_02_720x-120x120.jpg 120w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So then what’s the answer? Apparently, it’s to mold the threads directly into the bottom bracket shell itself. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, BRIDGE announced a patent-pending integrally threaded carbon BB shell to answer that question. While the shell is based on T47-BB86, the say that they can apply the technology to <em>any threads</em> on the bike, including other BB sizes. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Is Carbon Durable Enough for Threads?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s bound to be a question – is carbon durable enough to serve in this function? To that, BRIDGE says that they have engineered the entire process from raw carbon, to molding, to curing to ensure that the final design will be up to the task. On top of that, when everything is done, the threads are treated with Cerakote. This abrasion-resistant ceramic coating should be capable of protecting the threads for repeated bottom bracket replacements if you need. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bridge_Bike_Works_Bottom_Bracket_Feature_04_1080x.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"571\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bridge_Bike_Works_Bottom_Bracket_Feature_04_1080x-800x571.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bridge_Bike_Works_Bottom_Bracket_Feature_04_1080x-800x571.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bridge_Bike_Works_Bottom_Bracket_Feature_04_1080x-297x212.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bridge_Bike_Works_Bottom_Bracket_Feature_04_1080x-120x86.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bridge_Bike_Works_Bottom_Bracket_Feature_04_1080x-768x548.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bridge_Bike_Works_Bottom_Bracket_Feature_04_1080x.jpg 1000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bridge_Bike_Works_Bottom_Bracket_Feature_05_1080x.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"571\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bridge_Bike_Works_Bottom_Bracket_Feature_05_1080x-800x571.webp\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bridge_Bike_Works_Bottom_Bracket_Feature_05_1080x-800x571.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bridge_Bike_Works_Bottom_Bracket_Feature_05_1080x-297x212.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bridge_Bike_Works_Bottom_Bracket_Feature_05_1080x-120x86.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bridge_Bike_Works_Bottom_Bracket_Feature_05_1080x-768x548.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Bridge_Bike_Works_Bottom_Bracket_Feature_05_1080x.webp 1000w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll get more info on the process at Sea Otter, but BRIDGE is at least showing the BB mold and the threaded BB inserts that help create the carbon threads.
