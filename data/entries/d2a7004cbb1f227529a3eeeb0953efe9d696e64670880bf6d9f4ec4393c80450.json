It would have engaged five government agencies in a six-year initiative, with spending of $23 million in the project’s peak year of 1974—the equivalent of $172 million in today’s dollars. It would have used then-cutting-edge technology, some of which is only now being widely implemented in carbon monitoring more than 50 years later.</p>\n<p>But it stands as yet another lost opportunity early on the road to the climate crisis. Researchers at the National Security Archive, based at the George Washington University, could find no documentation of what happened to the proposal, and it was never implemented.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020216#p3\">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020216&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Inside Climate News","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d2a7004cbb1f227529a3eeeb0953efe9d696e64670880bf6d9f4ec4393c80450","category":"Tech"}
