They offer better insulation and weather-proofing than regular bib shorts, but generally offer more versatility than bib tights thanks to being able to be paired with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-leg-warmers-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">leg warmers</a> or without. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When combined with leg warmers, they can offer better insulation than bib tights due to the dual layer of material on the thighs, while without leg warmers they are often best effective from temperatures between 8-18 degrees. This also allows you to start a morning ride in the cold wearing leg warmers, and then remove them when the temperature picks up later on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many thermal bib shorts combine a mix of thermal materials on the legs and the front, while providing some breathability at the rear and in the straps for higher paced efforts during the winter. Many also feature additional weather-proofing tech such as windproof front panels, Durable Water Repellent (DWR) treatments or in some cases full waterproofing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the focus on thermal insulation, things to look for are the internal material’s insulation, the length of the short legs, and the height of the front to keep your core warmer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best thermal bib

difference between thermal bib shorts and regular bib shorts?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Thermal bib shorts feature a very similar structure to regular bib shorts. The main difference is the use of thermal fabrics, especially at the front of the shorts where the wind hits. There is also often a durable water repellent (DWR) treatment used to aid in weather-proofing. The fit can be a little different with the legs of the shorts normally longer, coming down right to the knee as well as a raised front, both adding extra insulation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Why use thermal bib shorts instead of bib tights?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Thermal bib shorts offer a bit more flexibility than bib tights. When paired with leg warmers, they offer similar levels of insulation to bib tights, if anything a little more due to the double layer of fabric on the thighs. The benefit over bib tights is that in changeable conditions, you can start a ride with leg warmers under the thermal bib shorts, then remove the warmers if the temperature increases. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What temperature are thermal bib shorts best for?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most thermal bib shorts have an effective operating temperature of around 10-18 degrees Celsius when used by themselves. When combined with a pair of thermal leg warmers, this operating temperature can be around 2-12 degrees, dependent on the level of insulation the shorts offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What should you look for in a pair of thermal bib shorts?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ideally you want the shorts to feature a brushed fleece material internally, as this helps boost insulation while also being comfortable. A DWR treatment is preferable to limit the amount of water ingress and associated wind chill. Longer length legs and a raised front also help with insulation. Finally and most importantly, look for a quality chamois, ideally with a dual density material for shock absorption and channels internally for added breathability; you don’t want to sacrifice saddle comfort in the quest for extra warmth.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How do we test and why trust our advice?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/10/specialized-diverge-str-riding-6-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Riding gravel bike in the woods\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/10/specialized-diverge-str-riding-6-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/10/specialized-diverge-str-riding-6-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/10/specialized-diverge-str-riding-6-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/10/specialized-diverge-str-riding-6-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/10/specialized-diverge-str-riding-6-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/10/specialized-diverge-str-riding-6-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/10/specialized-diverge-str-riding-6-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/10/specialized-diverge-str-riding-6-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/10/specialized-diverge-str-riding-6-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/10/specialized-diverge-str-riding-6-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Specialized</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All of our product reviewers are avid cyclists who have been riding for many years. They have all built up a huge array of experience from riding in various conditions and testing what kit works and doesn’t work in these situations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing these shorts through the months of January and February in the United Kingdom, all have well and truly been put through their paces to test their insulation qualities, weatherproofing, water repellency and comfort along potholed roads. There have been 0-3°C rides, rides through wind and rain storms, rides that have started at 5° and finished at around 18°, even some indoor ride testing. These conditions allow us to test every element of these thermal bib shorts to gauge their performance, comfort and usability. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best cycling thermal bib shorts 2024</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Castelli Tutto Nano</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Castelli-Tuto-Nano-Thermal-Bib-Shorts_1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Castelli Tuto Nano Thermal Bib Shorts\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Castelli-Tuto-Nano-Thermal-Bib-Shorts_1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Castelli-Tuto-Nano-Thermal-Bib-Shorts_1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Castelli-Tuto-Nano-Thermal-Bib-Shorts_1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Castelli-Tuto-Nano-Thermal-Bib-Shorts_1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Castelli-Tuto-Nano-Thermal-Bib-Shorts_1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Castelli-Tuto-Nano-Thermal-Bib-Shorts_1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Castelli-Tuto-Nano-Thermal-Bib-Shorts_1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Castelli-Tuto-Nano-Thermal-Bib-Shorts_1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Castelli-Tuto-Nano-Thermal-Bib-Shorts_1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Castelli-Tuto-Nano-Thermal-Bib-Shorts_1-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Andy Turner</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>RRP £130 | <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3462&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tredz.co.uk%2F.Castelli-Tutto-Nano-Bib-Shorts_213025.htm%3Fsku%3D662332\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Great value for money</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Really solid insulation</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Chamois a little thin</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Castelli Tutto Nano bib shorts use Castelli’s NanoTech 3G fabric which combines a soft fleece interior with their latest generation of NanoTech water repellent nanotechnology to provide weather-proofing. This is paired with mesh bib straps to allow greater breathability and thermal regulation, and reflective insets on the rear of each leg for enhanced visibility. The chamois is Castelli’s Kiss Air2 pad which offers decent comfort over shorter rides, but beyond four hours can become a little uncomfortable. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In practice the shorts work across a wide range of temperatures, being breathable enough for indoor turbo sessions, while being insulated enough for temperatures between 12-20° or 5-15° with leg warmers. At £130 they also offer great value for this level of performance, and although they may not perform as well as more expensive competitors, they offer potentially the best value for money. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full<strong> </strong></strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/castelli-tutto-nano-thermal-bib-shorts-review\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><strong>Castelli Tutto Nano</strong></strong> <strong><strong>thermal bib shorts</strong> review</strong></a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3462&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tredz.co.uk%2F.Castelli-Tutto-Nano-Bib-Shorts_213025.htm%3Fsku%3D662332\" target=\"_blank\">Tredz (£80)</a></strong></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Isadore Signature Thermal Bib Shorts</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Isadore-Signature-Thermal-Bib-Shorts_1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Isadore Signature Thermal Bib Shorts\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Isadore-Signature-Thermal-Bib-Shorts_1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Isadore-Signature-Thermal-Bib-Shorts_1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Isadore-Signature-Thermal-Bib-Shorts_1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Isadore-Signature-Thermal-Bib-Shorts_1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Isadore-Signature-Thermal-Bib-Shorts_1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Isadore-Signature-Thermal-Bib-Shorts_1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Isadore-Signature-Thermal-Bib-Shorts_1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Isadore-Signature-Thermal-Bib-Shorts_1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Isadore-Signature-Thermal-Bib-Shorts_1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Isadore-Signature-Thermal-Bib-Shorts_1-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Andy Turner</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>RRP £175 | <a href=\"https://isadore.com/signature-thermal-bib-shorts?variant=3148&amp;forceCountry=GB\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Brilliant thermal and weatherproofed qualities</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Useful cargo pocket</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Great fit and comfort levels</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Isadore Signature Thermal Bib Shorts use an internally combed fleece material to provide insulating thermal properties, with an external fluorine-free DWR that prevents the ingress of water from showers or road spray.

The DWR treatment is ecologically friendly and also performs brilliantly while external seams don’t allow water ingress. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fit is superb while compressive legs mean no rising even without silicone grippers. However, the chamois pad, although mostly comfortable and offering great support, breathability and coverage, does have a seam/ridge along its rear centre which can be noticeable when riding on a saddle with no cut-out or a less pronounced one. Given that this is the main weight-bearing contact point while cycling, it can detract from the shorts. Even at a higher price, the rest of the performance of these shorts is great, but the chamois seam does let them down a little. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/q36-5-woolf-2-0-thermal-bib-shorts-review\" target=\"_blank\">Q36.5 Woolf 2.0<strong> thermal bib shorts</strong> review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><strong>Buy now from<a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=205647X1684865&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tradeinn.com%2Fbikeinn%2Fen%2Fq36.5-wolf-2.0-bib-shorts%2F137572327%2Fp%3F\" target=\"_blank\"> Bikeinn (£144.49)</a></strong></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Santini Adapt Shell Bib Shorts</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Santini-Adapt-Shell-Thermal-Bib-Shorts_1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Santini Adapt Shell Thermal Bib Shorts\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Santini-Adapt-Shell-Thermal-Bib-Shorts_1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Santini-Adapt-Shell-Thermal-Bib-Shorts_1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Santini-Adapt-Shell-Thermal-Bib-Shorts_1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Santini-Adapt-Shell-Thermal-Bib-Shorts_1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Santini-Adapt-Shell-Thermal-Bib-Shorts_1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Santini-Adapt-Shell-Thermal-Bib-Shorts_1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Santini-Adapt-Shell-Thermal-Bib-Shorts_1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Santini-Adapt-Shell-Thermal-Bib-Shorts_1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Santini-Adapt-Shell-Thermal-Bib-Shorts_1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Santini-Adapt-Shell-Thermal-Bib-Shorts_1-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Andy Turner</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>RRP £170 | <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=205647X1684865&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tradeinn.com%2Fbikeinn%2Fen%2Fsantini-adapt-shell-bib-shorts%2F138589178%2Fp%3F\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Really great weatherproofing</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Insulated yet breathable</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Leg grippers can rise when worn with leg warmers</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Santini Adapt Shell bib shorts use Polartec NeoShell material to give genuine waterproofing rather than water repellency.

For all day riding performance the shorts are incredibly comfortable and work brilliantly between temperatures of 8-20° thanks to the high levels of breathability in the materials and pad. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the thermal qualities of the shorts are lacking compared to many of the competition so they are not really practical to use in the winter months. The water repellency is also poor and allows a fair amount of water ingress. Value-wise, at £190 they are not cheap, but fall around the median price for bib shorts in this group test. If this review were being written based purely on endurance comfort, these shorts would be outright winners, but as a pair of thermal bib shorts they just lack the thermal and weather-proofing qualities of competitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/assos-mille-gts-spring-fall-bib-shorts-c2-review\" target=\"_blank\">Assos Mille GTS Spring Fall Bib Shorts C2<strong> thermal bib shorts</strong> review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3462&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclestore.co.uk%2Fassos_mille_gts_spring_fall_bib_shorts_c2-ID_89873%3Fopt%3D203066\" target=\"_blank\">Cyclestore (£190)</a></strong></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Café du Cycliste Cecile</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Cafe-du-Cycliste-Cecile-Thermal-Bib-Shorts_1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Cafe du Cycliste Cecile Thermal Bib Shorts\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Cafe-du-Cycliste-Cecile-Thermal-Bib-Shorts_1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Cafe-du-Cycliste-Cecile-Thermal-Bib-Shorts_1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Cafe-du-Cycliste-Cecile-Thermal-Bib-Shorts_1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Cafe-du-Cycliste-Cecile-Thermal-Bib-Shorts_1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Cafe-du-Cycliste-Cecile-Thermal-Bib-Shorts_1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Cafe-du-Cycliste-Cecile-Thermal-Bib-Shorts_1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Cafe-du-Cycliste-Cecile-Thermal-Bib-Shorts_1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Cafe-du-Cycliste-Cecile-Thermal-Bib-Shorts_1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Cafe-du-Cycliste-Cecile-Thermal-Bib-Shorts_1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Cafe-du-Cycliste-Cecile-Thermal-Bib-Shorts_1-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Andy Turner</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>RRP £265 | <a href=\"https://www.cafeducycliste.com/en_uk/mens-cecile-bib-shorts-black.html?gad_source=1\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Premium feel and comfort</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Water repellency isn’t the best</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Very high price</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Café du Cycliste Cecile shorts are made using OEKO-TEX approved fabric, which is also used in skiing race suits to provide insulation, flexibility and compression, with a chamois pad from Italian chamois specialists Elastic Interface.
