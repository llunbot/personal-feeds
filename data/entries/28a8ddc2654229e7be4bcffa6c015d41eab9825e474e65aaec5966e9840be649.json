Of course, from a more practical derailleur standpoint, Wheels Mfg. does also machine their own <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wheels-mfg-adds-bright-new-bb-udh-colors-e-bike-chainring-lockring-tools/\" target=\"_blank\">colorful all-aluminum UDHs</a> and even Shimano <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wheels-mfg-gives-udh-bikes-a-direct-mount-hanger-for-shimano-derailleurs/\" target=\"_blank\">Direct Mount hangers for UDH</a>-equipped road, gravel  &amp; mountain bikes. Back to the seatpost collars though…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve had both ultralight and super-budget clamps fail on me in the past, so this is one place I never want to skimp on strength and durability. And these new Wheels Manufacturing Seatpost Collars look like they deliver on lightweight, affordability, and a robust design.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wheels-Manufacturing-affordable-Seatpost-Collars-CNC-machined-in-the-USA_details.webp\"><img width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wheels-Manufacturing-affordable-Seatpost-Collars-CNC-machined-in-the-USA_details.webp\" alt=\"Wheels Mfg.

There’s not much I can add to that other than that I am surprised that Wheels Mfg. manages to machine these in the US, offer them in three sizes to fit most conventional seattubes at weights from just 31g, and offer them in a rainbow of 7 bright colors for just $25. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have an external seatpost collar that you aren’t 100% satisfied with, or you just want to splash a little color onto your bike, these seem like a no-brainer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tech details, pricing &amp; availability</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wheels-Manufacturing-affordable-Seatpost-Collars-CNC-machined-in-the-USA_rainbow-of-colors.webp\"><img width=\"1400\" height=\"550\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wheels-Manufacturing-affordable-Seatpost-Collars-CNC-machined-in-the-USA_rainbow-of-colors.webp\" alt=\"Wheels Mfg.

But if you need to figure out the seatpost size on several bikes, it can be a little tricky. So Wheels Manufacturing also made this simple, low-cost seatpost size gauge – for pro and DIY home bike mechanics. For just $10, you drop this acrylic jobber into the seattube and you’ll know exactly what seatpost you need – 24 common sizes from 25.0mm all the way up to 34.9mm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get yours either directly from Wheels Mfg. or your local bike shop now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wheelsmfg.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>WheelsMfg.com</em></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wheels-manufacturing-machines-a-rainbow-of-seatpost-collars-in-the-usa/\">Wheels Manufacturing Machines a Rainbow of Seatpost Collars in the USA</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"28a8ddc2654229e7be4bcffa6c015d41eab9825e474e65aaec5966e9840be649","category":"Cycling"}
