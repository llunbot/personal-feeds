Even Egan Bernal (Ineos Grenadiers) wouldn’t help him out, as his teammate Adam Yates had launched the move that took Jack Haig and Gino Mäder (Bahrain-Victorious) up the road with Primož Roglič (Jumbo-Visma) and Enric Mas (Movistar).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Haig started the day in fourth, 1:43 behind the Colombian, and once the small red jersey group started scooping up breakaway riders, including Bahrain-Victorious rider Mark Padun – even fellow Australian Nick Schultz (BikeExchange) could be seen among Haig’s teammates – their advantage over the López group only got bigger. Even his Movistar teammate José Joaquim Rojas couldn’t do much to stem the damage once the group had swollen with riders dropped during the earlier accelerations.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Mas on Supermán: ‘Did he crash? I didn’t know anything…’</p>— Daniel Friebe (@friebos) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/friebos/status/1434180941753327620?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 4, 2021</a></blockquote> \n\n\n\n<p>It’s hard to tell exactly when or why López left the race, but he was already approaching eight minutes behind his nearest rivals when the rumours began with about 30 km to go. We might generously assume that he’s unwell – with a little over 60 km left of the Vuelta including Sunday’s final time trial, why else would he stop? But all we know for sure is Movistar’s head of performance Patxi Vila was seen trying to persuade him to continue before the 27-year-old climbed into the team car, which he did while engaged in an curiously timed phone call.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f534.png\" />¡Las imágenes de Miguel Ángel López subiéndose al coche del equipo Movistar para abandonar esta Vuelta! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/VueltaRTVE4S?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#VueltaRTVE4S</a> <br /><br />El colombiano, en rebeldía, decidió abandonar la carrera pese a la insistencia de su jefe de filas Patxi Vila<br /><br /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f4f9.png\" /><a href=\"https://twitter.com/villamorforever?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@villamorforever</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/X7FzypTYD7\">https://t.co/X7FzypTYD7</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/oLthMVMoOx\">pic.twitter.com/oLthMVMoOx</a></p>— Teledeporte (@teledeporte) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/teledeporte/status/1434180601456832519?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 4, 2021</a></blockquote> \n\n\n\n<p><em>This story is still unfolding…</em></p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/09/after-missing-the-decisive-gc-move-lopez-left-the-vuelta-in-dramatic-fashion/\">Read More</a>","author":"Kit Nicholson","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"4a734d257fecd3945b7ff425e3445542aa1a217b05ff3d7df22f700fb2a5af18","category":"Cycling"}
