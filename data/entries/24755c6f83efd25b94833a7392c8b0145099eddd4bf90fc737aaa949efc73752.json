Despite the long wheelbase, the bike still folds up small and can fit in the boot of a small car.</p>\n<p>GoCycle has its own motor system that monitors speed and cadence to determine how much power assistance you need. However, there’s also a button on the handlebar to override this.</p>\n<p>We found the motor and bike to be nippier than some of the best electric bikes and well suited to city rides. But, due to the chunky tyres, suspension and traction control, it can also tackle rougher terrain.</p>\n<p>The only thing holding the G4 back is its high price.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/electric-bikes/gocycle-g4-review/\">Read our full GoCycle G4 review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>MiRider One</h3>\n<h4>Best value for money electric folding bike</h4>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The MiRider One is a well-styled folding bike with electric assistance.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Warren Rossiter / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£1,300 as tested</li>\n<li>Range up to 35 miles</li>\n<li>Boost button to add extra assistance</li>\n<li>Singlespeed only</li>\n</ul><p>With a quick fold via a central hinge, the MiRider One pairs funky looks with a fun, practical ride.

It’s made up of a front-hub motor and a smart-looking battery, housed in a Cordura bag. The total bike weight is 17.43kg, compared to a claimed 11.35kg for a standard Brompton.</p>\n<p>The system is operated by two buttons on the battery, but we’d prefer a bar-mounted control, or the ability to use Brompton’s app (and a phone mount) to cycle between settings.</p>\n<p>Brompton’s motor provides a punchy ride, but it does feel like overkill in some situations, even if it’s fun to get a head start on other riders at traffic lights. The middle of the three settings provides the best balance of power and range.</p>\n<p>You need to remove the battery before folding, but that’s simple enough, and the charger is nice and compact.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/electric-bikes/brompton-electric-h2l-2-speed-review/\">Read our full Brompton Electric H2L 2-Speed review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Eelo 1885 Disc Explorer Pro</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>3.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Eelo is well kitted out for commuting.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£1,499 as tested</li>\n<li>Packs down neatly</li>\n<li>Won’t fit tall riders</li>\n<li>Fixed battery</li>\n</ul><p>The Eelo 1885 Explorer Disc Pro is a decent electric folding bike now with mechanical disc brakes in place of V-brakes.</p>\n<p>For nipping on and off a train, the 1885 is ideal because it’s easy to carry in folded form.

That has the advantage of a tidy, weatherproof package, but may limit the battery size and hence range, and add weight.</p>\n<p>Another option for the battery is to make it removable. That’s the way Brompton has gone, with a pack that clips to the front of the bike so it can be carried separately. It also means you can take your battery somewhere convenient to charge it, while leaving your bike locked up or in the garage/bike shed.</p>\n<p>Some internal batteries are removable too; that’s how the battery works in the GoCycle GX and GXi.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/electric-bike-laws/\">Electric bike laws</a> in the UK and EU stipulate that the motor in a standard electric bike has to provide no more than 250 watts of power output, and most ebike motors, including those in folders, will provide up to this level of assistance.</p>\n<h3>Folding electric bike gearing</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Folding electric bikes have few gears.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Some folding ebikes will only have a single-gear ratio. With the assistance from the motor to start you off, that may well be enough if you have a shortish, flat commute.</p>\n<p>For longer, hillier rides, or for leisure use, you may want some extra gears. Hub gears are popular because they’re out of the way and less likely to get damaged than a derailleur system when carrying or moving the folder.</p>\n<p>Our guide to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/electric-bike-maintenance/\">electric bike maintenance</a> has more tips on how to look after electric bikes. You’re unlikely to leave an electric folding bike unattended, but <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/ebike-insurance/\">electric bike insurance</a> is still advisable.</p>\n<p>Hub gears may range from a simple 2- or 3-speed system, up to eight or more gears. Adding gearing also adds weight, and the cabling for the shifters adds complexity to the design.</p>\n<h3>Wheel size</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Smaller wheels are matched to a smaller frame.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>A folding ebike will have small wheels, to make for a compact bundle once it’s folded. The classic Brompton has 16in wheels, a size used by many other folders.</p>\n<p>Other brands, such as Tern and GoCycle, use 20in wheels. Their larger size helps a bit with rolling resistance and they’ll ride more smoothly over road imperfections, in compensation for increased weight and a larger folded size.</p>\n<h3>Folded size</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> An electric folder’s compact size provides practicality.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Folded size and ease of folding are other things to think about. If you’re planning a commute that also includes public transport, you’ll want a folding ebike that packs up as small as possible, so you can get it onto busy trains or up awkward steps on buses.</p>\n<p>That’s where a design with an integrated battery comes in handy because it won’t get in the way of the fold. Brompton’s solution of a separate battery pack also works here. Although there’s a second piece of kit to carry around, the folding mechanism and compact folded size aren’t compromised.</p>\n<p>Another option, used by GoCycle and others, is to enable you to part-fold the bike, so you get a package that you can push or pull around using the seat as a handle. It’ll take up more space than a fully folded machine, but has the advantage that you don’t need to fully lug around the bike’s often substantial weight.</p>\n<p>MiRider’s clever design, meanwhile, has a skate wheel on the bottom of the bike, to make manoeuvring the folded package much easier.</p>\n<h3>What other electric bikes are there?</h3>\n<p>The electric bike market continues to see huge growth, with a whole plethora of ebikes available for all kinds of riding.</p>\n<p>Our guide to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-electric-bikes/\">the best electric bikes</a> takes you through everything you need to know about motor-assisted bicycles and provides more advice on choosing the right type of bike for your riding.</p>\n<p>Should you want to go further and faster, take a look at our lists of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-electric-road-bikes/\">best electric road bikes</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-electric-gravel-bikes/\">best electric gravel bikes</a>.
