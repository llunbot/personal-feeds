The smaller ‌iPhone 16‌ Pro is expected to have a display size of 6.3 inches, while the ‌iPhone 16‌ Pro Max will have a display size of 6.9 inches.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe information comes from display analyst Ross Young, who often shares accurate details on Apple's plans. He says that the new size options are exclusive to the Pro models, so this would mark the first time that Apple has used different sizes for the standard ‌iPhone 16‌ and ‌iPhone 16‌ Plus and the ‌iPhone 16‌ Pro and ‌iPhone 16‌ Pro Max models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNote that these display sizes are rounded and are not precise down to the decimal point at this time. The current <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14-pro/\">iPhone 14 Pro</a> has a display size of 6.1 inches and the ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ Max has a display size of 6.7 inches, so we are looking at an approximate increase of 0.2 inches for both devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>High-End Ultra Model</h2>\r<br />\nAccording to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a>, Apple could introduce a higher-end ‌iPhone 16‌ \"Ultra\" to be sold alongside the ‌iPhone 16‌, ‌iPhone 16‌ Plus, ‌iPhone 16‌ Pro, and ‌iPhone 16‌ Pro Max. It would be positioned as a top-of-the-line ‌iPhone‌, but it is not clear what specifically will differentiate it from the ‌iPhone 16‌ Pro and Pro Max, and it is also not known what the display size would be.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere is a possibility that the ‌iPhone 16‌ Ultra could replace the ‌iPhone 16‌ Pro Max rather than be sold alongside it.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Solid-State Buttons</h2>\r<br />\nFor the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/06/iphone-15-pro-buttonless-design-rumors/\">initially planned to add</a> solid-state volume, power, and mute buttons that would replace the physical buttons, but due to technical issues, Apple had to scrap the feature.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSolid-state buttons are instead <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/gurman-iphone-16-pro-haptic-buttons/\">expected be introduced</a> with the ‌iPhone 16‌ Pro and Pro Max models, with Apple using haptic feedback to mimic the feel of a traditional button press. With the addition of the solid-state technology, Apple will also change the design of the volume button. Rather than two volume buttons, the solid-state button will be a single, unified button.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>5G Modem Chip</h2>\r<br />\nApple has been working on its own 5G modem chip for the last several years, and it could be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/09/apple-in-house-modem-chips-2024/\">ready for inclusion</a> in at least some of the ‌iPhone 16‌ models. Apple wants to reduce its reliance on Qualcomm by using in-house technology.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRumors suggest that Apple will use the modem chip in a single device before rolling it out to other devices, with a full transition away from Qualcomm modem chips taking up to three years.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple also eventually wants to use its own WiFi and Bluetooth chips, and there is a possibility that those components could replace Broadcom chips as early as 2024.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Other Features</h2>\r<br />\nThere are a few other features that have been rumored for the ‌iPhone 16‌ models, which we may or may not see.\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong>Under Display Face ID</strong> - There were rumors that Apple could adopt under-display <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/\">Face ID</a> as soon as 2024, which would cut down on the size of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/\">Dynamic Island</a> and possibly allow for a smaller hole punch front camera, but it looks like that's going to be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/03/under-display-face-id-to-debut-on-iphone-17-pro/\">delayed until 2025</a>.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong>Periscope lens</strong> - With the ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max, Apple plans to introduce a periscope telephoto lens that supports 5x or 6x optical zoom. Apple sometimes expands technology used in a flagship ‌iPhone‌ to additional models the next year, but Apple analyst Ming-Cho Kuo suggests that the periscope technology will remain limited to the ‌iPhone 16‌ Pro Max in 2023.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><strong>USB-C Port</strong> - Apple is transitioning to USB-C in 2023 with the ‌iPhone 15‌ models, and the ‌iPhone 16‌ models will use the same technology.</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>More Information</h2>\r<br />\nAs we're still more than a year away from the launch of the ‌iPhone 16‌ models, these rumors are subject to change and could shift in the future.
