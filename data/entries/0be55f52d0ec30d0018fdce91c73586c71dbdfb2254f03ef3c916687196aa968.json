The news broke during the World Championships road race in Belgium and has been independently confirmed by CyclingTips.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 29-year-old sprinter has been with the DSM outfit (formerly Sunweb) since 2017, moving across from the US-based UnitedHealthCare Pro team as a proven winner in Europe and on home soil. In the five years since, Rivera has raced to some huge results, including victory at the Tour of Flanders 2017, the overall title at the 2018 Women’s Tour of Britain, and the final stage of this year’s Giro d’Italia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The American’s arrival will strengthen an already powerful Jumbo-Visma squad which has enjoyed a spectacular maiden season. Since the start of 2021, the team has netted 11 victories, seven of them thanks to their headliner Marianne Vos, with her compatriot Riejanne Markus and British rider Anna Henderson claiming the rest. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rest of the team’s 2022 lineup is yet to be confirmed – including whether Vos will still ride in black and yellow next season – but Rivera’s signing will bring more valuable racing experience and another winning mentality to Jumbo-Visma, especially in her favoured Spring Classics.</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/09/coryn-rivera-will-race-for-jumbo-visma-in-2022/\">Read More</a>","author":"Kit Nicholson","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"0be55f52d0ec30d0018fdce91c73586c71dbdfb2254f03ef3c916687196aa968","category":"Cycling"}
