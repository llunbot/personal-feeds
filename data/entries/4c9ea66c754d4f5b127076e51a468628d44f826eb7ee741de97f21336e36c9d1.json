The long-standing Finder feature essentially tells a file's parent application to open a copy of it by default, ensuring that the original file remains unedited. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/stationery-pad.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nStationery Pad doesn't get much attention these days, but it's a neat alternative to repeatedly editing templates and using the \"Save As...\" command, which can lead to overwriting the original file if you're not too careful.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAlmost any file type can be defined as a template with Stationery Pad â€“ it could be used to streamline common Photoshop jobs, create skeleton HTML/CSS files, or help with Word document invoicing. To make use of Stationery Pad, create the file you want to use as a template, then follow the steps below. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Define a File as a Template Using Stationery Pad</h2><ol>\r<br />\n<li>Find the file in Finder that you want to use as a template.\r<br />\n</li><li>Right-click (or Ctrl-click) the file and select <strong>Get Info</strong> in the contextual dropdown menu.
