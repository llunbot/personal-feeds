It will mark the third extension since Trump took office in January.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/TikTok-on-iPhone.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/04/tiktok-75-day-ban-extension/\">second extension</a> that Trump gave TikTok is set to expire on June 19, and there appears to be no progress made toward a deal with China, so TikTok needs a third reprieve to continue operating in the United States.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTikTok was banned in the U.S. after the Protecting Americans From Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act went <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/17/tiktok-january-19-ban-imminent/\">into law on January 19</a>, but Trump has ordered the U.S. Department of Justice not to enforce the law at the current time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSince January, Trump has been working to wrest TikTok's operations from Chinese control by establishing U.S. ownership. Trump's team has considered offers from Oracle, Perplexity, and Amazon, along with individuals like Jimmy Donaldson (known as MrBeast), Shark Tank host Kevin O'Leary, Employer.com founder Jesse Tinsley, and billionaire Frank McCourt.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTrump needs to work with China to get the TikTok deal approved, and China is not cooperating due to ongoing trade tensions created by Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTikTok <a href=\"https://tiktok.pxf.io/c/153062/2392239/27618\">continues to be available for download</a> as of now. It's not yet clear when the app might see a U.S. takeover, but with continued extensions, it is not in danger of being removed from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tiktok/\">TikTok</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/06/tiktok-third-ban-delay/\">TikTok Getting Yet Another Ban Delay as Trump Fails to Reach Deal With China</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tiktok-getting-yet-another-ban-delay-as-trump-fails-to-reach-deal-with-china.2458310/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"faa36c89476b171db2b5d88d38ccdbcf935d19b4e6a1c49ed347afbf366826ce","category":"Apple"}
