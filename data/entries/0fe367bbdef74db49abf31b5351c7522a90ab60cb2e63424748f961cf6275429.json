In one image, the website showed the iPhone 16 Pro Max reaching a peak charging speed of 37W with Apple's 140W USB-C power adapter, but it is unclear how long the device kept charging at that speed.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>PhoneArena</em> saw similar results with the standard iPhone 16. In its review last year, it said that device reached a peak charging speed of 38W when it was \"under extremely heavy loads such as benchmark testing or playing games.\" The website said the iPhone 16 achieved a sustained charging speed of closer to 20W.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll in all, with the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro models already reaching peak wired charging speeds in the 35W range, it sounds like there will be no significant improvement to wired charging speeds with any of the iPhone 17 models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPu did not reveal wireless MagSafe charging speeds for any iPhone 17 models. iPhone 16 models can charge <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/iphone-16-25w-magsafe-charging/\">at up to 25W with MagSafe</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/\">iPhone 17 Air</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/\">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/\">Jeff Pu</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/18/iphone-17-lineup-35w-charging-rumor/\">iPhone 17 Lineup Rumored to Support Up to 35W Charging Speeds</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-lineup-rumored-to-support-up-to-35w-charging-speeds.2449643/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0fe367bbdef74db49abf31b5351c7522a90ab60cb2e63424748f961cf6275429","category":"Apple"}
