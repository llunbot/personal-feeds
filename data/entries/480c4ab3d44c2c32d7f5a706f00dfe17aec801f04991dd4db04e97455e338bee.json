All performance claims for the M2 iPad Air are accurate and based on a 9-core GPU.</blockquote>\r<br />\nApple's website says that the ‌M2‌ chip is \"nearly 50 percent faster than the previous generation,\" and that it specifically has \"25 percent faster graphics.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple recently updated its technical specifications website for the ‌M2‌ ‌iPad Air‌ to state that the device has a 9-core GPU. Prior to the update, it listed a 10-core GPU. The prior-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> had a 10-core GPU, so it is a surprise that the ‌iPad Air‌ version is limited to a 9-core GPU.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOther ‌M2‌ chip specifications have not changed. The ‌iPad Air‌ has an 8-core CPU with four performance cores and four efficiency cores, along with 8GB RAM and a 16-core Neural Engine.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBecause it took Apple several days to correct the chip error on its website, some users may have purchased the ‌iPad Air‌ believing it had a 10-core GPU. The two week return period has expired for those who bought on launch day, but customers would have a good argument for a return exception.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air </a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air\">iPad Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/03/ipad-air-performance-accurate-gpu-error/\">Apple Says iPad Air Performance Details Are Accurate Despite 9-Core GPU Mistake</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-ipad-air-performance-details-are-accurate-despite-9-core-gpu-mistake.2428070/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"480c4ab3d44c2c32d7f5a706f00dfe17aec801f04991dd4db04e97455e338bee","category":"Apple"}
