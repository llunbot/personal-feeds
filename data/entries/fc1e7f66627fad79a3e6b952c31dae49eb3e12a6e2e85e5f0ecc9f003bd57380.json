In comparison, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> models are 7.8mm thick and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a> models are 8.25mm thick.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDue to this ultra-thin design, some compromises are said to be necessary. The device currently lacks a physical SIM card tray, a speaker on the bottom edge, an ultra-wide camera, and ultra-fast mmWave 5G support. Unsurprisingly, the device will also have a \"smaller battery\" than current iPhones, but it remains to be seen how battery life ultimately compares.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith just one camera, the unit is expected to be large and centered on the rear of the device for a dramatically different look compared to current models. The device should launch in September 2025 alongside the standard ‌iPhone 17‌ and ‌iPhone 17‌ Pro models, with no ‌iPhone 17‌ Plus expected.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMeanwhile, the ‌iPhone 17‌ Pro and ‌iPhone 17‌ Pro Max are expected to offer some of the most <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/25/first-iphone-17-pro-design-leak/\">significant design changes</a> in years. Both models will drop titanium and return to an aluminum frame for a more lightweight design and feature a new part-aluminum, part-glass rear to enable continued support for wireless charging. The camera bump is also purportedly larger and rectangular, cut into the aluminum top half of the rear rather than 3D glass.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe discuss the implications of these design changes and more. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/\">The MacRumors Show</a> also has <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow\">its own YouTube channel</a>, so make sure you're subscribed to keep up with new episodes and clips:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1\"><div>Subscribe to <em>The MacRumors Show</em> YouTube channel!</div></a></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYou can also listen to ‌The MacRumors Show‌ on <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/id1602394741\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/41XOHIA6w8IxAKJZvrnx90\">Spotify</a>, <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/itunes1602394741\">Overcast</a>, or your preferred podcasts app. You can also <a href=\"https://audioboom.com/channels/5096144.rss\">copy our RSS feed</a> directly into your podcast player.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nIf you haven't already listened to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/22/the-macrumors-show-november-tech-changes/\">previous episode of The MacRumors Show</a>, catch up for our discussion with some of the biggest changes in our personal Apple ecosystems this month.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSubscribe to ‌The MacRumors Show‌ for new episodes every week, where we discuss some of the topical news breaking here on <em>MacRumors</em>, often joined by interesting guests such as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/15/the-macrumors-show-apple-pro-apps-updates/\">Kevin Nether</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/01/the-macrumors-show-jon-prosser-talks-m4-macs/\">Jon Prosser</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/05/the-macrumors-show-luke-miani-talks-apple-watch-x/\">Luke Miani</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/12/the-macrumors-show-matthew-cassinelli/\">Matthew Cassinelli</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/23/the-macrumors-show-brian-tong-vision-pro/\">Brian Tong</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/09/the-macrumors-show-one-week-with-vision-pro/\">Quinn Nelson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/10/the-macrumors-show-apple-gaming-ft-toucharcade/\">Jared Nelson</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/10/the-macrumors-show-apple-gaming-ft-toucharcade/\">Eli Hodapp</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/13/the-macrumors-show-former-apple-executive-mike-bell/\">Mike Bell</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/06/the-macrumors-show-sara-dietschy-apple-accessories/\">Sara Dietschy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/15/the-macrumors-show-ijustine-talks-iphone-15/\">iJustine</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/25/the-macrumors-show-iphone-15-jon-rettinger/\">Jon Rettinger</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/10/the-macrumors-show-andru-edwards-iphone-ultra/\">Andru Edwards</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/26/the-macrumors-show-arnold-kim/\">Arnold Kim</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/19/the-macrumors-show-ben-sullins-apple-car/\">Ben Sullins</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/07/the-macrumors-show-marcus-kane-headset-design/\">Marcus Kane</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/24/the-macrumors-show-christopher-lawley-talks-ipados/\">Christopher Lawley</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/10/the-macrumors-show-frank-mcshan-yellow-iphone-14/\">Frank McShan</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/24/the-macrumors-show-david-lewis-talks-apple-audio/\">David Lewis</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/27/the-macrumors-show-tyler-stalman-new-macs/\">Tyler Stalman</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/02/the-macrumors-show-apple-event-expectations/\">Sam Kohl</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/09/the-macrumors-show-john-gruber-talks-macos-ventura/\">John Gruber</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/28/the-macrumors-show-ipados-16-ft-federico-viticci/\">Federico Viticci</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/08/26/the-macrumors-show-thomas-frank-talks-productivity/\">Thomas Frank</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/21/the-macrumors-show-jonathan-morrison/\">Jonathan Morrison</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/12/the-macrumors-show-ross-young/\">Ross Young</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/06/21/the-macrumors-show-ian-zelbo/\">Ian Zelbo</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/03/25/the-macrumors-show-rene-ritchie-talks-mac-studio/\">Rene Ritchie</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌The MacRumors Show‌ is on X <a href=\"https://twitter.com/macrumorsshow\">@MacRumorsShow</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/macrumorsshow\"></a>, so be sure to give us a follow to keep up with the podcast.
