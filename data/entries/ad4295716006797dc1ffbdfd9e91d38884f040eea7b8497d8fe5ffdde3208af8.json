The company started with two camera lenses in a horizontal configuration on the iPhone 7 Plus and 8 Plus, before switching to a vertical layout on the iPhone X in 2017. Apple stuck with a vertical layout until the iPhone the iPhone 13 in 2021, but used a larger camera array to match the Pro models. In 2024, Apple is expected to return to a smaller vertical array like the one used on the iPhone X.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reasoning behind these changes has always been somewhat obscure, with some pundits believing the diagonal layout allowed for larger sensors to be accommodated, while others think Apple just likes new phones to look different from previous generations for marketing purposes. But this year’s change has a more obvious rationale: vertical lenses will enable the iPhone 16 to take spatial videos for Vision Pro like the iPhone 15 Pro. (This is the same reason why Apple swapped the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/17/iphone-15-pro-max-camera-redesign-periscope/&amp;xcust=1-1-2230789-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">telephoto and ultra-wide lenses</a> on the iPhone 15 Pro last year: so that the main and ultra-wide lenses would sit side by side when the phone was held in landscape orientation.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The switch back to vertical has been rumored for some time. We first reported on this <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1930882/apple-plots-switch-back-vertical-camera-layout-iphone-16.html\">back in March 2023</a>, long before the iPhone 15 came out; at the time the prediction was based on just one source, albeit one with a solid track record, so was regarded as uncertain. But a leak of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2170810/iphone-16-prototype-vertical-camera-layout.html\">alleged ‘prototypes’</a> in December made the idea seem considerably more credible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there have been more recent developments. On Sunday, the X/Twitter user Majin Bu posted leaked “schematics” of the iPhone 16, adding yet more credence to the prediction of vertical camera lenses. At the very least, this appears to indicate that Apple has been exploring this as one possible design.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>iPhone 16 new information (Rumor)<br /><br />The size of the 16 Pro models, while many other sources are saying that the size has increased, I am seeing that the 16 Pro Max will have no change, at least that is what I am currently seeing.

And Majin Bu has in turn updated the prediction to say that the designs in the schematics “are almost 100% identical to the prototypes that are currently being tested by Apple” and that these “will most likely be the final design.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>Some of my sources told me that the renderings that have been released lately on the iPhone 16 schematics that I have shared are almost 100% identical to the prototypes that are currently being tested by Apple, these will most likely be the final design, even if it can't be had… <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://t.co/cast5vpxSK&amp;xcust=1-1-2230789-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">pic.twitter.com/cast5vpxSK</a></p>— Majin Bu (@MajinBuOfficial) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1755219317291933776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-2230789-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">February 7, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Other than potentially bringing support for spatial video–which, perhaps surprisingly, Majin Bu says will only “probably” be added–the changed camera layout won’t make much difference to most users.
