A more vibrant, human experience! Plus makes it much easier to tell who's talking.<br /><br />thanks to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/juberti?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@juberti</a> for this one üëè rolling out now on iOS, Android coming soon! <a href=\"https://t.co/Zit6F9ijRK\">pic.twitter.com/Zit6F9ijRK</a></p>‚Äî Clubhouse (@Clubhouse) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Clubhouse/status/1432014506247417860?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 29, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\nThe company announced the feature on Sunday in a tweet, in which it offered a brief demo and explained that spatial audio is \"like surround sound, but with your own headphones.\" \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn the example, individual speakers on a Clubhouse call can be heard as if their voices are in separate locations within a three-dimensional space around the listener, making it seem like everyone is situated in different places in the same a room. Clubhouse explained that users won't hear spatial audio when they're on stage, only when they're in the audience. Also, Android support is coming soon.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nTo be clear, this isn't Apple's version of spatial audio, which includes head tracking to make it sound like the sound is coming from your <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, but it shows just how much spatial audio has caught on since Apple began touting the concept. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nPowered by ‚Äå<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a>‚Äå or Max and based on Dolby Atmos, Apple's implementation uses the gyroscope and accelerometer in the ‚Äåheadphones‚Äå and the iOS device to track the motion of your head and your ‚Äådevice's position, then compares the motion data, and remaps the sound field so that it stays anchored to your device even as your head moves. \r\n<br />\r\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/enable-dolby-atmos-spatial-audio/\">Apple Music: How to Enable Dolby Atmos Spatial Audio</a></li></ul>\r\n<br />\r\nWith <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a> set to launch next month, Apple plans to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/apple-announces-facetime-features-spatial-audio/\">add spatial audio to FaceTime calls</a>. Like the Clubhouse version, adding spatial audio will make it feel like you're sitting in the same room as the person you're speaking to, and in group calls, friends will sound spread out in the room.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/clubhouse/\">Clubhouse</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/30/clubhouse-rolls-out-spatial-audio-to-ios-users/\">Clubhouse Rolls Out Spatial Audio to iOS Users</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/clubhouse-rolls-out-spatial-audio-to-ios-users.2309153/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Ck_kecpfkSo:0ubDJyMTpTI:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Ck_kecpfkSo:0ubDJyMTpTI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/Ck_kecpfkSo\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3c953e402d39044aba0abe5630abb6160bc70a9c4d2b353b69170741c556719a","category":"Apple"}
