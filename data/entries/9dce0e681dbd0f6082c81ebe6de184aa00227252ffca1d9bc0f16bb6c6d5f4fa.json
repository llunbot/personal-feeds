Now that they’re available for <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZHYWJS\" target=\"_blank\">$399 at Amazon</a>, we really can’t complain about this anymore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We gave the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234986/airpods-max-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Apple AirPods Max a 4-star rating when we reviewed them</a>, appreciating how great the sound is, the “industry-leading active noise canceling,” and the excellent materials and construction. Still, we found them to be too pricey, which, at $550, is easy to understand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are so many great things about the headphones, however. Starting with the superb listening experience and continuing with the way they fit on your head. The headphones even provide a personalized listening experience based on your unique ear shape. Then there’s the noise canceling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Most high-end noise-canceling headphones have some sort of transparency mode that leaves noise canceling active but uses the microphones to pipe in a bit of outside sound, so you can hold a quick conversation or hear other important sounds around you. Apple’s transparency mode is light-years ahead of everyone else’s. It sounds more clear, natural and normal than any other noise-cancelling headphones I have ever used. It’s almost like not wearing headphones at all, except you can still hear your music,” our expert notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So go ahead and place your order for the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZHYWJS\" target=\"_blank\">Apple AirPods max for $399 at Amazon</a> while you still can since we can never know when the deal expires.</p>\n\n\n<span>The AirPods Max are only $399 right now</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZHYWJS\" target=\"_blank\">Get it at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"9dce0e681dbd0f6082c81ebe6de184aa00227252ffca1d9bc0f16bb6c6d5f4fa","category":"Apple"}
