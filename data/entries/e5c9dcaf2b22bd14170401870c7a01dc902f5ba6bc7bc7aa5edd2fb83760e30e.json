{"title":"★ Single-Story a’s in Very Early Versions of Macintosh System 1","link":"https://daringfireball.net/2025/05/single_story_a_classic_mac_system_1","date":1747239719000,"content":"\n<p>Following up on <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/12/that-stupid-apple-notes-a\">my gripe regarding the alternative <em>a</em> glyph</a> used in Apple Notes, here’s <a href=\"https://www.threads.com/@kfury/post/DJlFkNfR5ik\">Kevin Fox, tweeting on Threads</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>While we’re waxing nostalgic on the Original Mac, a Daring\nFireball post today (below) reminded me of another piece of Mac\n128k trivia.</p>\n\n<p>Until shortly before the official release, the ‘a’ in Geneva was a\nsingle story ‘a’ like you see currently (and to some,\ninfuriatingly) in the Notes app.</p>\n\n<p>The screenshots in the original Mac 128k user manual show the OS\nusing the pre-release single-story ‘a’ before it was changed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I double-checked using the (amazing) <a href=\"https://infinitemac.org/\">classic Mac emulators at Infinite Mac</a>, and it turns out, Apple actually shipped System 1.0 with a version of Geneva with a single-story <em>a</em> glyph — but only in the 9-point version of Geneva. At 12 points (and larger), Geneva’s <em>a</em> was double-story. Here are screenshots of the Finder showing Geneva 9 in System 1.0 (with single-story <em>a</em>):</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/05/system-1.0-geneva-a.png\">\n  <img src=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/05/system-1.0-geneva-a.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the Finder in Macintosh System 1.0, showing a version of the Geneva 9 font with a single-story “a” glyph.\" width=\"512\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>And System 2.0 (with double-story <em>a</em>):</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/05/system-2.0-geneva-a.png\">\n  <img src=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/05/system-2.0-geneva-a.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the Finder in Macintosh System 2.0, showing a version of the Geneva 9 font with a double-story “a” glyph.\" width=\"512\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>And a screenshot of MacWrite running on System 1.0 showing Geneva 9 and 12:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/05/system-1.0-geneva-a-macwrite.png\">\n  <img src=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/05/system-1.0-geneva-a-macwrite.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of MacWrite in System 1.0, showing the differences between Geneva 9 and 12.\" width=\"512\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Geneva 9 — the eventual version, with a double-story <em>a</em> — is so intimately familiar to me that looking at those screenshots from System 1.0 makes me feel weird. It’s so clearly wrong. (What it feels like, to me, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/retrobattlestations/comments/1e5k4xb/a_few_years_ago_i_bought_a_beautiful_transparent/\">is the original Palm OS</a>, from the one-bit Palm Pilot / Handspring Visor days. Palm’s small sans serif font was very Geneva-9-ish, but their single-story <em>a</em> was distinctive.)</p>\n\n<p>Fox also posted a link to <a href=\"https://vintageapple.org/macmanuals/pdf/Macintosh_1984.pdf\">Vintage Apple’s high-res scan of the amazing original Mac user manual</a>, which, because it had to go to press before the 1.0 software was finished, contains screenshots of a few icons <a href=\"https://www.threads.com/@johncsiracusa/post/DJniWZ3NCCR\">that changed by the time the original Mac was in customers’ hands</a>. What a remarkably good user manual this is — everything from the typography, to the clarity and tone of its writing, to its comprehensiveness is exemplary.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s where it really gets nutty though. Marcin Wichary — <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/16/the-hardest-working-font-in-manhattan\">whom you may recall</a> from his recent remarkable deep dive on the Gorton typeface (“<a href=\"https://aresluna.org/the-hardest-working-font-in-manhattan/\">The Hardest Working Font in Manhattan</a>”), or from <em><a href=\"https://shifthappens.site/\">Shift Happens</a></em>, his encyclopedic book on the history of keyboards — <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/aresluna.org/post/3lozitikp5k2d\">chimed in on Bluesky</a> after observing that a few of the screenshots in that System 1.0 user manual show an early version of Chicago 12 with a single-story <em>a</em>. Seeing a single-story <em>a</em> in Chicago feels more blasphemous than that AI-generated image Trump tweeted of himself <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/04/world/trump-ai-image-pope-intl-hnk\">as the new pope</a>.</p>\n\n<p>One last note: I of course am not opposed to single-story <em>a</em>’s. Futura’s <em>a</em> is single-story, and <a href=\"http://neverusefutura.com/\">Futura</a>, depending on my mood, might be my answer if asked to name my favorite typeface of all time. I just don’t particularly care for the alternate single-story <em>a</em> in San Francisco (Apple’s <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/fonts/\">modern San Francisco</a>, not <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/05/system-1.0-san-francisco.png\">the one from 1984</a>), and to me it just gives an ever-so-slightly wrong — a little silly or unserious — vibe in the Notes app.</p>\n\n\n\n    ","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"e5c9dcaf2b22bd14170401870c7a01dc902f5ba6bc7bc7aa5edd2fb83760e30e","category":"Tech"}
