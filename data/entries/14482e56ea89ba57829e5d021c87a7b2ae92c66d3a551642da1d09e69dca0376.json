One of those things just changed, though; Valve just released the most substantial <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/3687931965598906185\">overhaul</a> to Steam in years, including a visual makeover and several new features.</p>\n<p>Further, the company has brought the Mac and Linux versions of Steam closer to parity with the historically superior Windows version.</p>\n<p>Valve says \"the most impactful changes\" are actually under the hood.

This codebase overhaul means that new features that come to the desktop version of Steam can simultaneously ship on Steam Deck with minimal effort.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1948635#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1948635&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"14482e56ea89ba57829e5d021c87a7b2ae92c66d3a551642da1d09e69dca0376","category":"Tech"}
