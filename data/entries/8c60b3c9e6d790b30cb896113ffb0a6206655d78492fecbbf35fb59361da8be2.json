It was time for me to build a proper hardtail so the local folks over at 9zero7 bikes helped put together this beautiful hardtail touring / bikepack racing rig. With the explosion of multi day dirt touring routes and bikepacking races I wanted to have a fast and capable set up. It is built with a SON hub and Sinewave Beacon for reliable lighting solution on multi day routes without access to a wall charger. For now it is put together with a Lauf fork and Fleecer Ridge tires to be extra speedy. It would be perfect for taking down the Great Divide route or on the Denali park road.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/09/6-high-res-fork-tire.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The frame bag was custom made by Rockgeist and incorporates bolt on mounts to keep the aesthetic looking clean. Inside of the frame bag is the new Apidura bladder which is conveniently shaped to be the same geometry as a bike triangle. There is still plenty of space for extra layers and bear spray. All other mounted bags will be from local friends over at Revelate Designs.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/09/5-high-res-beacon.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/09/2-high-res-drive-train.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/09/3-high-res-seat-clamp.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I love the Ergon GA3 grips and the purple adds a nice touch to the Wolf Tooth bling gold accents on the bike. I’ve never ridden carbon wheels on a mountain bike before and the ENVE wheel + handlebar combo has been great at dampening vibrations from chunky roads. The SRAM AXS makes a high pitched shifting noise that reminds of marmot. They are a local ground squirrel that loves to steal our food when out backpacking. Some folks around here call them “whistle pigs” and I joke that I now have my own whistle pig that follows me around, haha!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/09/7-high-res-oblique-profile.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Spec List</strong><br />\nFrame: 9zero7 Saber<br />\nFork: Lauf TR Boost<br />\nWheels: ENVE M630<br />\nHubs: front SON 28 hooked up to the Sinewave Beacon light with i9 rear hub<br />\nTires: Rene Herse Fleecer Ridge<br />\nDrivetrain: SRAM AXS 1×12 with 36T chainring<br />\nBrakes: SRAM Level<br />\nBars: ENVE M6<br />\nGrips: Ergon GA3<br />\nPedals: Shimano XTR<br />\nSaddle: Specialized Power Arc Pro Elaston<br />\nFramebag: Rockgeist custom bolt on<br />\nMiscellaneous gold bling: Wolf Tooth</p>\n<p>More bicycle photos and general Alaska photography <a href=\"https://instagram.com/adrianbarniak\" target=\"_blank\">@adrianbarniak</a>.</p>\n<p>____</p>\n<p><em>We’d like to thank all of you who have <a href=\"mailto:readersrides@theradavist.com\" target=\"_blank\">submitted Readers Rides</a> builds to be shared over here.
