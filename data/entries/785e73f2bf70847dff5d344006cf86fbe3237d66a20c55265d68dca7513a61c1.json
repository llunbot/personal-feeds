This project was very involved, so let’s check out the bike in detail below!</em><span></span></p>\n<p>Hey The Radavist! After thoroughly enjoying the post on Lucas’ <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/1995-rockrider-520-restomod/\" target=\"_blank\">1995 RockRider</a> restomod, I thought I’ll throw another restomod from Germany in the ring.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9300.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9300.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9300.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9300.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9300.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9300.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9300.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9300.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9299.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9299.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9299.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9299.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9299.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9299.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9299.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9299.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>This is about my once very unloved 1990 Kuwahara Tiger: The bike – before it came into my hands – was initially left to rot on a random Berlin street corner along with a bogged down seatpost and bottom bracket shells, chipped of paint, and all sorts of terribly abused relics of what once was a very capable mountain bike. The broken components aside, it did not show any structural damage, though.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9302.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9302.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9302.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9302.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9302.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9302.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9302.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9302.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9304.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9304.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9304.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9304.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9304.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9304.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9304.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9304.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Yet I couldn’t withstand this nicely lugged, Japanese quattro-butted Ishiwata steel frame, so I took it home and did, what this page thought me to do: Put a totally unreasonable amount of time and resources into a project that ends in me having another bike that’s just about 5% percent different from my other bikes. The frame itself was for free though, so I had that going for me…</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9498.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9498.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9498.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9498.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9498.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9498.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9498.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9498.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9298.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9298.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9298.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9298.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9298.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9298.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9298.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9298.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>I started with removing the seatpost, as this seemed to indicate the further success of this project. Spoiler: I did not listen to the signs the stuck seat post sent me and after trying all the moderately violent options, I ended up using sodium hydroxide in order to melt the seatpost out of the seat-tube (H U G E  M E S S – I’ll never ever gonna do that again). After that, the removal of the corroded bottom bracket shells, the rear cable-stop and the pump pegs were almost meditative.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9299.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9299.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9299.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9299.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9299.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9299.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9299.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9299.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>After that, I gave to frame to my frame builder in order to remove the rear u-brake bosses and put on cantilever bosses on fork and seatstays to accommodate 650B wheels. I also had some additional mid blade braze-ons on the fork in order to install a lowrider if necessary. We also re-cut any thread of the frame and added the option of internal dynamo-cable routing on the fork.</p>\n<p>Next was removing the old paint and repaint the whole thing.</p>\n<p>Components-wise: Its a wild mix of stuff I had lying around and other stuff that I painstakingly sourced throughout the internet. In the end,  that came together way better than I ever could have imagined.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9297.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9297.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9297.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9297.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9297.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9297.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9297.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9297.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Build Spec:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Frame: Kuwahara Tiger with 650B cantilever-mod</li>\n<li>Wheels: rear: DT Swiss Hugi240 hub with a Ryde Andra rim, front: Shutter Precision SV9 also with the Andra rim</li>\n<li>Tires: Panaracer Gravelling 650-48mm for the summer, in winter I put on a pair of Rene Herse’s 48mm Juniper Ridge</li>\n<li>Transmission: Microshift 2×9 bar-end shifters, Ultegra front derailleur, Shimano XT (1st gen., I believe) rear derailleur</li>\n<li>Crank: Shimano XTR FC-M900 with 46/30 T.A. chainrings and a 103mm Neco titanium bottom bracket</li>\n<li>Brakes: Avid Single Digit Ti</li>\n<li>Seatpost and stem: Velo Orange</li>\n<li>Saddle: Rivet Pearl</li>\n<li>Lighting: Supernova E3Pro and E3 Taillight</li>\n<li>Handelbar: Richey Venturemax WCS</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<hr />\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>We’d like to thank all of you who <a href=\"mailto:readersrides@theradavist.com\" target=\"_blank\">submitted Readers Rides</a> builds to be shared here at The Radavist.
