It’s a tale of complex sessions and maximising resources…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>World-class women</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Trek-Segafredo was founded in 2011 under the name Leopard-Trek. As per pro cycling’s brittle sponsorship-led business model, the team went by several different monikers until Italian coffee giant Segafredo came on board in 2016. This added financial stability and led to the launch of a women’s team in 2019, which last season notched up 33 wins to finish second behind SD Worx in the Women’s WorldTour rankings.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/trek-segafredo-training-camp-06-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Trek-Segafredo training camp\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/trek-segafredo-training-camp-06-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/trek-segafredo-training-camp-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/trek-segafredo-training-camp-06-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/trek-segafredo-training-camp-06-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/trek-segafredo-training-camp-06-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/trek-segafredo-training-camp-06-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/trek-segafredo-training-camp-06-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/trek-segafredo-training-camp-06.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Sun, smooth roads and route variety makes the Costa Blanca a cyclist’s paradise</figcaption><figcaption>Sean Hardy</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Dressed in the team’s white and light blue on this fresh January morning, the group represents a who’s who of women’s cycling: Ellen van Dijk, Time-Trial World Champion and Hour record holder; Elisa Balsamo, nine victories last season and Road Race World Champion in 2021; Lucinda Brand, 2022 Tour du Suisse champ and winner of the 2021 Cyclocross Worlds. Also in attendance are Gaia Realini, Shirin van Anrooij and Elynor Bäckstedt, who’s sporting road rash from a downhill masterclass taken by Oscar Saiz earlier in the camp. An ex-pro mountain biker teaching descending skills? It’s progressive if sometimes painful stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reigning Paris-Roubaix Femmes champ Elisa Longo Borghini was also here but headed off earlier this morning for an altitude camp, while Lizzie Deignan is on maternity leave after giving birth to her second child, Shea, in September. Also bolstering the squad this year are Australians Amanda Spratt and Brodie Chapman, but both are currently at the Tour Down Under.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/trek-segafredo-training-camp-03-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Trek-Segafredo training camp\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/trek-segafredo-training-camp-03-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/trek-segafredo-training-camp-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/trek-segafredo-training-camp-03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/trek-segafredo-training-camp-03-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/trek-segafredo-training-camp-03-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/trek-segafredo-training-camp-03-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/trek-segafredo-training-camp-03-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/trek-segafredo-training-camp-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Elynor Bäckstedt (right) rode through the pain of road rash after a fall at camp</figcaption><figcaption>Sean Hardy</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘Who are the other riders in the darker blue?’ we ask Irizar, who’s taking a closer look at today’s planned ride on VeloViewer. ‘They’re from the Trek Factory Racing team, our off-road squad,’ he replies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s another star-studded line-up, including Jolanda Neff, winner of mountain biking cross-country gold at the 2020 Olympics, who is chatting away to Britain’s Evie Richards, XCO World Champion in 2021. Ahead of this cosmopolitan pack lies a 107km loop with 1,600m climbing, although this wasn’t always the plan, says Irizar.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/trek-segafredo-training-camp-04-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Trek-Segafredo training camp\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/trek-segafredo-training-camp-04-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/trek-segafredo-training-camp-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/trek-segafredo-training-camp-04-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/trek-segafredo-training-camp-04-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/trek-segafredo-training-camp-04-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/trek-segafredo-training-camp-04-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/trek-segafredo-training-camp-04.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>2021 Road Race World Champion Elisa Balsamo gets in some time-trialling prep ahead of the new season</figcaption><figcaption>Sean Hardy</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘Today was supposed to be a recovery day but the winds were crazy yesterday so we swapped the sessions over. It’s a bit of a mixed bag because we have the mountain biking girls, the road squad and the likes of Lucinda and Shirin, who are racing the Benidorm Cyclocross World Cup this Sunday [Brand and Van Anrooij would finish fifth and third respectively, the latter on a replacement bike after her Trek Boone was stolen from the parking lot ahead of the race]. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But they’ll all cover the same route today, including the long climb up to La Vall d’Ebo, albeit at different intensities. We’ll also do some sprints on the flat where they ride real slow and then power up in the big gear. The high threshold work is preparing them for race season.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pro roads</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/trek-segafredo-training-camp-05-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Trek-Segafredo training camp\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/trek-segafredo-training-camp-05-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/trek-segafredo-training-camp-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/trek-segafredo-training-camp-05-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/trek-segafredo-training-camp-05-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/trek-segafredo-training-camp-05-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/trek-segafredo-training-camp-05-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/trek-segafredo-training-camp-05-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/trek-segafredo-training-camp-05.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Head of performance Josu Larrazabal is charged with overseeing training content</figcaption><figcaption>Sean Hardy</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>We head west from the team’s hotel, the Denia Marriott La Sella Golf Resort and Spa.

But his ebullience these days is in stark contrast to a tough childhood in the Basque province of Gipuzkoa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘When I was a kid, we had a shit life,’ he says matter-of-factly. ‘My dad was an alcoholic and we had no money. Thankfully, the owner of my local bike shop helped me. He sponsored the first club I raced for as a youngster and always encouraged me.

We spy Mads Pederson first, looking for all the world like he has just been out for a Sunday stroll, rather than returned from 170km of undulating roads around Spain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pedersen is arguably the team’s star rider now the likes of Nibali and Richie Porte have retired, with the Dane set to race the Giro d’Italia this year in search of stage wins alongside targeting a selection of cobbled Classics. Can he raise the men’s team beyond their mid-table mediocrity of 2022? Recent history suggests not. Last year the men’s team won 19 times, as they did in 2021.

At this early stage in their careers neither is likely to win big, although their signing does signal the team’s focus on youth, and a month into the season it’s already paying back. As we sit in the Costa Blanca, American Quinn Simmons, just 21, has taken a stage plus tenth overall at the Vuelta a San Juan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This focus on raw talent is partly by design, but perhaps also partly by necessity, as the men’s team are mooted to have a moderate budget. Quite how much only they know – teams generally don’t reveal their accounts – but ‘moderate’ may mean in the high-teens of millions, and that budget has to stretch to the 14 women and 29 men, as well as the Trek Factory Racing off-road team.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/trek-segafredo-training-camp-13-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Trek-Segafredo training camp\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/trek-segafredo-training-camp-13-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/trek-segafredo-training-camp-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/trek-segafredo-training-camp-13-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/trek-segafredo-training-camp-13-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/trek-segafredo-training-camp-13-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/trek-segafredo-training-camp-13-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/trek-segafredo-training-camp-13-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/trek-segafredo-training-camp-13.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Jacopo Mosca catches up with news.

The team also famously topped up Lizzie Deignan’s Roubaix-winning purse in 2021 to match the men’s – increasing it to €30,000 from a derisible €1,535. Still, with Trek and Segafredo’s annual turnover a reported £2 billon between them, we’ll refrain from handing out the collection bucket just yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We might not have the biggest budget but we’ll be competitive this season,’ says Irizar. ‘Yes, the peloton’s growing stronger, but so are we. But success isn’t always measured by victories. This is a great, inclusive team. Trek’s doing more and more for the environment and is leading the way,’ says the man with the marketing glint in his eye. ‘It’s why all of your readers will regret it if they don’t buy a Trek before they die…’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The trailblazer</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Trek-Segafredo’s Elisabetta Borgi is the WorldTour’s first full-time psychologist.

Areas include emotional regulation, coping skills, focus, anxiety and self-confidence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘There are three common stressors for riders: the performance side, their private lives and the organisational – much of which is down to the leadership and the environment we create. We know we can’t control or prevent everything, but we have a duty to create a strong psychological environment for performance and better mental health.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The women are definitely more receptive than men. Once they see you’re reliable they open up and create a full relationship with you. Men, it’s different, although we’re slowly getting there. The female riders are more perfectionists, which is good from one side but it’s easier to tip over the edge. If you look at the research, female athletes suffer more from burnout than men, which matches with their super-high expectations. They also like to feel in control of the situation, and if they feel they lose control – be it through their competitors’ performance or their own – it’s easier for them to drop into a low mood and become more anxious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Basically, the ideal doesn’t look like the real.
