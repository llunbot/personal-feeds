It is notable that Apple is specifically using the word \"experience,\" rather than \"event.\" Unlike a full live-streamed event from <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-park/\">Apple Park</a>, the March 4 event in other cities is likely to be smaller in scale.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe launch of several new Apple products is believed to be imminent. We're most likely to see the announcement of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> 17e, a spec-bumped successor to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/\">iPhone 16e</a>, with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/05/iphone-17e-and-ipad-12-rumors/\">rumored upgrades</a> including an A19 chip, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a>, and Apple's C1X and N1 wireless chips. The device will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/05/iphone-17e-and-ipad-12-rumors/\">apparently have a notch</a> despite earlier rumors mentioning a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/\">Dynamic Island</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/08/iphone-17e-launch-imminent-with-four-features/\">pricing will continue to start at $599</a> in the United States.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe all-new low-cost MacBook is likely to arrive, featuring the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/02/12-9-inch-macbook-spring-2026-rumor/\">A18 Pro chip</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/02/12-9-inch-macbook-spring-2026-rumor/\">12.9-inch display</a>, and a selection of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/16/low-cost-macbook-yellow-green-blue-pink/\">fun color options</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a> is also expected to receive the M5 Pro and M5 Max chips, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/10/16/new-14-inch-macbook-pro-two-key-upgrades/\">PCIe 5.0 support</a> for faster SSD speeds.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAdditionally, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> is due a bump up to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/08/ipad-12-and-ipad-air-8-reportedly-coming-soon/\">M4 chip</a>, while the entry-level <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> is expected to get the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/08/ipad-12-and-ipad-air-8-reportedly-coming-soon/\">A18 chip</a> with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a> support.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA refreshed <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/\">Mac Studio</a>, and Studio Display are also possibilities, along with a new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a>. The event could could include a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/19/apple-immersive-f1-vision-pro-march-event/\">demo of immersive Formula 1 content</a> on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a>, too.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe also discuss iOS 26.4, which is now available in beta. The update includes a new Playlist Playground feature that lets users create a playlist with a text-based prompt, refinements to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a>'s design, videos in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-podcasts/\">Apple Podcasts</a>, end-to-end encryption (E2EE) for ‌<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/\">RCS</a>‌ messages, and more. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-macrumors-show/\">The MacRumors Show</a> has <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow\">its own YouTube channel</a>, so make sure you're subscribed to keep up with new episodes and clips.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@themacrumorsshow?sub_confirmation=1\"><div>Subscribe to <em>The MacRumors Show</em> YouTube channel!</div></a></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYou can also listen to ‌The MacRumors Show‌ on <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/id1602394741\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/41XOHIA6w8IxAKJZvrnx90\">Spotify</a>, <a href=\"https://overcast.fm/itunes1602394741\">Overcast</a>, or other podcast apps.
