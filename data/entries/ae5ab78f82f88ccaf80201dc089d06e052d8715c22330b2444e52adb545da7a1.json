To many of us, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671336/how-to-back-up-a-mac-or-macbook.html\">backing up a Mac</a> means using <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671873/how-to-use-time-machine-to-back-up-a-mac.html\">Time Machine</a>, the free backup app included with macOS. Time Machine can make incremental backups of everything on a Mac and can be used clone an old Mac to a new Mac. Also popular is iCloud, which although not a way to back up your Mac, can be used to sync photos, music, files and more so you can access them on all your Apple devices. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, while Time Machine and iCloud are great resources, they aren’t perfect, and relying on them alone to keep your data safe is a mistake that could have disastrous consequences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we look at the best Mac backup software to use with your Mac.

But that doesn’t necessarily mean it will be the best option for you.</p>\n\n<p>Time Machine is a reliable tool for local backups of Macs, providing a full-sized initial backup of every file on the Mac and incremental backups throughout the day as long as the Mac is attached to a designated Time Machine external drive. That drive can be disconnected and used as an external drive for other computers or paired with multiple Macs for backups.</p>\n\n<p>The first backup takes the longest while every file on the Mac is rolled into the Time Machine backup, but it gets quicker from there. Time Machine’s Restore function allows users to open and scroll through past backups to locate and restore files, which is useful if something was accidentally deleted or you made changes to a file and need to go back to an earlier version.</p>\n\n<p>When paired with Apple’s Migration Assistant, porting data and user profiles from an old Mac to a new one is simple. When importing a Time Machine backup to a new Mac, Time Machine inherits previous backups as well.</p>\n\n<p>For security, users can designate a password to encrypt their Time Machine backups and there are reminders about the number of days since the last backup that encourage you to keep it plugged in.</p>\n\n<p>However, Time Machine is more geared towards external hard drives, which can be lost, damaged, or stolen, and it relies on said drive being connected to your Mac (you could use a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668856/best-nas-pcs-drives-for-mac.html\">NAS drive</a>). It is best to have both a local and secure off-site copy of your data, and the online backup market has grown over the past few years with services like iCloud, OneDrive, Dropbox, and Box.</p>\n\n<p>Despite its limitations, Time Machine is an excellent solution for local backups of Macs. While it requires an external hard drive connected to the Mac for consistent functionality, it offers excellent protection built into the operating system.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChronoSync – Ultimate Mac backup with complete control\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure><img alt=\"ChronoSync - Ultimate Mac backup with complete control\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Chronosync-Review.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n<li>Good level of control</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Supports backing up to Google Cloud and Amazon S3</li>\n</ul>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n<li>Complex</li>\n</ul>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChronosync: $49.99; ChronoSync Express: $29.99\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today: \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Retailer</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Price</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Econ Technologies</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$49.99\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.econtechnologies.com/store/econ-store.php\">View Deal</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Product</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Price</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\tPrice comparison from Backmarket\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>ChronoSync for macOS, from Econ Technologies, can give those who want it tighter control over their backup options in a format that doesn’t overwhelm. The software is based on several core modules including Home Folder Backup, Data Volume, Synchronize Two Folders, Multiple Folder Backup, Bootable Backup, Backup to a Disk Image, and Folder Backup.</p>\n\n<p>Simply select your desired function from the ChronoSync Organizer/home screen. For example, select the task you want to create, specify your settings (e.g. folders you want to copy over, file types to copy, a schedule, etc.), and hit “Synchronize”.</p>\n\n<p>Synchronizations can also be set up to simulate functions. For the truly die-hard and geeky, rule-based copies and tasks can be set up. </p>\n\n<p>You can readily back up to NAS and file servers, the program supporting Apple’s HFS+ and APFS file formats as well as others. ChronoSync also supports backing up to Google Cloud and Amazon storage.</p>\n\n<p>For users looking to make bootable clones, this is just as easy as what <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2371118/superduper-review.html\">SuperDuper! </a>or <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2405539/carbon-copy-cloner-review.html\">Carbon Copy Cloner</a> have become known for. Choose a source volume, choose a target volume, hit “Synchronize,” let the process run. ChronoSync can create two types of bootable clones: standard and mirrored. The former creates a bootable system on the destination volume, leaving other files on the volume intact.

It supports HFS+ and APFS drive formats, local volumes, and NAS-enabled networks. However, it cannot back up Windows file formats, optical media, web-based platforms, or Apple’s Time Machine platforms.</p>\n\n<p>Carbon Copy Cloner has a comprehensive user interface, and customizable filters and grants access to configuration options like disk encryption, task notes, and bandwidth configuration for NAS backups. Other tools, such as scheduling, can be performed without issue. The task manager allows users to save and configure multiple backup tasks. A scripting feature allows custom scripts to be loaded and activated as needed.</p>\n\n<p>The SafetyNet feature allows for drive formatting or stopping processes before overwriting data on a volume. However, there are some weak points, including Apple’s lack of openness and the need for bootable external volumes. Creating a bootable external volume in Carbon Copy Cloner is currently a hit-or-miss proposition, with attempts at creating a bootable external volume failing due to Apple’s protocols. Other utilities face the same issues.</p>\n\n<p>Carbon Copy Cloner pairs well with utilities like Time Machine, Apple’s Migration Assistant, and SuperDuper!. The company’s customer support is friendly and speedy, and the software offers quick access to help guides. A supportive community and frequent developer updates are another bonus. If Carbon Copy Cloner is not in your arsenal of handy utilities, you should download it and give it a try. There’s a full-featured 30-day trial. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2405539/carbon-copy-cloner-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tCarbon Copy Cloner review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSuperDuper! – One of the best Mac cloning apps \t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure><img alt=\"SuperDuper! - One of the best Mac cloning apps \" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Superduper-review.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n<li>Easy installation, great user interface</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Scripting and customization capabilities</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Reliable updates</li>\n</ul>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n<li>No network volume support</li>\n\n\n\n<li>No FAT, exFAT, or NTFS support</li>\n</ul>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$27.95\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today: \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Retailer</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Price</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Shirt Pocket</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$27.95\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html?buyProductID=558385\">View Deal</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Product</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Price</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\tPrice comparison from Backmarket\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p><a href=\"https://www.shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html\" target=\"_blank\">SuperDuper!</a> (version 3.8 at the time of this review) is a popular Mac cloning and restoration app that is easy to install. It supports APFS and HFS+ file formats and can be customized to fit individual needs. In addition to cloning, the app supports scheduling and allows users to specify files to be copied over, including Unix-specific elements like user folders, shared users, shared users and applications, and backup files.</p>\n\n<p>SuperDuper! easily restores data from one volume to another, which is simpler than using Apple’s restoration options in macOS’s Disk Utility. The user interface displays the number of files copied, copy speed, data evaluated, time elapsed, and amount of data moved from the source volume to the target volume. Users can edit provided scripts or write their own, choose between methods such as Total Backup and Smart Backup, and set up events like permission repairs before a copy begins, scripts to execute after a copy has completed, and for the Mac to eject the target volume, shut down, go to sleep, or quit SuperDuper! once the copy is done.</p>\n\n<p>However, SuperDuper! has room for improvement. For example, it can’t back up to network volumes and it doesn’t support FAT, exFAT, or NTFS for Windows and Linux volumes.

It allows you to continually backup your entire drive to the cloud, while also letting you drag and drop files to the cloud to access remotely. lDrive also allows you to back up external hard drives.</p>\n\n<p>lDrive’s user interface is very straightforward. Your Desktop, Documents, Music and Pictures folders are automatically selected for backup, along with the contents of ~/Library/Mail.</p>\n\n<p>Features like Rewind and Snapshots allow you to restore from earlier versions of files or snapshots of the complete data set. </p>\n\n<p>To add other folders, click ‘Change’ at the bottom of the window – that’s not exactly intuitive. You can add videos to the backup, but locating them in lDrive’s interface can be complicated.</p>\n\n<p>Both scheduling and restoring are straightforward, however. As is choosing a local drive as the destination for a backup in place of lDrive’s servers.</p>\n\n<p>All data is encrypted, with the option to set your own private encryption key.</p>\n\n<p>You have the choice of restoring by having data physically shipped to you. This is free for the first restore each year, but if you are based outside the US you’ll have to pay for shipping.</p>\n\n<p>The subscription-based tier system offers a free Basic account with 10GB of online disk space for free with no credit or debit card required. That 10GB free tier allows for local backups and is pretty generous, but the real steal is the IDrive Mini plan, which, for less than 3 bucks a year, gives you access to 100GB of storage. </p>\n\n<p>lDrive’s free tier and the ability to spread your data allocation in the paid tiers across multiple computers makes it attractive. Overall, though, it’s expensive for a single machine.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2509843/idrive-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIDrive review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Backup Pro – Excellent for the casual user\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure><img alt=\"Get Backup Pro - Excellent for the casual user\" src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/slideshow/3641849/get_backup_pro.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n<li>Flexibility </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Can back up to network volumes</li>\n</ul>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFrom $29.99 for a single license; Family pack of up to 5 Macs is $49.99\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today: \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Retailer</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Price</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>BeLight Software</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$29.99\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.belightsoft.com/products/getbackup/\">View Deal</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Product</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Price</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\tPrice comparison from Backmarket\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>Get Backup Pro by BeLight Software is easy to download, install into the Applications folder, and run (although we did encounter a few problems assigning full disk access).</p>\n\n<p>The user interface keeps things simple, scheduling full backups, cloning, and incremental backups worked like a charm, and a slate of customization options allows for specific files and folders to be chosen and app data to be added to the backup/clone process.</p>\n\n<p>The impressive level of customization makes it easy to set tasks up, while an excellent restoration system installed data where it needed to be without fail.

Mac Backup Guru offers this feature. Additionally, the number of recent snapshots can be designated as well before older snapshots are deleted. </p>\n\n<p>There’s also backup/cloning feature that taps into iCloud-related tools and makes a copy of all your iCloud-based files to help complete the cloned volume. </p>\n\n<p>Still, there’s room for improvement.

Backblaze also excludes some file types from being backed up, such as .dmg disk images – that restriction can be switched off, however.</p>\n\n<p>Backups are kept for 30 days, so you can restore from any that ran during that time. As you would expect, backups are incremental so only files that have changed since it last ran are copied. Data is encrypted and you can optionally add a six-digit passcode to provide an additional layer of security.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to restoring your data, you have three options: you can restore via Backblaze’s web interface or you can have files sent to you on a USB stick or hard drive for an additional fee. And there’s a 100% refund if you return the USB stick or hard drive within 30 days, though you’ll have to pay shipping and taxes.</p>\n\n<p>You can view individual files and choose which ones to download. And you can view and share backed up files on an iPhone or iPad with the Backblaze mobile app.</p>\n\n<p>The Locate your Computer service tracks your Mac’s location to help you find it if it’s stolen – similar to Find My. If a lost Mac is still running backups your Mac can tell you its current IP address and show you recently backed-up data.</p>\n\n<p>Backblaze’s user interface comprises a menu bar item and a System Preferences pane. However, that pane is more like a fully fledged application, with options to exclude files, add folders and disks to the backup, and throttle bandwidth. It’s simple and very Mac-like.</p>\n\n<p>If you only need to back up one Mac, and particularly if you want to back up external disks, Backblaze’s simplicity and price give it the edge over Carbonite and IDrive.</p>\n\n<p>With Backblaze your data is stored in secure data centres and two-factor authentication adds an extra level of security.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2475815/backblaze-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBackblaze review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAcronis True Image for Mac – Customizable backup utility\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure><img alt=\"Acronis True Image for Mac - Customizable backup utility\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Acronis-Cloud-True-Image.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n<li>Good backup elements, functional scheduling, and fast copy speeds.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Antiviral Protection module.</li>\n</ul>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n<li>Cloud-based dashboard interface</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Errors creating clone archives</li>\n</ul>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEssentials: $49.99 a year for local back up of one computer (currently $39.99); Advanced: $72.99 a year for local and cloud backup of 1 computer (currently $51.09)  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today: \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Retailer</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Price</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Acronis </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$49.99\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.acronis.com/en-us/products/true-image/\">View Deal</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Product</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Price</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\tPrice comparison from Backmarket\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>Acronis True Image for Mac works as a customizable backup utility as well as an antiviral/anti-malware app. It starts at $49.99/£42.99 per year for the Essentials version that includes one computer with local backup and anti-ransomware.

It’s easy to create exclusion lists as to which files can by bypassed when it comes to backing up, and the scheduling feature worked well.</p>\n\n<p>The Backup module also leads to True Image’s Acronis Survival Kit, which allows for a bootable backup drive to be created that your Mac can boot and install a new operating system from.</p>\n\n<p>The Disk Cloning module works well, and makes quick copies of volumes as needed. The Archive module allows you to offload local data to Acronis’ cloud structure, which is handy for freeing up local space.</p>\n\n<p>The Protection module offered a good degree of antiviral protection, catching no less than 23 potential threats from a sample archive off the bat.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, during our testing there were bugs that couldn’t be avoided and user interface elements that were either inconvenient or needed a complete overall.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2572917/acronis-true-image-for-mac-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAcronis True Image review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<h2>Why you should trust Macworld</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Macworld’s backup software reviewer, Chris Barylick is an Apple-Certified Macintosh Technician with experience working with clients who have lost data and decades of experience tinkering with Macs. Like the rest of the Macworld team, he has been using Mac hardware, software, and services for decades. Macworld’s review process is thorough and we have evaluated all aspects of the products included here. We discuss our testing process in more detail below.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How we choose the best backup software</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here at Macworld we conduct comprehensive software reviews and, on occasion, a particular application emerges as an undisputed standout. However, in certain cases, multiple contenders may emerge. The optimal choice often hinges on a specific set of requirements. For instance, one option may be the most suitable for those with a limited budget, while another may be preferable for an individual who wants more control over the software. Consequently, we provide specific recommendations for each application so you can find the one that meets your needs. The applications that we deem most worthy are included in our group tests. If an application is not featured here, it may be due to its lower rating compared to those included in this roundup.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How we test Mac backup software</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We judge the best Mac backup software on a variety of criteria including reliability, ease of use and the features it supports. Our tests involve running each program through the various types of backups it’s capable of, restoring backup data to make sure that it can be recovered without corruption, and simulating disaster recovery scenarios. We aim to ensure that the software delivers on its promises and that it is easy to use. We run through what we recommend you look for in a backup app in more detail below. We award scores between 0 and 5, including half stars and the best apps are then considered for our Best Backup software for Mac list.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to choose the best Mac backup app</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve selected the best Mac backup software in this group test based on the criteria mentioned above. If you are evaluating the best option for you we recommend that you consider the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Value for money</strong>: Is the app subscription only or can you purchase a perpetual licence? In many cases buying the software outright may appeal because you won’t be charged each year. One advantage of a subscription model tends to be that the developer will keep your version of the app up to date, so there is less risk that the app won’t be supported in the future. Some apps will have multiple features, which is great if you need them all, but another app with fewer features may cost less and give you what you need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Backup options</strong>: Think about what you want to backup because there is more than one type of backup. A <strong>system backup</strong> will back up everything – the operating system, all your applications, and all your settings. This means that if your Mac fails (or you buy a new one) you can recover your Mac exactly the way it was onto a new model. This method is time consuming the first time the backup is made, but later backups are incremental, with only only backups being things that have changed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively a <strong>data only back up</strong> will allow you to keep a copy of files and data that can be restored at a later date. This method is quick, but if your Mac fails you will need to reinstall the operating system and your apps and your unique set up will be lost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another option, though it’s not a backup as such, is <strong>syncing</strong>. You can sync your data on your Mac to the cloud and then access it on other devices you own. The main problem with this is that if you alter a file that is synced to the cloud those changes are made centrally, so you can’t easily recover an older version. So if you delete what’s in the cloud you will lose it for ever (although luckily there is an option to recover your deleted data for 30-day, at least on iCloud).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Backup device</strong>:<strong> </strong>Another issue is what you will be backing up to. A SSD will be quick, but an hard drive will offer you more space for less money. Your choice of backup software should consider how much data you are backing up and what you are backing up to. Another consideration is what will happen when you run out of space for your backup. Look at the space management options of the backup app. Will older backups be deleted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Scheduling options</strong>: Of all the features offered by backup apps this is probably the most important. Look to see how often you can set your backups to happen, are they real time, continuous, hourly, daily, weekly? If your Mac is only backing up what changes then a real time backup can actually be less noticeable because you Mac only backs up a small amount of data at a time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Security</strong>: Also important is the security of your data, especially if you are carrying a hard drive around with you. Look for both encryption and/or password protection options.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><h2> FAQ </h2><hr />\n<div><div><span>1.</span>\n<h3>What is the best way to backup a Mac?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<p>An ideal strategy consists of at least two separate backup schedules, one backing up your Mac to a hard drive onsite, and one backing up to a drive that’s stored offsite or in the cloud. At the very least, if you use Time Machine to back up to an external hard drive or network device, you should also have another tool running regular backups to a different drive just in case one fails.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div><span>2.</span>\n<h3>How do I backup my entire Mac to an external hard drive?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<p>You can do this with Time Machine, which is the simplest and cheapest solution. The only associated cost is purchasing an external drive, but a 1TB hard drive can be purchased for less than $30/£40 these days, so that isn’t prohibitive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how to backup with Time Machine:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Plug in a hard drive, SSD or NAS drive.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>An alert should appear on your Mac asking if you want to use the drive with Time Machine. Click Use as Backup Disk. (If you don’t see the alert, make sure the drive is formatted correctly, see: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671300/how-to-format-a-drive-on-a-mac.html\">How to format a drive for Mac</a>).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you still don’t see the alert, open System Settings &gt; General &gt; Time Machine and choose Backup Disk. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Choose the storage device and click Use Disk.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Choose how often you want to back up, this can be every hour, daily, weekly, or manually. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>You can also choose what to exclude from backups. Just click on the + to remove certain folders. </li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>As we mention above, you shouldn’t rely on only Time Machine, a better solution might be one that is not kept at the same location as your Mac, given that if there was a fire or flood, both Mac and backup could be destroyed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We explain <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671873/how-to-use-time-machine-to-back-up-a-mac.html\">How to back up your Mac with Time Machine</a> and also <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671336/how-to-back-up-a-mac-or-macbook.html\">How to back up a Mac</a> using various other methods in separate articles. </p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div><span>3.</span>\n<h3>What does a Mac backup include?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<p>Time Machine keeps a back up of everything on your Mac.
