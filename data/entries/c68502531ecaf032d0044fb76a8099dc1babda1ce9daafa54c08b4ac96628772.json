The new Norco Sight VLT CX all-mountain eMTB is part of their continuing innovation in their VLT line. But, you’ll have to wait until Spring 2025. Sorry, kids. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Norco-Bikes-Sight-VLT-CX-eMTB-front-side-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"881\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Norco-Bikes-Sight-VLT-CX-eMTB-front-side-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Norco Bikes Sight VLT CX eMTB front side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Norco-Bikes-Sight-VLT-CX-eMTB-front-side-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Norco-Bikes-Sight-VLT-CX-eMTB-front-side-297x204.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Norco-Bikes-Sight-VLT-CX-eMTB-front-side-120x83.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Norco-Bikes-Sight-VLT-CX-eMTB-front-side-768x529.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos / Norco Bikes)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Norco-Bikes-Sight-VLT-CX-eMTB-Bosch-motor-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"851\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Norco-Bikes-Sight-VLT-CX-eMTB-Bosch-motor-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Norco Bikes Sight VLT CX eMTB Bosch motor\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Norco-Bikes-Sight-VLT-CX-eMTB-Bosch-motor-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Norco-Bikes-Sight-VLT-CX-eMTB-Bosch-motor-297x197.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Norco-Bikes-Sight-VLT-CX-eMTB-Bosch-motor-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Norco-Bikes-Sight-VLT-CX-eMTB-Bosch-motor-768x511.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Norco-Bikes-Sight-VLT-CX-eMTB-Bosch-motor-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Norco-Bikes-Sight-VLT-CX-eMTB-Bosch-motor-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Using the updated <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/boschs-new-performance-cx-ebike-motor-is-not-more-powerful-but-is-better-and-lighter/\" target=\"_blank\">Bosch Performance Line CX</a> system, the new Sight VLT CX claims to be almost 20% lighter than the previous models.

Norco also utilizes size-specific chainstay lengths, though a full geometry chart is not yet available. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bike will be available in three different models, so you can pick out the best build spec for your needs.
