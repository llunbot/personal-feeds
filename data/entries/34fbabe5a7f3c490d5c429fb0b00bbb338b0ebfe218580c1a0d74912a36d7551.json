Our company wants to continue offering unique ways to play with its integrated hardware and software business, so please look forward to it.\"</p>\n<p>It's hard to read too much into that non-answer, considering that Nintendo hasn't formally announced <em>any</em> details about its next console hardware yet. Later in that same Q&amp;A, though, Furukawa <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/1673552699202363392\">noted</a> that \"as for the transition from Nintendo Switch to the next-generation machine, we want to do as much as possible in order to smoothly transition our customers, while utilizing the Nintendo Account.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1950554#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1950554&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"34fbabe5a7f3c490d5c429fb0b00bbb338b0ebfe218580c1a0d74912a36d7551","category":"Tech"}
