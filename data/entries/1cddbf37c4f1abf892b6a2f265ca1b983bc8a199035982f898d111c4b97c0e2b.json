Ad tech company Glance has been taking advantage of that for years with its <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/07/coming-soon-to-a-carrier-phone-near-you-lock-screen-ads/\">ad-laden lock screen experiences</a>, but it's going further in the age of AI. Samsung and Glance have teamed up to deliver a new \"AI shopping\" experience that uses a selfie to create custom fashion ads. This feature is rolling out to numerous Samsung phones in the next month.</p>\n<p>Glance has been around for a whileâ€”its non-AI lock screen experience has been bundled on various phones from Samsung, Motorola, and others. Before the AI era, Glance lured people in with promises of pretty pictures and news alerts, which came with a side of ads and tracking. The new Glance AI feature has all that, but it adds an unsettling face-stealing layer to the experience.</p>\n<p>The AI-infused Glance will arrive on Samsung phones as both a standalone app and a fully integrated lock screen. Thankfully, this is a fully opt-in experience. If you never open or set up Glance, you can keep using the normal lock screen on your phone.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/samsung-teams-up-with-glance-to-use-your-face-in-ai-generated-lock-screen-ads/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/06/samsung-teams-up-with-glance-to-use-your-face-in-ai-generated-lock-screen-ads/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ryan Whitwam","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1cddbf37c4f1abf892b6a2f265ca1b983bc8a199035982f898d111c4b97c0e2b","category":"Tech"}
