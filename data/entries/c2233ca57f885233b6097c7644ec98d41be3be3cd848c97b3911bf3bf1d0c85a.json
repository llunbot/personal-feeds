Employees on the ‌Siri‌ team will be able to use time away to recharge and prepare for \"hard work ahead.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWalker told employees that it is not yet clear when the new ‌Siri‌ features will be ready for launch, but Apple's statement about the delay mentioned \"in the coming year.\" That has been interpreted as 2026, or in an update to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/\">iOS 19</a> operating system launching this fall.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWalker said that Apple is aiming for ‌iOS 19‌, but that the timeline \"doesn't mean that we're shipping then.\" Apple will ship the ‌Siri‌ functions when they're ready to launch, and the company does not want to provide the public with unfinished features, even if \"competitors might have launched them in this state or worse.\"\r<br />\n<blockquote>\"We have other commitments across Apple to other projects,\" Walker said, citing new software and hardware initiatives. \"We want to keep our commitments to those, and we understand those are now potentially more timeline-urgent than the features that have been deferred.\" He said decisions on timing will be made on a \"case-by-case basis\" as work progresses on products planned for next year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"Customers are not expecting only these new features but they also want a more fully rounded-out Siri,\" he said. \"We're going to ship these features and more as soon as they are ready.\"</blockquote>\r<br />\nAccording to <em>Bloomberg</em>, Apple does not have plans to fire ‌Siri‌ chief John Giannandrea or any other ‌Siri‌ executives at this time, though there have been discussions about moving additional senior executives under Giannandrea to speed up development.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/14/apple-siri-team-reassurance/\">Apple Reassures Siri Team Members Feeling Disappointed and Embarrassed by Apple Intelligence Delay</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reassures-siri-team-members-feeling-disappointed-and-embarrassed-by-apple-intelligence-delay.2453136/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c2233ca57f885233b6097c7644ec98d41be3be3cd848c97b3911bf3bf1d0c85a","category":"Apple"}
