My go-to size is 30-32mm, just enough to take on bumps but small enough to fit in my cyclocross frame. The Vittoria RideArmor offers an excellent array of sizes for the dedicated roadie and the rider coming off a season of 33mm. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-close-up-new--scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"514\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-close-up-new--800x514.jpeg\" alt=\"Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-close-up-new-\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-close-up-new--800x514.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-close-up-new--297x191.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-close-up-new--120x77.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-close-up-new--768x494.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-close-up-new--1536x987.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-close-up-new--2048x1316.jpeg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I went with the 32mm size in the middle of the RideArmor range. It fits the hookless rim (via Vittoria’s recommendations) and is what I’m partial toward. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-weight-32--scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"601\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-weight-32--800x601.jpeg\" alt=\"Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-weight-32\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-weight-32--800x601.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-weight-32--297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-weight-32--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-weight-32--768x577.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-weight-32--1536x1155.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-weight-32--2048x1539.jpeg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Weight</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Vittoria RideArmor, in 32mm is 436g on my scales. It’s not too heavy for a high puncture-resistant tire. Though having a super lightweight ‘puncture resistant’ tire is excellent, it rarely performs as described. So, this weight is exactly what I would expect from a tire with the same claims as the Vittoria RideArmor.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-mounted--scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-mounted--800x600.jpeg\" alt=\"Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-mounted\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-mounted--800x600.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-mounted--297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-mounted--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-mounted--768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-mounted--1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-mounted--2048x1536.jpeg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Installation </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The installation was uneventful; the tire fit quickly and easily on my <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/mavic-rolls-out-2-all-new-affordable-allroad-wheelsets-for-rough-roads-gravel-dirt/\">Mavic All-Road </a>(hookless) alloy wheels.

I’ve used it on Specialized Crux for gravel and rough roads (maybe some single track). Then, on our <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/new-canyon-endurace-road-bike-gets-storage-inside-and-ultralight-cfr-treatment/\">Canyon Endurace </a>test rig for longer roads and faster winter group rides. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-tread-in-the-sun--scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"597\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-tread-in-the-sun--800x597.jpeg\" alt=\"Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-tread-in-the-sun\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-tread-in-the-sun--800x597.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-tread-in-the-sun--297x222.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-tread-in-the-sun--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-tread-in-the-sun--768x573.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-tread-in-the-sun--1536x1146.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-tread-in-the-sun--2048x1528.jpeg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Regarding ride feel, the RideArmor is what you would expect from a highly anti-puncture tire. It’s slightly heavy, with a dull feel on the road. It rolls efficiently and doesn’t feel sluggish like some commuter tires do on fresh tarmac. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-long-view--scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-long-view--800x600.jpeg\" alt=\"Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-long\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-long-view--800x600.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-long-view--297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-long-view--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-long-view--768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-long-view--1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-long-view--2048x1536.jpeg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I looked to tire pressure adjustments to dial in my intended ride feel further. I went lower than usual on my road setup (around 48psi), and the tire felt more supple and comfortable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regarding grip, I never found myself looking for more with the RideArmor. The slight tread offers cornering stability and confidence on the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-dirty-tires--scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"547\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-dirty-tires--800x547.jpeg\" alt=\"Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-dirty-tires\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-dirty-tires--800x547.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-dirty-tires--297x203.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-dirty-tires--120x82.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-dirty-tires--768x525.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-dirty-tires--1536x1051.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-dirty-tires--2048x1401.jpeg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Around 40-45psi (or lower) was my go-to range on rough roads and gravel. This gave me the compliance and suspension-like ride I was after but rolled well. Regarding puncture resistance, I didn’t have any during my test period (around one month) with the RideArmor. I took it over roads with glass and gravel with big rocks and rode mountain bike trails. After hitting the rim many times (hopping a curb sloppy), the tire was still airer up. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-side-top--scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-side-top--800x600.jpeg\" alt=\"Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-side-top\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-side-top--800x600.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-side-top--297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-side-top--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-side-top--768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-side-top--1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-Tire-side-top--2048x1536.jpeg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>How About the <strong>Price</strong>?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Vittoria RideArmor is a lightly higher price for a performance-style puncture-resistant tire. Others in the field would be the Specialized Armadillo, Pirelli Cinturatro Velo, and the Continental Gator Skin. The difference with the Vittoria RideArmor is the TLR version and the ability to use it on a hookless rim. <strong>Does this justify the extra coin?</strong> Maybe — but in my thoughts, it’s all about the efficiency of the tire vs the wear. Plus – there is a size for nearly every need and ride style.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll report back with a long-term review, but the Vittoria RideArmor looks to be an excellent option for those looking for a tremendous, long-wearing road tire in many sizes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vittoria.com/\">Vitto</a><a href=\"https://int.vittoria.com/\">ria.com</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/vittorias-ridearmor-tire-offers-max-durability-and-a-reasonably-quick-ride/\">Vittoria’s RideArmor Tire Offers Max Durability and a Reasonably Quick Ride</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jordan Villella","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"bdb6b8bc75349f4d8ba67614950bdb12efbdd5fd21c7cfb8202215f879786982","category":"Cycling"}
