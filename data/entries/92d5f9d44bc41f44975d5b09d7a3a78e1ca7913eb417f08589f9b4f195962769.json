Now an <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/media/1401356/dl?inline\">indictment</a> of a group of Russian nationals and the takedown of their sprawling botnet offers the clearest example in years of how a single malware operation allegedly enabled hacking operations as varied as ransomware, wartime cyberattacks in Ukraine, and spying against foreign governments.</p>\n<p>The US Department of Justice today announced criminal charges today against 16 individuals law enforcement authorities have linked to a malware operation known as DanaBot, which according to a <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/media/1401356/dl?inline\">complaint</a> infected at least 300,000 machines around the world. The DOJ’s announcement of the charges describes the group as “Russia-based,” and names two of the suspects, Aleksandr Stepanov and Artem Aleksandrovich Kalinkin, as living in Novosibirsk, Russia. Five other suspects are named in the indictment, while another nine are identified only by their pseudonyms. In addition to those charges, the Justice Department says the Defense Criminal Investigative Service (DCIS)—a criminal investigation arm of the Department of Defense—carried out seizures of DanaBot infrastructure around the world, including in the US.</p>\n<p>Aside from alleging how DanaBot was used in for-profit criminal hacking, the indictment also makes a rarer claim—it describes how a second variant of the malware it says was used in espionage against military, government, and NGO targets. “Pervasive malware like DanaBot harms hundreds of thousands of victims around the world, including sensitive military, diplomatic, and government entities, and causes many millions of dollars in losses,” US attorney Bill Essayli wrote in a statement.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/feds-charge-16-russians-allegedly-tied-to-botnets-used-in-cyberattacks-and-spying/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/feds-charge-16-russians-allegedly-tied-to-botnets-used-in-cyberattacks-and-spying/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andy Greenberg, WIRED.com","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"92d5f9d44bc41f44975d5b09d7a3a78e1ca7913eb417f08589f9b4f195962769","category":"Tech"}
