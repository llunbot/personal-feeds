The repair site says \"flashy press releases and ambitious initiatives don’t mean much without follow-through.\"</p>\n<p>iFixit's Scott Head explains: \"As we tried to build this ecosystem we consistently faced obstacles that made us doubt Samsung’s commitment to making repair more accessible. We couldn’t get parts to local repair shops at prices and quantities that made business sense. The part prices were so costly that many consumers opted to replace their devices rather than repair them. And the design of Samsung’s Galaxy devices remained frustratingly glued together, forcing us to sell batteries and screens in pre-glued bundles that increased the cost.\"</p>\n  <ul>\n          <li>\n        <div>\n          <div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/screen.png\" /></div>\n          <p>\n            Samsung's screen replacement parts usually require buying the display, battery, phone frame, and buttons, which is a big waste.                           [credit:\n                              iFixit                            ]\n                      </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n\n<p>A good example of Samsung's parts bundling is this <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/products/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-usa-screen-and-battery-genuine\">Galaxy S22 Ultra \"screen\" part</a> for $233. The screen is the most common part to break, but rather than just sell a screen, Samsung makes you buy the screen, a brand-new phone frame, a battery, and new side buttons and switches. As we said when this was <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/08/samsung-and-ifixit-launch-repair-program-for-flagship-phones-and-tablets/\">all first announced</a>, that's like half of the total parts in an entire phone. This isn't a perfect metric, but the Samsung/iFixit parts store only offers <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/Parts/Samsung_Galaxy_S22_Ultra\">three parts</a> for the S22 Ultra, while the <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/Parts/Google_Pixel_8_Pro\">Pixel 8 Pro store</a> has 10 parts, and the <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/Parts/iPhone_14_Pro_Max\">iPhone 14 Pro Max</a> store has 23 parts.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027154#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2027154&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"03fe77c5222827c839f5af817e73a55a82d2515f63cc66923b59b47c5e6e43a5","category":"Tech"}
