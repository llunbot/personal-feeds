(credit: Paramount+)</p>  </figure><div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>By the end of the first season of <a href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/shows/star-trek-lower-decks/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Star Trek: Lower Decks</em></a>, the show was my favorite of the three Trek series that had premiered on Paramount+ (née CBS All Access) since <em>Discovery</em> brought the franchise back to TV in 2017.</p>\n<p>Some of that is definitely rooted in nostalgia. <em>Lower Decks</em> intentionally recreates the aesthetic of '90s-era Trek shows like <em>The Next Generation </em>and <em>Voyager</em>, from the ship design to the scoring to the blue typeface used for the credits. But it's mostly because the show isn't afraid to be low-stakes and silly and tell self-contained stories. This was a hallmark of '90s Trek—<em>Deep Space 9</em> followed the <a href=\"https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Far_Beyond_the_Stars_(episode)\">gorgeous, nuanced <em>Far Beyond the Stars</em></a> episode with a <em>Honey I Shrunk the Kids</em> spoof where <a href=\"https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/One_Little_Ship_(episode)\">someone accidentally makes a shuttlecraft tiny</a>—but this sense of playfulness is often absent from the nonstop world-saving bombast of <em>Discovery</em> or the convoluted storytelling of <em>Picard</em>.</p>\n<p>This isn’t to say that <em>Lower Decks</em> is always top-tier Trek. Its irreverent, self-referential style can get tiring in large doses, and there's a fine line between \"clever\" and \"lazy\" in any show that leans <em>this</em> heavily on references to older shows for everything from throwaway sight gags to major plot points. But by the end of its first season, <em>Lower Decks</em> had proven it could be a good Trek show in addition to being a Trek reference factory, combining well-established characters, comedy, and genuinely engaging action sequences in the way that <em>Futurama </em>could when it was firing on all cylinders, and season two is more of the same.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1786380#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1786380&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"08b17646e4e5e7832e6d01c67608ac00d12e6caedf85e27f874388629191fd6e","category":"Tech"}
