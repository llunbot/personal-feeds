Last autumn, Wout van Aert took the overall title after a week of domination alongside Jumbo-Visma teammate Olav Kooij. With two months to go until a new winner is crowned, British Cycling has unveiled the route for the 2024 edition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2024 event â€“ which stands as â€˜Britainâ€™s biggest free-to-attend sporting spectacleâ€™ â€“ will begin in Kelso in the Scottish Borders on Tuesday 3rd September and will finish in Felixstowe, Suffolk on Sunday 8th September. The race will travel southwards from the southeast of Scotland. The six-day race will pass through North Yorkshire, Sheffield, Northamptonshire and East Anglia throughout the week of racing, with one stage still to be confirmed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will be the first edition of the menâ€™s race since its organisation was taken over by British Cycling at the end of 2023. This means this will be the first menâ€™s Tour of Britain led by new race director Rod Ellingworth, former team director at Ineos and the British Olympic squad.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Tour of Britain 2024: Key information</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/ToB-2023-Cyclist-Gallery-047-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"cyclists ride up hill in shadow of trees\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/ToB-2023-Cyclist-Gallery-047-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/ToB-2023-Cyclist-Gallery-047-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/ToB-2023-Cyclist-Gallery-047-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/ToB-2023-Cyclist-Gallery-047-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/ToB-2023-Cyclist-Gallery-047-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/ToB-2023-Cyclist-Gallery-047-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/ToB-2023-Cyclist-Gallery-047-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/ToB-2023-Cyclist-Gallery-047-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/ToB-2023-Cyclist-Gallery-047-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/ToB-2023-Cyclist-Gallery-047-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>James York</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dates:</strong> Tuesday 3rd to Sunday 8th September 2024<br /><strong>Start:</strong> Kelso, Scotland<br /><strong>Finish:</strong>Â Felixstowe, England<br /><strong>UK television coverage:</strong> ITV4, Eurosport, Discovery+<br /><strong>Television coverage elsewhere:</strong> Eurosport (Europe, Asia and Oceania), Discovery+ (Europe, Asia, Oceania and North America), Lâ€™Ã‰quipe (France), RTVC (Colombia), Starzplay (North Africa), SuperSport (Sub-Saharan Africa)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tour of Britain 2024 route</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><p><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f5fa.png\" alt=\"ðŸ—º\" /> Here they are, the stage locations of the 2024 Lloyds Bank Tour of Britain Men! <br /><br />Starting in Scotland and ending on the South East coast of England, it's going to be a six days of incredible racing.

This means this Tour of Britain will be the shortest since 2007 (with the exception of the 2022 race, which was abandoned early due to the death of Queen Elizabeth II). At the moment, five of the six stages have had host town information released. We await further information about Stage 4â€™s location.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on this current knowledge, the Tour will visit England and Scotland, omitting Wales, which held half of the racing at the recent<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-of-britain-women-2024-photos\" target=\"_blank\"> Tour of Britain Women</a> in June. The race also takes place in the north of Great Britain for the most part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be no time-trial involved<em>,</em> neither will the race close out with a city-centre stage in Manchester, London or Glasgow. The race will, however, include a cobbled finish, steep kickers and wind-exposed roads. Yes please.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n

September, Kelso â€“ Kelso</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After a yearâ€™s hiatus from the menâ€™s race, Scotland returns to the Tour of Britain <em>parcours</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The race will begin in Kelso, the hometown of<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/british-riders-tour-de-france\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/british-riders-tour-de-france\" target=\"_blank\">DSM-Firmenich-PostNL rider Oscar Onley</a>. The route and stage type are unknown at this point, but the cobbled market square will host the start and the finish. The last phase of the race will take place on a circuit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, Jayco-AlUla have had success under their previous monikers in Kelso. Caleb Ewan won in the town in 2017 and Matteo Trentin took a win here in 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In niche local trivia, Kelso is twinned with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/roubaix-cobbles-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">Orchies</a>, a town situated on a cobbled sector from the Hell of the North, Paris-Roubaix.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Stage 2: Wednesday 4th September, Darlington â€“ Redcar</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Stage 2 heads into England with a start in Darlington. The stage will traverse the Tees Valley with a visit to Saltburn Bank along the way, the hill that has decided the previous two British National Championships. The North Moors provides some bumps to the profile before rejoining the North Sea coast to the finish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The stage will end in the steelmaking town of Redcar. The finishing approach has been confirmed by race organisers to take place along the seafront of the North Yorkshire town.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/ToB-2023-Cyclist-Gallery-038-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"cyclists ride past rollercoaster\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/ToB-2023-Cyclist-Gallery-038-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/ToB-2023-Cyclist-Gallery-038-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/ToB-2023-Cyclist-Gallery-038-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/ToB-2023-Cyclist-Gallery-038-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/ToB-2023-Cyclist-Gallery-038-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/ToB-2023-Cyclist-Gallery-038-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/ToB-2023-Cyclist-Gallery-038-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/ToB-2023-Cyclist-Gallery-038-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/ToB-2023-Cyclist-Gallery-038-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/ToB-2023-Cyclist-Gallery-038-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>James York</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Stage 3: Thursday 5th September, Sheffield â€“ Barnsley</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The third stage of racing kicks off in the South Yorkshire city of Sheffield. The hometown of the Arctic Monkeys, Adam Blythe and Michael Palin, Sheffield has hosted the Tour of Britain and the Tour de France in the past two decades. This will be Sheffieldâ€™s big comeback to cycling, as the city hasnâ€™t hosted a stage of Britainâ€™s top stage race since 2006.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The organisers have teased that Stage 3 will be a â€˜tough stageâ€™ most likely through the Peak District and Yorkshire Moors. The finish is certain to be in Barnsley, however. The South Yorkshire town â€“ birthplace of England international footballer John Stones â€“ has never hosted a stage of the Tour of Britain. It has, on the other hand, hosted stages of the now-defunct Tour de Yorkshire.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Stage 4: Friday 6th September, TBC â€“ TBC</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Donâ€™t worry, TBC is not a secret newly built city in the Midlands. The details of Stage 4 are yet to be announced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We await where it could possibly be. For the sake of speculation, it is likely to be somewhere between Yorkshire and Northamptonshire. Perhaps this could be Lincolnshire or Nottinghamshire.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/ToB-2023-Cyclist-Gallery-030-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"cyclists ride by beach with crowds\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/ToB-2023-Cyclist-Gallery-030-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/ToB-2023-Cyclist-Gallery-030-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/ToB-2023-Cyclist-Gallery-030-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/ToB-2023-Cyclist-Gallery-030-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/ToB-2023-Cyclist-Gallery-030-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/ToB-2023-Cyclist-Gallery-030-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/ToB-2023-Cyclist-Gallery-030-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/ToB-2023-Cyclist-Gallery-030-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/ToB-2023-Cyclist-Gallery-030-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/ToB-2023-Cyclist-Gallery-030-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>James York</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Stage 5: Saturday 7th September, Northampton â€“ Northampton</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Stage 5, the penultimate stage, will both start and finish in Northampton. The town will make its menâ€™s Tour of Britain debut this year. It has previously featured in the Womenâ€™s Tour. Emma Johansson won a stage here in the back in 2014, the raceâ€™s inaugural edition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The organisers tell us that the stage will take place around West Northamptonshire. This part of the county is incredibly flat, so expect a sprint stage on the penultimate day of racing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Stage 6: Sunday 8th September, Lowestoft â€“ Felixstowe</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the race will travel a couple of hours down the road to Suffolk for the closing stage of the 2024 Tour of Britain. The day begins in Lowestoft, the most easterly town in the UK, and ends in Felixstowe. In fact, the arrival will be the same as Stage 5 from last yearâ€™s Tour of Britain won by Wout van Aert. Given the flat terrain of Suffolk, expect another bunch gallop to the line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beware of the East Anglian wind, there is a real chance that last-minute echelons could affect the sixth and final stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>â€˜The very best of Britainâ€™s character and terrainâ€™</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/ToB-2023-Cyclist-Gallery-035-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/ToB-2023-Cyclist-Gallery-035-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/ToB-2023-Cyclist-Gallery-035-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/ToB-2023-Cyclist-Gallery-035-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/ToB-2023-Cyclist-Gallery-035-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/ToB-2023-Cyclist-Gallery-035-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/ToB-2023-Cyclist-Gallery-035-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/ToB-2023-Cyclist-Gallery-035-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/ToB-2023-Cyclist-Gallery-035-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/ToB-2023-Cyclist-Gallery-035-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/09/ToB-2023-Cyclist-Gallery-035-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>James York</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The route has been met online with positive reaction. Some social media commenters appear upset by the omission of the southeast of England from the route once again, however the return to Scotland has been well received.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response to the route reveal earlier today, Jonathan Day, British Cyclingâ€™s events managing director, said, â€˜Weâ€™re delighted to be bringing top-level racing and the joy of cycling to communities across the country in September, with six stages to showcase the very best of Britainâ€™s character and terrain.â€™</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>More details are to come on the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tour-of-britain\">Tour of Britain</a>.
