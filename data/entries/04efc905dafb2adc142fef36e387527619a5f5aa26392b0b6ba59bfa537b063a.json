Single- or double-sided drives with storage sizes ranging from 250GB to 4TB should work with the console.</p>\n<p>Sony recommends that any PS5 expansion drive have a sequential read speed of at least 5500MB/s but warns that even then, \"not all games are necessarily playable with the exact same performance provided by the PS5 consoleâ€™s internal Ultra-High Speed SSD.\" The company also recommends a heatsink (either built in or attached by the user) to aid with heat dissipation but warns that the heatsink should only rise 8 mm \"above the board\" to help ensure the entire housing can fit in the PS5's 11.25 mm-high compartment.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1783881#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1783881&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"04efc905dafb2adc142fef36e387527619a5f5aa26392b0b6ba59bfa537b063a","category":"Tech"}
