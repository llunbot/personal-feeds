And it looks chic, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the backpack’s notebook compartment, Peak Design came up with a very clever height adjustment. If you have a 13-inch MacBook Air, you don’t have to reach very deep to pull it out. The compartment is well padded, so even if you drop the backpack your precious MacBook is protected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The large main compartment can be divided using three Velcro separators. Without a separator, the compartment is big enough to hold, say, a stack of three A4 binders and books, along with a separator to make room for a camera at the bottom, and books or an iPad above it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main compartment can be accessed from three directions: via the large side covers on the left and right, or from above. The cover flap has Peak Design’s MagLatch, which can be locked in four stages with a magnetically snapped hook–it’s an elegant way to accommodate items that are bulging at the top of the backpack.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/PeakDesign_EveryDayBackpack_07.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Peak Design Everyday Backpack\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/PeakDesign_EveryDayBackpack_07.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1500w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/PeakDesign_EveryDayBackpack_07.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/PeakDesign_EveryDayBackpack_07.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/PeakDesign_EveryDayBackpack_07.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/PeakDesign_EveryDayBackpack_07.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/PeakDesign_EveryDayBackpack_07.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" /><figcaption><p>All this stuff fits into the 20-liter version of the Everyday Backpack.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Thomas Bergbold </p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The two outer side pockets are perfect for a drinking bottle, umbrella, or tripod. These pockets don’t have zippers, but there are straps that extend from inside the pockets and latch onto the backpack to keep items secure. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside, there’s a softly lined compartment for glasses. This compartment is accessible via the same zipper as the notebook compartment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The zippers–Peak Design calls them UltraZips–are weatherproof and the openings are wide for easy access. Each of the two side covers has a magnetic closure compartment. These are good places for small things such as USB sticks, adapters, cables, or keys.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The backpack has a large, comfortable, and minimalist-looking leather strap at the top. The backpack straps are large and well-padded, making them comfortable to wear. The backpack straps have a chest strap, and an optional Everyday Hip Belt strap is available for <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.peakdesign.com/products/everyday-hip-belt&amp;xcust=1-1-2199657-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">$29.95</a>/<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://uk.peakdesign.com/products/everyday-hip-belt&amp;xcust=1-1-2199657-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">£28.99</a>. There are also straps for fastening a sleeping bag or bicycle helmet to the backpack.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/PeakDesign_EveryDayBackpack_06.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Peak Design Everyday Backpack\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/PeakDesign_EveryDayBackpack_06.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1500w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/PeakDesign_EveryDayBackpack_06.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/PeakDesign_EveryDayBackpack_06.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/PeakDesign_EveryDayBackpack_06.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/PeakDesign_EveryDayBackpack_06.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/PeakDesign_EveryDayBackpack_06.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" /><figcaption><p>The Everyday Backpack has sturdy straps that are smartly placed.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Thomas Bergbold </p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Made of 100 percent recycled 400D nylon, the Everyday Backpack has a pleasing canvas structure and is coated with a durable water repellant to ensure good weather protection. The backpack is easy to clean.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Everyday Backpack is available in three colors (Black, Charcoal, and Midnight). The 20-liter size (which is also available in an Ash color) is $279.95/£249.99, and the 30-liter size is $299.95/£269.99.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Should you buy the Peak Design Everyday Backpack?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Peak Design has put a lot of thought into the Everyday Backpack, and it shows–it’s a sophisticated and universal backpack. It’s a great fit for a variety of users, like photographers and videographers who carry a lot of gear, workers and students going to where they need to go, or athletes who need to carry equipment. Yes, it’s expensive, but the Everyday Backpack is a high-quality product with workmanship and material designed to last. The Everyday Backpack lives up to its name and is one of the best backpacks we’ve reviewed.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/PeakDesign_EveryDayBackpack_05.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Peak Design Everyday Backpack\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/PeakDesign_EveryDayBackpack_05.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1500w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/PeakDesign_EveryDayBackpack_05.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/PeakDesign_EveryDayBackpack_05.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/PeakDesign_EveryDayBackpack_05.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/PeakDesign_EveryDayBackpack_05.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/PeakDesign_EveryDayBackpack_05.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" /><figcaption><p>The Everyday Backpack is easy to clean and looks great.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Thomas Bergbold </p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article originally appeared on <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macwelt.de/article/2157635/rucksack-peak-design-everyday-backpack-test.html&amp;xcust=1-1-2199657-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Macwelt</a> and was translated by <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/author/rloyola\">Roman Loyola</a>.</em></p>\n\nAccessories</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"a0243754e1f7713c4192ee481a9c55d480e2faed58c293b91a93267c6d53e647","category":"Apple"}
