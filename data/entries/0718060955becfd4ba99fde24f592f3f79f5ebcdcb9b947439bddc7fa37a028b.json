A systematic approach to aerodynamics could be the biggest step-change in bicycle design since the invention of the safety bicycle. Letting you go faster for the same effort by cutting down on drag, today the aero story hardly needs telling – the bikes and the plethora of data-driven claims speak for themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Direct comparisons between rival bikes aren’t easy, as everything from the testing standards to testing apparatus differs from manufacturer to manufacturer – a fact cynics will say is bent to individual manufacturers’ will, allowing each to claim ‘our bike is the fastest’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But no matter, it’s still undoubtable that aero bikes, as a whole, are quicker than their round tube counterparts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The best aero bikes of

bikes designed to give you an extra turn of speed through aerodynamic features that streamline the bike’s frame. That starts with aero tube profiles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first aero bikes, such as the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/game-changer-cervelo-soloist\" target=\"_blank\">Cervélo Soloist</a>, had teardrop-shaped tubing, but now kamm-tail truncated aerofoil shapes – where the tail of the aerofoil is sliced off – are the norm. They’re lighter and more rigid, while still giving the aero benefits of a much longer tube with an aero tail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The modern trend is to mix lightweight and aero. There are a couple of bikes here which fit into that mould, including the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-tarmac-sl8-review\" target=\"_blank\">Specialized Tarmac SL7</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/bianchi-specialissima-disc-review\" target=\"_blank\">Factor Ostro VAM</a>, but you’ll find even more like the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/bianchi-specialissima-disc-review\">Bianchi Specialissima</a> in our main guide to the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-road-bike\" target=\"_blank\">best road bikes</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Related: <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/uphill-battle-aero-vs-lightweight-field-test\" target=\"_blank\">Aero vs lightweight bike: Which is better for climbing?</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>How we test and why you should take our word for it</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/03134423/giant-propel-13-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Sam Challis riding an aero road bike\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/03134423/giant-propel-13-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/03134423/giant-propel-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/03134423/giant-propel-13-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/03134423/giant-propel-13-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/03134423/giant-propel-13-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/03134423/giant-propel-13-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/03134423/giant-propel-13-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/03134423/giant-propel-13-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/09/03134423/giant-propel-13.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Lizzie Crabb / Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At Cyclist, we’re constantly out testing and evaluating a huge range of bikes from the budget to the most expensive, putting in the miles on roads we know well to pick apart what works and what doesn’t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our team of expert reviewers led by <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/author/sam-challis\" target=\"_blank\">tech editor Sam Challis</a> has a wealth of experience riding bikes of all types.

The Foil RC Pro runs on a 25mm front tyre and a 28mm rear one, but there’s clearance for 30mm rubber if you want more road-smoothing.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/scott-foil-rc-review%ef%bf%bc\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Foil RC review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Specialized Tarmac SL8</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/specialized-tarmac-sl8-review-1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"White Specialized Tarmac SL8 S-Works Di2 bicycle\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/specialized-tarmac-sl8-review-1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/specialized-tarmac-sl8-review-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/specialized-tarmac-sl8-review-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/specialized-tarmac-sl8-review-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/specialized-tarmac-sl8-review-1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/specialized-tarmac-sl8-review-1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/specialized-tarmac-sl8-review-1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/specialized-tarmac-sl8-review-1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/specialized-tarmac-sl8-review-1-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/specialized-tarmac-sl8-review-1.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Lizzie Crabb</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>£5,699 | <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6821&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;clickref=Best+aero+road+bike+2023+-+Specialized+Tarmac+SL7+Expert&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tredz.co.uk%2F.Specialized-Tarmac-SL7-Expert-2023-Road-Bike_262774.htm\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pros: More comfortable and more aero than the SL7 and lighter too</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cons: Still an expensive proposition despite a lower price than the SL7</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>New design tweaks makes for an even more aero, more comfortable ride </strong> </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>An update in 2023 has seen the Tarmac SL7 replaced by the SL8. The changes are subtle but significant, with the SL8 boasting a lighter 6.6kg weight for the top spec size 56 bike that we tested. This puts a complete race-ready bike exactly on the UCI’s 6.8kg weight limit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tarmac SL8 is also more aero than its predecessor, largely thanks to the one-piece cockpit on higher spec models, but with the new bulbous nose helping too. At the same time, the rear of the bike is thinner, lighter and more comfortable, taking lessons from the Aethos lightweight bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It all adds up to an impressive package that’s fun to ride and easy to live with, due to the paucity of proprietary component standards. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-tarmac-sl8-review\" target=\"_blank\">Specialized Tarmac SL8 review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Trek Madone SLR</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/11/trek-madone-slr-2-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"trek-madone-slr-2\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>£13,625 | <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tool_type=cl&amp;merchant_id=0d15472d-796a-41f7-afb4-32437118891b&amp;website_id=cd05eb41-d5ae-4325-92b1-b5b584fc1186&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trekbikes.com%2Fgb%2Fen_GB%2Fbikes%2Froad-bikes%2Fperformance-road-bikes%2Fmadone%2Fmadone-slr%2Fmadone-slr-9-gen-7%2Fp%2F37419%2F%3FcolorCode%3Dgrey\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pros: Feels very fast and light, Innovative design </strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cons: A very expensive proposition, No IsoSpeed </strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Novel seatpost and one-piece bar-stem offer claimed 20-watt aero gains over previous model</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The seventh generation Trek Madone SLR has had a radical update that has dispensed with IsoSpeed, as found on the previous generation <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/gallery-mads-pedersens-world-champion-trek-madone\" target=\"_blank\">Madone SLR 9</a>, in favour of IsoFlow, which has a huge hole in the seat tube, with the saddle cantilevered over the rear of the bike. The new design and new OCLV 800 carbon fibre shave around 300g off the bike’s weight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a design that Trek says saves around 10 watts on the previous model. There’s a similar saving from the new cockpit with its flared bars, although we found the narrow tops took some getting used to, particularly when climbing out of the saddle. Top specs of the bike are very expensive too.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/trek-madone-review\" target=\"_blank\">Gen 7 Trek Madone SLR review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy it now from <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tool_type=cl&amp;merchant_id=0d15472d-796a-41f7-afb4-32437118891b&amp;website_id=cd05eb41-d5ae-4325-92b1-b5b584fc1186&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trekbikes.com%2Fgb%2Fen_GB%2Fbikes%2Froad-bikes%2Fperformance-road-bikes%2Fmadone%2Fmadone-slr%2Fmadone-slr-9-gen-7%2Fp%2F37https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tool_type=cl&amp;merchant_id=0d15472d-796a-41f7-afb4-32437118891b&amp;website_id=cd05eb41-d5ae-4325-92b1-b5b584fc1186&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trekbikes.com%2Fgb%2Fen_GB%2Fbikes%2Froad-bikes%2Fperformance-road-bikes%2Fmadone%2Fmadone-slr%2Fmadone-slr-9-gen-7%2Fp%2F37419%2F%3FcolorCode%3Dgrey419%2F%3FcolorCode%3Dgrey\" target=\"_blank\">Trek (£13,615)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Vitus ZX-1 EVO</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/11/02141452/vitus_zx-1_evo_review_05-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"vitus_zx-1_evo_review_05\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>£4,200 | <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1857&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;clickref=Best+aero+road+bike+2023+-+Vitus+ZX+1+EVO&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wiggle.com%2Fp%2Fvitus-zx-1-evo-frameset\" target=\"_blank\">View offer (frameset only £899)</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pros: Modest price for a high spec aero bike</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cons: Stiff front end transmits some vibration to the bars</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>A fast, planted aero bike that’s well priced</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Vitus has upped the aero credentials of its ZX-1, so that they’re the match of much more expensive bikes, with an integrated cockpit, waisted head tube and deep section wheels.
