alt=\"Schwalbe Pro One Aerothan prototype tyre\" title=\"Schwalbe Pro One Aerothan prototype tyre_01\" />                                            <p>Schwalbe has unveiled the Pro One Aerothan, a prototype tubeless road tyre with a claimed weight of just 165g in a 700x28c size.</p>\n<p>The Pro One Aerothan tyre is said to incorporate tech from Schwalbe’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/schwalbe-aerothan/\">thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) Areothan inner tubes</a>, making it possible to cut its weight significantly.</p>\n<p>Compared to a typical high-end <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-tubeless-road-tyres/\">tubeless road tyre</a>, such as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/tyres/road-bike-tyres/schwalbe-pro-one-tubeless-review/\">Schwalbe’s Pro One TLE</a> – which weighs 264g in the same size – that represents a saving of nearly 100g per tyre.</p>\n<p>It’s also claimed this tyre will exhibit “very low rolling resistance”, due to the nature of its construction.</p>\n<p>While Schwalbe is coy on when this tyre will be released, one of BikeRadar’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/events/eurobike-show/\">Eurobike</a> correspondents, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/author/jackluke/\">Jack Luke</a>, was able to tease out some details from Schwalbe’s UK marketing manager, Tim Ward.</p>\n<h2>TPU tyres</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Schwalbe Pro One Aerothan prototype tyre\"

construction.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>According to Ward, the Pro One Aerothan tubeless tyre uses technology and knowledge Schwalbe gained from developing its range of ultra-light TPU inner tubes.</p>\n<p>These inner tubes weigh as little as 41g for a 700c tube, compared to 105g for a standard Schwalbe butyl inner tube.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Schwalbe Aerothan inner tubes\" title=\"Schwalbe Aerothan inner tubes\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Schwalbe’s Aerothan TPU inner tubes are said to have informed its development of this new ultra-light tyre.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Schwalbe</i></span></div>\n<p>While Ward declined to go into too much detail, he confirmed Schwalbe has “combined some of the technologies to create a tyre that’s based around the Aerothan TPU material itself”.</p>\n<p>With the rubber compound used in the tread of the new tyre said to be relatively standard, Ward says the secret behind the Pro One Aerothan lies elsewhere – presumably in the casing.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Schwalbe Pro One Aerothan prototype tyre\" title=\"Schwalbe Pro One Aerothan prototype tyre (3 of 3)\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Pro One Aerothan’s tread is said to be relatively standard, so it sounds as though the magic is happening in the casing.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Ward also claims Schwalbe is the only brand in cycling (and perhaps even outside of cycling) that has produced a tyre using this construction method.</p>\n<p>When asked if Schwalbe has patented this technology, Ward simply replied, “No comment”.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Schwalbe Pro One Aerothan prototype tyre\" title=\"Schwalbe Pro One Aerothan prototype tyre (2 of 3)\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The tyre we saw at Eurobike appears to be set up

seen a glut of new <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/time-trial-bikes/\">time-trial</a> specific tyres in recent years, such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/continental-gp5000-as-tr/\">Continental GP5000 TT TR</a>, the Vittoria Corsa Speed G2.0 and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/schwalbe-pro-one-tubeless-tyre-released/\">Schwalbe’s own Pro One TT</a>.</p>\n<p>If Schwalbe’s claims are true, though, the Pro One Aerothan would beat all of them on the scales by some margin.</p>\n<p>A 700x28c Continental GP5000 TT TR weighs 252g, for example, while Schwalbe’s Pro One TT is claimed to weigh 240g in the same size.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Schwalbe Pro One TT tyre\" title=\"Schwalbe Pro One TT tyre\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Schwalbe’s Pro One TT tyre weighs 225g in a size 700x25c – which is already very light.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The only tubeless road tyre we can think of that comes close to matching the Aerothan on paper (in terms of weight) is the Veloflex Record TLR, which has a claimed weight of 175g for a 700x25c tyre.</p>\n<p>Of course, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/2022-hill-climb-bikes/\">hill climb racing</a> aside, quibbling over a few grams isn’t likely to win or lose you many races.</p>\n<p>However, it’s also fair to say the rolling resistance tyres exhibit tends to follow weight. Lighter tyres, for example, often produce less rolling resistance than heavier ones.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Continental GP5000 S TR tyres on scales\" title=\"20211201_SB_5DSR_MG_4812\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A typical set of high-end tubeless road tyres (such as these 700x28c Continental GP5000 S TR tyres), weighs around 550 to 600g.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The previously mentioned Veloflex Record TLR, for example, is considered to be among the fastest <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bike-tyres/\">road bike tyres</a> available by independent testers such as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/author/drxavierdisley/\">AeroCoach</a> – likely due in part to its ultra-light construction.</p>\n<p>This is because there is, almost by definition, typically less material used in the construction of a lighter tyre. As a result, less energy is lost to deformation of the tyre as it rolls along the road (all else being equal).</p>\n<p>Of course, less material often means reduced puncture resistance, but this could be an exciting development for races where every second counts.</p>","author":"Simon von Bromley","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"a287897a67839d6a72a94e99f33096445353b2cb5b2709837846dd8fb5e71d00","category":"Cycling"}
