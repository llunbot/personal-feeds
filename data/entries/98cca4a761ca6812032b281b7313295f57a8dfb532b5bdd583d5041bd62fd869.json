That is what I was trying to solve. I did not intend to discover that, for a while there, water heaters like mine may have been open to anybody. That, with some API tinkering and an email address, a bad actor could possibly set its temperature or make it run constantly. That’s just how it happened.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a step back. My wife and I moved into a new home last year. It had a Rinnai <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/tankless-or-demand-type-water-heaters\">tankless water heater</a> tucked into a utility closet in the garage. The builder and home inspector didn't say much about it, just to run a yearly cleaning cycle on it.</p>\n<p>Because it doesn’t keep a big tank of water heated and ready to be delivered to any house tap, tankless water heaters save energy—up to 34 percent, <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/energysaver/tankless-or-demand-type-water-heaters\">according to the Department of Energy</a>. But they're also, by default, slower. Opening a tap triggers the exchanger, heats up the water (with natural gas, in my case), and the device has to push it through the line to where it's needed.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020163#p3\">Read 38 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020163&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"98cca4a761ca6812032b281b7313295f57a8dfb532b5bdd583d5041bd62fd869","category":"Tech"}
