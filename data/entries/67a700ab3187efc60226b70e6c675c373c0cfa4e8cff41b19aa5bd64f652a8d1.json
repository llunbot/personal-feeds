Payment through Apple's platform is set to stop, however, because Netflix does not want to continue to pay Apple a 15 percent cut of those subscription fees.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs noted by <em><a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2024/02/26/netflix-billing-app-store-support-ending/\">9to5Mac</a></em>, the U.S. Netflix support site now says that customers in \"some\" countries will need to add a new payment method. It isn't clear which countries the new Netflix policy is applicable to, but given that it was added to the U.S. site, it likely applies to customers in the United States.\r<br />\n<blockquote>Some Apple-billed members in select countries may be prompted to add a new payment method to continue their subscription.</blockquote>\r<br />\nThere is no word on how many Netflix subscribers are still paying through in-app purchase since it's been nearly six years since Netflix removed the option. Since 2018, Netflix has required customers who have Apple devices to sign up for a new Netflix subscription on the Netflix website. There is no option to subscribe through the Netflix app on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, and these devices open to a sign-in screen.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen Netflix first removed the option to pay through the ‌App Store‌, it said customers who paid for subscriptions with in-app purchases could continue to use that billing method until their accounts were canceled, but Netflix seems to have run out of patience.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<b>Update:</b> Netflix has clarified that the changes affect basic plan members in some countries including the US and Canada, and it does not impact all Netflix users. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/netflix/\">Netflix</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/26/netflix-stops-allowing-app-store-payment/\">Netflix No Longer Allowing Subscribers to Pay Through Apple's App Store</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/netflix-no-longer-allowing-subscribers-to-pay-through-apples-app-store.2420481/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"67a700ab3187efc60226b70e6c675c373c0cfa4e8cff41b19aa5bd64f652a8d1","category":"Apple"}
