Rumors have been coming thick and fast since the launch of the iPhone 16 last month and a new case leak this weekend appears to have revealed the fundamentals of the new phone’s design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Saturday the reputable leaker Sonny Dickson <a href=\"https://x.com/SonnyDickson/status/1845013129106743566\" target=\"_blank\">posted</a> to Twitter/X a photo of what he labels as a case for the (as yet unannounced) iPhone SE 4. It looks like the standard silicone case design Apple makes for its phones, in plain black.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p><a href=\"https://t.co/cAySCuE1cz\">pic.twitter.com/cAySCuE1cz</a></p>— Sonny Dickson (@SonnyDickson) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SonnyDickson/status/1845013129106743566?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 12, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If the case is genuine–and based on the iPhone SE 4’s final design, rather than a prototype that could change before launch–it gives away some important details. There’s a cutout, for example, for the mute switch, which means the handset <strong>won’t have an Action button</strong>. (The official silicone case for the iPhone 16 Plus doesn’t have a cutout there: you just press the Action button through a raised section of silicone.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s less clear-cut, but the photos also suggest that the next SE <strong>won’t gain the Camera Control</strong> that was introduced last month with the 16-series iPhones. The Camera Control doesn’t get a full cutout on the 16 Plus case, admittedly, but it does have a separate thinner section above it that you press through; this would probably be noticeable in the photos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, as <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2024/10/12/iphone-se-4-case-leak/\" target=\"_blank\">9to5Mac</a> points out, the cutout for the rear-facing camera points to <strong>a single lens</strong>, as was the case in 2022, rather than twin lenses to match the iPhone 14 which the new SE is expected to be based on. That might seem counterintuitive–the cutout <em>is</em> bigger than a single lens, and could plausibly accommodate a pair of lenses in a horizontal alignment–but that’s how <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MN6G3ZM/A/iphone-se-silicone-case-chalk-pink\" target=\"_blank\">cases for the 2022 iPhone SE</a> are made at the moment, with an opening for the flash next to the single lens. Whereas the iPhone 14 has its twin lenses arranged diagonally in a larger square camera module, and this case design would not accommodate that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lots of negatives, then: no Camera Control, no Action button, and no second rear-facing camera lens. But there’s still time for plans to change, and Apple may yet surprise us in the spring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To keep up with the latest news and rumors, check out our regularly updated <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1354114/iphone-se-4-design-specs-features-release-date.html\">iPhone SE 4</a> superguide.
