That project ultimately folded because of the complexity of creating a car, but Foxconn is once again building up a vehicle supply chain with plans to get into EV manufacturing.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nGou's successor Young Liu is aiming to have Foxconn designs, components, and mechanical parts or software inside five percent of electric vehicles by 2025, and Foxconn <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/12/foxconn-plant-in-the-united-states/\">is building factories</a> in the U.S. and Thailand for car assembly.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple too is making inroads into car manufacturing with its long running \"Project Titan,\" and though the project has evolved and shifted over the years, rumors suggest that Apple is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/\">working on creating a full electric vehicle</a> that could come out by 2028.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFoxconn subsidiaries already supply parts to companies like Tesla and BMW, and Foxconn has signed vehicle supply deals with Fiat and Chrysler owner Stellantis and is working with Geely to develop software platforms and whole vehicles. It is also planning to manufacture vehicles for Fisker.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs Foxconn is already a major Apple supplier, Foxconn could play a key role in Apple's future vehicle plans. According to <em>Nikkei</em>, Foxconn is assumed to be a candidate to produce Apple Cars.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nRumors have suggested that Apple is pursuing manufacturing partners and talking with multiple companies at the current time, though there's no concrete word yet on the companies that Apple will end up working with for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/\">Apple Car</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foxconn/\">Foxconn</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/19/foxconn-electric-vehicle-ambitions/\">Apple Supplier Foxconn Eager to Break Into Electric Vehicle Manufacturing</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-supplier-foxconn-eager-to-break-into-electric-vehicle-manufacturing.2308082/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=KYwfoXbLFmw:XzQ65mgDH50:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=KYwfoXbLFmw:XzQ65mgDH50:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/KYwfoXbLFmw\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6596ec0f8d30f2d894935f56b43dfaff2c9b4bea2fd97cd9a1d02cd910972dd0","category":"Apple"}
