In the ad that was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/18/apple-shares-underdogs-video-vision-pro/\">released on July 18</a>, the underdogs design team traveled to Bangkok and Rayong, Thailand for a project and were depicted traveling in a tuk-tuk and staying in a rundown hotel.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/underdogs-video.jpg\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" />\r<br />\nThai residents found the depiction of Thailand offensive, and took to social media to criticize Apple for portraying the country with outdated stereotypes. The video made Thailand look \"low-tech and underdeveloped\" due to the faded, sepia tone and focus on dilapidated architecture, according to the Bangkok Post.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>Apple’s latest short film commercial 'The Underdogs: OOO (Out Of Office)' that aims to represent its gadgets filmed in Thailand has sparked criticism among Thai people as the commercial portrays Thailand in a low-tech and underdeveloped mood and tone, using a warm colour in… <a href=\"https://t.co/yYgAXCDFUd\">pic.twitter.com/yYgAXCDFUd</a></p>— Bangkok Post (@BangkokPostNews) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BangkokPostNews/status/1816768894218260808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 26, 2024</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\nThai House of Representatives Committee on Tourism spokesperson Sattra Sripan called for a boycott on Apple over the video. \"Thai people are deeply unhappy with the advertisement,\" he said. \"I encourage Thai people to stop using Apple products and change to other brands.\" He said that the tourism committee planned to invite Apple representatives and state agencies to discuss the ad.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple in a statement to <em><a href=\"https://www.bangkokpost.com/life/tech/2840337/apple-apologises-and-removes-controversial-ad\">Bangkok Post</a></em> this morning said that it was sorry that Thailand was inaccurately portrayed, and confirmed that the ad had been taken down.\r<br />\n<blockquote>Our intent was to celebrate the country's optimism and culture, and we apologize for not fully capturing the vibrancy of Thailand today.</blockquote>\r<br />\nApple worked with Thailand-based film production studio Indochina Productions on the video, and it was shot entirely in Thailand. Since 2019, Apple has released several videos that star the underdogs as part of an \"Apple at Work\" ad campaign.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis is the second ad that Apple has pulled this year. When the M4 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> models came out in May, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/10/apple-crush-ad-apology/\">showed a video</a> of a hydraulic press crushing an array of creative tools, which was not well received by creatives. Apple pulled the video, apologized, and said that it had \"missed the mark\" with the ad.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ads/\">Apple Ads</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/thailand/\">Thailand</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/02/apple-pulls-latest-underdogs-ad/\">Apple Pulls Latest Ad After Criticism Over Depiction of Thailand</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pulls-latest-ad-after-criticism-over-depiction-of-thailand.2432788/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7336893b436c18b9a2444adbcb5bf6d91241b79773bd99457e17197ba9263b05","category":"Apple"}
