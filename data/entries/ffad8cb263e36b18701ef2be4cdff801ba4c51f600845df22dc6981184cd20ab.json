The Hero 10 Black will also let you pull 15.8MP stills from 5.7k video and 19.8MP stills from 5k30 4:3 video.</p>\n<p>GoPro debuted its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/gopro-hero-7-just-how-hypersmooth-is-gopros-headline-feature/\">HyperSmooth image stabilisation</a> with the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/the-gopro-hero-7-is-here-and-its-the-best-one-yet-for-cyclists/\">GoPro Hero 7</a>. Back then, GoPro claimed the technology provided gimbal-like stability without a gimbal, and GoPro says it has been improved even further with the latest HyperSmooth 4.0 in the Hero Black 10.</p>\n<p>GoPro has also increased the camera’s horizon levelling technology and now benefits from an increased tilt limit of 45 degrees (up from 27 degrees).</p>\n<h2>Faster uploads?</h2>\n<p>GoPro also claims the new Hero 10 Black offers faster ways to access your photos and footage.</p>\n<p>It will automatically upload your most recent footage to your GoPro Cloud account while the camera is on charge.</p>\n<p>Wireless offloading to the GoPro Quik app is said to be 30 per cent faster than the GoPro Hero 9 Black too, and a new wired connection is claimed to upload footage 50 per cent faster to the app compared to wireless.</p>\n<h2>Webcam and live streaming</h2>\n<p>The GoPro Hero 10 Black has dedicated webcam and live streaming modes.</p>\n<p>The webcam mode will broadcast in 1080p HD video with a 132-degree wide-view, while the live streaming mode will stream with the new HyperSmooth 4.0 technology.</p>","author":"Stan Portus","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"ffad8cb263e36b18701ef2be4cdff801ba4c51f600845df22dc6981184cd20ab","category":"Cycling"}
