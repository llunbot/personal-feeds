Vega would replace the Fire OS that is installed on Fire TV sticks and televisions, Kindle Fire tablets, and other Amazon devices. Vega, based on \"a flavor of Linux,\" uses the popular JavaScript-based <a href=\"https://reactnative.dev\">React Native</a> as an application framework. This could simplify development for Fire devices alongside other React-ready platforms, including smartphones, desktops, and other smart TVs.</p>\n<p>Fire OS is a fork of Android based on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), but it's far from the same thing. The <a href=\"https://developer.amazon.com/docs/fire-tablets/ft-device-specifications-firehd-models.html?v=firemax11_2023\">Fire Max 11</a>, a 2023 device, is running Fire OS 8, which is <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/09/android-11-the-ars-technica-review/\">based on Android 11, released in 2020</a>. As Roettgers points out, Fire TVs sold in 2023 are based on <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/09/android-9-pie-thoroughly-reviewed/\">Android 9, from 2018</a>. While an Android base provides a relatively familiar entry for developers that already have Android apps, rebuilding the AOSP project—meant to support a wealth of different devices and carrying years of technical debt—seemingly became frustrating enough for Amazon to push toward an in-house solution.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1982914#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1982914&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8d27c3a311141583a8b0cd8ebe7005596a7950115b13493f31d83384763e562e","category":"Tech"}
