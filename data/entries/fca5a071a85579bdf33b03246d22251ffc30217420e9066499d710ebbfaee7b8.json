Broadcom also <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/broadcom-owned-vmware-kills-the-free-version-of-esxi-virtualization-software/\">discontinued</a> the free-to-use version of VMware's vSphere Hypervisor, also known as ESXi, earlier this year, forcing home users <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/03/proxmox-adds-easy-import-option-for-vms-after-broadcom-kills-vmwares-esxi/\">to find alternatives</a>.</p>\n<p>But today there's a bit of good news—for home users, at least. Broadcom is making <a href=\"https://blogs.vmware.com/teamfusion/2024/05/fusion-pro-now-available-free-for-personal-use.html\">VMware Fusion Pro 13</a> and <a href=\"https://blogs.vmware.com/workstation/2024/05/vmware-workstation-pro-now-available-free-for-personal-use.html\">VMWare Workstation Pro</a> free for personal use.</p>\n<p>Fusion Pro and Workstation Pro certainly aren't the only free-to-use virtualization products—<a href=\"https://www.virtualbox.org/\">VirtualBox</a> has existed for years, and there are many indie projects that make use of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/07/how-to-use-free-virtualization-apps-to-safely-test-the-macos-ventura-betas/\">Apple's virtualization frameworks for macOS</a>. But VMware's products are a bit more polished and easier to learn than some of those alternatives, and VMware's file formats are also commonly used when redistributing virtual machines for retrocomputing purposes.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024573#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024573&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fca5a071a85579bdf33b03246d22251ffc30217420e9066499d710ebbfaee7b8","category":"Tech"}
