So far, authorities have identified 67 casesâ€”53 in Turkey, 12 in Germany, and one each in Austria and Switzerland.</p>\n<p>Botulism is a life-threatening neuroparalytic condition caused by the botulinum toxin, which is made by the bacterial species <em>Clostridium botulinum</em>. There are <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/botulism/definition.html\">several forms of botulism</a>, but in this outbreak, the cases are a form called iatrogenic botulism, which occurs when too much toxin is injected during medical procedures. Iatrogenic botulism is associated with generalized muscle weakness, drooping eyes, difficulty swallowing, and difficulty breathing. The cases in the outbreak have ranged from mild to severe, with a number of people ending up in intensive care, <a href=\"https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/Communicable-Disease-Threats-Report-10-Mar-2023.pdf\">the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) reported</a>.</p>\n<p>The botulinum toxin <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16168317/\">is one of the most poisonous natural substances known</a>; a dose of just<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK534807/?report=classic\"> 1 nanogram per kilogram weight is lethal</a>.
