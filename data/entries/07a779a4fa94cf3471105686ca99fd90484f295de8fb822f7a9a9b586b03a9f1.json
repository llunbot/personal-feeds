The ratio offers a balanced experience in both portrait and landscape orientation, making it particularly versatile for reading/browsing and split-screen multitasking. Only the 8.3-inch iPad mini has deviated from the traditional ratio, instead using an approximate 3:2 ratio due to its slightly taller and narrower dimensions.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDigital Chat Station previously revealed the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/21/alleged-display-sizes-apple-foldable-iphone/\">alleged dimensions</a> of the iPhone Fold, claiming the device has a 5.5-inch outer screen and an inner folding 7.8-inch screen. Reputable Apple industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has since <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/kuo-apple-foldable-iphone-book-style-2000/\">corroborated</a> the dimensions, additionally describing the inner screen as \"crease-free.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKuo says the device will feature a titanium alloy casing with a hinge made of metallic glass, and it will have a dual-lens rear camera with a front-facing camera for both folded and unfolded states.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNotably, Kuo says that the phone will forgo Face ID authentication, instead using a Touch ID side button as a means to save precious internal space. It will also be positioned as a \"true AI-driven phone,\" with the larger screens allowing for a better multi-tasking AI experience.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMost estimates put the selling price of the iPhone Fold at around $2,000-$2,500 in the United States. <em>Bloomberg</em> reporter Mark Gurman expects Apple's first foldable device to arrive as soon as next year.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digital-chat-station/\">Digital Chat Station</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/\">Foldable iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/28/iphone-foldable-display-ipad-style-aspect-ratio/\">iPhone Foldable Display Said to Feature iPad-Style 4:3 Aspect Ratio</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-foldable-display-said-to-feature-ipad-style-4-3-aspect-ratio.2454219/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"07a779a4fa94cf3471105686ca99fd90484f295de8fb822f7a9a9b586b03a9f1","category":"Apple"}
