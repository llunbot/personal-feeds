As a company that connects billions of people around the world and has built industry-leading technology, we're determined to protect people's private communications and keep people safe online.</blockquote> Facebook had previously set in motion a plan to fully encrypt all messages in Messenger and Instagram in 2022, but following that announcement, government officials, institutions, and others raised concerns. Concerns amount to whether end-to-end encryption will make it harder for law enforcement to protect public and child safety.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nDavis said that a balance can be and must be accomplished. \"We believe people shouldn't have to choose between privacy and safety,\" Davis wrote, adding that Meta is \"engaging with privacy and safety experts, civil society and governments to make sure we get this right.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nInstagram, owned by Meta, has introduced features and changes to improve the platform for younger users, including automatically defaulting the accounts of users under the age of 18 to private. Meta is also relying on people's goodwill to combat possible abuse on its platform.\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote>Third, we're actively encouraging people to report harmful messages to us and will prompt them to do so when we think there could be a problem. Once they do, we can view the reported message, investigate the content, offer support where appropriate, and take action where necessary. Where we find abuse, we make referrals to the authorities and respond swiftly to valid requests for data to support law enforcement investigations â€“ as we always will.</blockquote>Davis is defended the need for end-to-end encryption, citing recent cases with data requests from law enforcement showing that the majority of user information requested is non-encrypted in the first place. \"While no systems are perfect, this shows that we can continue to stop criminals and support law enforcement,\" Davis wrote.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMeta already utilizes end-to-end encryption on WhatsApp, but that privilege is not extended by default to all Facebook Messenger and Instagram DM users. In August, Instagram <a href=\"https://messengernews.fb.com/2021/08/13/messenger-updates-end-to-end-encrypted-chats-with-new-features/\">said</a> it would be testing \"opt-in\" end-to-end encryption chats for a limited number of adult users in certain countries. Signal, Telegram, and iMessage are all end-to-end encrypted with no need to \"opt-in\" to the most secure form of mobile communication.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facebook-messenger/\">Facebook Messenger</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instagram/\">Instagram</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/22/facebook-instagram-end-to-end-encrypted-delay/\">Facebook Delays Plans to Use End-to-End Encryption As Default for Messenger and Instagram Messages Until at Least 2023</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/facebook-delays-plans-to-use-end-to-end-encryption-as-default-for-messenger-and-instagram-messages-until-at-least-2023.2324450/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ejSAR02gNZ4:gt-2S0YI7nw:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ejSAR02gNZ4:gt-2S0YI7nw:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"20f835f5e2e7460e8035a5316d689f571cb3d1dcfd43de43b0fc090e6878a253","category":"Apple"}
