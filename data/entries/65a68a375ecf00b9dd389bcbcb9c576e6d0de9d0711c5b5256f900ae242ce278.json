But just like how DH full-face helmet tech has trickled down to a lot of lightweight convertible and full-face helmets for enduro and even some aggressive trail riders – it’s hard to argue with extra head protection. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Beam Virgo Integral MIPS full-face city &amp; ebike helmet</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-Integral-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_side-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-Integral-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_side-jpg.webp\" alt=\"The Beam Virgo Integral MIPS full-face commuter ebike helmet review, side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-Integral-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_side-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-Integral-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_side-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-Integral-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_side-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-Integral-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_side-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-Integral-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_side-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-Integral-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_side-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-Integral-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_side-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/ Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Full-face helmets are nothing new in cycling. But for some reason, they’ve really never made the transition from gravity mountain biking to more mainstream cycling. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Beam Virgo full-face looks to break down that barrier with a lightweight and well-ventilated helmet that offers more of the light comfort, adjustable fit, and premium safety tech that we’ve come to expect from modern cycling helmets. Plus, of course, the added benefit of extra protection of the rider’s chin &amp; face.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-Integral-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_winter-riding-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-Integral-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_winter-riding-jpg.webp\" alt=\"The Beam Virgo Integral MIPS full-face commuter ebike helmet review, winter commuting\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-Integral-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_winter-riding-jpg.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-Integral-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_winter-riding-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-Integral-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_winter-riding-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-Integral-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_winter-riding-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-Integral-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_winter-riding-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-Integral-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_winter-riding-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-Integral-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_winter-riding-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve been following the development of this lightweight, multi-disciple full-face since it began as an <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/ventoux-cycling-helmet-concept-aims-for-aero-full-face-road-riding-protection/\" target=\"_blank\">aero road helmet</a> almost 5 years ago. So, with my own adoption of more time riding a <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/engwe-engine-x-folding-fat-tire-ebike-review/\" target=\"_blank\">strange utilitarian</a> ebike and a bright yellow <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bikerumor-editors-choice-2022-corys-best-bike-gear-awards/\" target=\"_blank\">cargo ebike</a>, I was happy to test out this latest evolution of the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/the-beam-x-virgo-move-full-face-helmet-brings-extra-protection-for-safer-ebike-riding/\" target=\"_blank\">Virgo full-face</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Why an ebike commuter full-face? Why not!</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-Integral-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_riding-visor-shading-my-eyes-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-Integral-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_riding-visor-shading-my-eyes-jpg.webp\" alt=\"The Beam Virgo Integral MIPS full-face commuter ebike helmet review, eiding side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-Integral-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_riding-visor-shading-my-eyes-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-Integral-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_riding-visor-shading-my-eyes-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-Integral-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_riding-visor-shading-my-eyes-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-Integral-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_riding-visor-shading-my-eyes-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-Integral-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_riding-visor-shading-my-eyes-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As more people have adopted ebikes as an alternative form of transportation, we have seen more helmets get ebike certifications – i.e. <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?s=NTA+8776\" target=\"_blank\">NTA 8776</a>. Yet still, we still only really see ebike helmets going full-face for off-road-focused aggressive eMTB riding. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, as commuter ebikes share more of the road and urban environment, it makes sense that ebike helmets could start to look a bit more like a scooter or moto helmet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you are riding back and forth to work amongst car traffic, or zipping around town on quick &amp; powerful ebikes, The Beam Virgo Integral MIPS helmet simply offers extra peace of mind in a lightweight and comfortable helmet at a reasonable price. And it delivers enough ventilation that you won’t really roast when you have to pedal a bit on your own, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech Details &amp; Actual Weight</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-Integral-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_side-profile-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-Integral-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_side-profile-jpg.webp\" alt=\"The Beam Virgo Integral MIPS full-face commuter ebike helmet review, side angled\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-Integral-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_side-profile-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-Integral-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_side-profile-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-Integral-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_side-profile-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-Integral-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_side-profile-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-Integral-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_side-profile-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Beam developed the Virgo full-face to not only comply with the regular EN1078 / CPSC bike certification standards, but also to meet the more stringent European NTA-8776 regulation created for higher-speed (45kph/28mph) pedelec ebikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The French-designed helmet features a unique multi-layer construction. First, there’s essentially a more conventional in-mold half-shell helmet – with just a plastic shell molded over the edges of its EPS foam energy absorbing layer for wear &amp; tear protection. Then, molded on the outside of that, there’s the complete ABS shell with separate in-mold EPS around the cheeks and chin bar for additional protection. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, inside it all, is a black MIPS Evolve Core liner insert to isolate your head from rotational forces in an impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-Integral-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_inside-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2100\" height=\"1400\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-Integral-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_inside-jpg.webp\" alt=\"The Beam Virgo Integral MIPS full-face commuter ebike helmet review, inside details\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-Integral-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_inside-jpg.webp 2100w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-Integral-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_inside-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-Integral-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_inside-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-Integral-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_inside-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-Integral-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_inside-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-Integral-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_inside-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-Integral-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_inside-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-Integral-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_inside-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>unique multi-part construction for conventional impacts, plus separate face protection</li>\n\n\n\n<li>ABS shell with in-mold EPS foam</li>\n\n\n\n<li>5 forward &amp;

In fact, while riding commuter bikes or even trail bikes in the winter, I’ve already been apt to put on a lightweight enduro full face and goggles to get a bit of extra weather protection with the added safety just a bonus. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weight-wise, I have a couple of light enduro MTB full-face helmets that are lighter (Dainese &amp; Endura) than the Virgo without its visor, but only the Endura is lighter once I factor in a pair of goggles, and then only by about 10g. Only the Dainese has MIPS, and neither are NTA-8776 certified. What that says is that comparing apples to apples (or at least to pears), The Beam’s Virgo Integral MIPS is truly a lightweight when it comes to full-face protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Riding Review</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_parially-opened-visor-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_parially-opened-visor-jpg.webp\" alt=\"The Beam Virgo Integral MIPS full-face commuter ebike helmet review, side with visor open\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_parially-opened-visor-jpg.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_parially-opened-visor-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_parially-opened-visor-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_parially-opened-visor-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_parially-opened-visor-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_parially-opened-visor-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_parially-opened-visor-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve ridden the Virgo Integral MIPS mostly through autumn, with my ebike rides generally leaning towards jackets and gloves weather, so I really can’t vouch for how it will do on hot summer days when you have to pedal uphill by yourself. Or when your ebike battery will run out. But I have ridden in cold enough weather to notice that the vents do let a good bit of air in, so I definitely put a thin windproof cap on when it got closer to freezing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I picked the sand tan helmet to test because I figured the lighter color would offer improved visibility to drivers. And I have the clear Crystal visor, which still has a tiny bit of a gray tint, although it’s completely fine for riding at night with lights.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The visor itself doesn’t have any specific handles or tabs to move it. But it sits far enough away from my face that I have no problem pushing it up or down by the visor’s edges, even with winter gloves. When it’s not exceptionally cold, I like to ride with the visor up so I can feel the wind on my face. Or half way up which offers a tiny bit of shading against the setting sun. But on especially cold, windy, or even rainy days, dropping the visor down is great. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Virgo Integral’s snap-on Smart Rear Light</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_snap-in-tailight-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_snap-in-tailight-jpg.webp\" alt=\"The Beam Virgo Integral MIPS full-face commuter ebike helmet review, snap on taillight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_snap-in-tailight-jpg.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_snap-in-tailight-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_snap-in-tailight-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_snap-in-tailight-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_snap-in-tailight-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_snap-in-tailight-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_snap-in-tailight-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I especially like the Virgo Integral’s included rear smart taillight (optional on Access models), as it greatly boosts nighttime and low-light visibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It puts out a steady 40 lumens of red light, then powered by an on-board accelerometer, it automatically boosts to 120 lumens when braking for added visibility. The water-resistant 28g USB-C rechargeable taillight has a 400mAh battery for a claimed runtime of 20 hours, and a 2hr recharge time – both of which seem to match my real-world use. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Smart rear light is StVZO-certified, and comes in a package with the top-spec Virgo Integral models, or sells for 49€ separately.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Riding Takeaways</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_increased-evening-visibility-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_increased-evening-visibility-jpg.webp\" alt=\"The Beam Virgo Integral MIPS full-face commuter ebike helmet review, improved visibility\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_increased-evening-visibility-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_increased-evening-visibility-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_increased-evening-visibility-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_increased-evening-visibility-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_increased-evening-visibility-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are only used to road, gravel, or conventional urban commuter helmets, The Beam Virgo Integral MIPS full-face is a pretty shocking switch. And I won’t lie, the first comments that I’ve got from coworkers, friends, and family were often astonishment why I would want a helmet that they thought looked more like a motorcycle helmet than a commuter bike helmet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But on second thought, pretty much everyone understands that more coverage and more protection means improved safety. And what other reason do we wear helmets than to keep our heads safe? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, more ebikes means more time sharing the road with cars, more inexperienced riders on heavier ebikes (vs. conventional bikes), and maybe even higher average speeds. So there’s good reason to offer more protection to the heads of ebikers. And The Beam’s Virgo Integral full face does all that in a lightweight and comfortable helmet, that I personally feel better riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Beam Virgo Integral – Pricing, options &amp; availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Beam_Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-Kickstarter_safest-cycling-helmet-for-e-bikes_colors.jpg\"><img width=\"2500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Beam_Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-Kickstarter_safest-cycling-helmet-for-e-bikes_colors.jpg\" alt=\"The Beam x Virgo MIPS full-face commuter ebike helmet on Kickstarter now, the safest cycling helmet for e-bikes, color options\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Beam_Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-Kickstarter_safest-cycling-helmet-for-e-bikes_colors.jpg 2500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Beam_Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-Kickstarter_safest-cycling-helmet-for-e-bikes_colors-297x119.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Beam_Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-Kickstarter_safest-cycling-helmet-for-e-bikes_colors-800x320.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Beam_Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-Kickstarter_safest-cycling-helmet-for-e-bikes_colors-120x48.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Beam_Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-Kickstarter_safest-cycling-helmet-for-e-bikes_colors-768x307.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Beam_Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-Kickstarter_safest-cycling-helmet-for-e-bikes_colors-1536x614.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/The-Beam_Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-Kickstarter_safest-cycling-helmet-for-e-bikes_colors-2048x819.jpg 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/The Beam)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Beam offers their Virgo full-face helmet in 3 sizes: S(51-54cm), M (55-58cm) &amp; L (59-63cm. Then, you get to pick from 4 colors – black, white, navy blue &amp; sand (<em>tested</em>). And then, if you get one of the top-tier Integral models, it comes with your choice of 4 visor options – lightly tinted Crystal (<em>tested</em>), dark smoke tinted Black, reflective Polarized Blue, bronze-tinted Yellow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, The Beam Virgo is available in 4 spec options to hit all price points: Integral includes both the visor of your choice and the taillight. Access is without a visor (but one could still be added later). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Technically, it looks like only the top-tier is available in the <a href=\"https://www.thebeam-usa.com/\" target=\"_blank\">US-specfic</a> web store, at the moment. But global delivery is available from the European webshop, so you might just have slightly higher shipping costs or extra delivery time.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_winter-evening-ride-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_winter-evening-ride-jpg.webp\" alt=\"The Beam Virgo Integral MIPS full-face commuter ebike helmet review, winter night riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_winter-evening-ride-jpg.webp 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_winter-evening-ride-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_winter-evening-ride-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_winter-evening-ride-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_winter-evening-ride-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/The-Beam-Virgo-MIPS-full-face-commuter-ebike-helmet-review_winter-evening-ride-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The top-spec The Beam Virgo Integral MIPS full-face (<em>as tested</em>) sells for $299 / 299€, directly from The Beam’s online shop. Get rid of the visor &amp; that smart taillight, and the Virgo Access MIPS retails for just 239€. Or without the extra rotational impact protection, the Virgo Integral sells for 229€ with the accessories, and the Virgo Access goes for 179€ without. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are also even cheaper XS (48-50cm) &amp; S (51-54cm) kids versions for just 99€ in more child-oriented colors, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an extra holiday shopping deal now in Europe, if you buy any Virgo helmet right now, The Beam will give you a free visor and a helmet Reflector reflective sticker for free, making it cheaper to get a visor-equipped commuter full-face.
