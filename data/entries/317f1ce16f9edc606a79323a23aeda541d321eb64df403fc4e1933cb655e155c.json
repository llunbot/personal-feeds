{"title":"Disney Has a Good Disney+ App for VisionOS (and, by the Way, I Got Another 30-Minute Hands-On Experience With Vision Pro)","link":"https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disney-on-apple-vision-pro-ushers-in-a-new-era-of-storytelling-innovation-and-immersive-entertainment/","date":1705453246000,"content":"\n<p>Disney:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>At launch, viewers can transform their space into one of four \nDisney+ environments, bringing them even closer to the story. Each \nenvironment includes animations and sounds that make the space \nfeel alive, and Easter eggs from films and franchises that will \nsurprise and delight fans. </p>\n\n<p>Available only on Apple Vision Pro, Disney+ subscribers will be \nable to stream the entire catalog — including thousands of TV \nshows and films, plus access to Hulu content for eligible Disney \nBundle subscribers — from iconic environments with vivid details, \nincluding: the Disney+ Theater, inspired by the historic El \nCapitan Theatre in Hollywood; the Scare Floor from Pixar’s \nMonsters Inc.; Marvel’s Avengers Tower overlooking downtown \nManhattan; and the cockpit of Luke Skywalker’s landspeeder facing \na binary sunset on the planet Tatooine from the Star Wars galaxy. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I got to try this during <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@gruber/111767493035111862\">another hands-on Vision Pro demo</a> <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@gruber/post/C2LKPu5P0Wu\">in New York today</a>. (Follow those links to Mastodon and Threads, where I’ve tried to answer every question asked by my followers.)</p>\n\n<p>It’s 100 percent a gimmick, but it’s a really good fun whimsical gimmick, and the detail is extraordinary. It looks like you are there on Tony Stark’s helipad penthouse deck, with a towering view of Manhattan in front of you, and Stark’s apartment behind you. These are 360° environments. The Tatooine view in the landspeeder is right outside Mos Eisley, at dusk.</p>\n\n<p>Does it make the movie you’re watching any better to see it while sitting in an immersive fantasy environment? No, of course not. But it’s a lot of fun, because it’s so intricately detailed and well-done. Did the Mac OS X Aqua user interface make Mac users more productive? Did the original iPhone work better because its interface looked so damn cool? No. But those UIs sure did make Mac OS X and the original iPhone more fun.</p>\n\n<p>I don’t know why people lose sight of the fact that having fun is one of the very best parts of being a human. The Disney+ app for VisionOS is fun.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/16/disney-plus-visionos\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"317f1ce16f9edc606a79323a23aeda541d321eb64df403fc4e1933cb655e155c","category":"Tech"}
