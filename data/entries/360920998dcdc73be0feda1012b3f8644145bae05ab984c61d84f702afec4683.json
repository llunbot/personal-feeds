{"title":"The Amazing Kreskin Dies at 89","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/11/arts/the-amazing-kreskin-dead.html","date":1734031057000,"content":"\n<p>The New York Times:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>George J. Kresge, who as the entertainer the Amazing Kreskin used\nmentalist tricks to dazzle audiences as he rose to fame on\nlate-night television in the 1970s, died on Tuesday in Wayne, N.J.\nHe was 89. A close friend, Meir Yedid, said the death, at an\nassisted living facility, was from complications of dementia.</p>\n\n<p>Kreskin’s feats included divining details of strangers’ personal\nlives and guessing at playing cards chosen randomly from a deck.\nAnd he had a classic trick at live shows: entrusting audience\nmembers to hide his paycheck in the auditorium, and then relying\non his instincts to find it — or else going without payment for\na night.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Somehow his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_E_uzSCegiU\">first appearance with Letterman</a> wasn’t until 1990, but after that he was a regular. Just a canonical “late night talk show guest” of that era. He was good at the mentalist tricks, but what made Kreskin great — amazing even — was that he was just such a weird, fun, and funny guy.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/12/kreskin-rip\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"360920998dcdc73be0feda1012b3f8644145bae05ab984c61d84f702afec4683","category":"Tech"}
