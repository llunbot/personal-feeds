Ford and Tesla have agreed to give Ford EVs access to Tesla's Supercharger network. Current Ford EVs will require an adapter to connect what Tesla has called <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/07/the-ars-technica-guide-to-electric-vehicle-charging/\">the \"North American Charging Standard\" (NACS) cable to its Combined Charging System (CCS) ports</a>. But Ford's next series of EVs will feature native NACS ports, removing the need for an adapter.</p>\n<p>\"This is great news for our customers who will have unprecedented access to the largest network of fast-chargers in the US and Canada with 12,000-plus Tesla Superchargers plus 10,000-plus fast-chargers already in the BlueOval Charge Network,\" Farley said. \"Widespread access to fast-charging is absolutely vital to our growth as an EV brand, and this breakthrough agreement comes as we are ramping up production of our popular Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning, and preparing to launch a series of next-generation EVs starting in 2025.\"</p>\n<p>Many words have been written these past few years about the poor state of the US's DC fast-charging infrastructure. EV drivers of all stripes <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/07/electric-cars-are-doomed-if-fast-charger-reliability-doesnt-get-better/\">have horror stories</a> about inscrutable charger errors, out-of-order stations, and hours-long delays to road trips... except Tesla drivers, who have access to an expansive DC fast-charging network that seems to just work.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1942438#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1942438&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
