During the design process, Starling worked closely with Effigear to build this steel frame around their 9-speed system, offering a 440% range, making any climb more efficient. Speaking of efficiency, the Effigear system uses a standard trigger shifter, not an annoying grip ship. Having the gearbox at the bottom bracket keeps the bike balanced, nimble, and provides a lower center of gravity. This translates to unprecedented traction, control, and an overall more balanced feel.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/07/Starling-Cycles-Spur-Gearbox-Bike-16.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The Spur is available to order now from Starling Cycles and is built by hand in Bristol, UK using Reynolds 853 steel heat-treated tubing.
