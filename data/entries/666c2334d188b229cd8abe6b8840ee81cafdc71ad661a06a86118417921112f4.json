{"title":"New MacBook Pro Keyboard Has All-Black Design, Full-Size Function Keys, and Touch ID Ring","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/18/new-macbook-pro-keyboard-design/","date":1634606820000,"content":"Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/18/apple-unveils-redesigned-macbook-pro/\">new MacBook Pro models</a> unveiled today feature a redesigned keyboard with an all-black design, a row of full-size function keys, and a Touch ID ring that provides a more tactile experience for unlocking the Mac with your finger.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/2021-macbook-pro-keyboard.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe function keys include new shortcuts for Spotlight, Siri, Dictation, and Do Not Disturb, in addition to usual shortcuts for display brightness, media playback, volume, and more. These keys replace the Touch Bar, which was removed on all new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models, five years after it was introduced.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple didn't comment on its reason for removing the Touch Bar, but during its \"Unleashed\" event, the company said that the return of physical function keys brings back the \"familiar, tactile feel of mechanical keys that pro users love.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhile some users are disappointed that Apple removed the Touch Bar, the new MacBook Pro is likely to be a crowd-pleasing design given not only physical function keys, but the return of additional ports like an HDMI port, SD card slot, and MagSafe. The new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models also feature Apple's next-generation M1 Pro and M1 Max chips, mini-LED displays with a ProMotion adaptive refresh rate up to 120Hz, and more.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe new MacBook Pro models can be ordered now and will start arriving to customers and launch in stores on Tuesday, October 26. Pricing starts at $1,999 for the 14-inch model and at $2,499 for the 16-inch model.
