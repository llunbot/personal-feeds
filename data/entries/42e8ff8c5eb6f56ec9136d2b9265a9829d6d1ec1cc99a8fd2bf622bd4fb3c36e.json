Which one will it be? […] Difficult to say in truth, but, in any case, they will deserve the congratulations of sportsmen, because it is obvious that the event will be beautiful, magnificently eventful,’ the article continued. ‘The course is as tough as can be; the distance is only within the reach of a great ace.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That distance was 361km from the Porte de la Villette in Paris to the Parc des Princes via Épernay, Reims, Compiègne, Chantilly and Pontoise. And the 41-strong peloton was indeed comprised of many an ‘ace’. Pélissier had won the Tour de France in 1923 and had claimed multiple editions of Paris-Roubaix and Il Lombardia, as well as a Milan-San Remo; Suter had won both the Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix the previous year; Girardengo had won the Giro d’Italia twice and both Milan-San Remo and Il Lombardia three times (he would go on to win six Milan-San Remos, a record until Eddy Merckx took his seventh in 1976).</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Also in the bunch were the likes of Philippe Thys (the first rider to win three Tours), Ottavio Bottecchia (the reigning Tour champion who in 1925 would successfully defend that title) and two-time Bordeaux-Paris winner Eugène Christophe (he of broken forks on the Tourmalet fame).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While <em>L’Auto</em>, as race organiser, hyped up the event in its subsequent race report – ‘The hunt becomes extremely hectic. Detreille runs like hell. Behind him, Sellier and Francis Pélissier charge like demons’ – other reports describe a less frenzied affair.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘To say that the race presented enormous interest would be excessive,’ said <em>Le Petit Journal</em>. ‘As was to be expected, this event, because it brought together too many men of substantially equal value, was monotonous for the greater part of its journey.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"710\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/pro-history-154-girardengo-1924-710x970.jpg\" alt=\"Costante Girardengo\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/pro-history-154-girardengo-1924-710x970.jpg 710w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/pro-history-154-girardengo-1924-220x300.jpg 220w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/pro-history-154-girardengo-1924-768x1050.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/pro-history-154-girardengo-1924-1124x1536.jpg 1124w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/pro-history-154-girardengo-1924-1499x2048.jpg 1499w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/pro-history-154-girardengo-1924-750x1025.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/pro-history-154-girardengo-1924-1140x1558.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/pro-history-154-girardengo-1924.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Offside</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>As the race entered its final phase, those that remained were pretty much all together. The leading bunch numbered 23 as they began the climb of Coeur Volant, ‘the final obstacle’, with 15km to go. <em>L’Auto</em> describes Girardengo crossing the top with a lead of 30m over Henri Pélissier, with Georges Detreille 40m back and Francis Pélissier a further 10m off the pace. <em>Le Miroir des Sports</em> meanwhile has Henri Pélissier first over the top with Girardengo fifth in line, an account somewhat supported by <em>Le Petit Journal</em>, which told readers that ‘three clearly stood out from the pack at the top of the climb: Francis and Henri Pélissier and Detreille.’ </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, Girardengo was at the head of affairs when it mattered. Nine riders entered the Parc des Princes together and with 400m to go the Italian launched his final and definitive effort, edging out Henri Pélissier by a matter of centimetres on the line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Girardengo, who had never won a road race in France, triumphed for the first time on cement, like the excellent track rider that he is,’ reported <em>Le</em> <em>Miroir des Sports</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The best of the best</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The quality of the field was due to the fact that the GP Wolber was designed to feature only the best riders from the season. First held in 1922, the race was the idea of French industrialist Antoine Wolber, who in 1898 had formed a rubber and tyre company that carried his surname and which made tyres among other bicycle components.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wolber’s idea was to stage a season-closing race with a large prize fund.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘He began by taking out of his safe 24 beautiful thousand franc notes,’ reported <em>L’Auto</em>, ‘took 15 between his thumb and index finger on his right hand, reserving them for the winner of the race, and, having regard to the significance of the sum, then decreed that his race would only bring together undisputed champions of the bicycle.’ </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://store.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"343\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/clickable-subs-promo8-970x343.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/clickable-subs-promo8-970x343.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/clickable-subs-promo8-300x106.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/clickable-subs-promo8-768x271.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/clickable-subs-promo8-1536x543.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/clickable-subs-promo8-2048x724.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/clickable-subs-promo8-750x265.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/clickable-subs-promo8-1140x403.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>So it was that the GP Wolber would only be open to the top-three finishers in cycling’s greatest races: Paris-Roubaix, Bordeaux-Paris, Tour de France, Giro d’Italia and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time there was no official road world championship so the race became seen as an unofficial one. Girardengo, the original <em>Campionissimo</em> (champion of champions) thanks to his stunning winning record in Italy, was a fitting winner.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The de-facto world championship</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1927 the UCI introduced an official men’s professional road World Championship (it would take another 31 years for women to get their race). Girardengo’s great Italian rival, Alfredo Binda, took that inaugural title with Girardengo, who launched the attack that had ultimately led to his rival’s win, finishing second. One year later both Girardengo and Binda faced the wrath of the Italian cycling federation after refusing to co-operate in the 1928 race, handing the title to Belgian Georges Ronsse. Both were handed suspensions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Girardengo would never ride another World Championship race – though he would later direct the Italian team in the event. The GP Wolber continued in its original form until 1931, changing to a French-only race in 1932 and then one for amateurs and independents under 25 years old from 1934 until its demise in 1950.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>• This article originally appeared in issue 154 of Cyclist magazine. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to </a><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\">subscribe</a></em></strong></p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bernard-hinault-liege-1980\">Pro race history: Bernard Hinault wins a frozen Liège-Bastogne-Liège in 1980</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/rik-van-looy-1963-worlds\">Pro race history: Rik Van Looy is upstaged by his teammate at the 1963 Worlds</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/uci-world-championships-2023-highlights\">Pro Log: 5 things to remember from the 2023 UCI World Championships</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/costante-girardengo-1924-world-championship\">Pro race history: Costante Girardengo wins the unofficial world championship in 1924</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"42e8ff8c5eb6f56ec9136d2b9265a9829d6d1ec1cc99a8fd2bf622bd4fb3c36e","category":"Cycling"}
