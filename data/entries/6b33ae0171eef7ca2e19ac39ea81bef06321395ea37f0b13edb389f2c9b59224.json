Gurman reports that Apple is planning to unveil a redesigned Mac mini with both M4 and M4 Pro chip options. Additionally, the iMac is set to receive an update, with Apple's all-in-one desktop finally transitioning to the M4 chip.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA refreshed iPad mini is also reportedly on the horizon, with a potential release date in early November. This would mark the first update to Apple's smallest tablet since its redesign in 2021.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLooking further ahead, Gurman outlined Apple's hardware plans for the first half of 2025. The company is expected to introduce M4-powered 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air models, a new iPhone SE with Apple Intelligence, updated 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Air models with accompanying new Magic Keyboards, and a refreshed AirTag.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMac power users may need to wait a bit longer for high-end desktop updates. While new Mac Studio and Mac Pro models with M4 chips are in development, Gurman says they are slated for later releases. The Mac Studio is anticipated around mid-2025, with the Mac Pro following towards the end of the year.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro 14 &amp; 16\" </a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac\">iMac (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini\">iPad Mini (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">14\" &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini\">Mac Mini (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91\">iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146\">Mac mini</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/06/apple-to-launch-new-m4-macs-nov-1/\">Gurman: Apple to Launch New M4 Macs and iPad Mini 7 on November 1</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-apple-to-launch-new-m4-macs-and-ipad-mini-7-on-november-1.2439319/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6b33ae0171eef7ca2e19ac39ea81bef06321395ea37f0b13edb389f2c9b59224","category":"Apple"}
