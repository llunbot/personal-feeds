{"title":"Meta and Yandex’s ‘Local Mess’ Exploit Seemingly Only Works on Android","link":"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/06/meta-and-yandex-are-de-anonymizing-android-users-web-browsing-identifiers/","date":1749074932000,"content":"\n<p>Dan Goodin, writing at Ars Technica:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This abuse has been observed only in Android, and evidence\nsuggests that the Meta Pixel and Yandex Metrica target only\nAndroid users. The researchers say it may be technically feasible\nto target iOS because browsers on that platform allow developers\nto programmatically <a href=\"https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=279249\">establish localhost connections</a> that\napps can monitor on local ports.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast to iOS, however, Android imposes fewer controls on\nlocal host communications and background executions of mobile\napps, the researchers said, while also implementing stricter\ncontrols in app store vetting processes to limit such abuses. This\noverly permissive design allows Meta Pixel and Yandex Metrica to\nsend web requests with web tracking identifiers to specific local\nports that are continuously monitored by the Facebook, Instagram,\nand Yandex apps. These apps can then link pseudonymous web\nidentities with actual user identities, even in private browsing\nmodes, effectively de-anonymizing users’ browsing habits on sites\ncontaining these trackers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’ll note that among the so-called <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2025/06/apple_appeals_eu_interop_requirements\">“interoperability” requirements the European Commission is demanding of iOS</a> is for third-party apps to run, unfettered, in the background, because some of Apple’s own first-party software obviously runs in the background. And I’ll further note that Apple made clear, <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/support/downloads/DMA-Interoperability-Dec-2024.pdf\">back in its December 2024 report laying out its objections to the EC’s demands</a>, that:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>No company has made more interoperability requests of Apple than\nMeta. In many cases, Meta is seeking to alter functionality in a\nway that raises concerns about the privacy and security of users,\nand that appears to be completely unrelated to the actual use of\nMeta external devices, such as Meta smart glasses and Meta Quests.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This newly uncovered “Local Mess” exploit — which seemingly only works on Android — is exactly the sort of scheme Meta wants to pull on iOS: to track users across millions of websites while they justifiably believe their web browsing is sandboxed from all native apps.</p>\n\n<p>Back to Goodin:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Meta Pixel and Yandex Metrica are analytics scripts designed to\nhelp advertisers measure the effectiveness of their campaigns.\nMeta Pixel and Yandex Metrica are estimated to be installed on\n<a href=\"https://trends.builtwith.com/websitelist/Facebook-Pixel%20\">5.8 million</a> and <a href=\"https://trends.builtwith.com/analytics/Yandex-Metrika\">3 million</a> sites, respectively.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Every one of the sites that includes these tracking scripts is complicit to some extent in the theft of hundreds of millions of Android users’ web browsing privacy.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/06/04/meta-and-yandexs-local-mess-exploit-seemingly-only-works-on-android\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b251fbe12e723561ef34c6fe54254b62b2b27e97e640b5dc87e412fafe9a6430","category":"Tech"}
