And while the changes aren't earth-shattering, they will probably pique your interest. The headline news for Ars readers is probably this: the hybrid is back, and now you can spec an all-wheel drive hybrid Maverick as well as a front-wheel-drive electrified model.</p>\n<p>When we tested the Maverick back in 2021, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/10/the-2022-ford-maverick-is-a-cheap-cheerful-diy-friendly-pickup-truck/\">we were very impressed with it</a>, particularly the front-wheel drive hybrid powertrain. The 191 hp (142 kW) pickup was capable of exceeding 42 mpg (5.6 L/100 km). It was the right size, as opposed to being gargantuan like almost every other pickup on sale, yet it still had the ability to carry 1,500 lbs (680 kg) in the bed or tow 2,000 lb (907 kg) trailers. All for a starting price of just under $20,000, assuming you ignored the destination charge.</p>\n<p>Even better, the 2.5 L hybrid powertrain was the standard option, with the more powerful 2.0 L EcoBoost hybrid as a cost-option, either with front- or all-wheel drive. Sadly, more recent supply chain issues got in the way of that, with Ford <a href=\"https://fordauthority.com/2023/07/2024-ford-maverick-to-drop-2-5l-hybrid-as-standard-engine/\">dropping the hybrid as standard for MY24</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040229#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040229&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
