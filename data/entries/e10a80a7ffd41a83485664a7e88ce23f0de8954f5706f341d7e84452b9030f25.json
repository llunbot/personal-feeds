{"title":"Apple Shares New 'Sleek Peek' Teaser Ahead of WWDC 2025 Next Week","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/02/apple-sleek-peek/","date":1748877753000,"content":"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/\">WWDC 2025</a> is just one week away, with Apple's opening keynote <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/20/apple-announces-wwdc-2025-schedule/\">scheduled to begin on Monday, June 9 at 10 a.m. Pacific Time</a>. Ahead of the annual developer conference, Apple <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=ccuxfzqc\">updated</a> its <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/wwdc25/\">WWDC page</a> today with a new \"Sleek peek\" tagline, which replaces the original \"On the horizon\" tagline that it used over the past few weeks.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/WWDC-2025-Sleek-Peek.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"899\" />\r<br />\nThe graphic for WWDC 2025 has also been updated. It is now a glass-like Apple logo with colors shining through. Until now, it was a glass-like rainbow.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIs the \"Sleek peek\" tagline a hint at what is to come? It could be a subtle reference to the sleek new look of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/28/apple-ios-26/\">iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, tvOS 26, and watchOS 26</a>, which are all <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/ios-19-macos-16-major-design-update/\">rumored to feature a new glass-like, visionOS-inspired design</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWWDC 2025 has also been added to the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-events/\">Apple Events page</a> today. Apple's keynote will be available to stream on that page, as well as in the Apple TV app, and on YouTube. It will also be available for replay afterwards.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLast, Apple's marketing chief Greg Joswiak has <a href=\"https://x.com/gregjoz/status/1929558230990049758\">shared</a> a short WWDC 2025 animation with a glass-like Apple logo, a Swift logo, and a rainbow.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WWDC25?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WWDC25</a> is next week!
