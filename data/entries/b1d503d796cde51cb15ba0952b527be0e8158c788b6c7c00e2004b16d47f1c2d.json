The even has come a long way since that first chaotic Miami ePrix: The cars are properly fast now, the racing is both entertaining and quite technical, and at least the trackside advertising banners were in place before the start of the event this time.</p>\n<p>It's not the same track, of course. Nor is it anywhere near the Hard Rock Stadium that Formula 1 now fills with ersatz marinas and high-priced hospitality packages during its visit to the area. Despite what the b-roll helicopter shots might have led viewers to believe, we were actually an hour south of the city at a mid-sized oval track next to a landfill in Homestead.

Despite the bucolic charm of PIR, with its easy bicycle and light rail access, enthusiastic crowd of attendees, and exciting racing, it was only a temporary patch for Formula E. The vast majority of Formula E's fans live outside the US, and Portland means nothing to them, but they've heard of Miami, I was told last year.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/formula-e-still-searching-for-a-place-in-america-to-call-home/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/formula-e-still-searching-for-a-place-in-america-to-call-home/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
