The sport is adopting <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/11/formula-1-talks-to-ars-about-sustainability-and-synthetic-fuels/\">carbon-neutral synthetic fuels</a> and switching to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/04/smaller-more-slippery-more-sustainable-cars-f1s-plan-for-2026/\">a simplified, if far more powerful, hybrid system,</a> powering cars with much less drag. But early simulation tests have been alarming, with cars that were at times \"undriveable,\" according to a report in <a href=\"https://us.motorsport.com/f1/news/f1s-2026-active-aero-plan-set-for-change-after-alarming-simulator-findings/10596683/\">Motorsport</a>.</p>\n<p>The FIA, which is in charge of F1's rules and regulations, wants cars that can race each other closely and entertain an audience, so expect the 2026 cars to generate less aerodynamic downforce, since that is often conducive to processional racing.</p>\n<p>Reducing drag is a bigger priority for the FIA, especially since the new hybrid system, which still regenerates energy under braking but no longer also from the engine's turbocharger, won't have the energy sufficient to aid the car's combustion engine throughout the entire lap.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016256#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016256&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
