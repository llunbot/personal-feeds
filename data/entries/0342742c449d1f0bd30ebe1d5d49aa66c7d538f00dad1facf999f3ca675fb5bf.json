In the United Kingdom, for example, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/14-inch\">Apple's online store</a> shows the following configurations as available to pick up in-store today.\r\n<br />\r\n<div> <ul><li><strong>14-inch MacBook Pro</strong></li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Silver/Space Gray</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>8-Core CPU</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>14-Core GPU</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>16GB Unified Memory</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>512GB SSD Storage</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>67W USB-C Power Adapter</li> </ul></div><div><ul><li><strong>14-inch MacBook Pro</strong></li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Silver/Space Gray</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>10-Core CPU</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>16-Core GPU</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>16GB Unified Memory</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>1TB SSD Storage</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>96W USB-C Power Adapter</li></ul> </div>\r\n<br />\r\n<div></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div> <ul><li><strong>16-inch MacBook Pro</strong></li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Silver/Space Gray</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>10-Core CPU</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>16-Core GPU</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>16GB Unified Memory</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>512GB SSD Storage</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>140W USB-C Power Adapter </li> </ul></div><div><ul>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<li><strong>16-inch MacBook Pro</strong></li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Silver/Space Gray</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>10-Core CPU</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>16-Core</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>16GB Unified Memory</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>1TB SSD Storage</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>140W USB-C Power Adapter </li> </ul></div>\r\n<br />\r\n<div></div>\r\n<br />\r\nAvailability wise, the only off-the-shelf model that doesn't appear to be widely available at U.K. retail stores is the top-spec 16-inch MacBook Pro with M1 Max chip, 32-Core GPU, and 32GB or memory, which costs a combined £3,299 ($3,499). This exception is likely to be replicated in other stores and countries.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/macbook-store-checkout-bag.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you intend to pick up a new MacBook Pro, once you proceed to the checkout and click the blue \"Checkout\" button, select \"I'll pick it up,\" then choose a store location, pickup date, and an available 15-minute check-in window from the options.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIf you will be picking up the ‌MacBook Pro personally, enter your phone number. If someone else will be arranging the pickup, enter his or her contact information. The person making the pickup must be carrying a valid photo ID.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/macbook-pro-in-store-pickup.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThen, proceed with the checkout process as usual. Once payment has been made, wait until you receive a pickup notification email or text message before picking up the ‌MacBook Pro. If you don't receive one, call the store. Since the ‌MacBook Pro is paid for ahead of time, the store will hold the device in its back room until you arrive. Your order will be held for 14 days.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOf course, another option is to simply walk into an Apple store on Tuesday, preferably right when they open. In some instances, you may have to wait in line, but the queues have typically been shorter in recent years and shouldn't be anything like as long as iPhone launch days. Note that temperature checks and face masks may be required. You can use the pickup tool on Apple's website to check if stores in your local area have stock, or call the store directly.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">14 &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/personal-pickup/\">Personal Pickup</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">14\" &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/26/get-macbook-pro-today-apple-store-pickup/\">Forgot to Pre-Order Your MacBook Pro?
