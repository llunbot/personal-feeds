This loop has been created to be inviting to riders on both mountain or gravel bikes, and riders will find that resupply options are relatively frequent along the way. Singletrack alternates and trail networks along the way offer options for riders looking for more technical riding opportunities – loaded or unloaded – and to experience the many unique trail systems built near communities along the way.</p>\n<p>Head to <a href=\"https://www.bikepackingroots.org/northwoodsroute.html\" target=\"_blank\">Bikepacking Roots</a> for the full breakdown of this epic route!</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"d64b8ddcf69d45e8983ace441676a84880d6d2acc09712c4b775a3a26f75f3ab","category":"Cycling"}
