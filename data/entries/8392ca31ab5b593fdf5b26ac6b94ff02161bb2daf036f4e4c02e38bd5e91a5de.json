The bug allowed users to access photos and videos that were meant to disappear after a single viewing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Whatsapp-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" />\r<br />\nThe security flaw, which only impacted iPhone users, allowed anyone to view supposedly ephemeral content by navigating to Settings ➝ Storage and Data ➝ Manage Storage and sorting media by \"Newest.\" This completely bypassed the privacy protection that View Once was designed to provide.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSecurity researcher Ramshath first documented the vulnerability in a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@ramshath1999/how-i-discovered-a-bypass-in-whatsapps-view-once-feature-aea3bdf6405a\">Medium post</a>, prompting WhatsApp to acknowledge the issue and develop a fix. This isn't the first time View Once has faced security challenges – a similar bug was discovered and patched on WhatsApp Web last December.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe latest update also introduces several new features, including the ability to make calls without saving phone numbers first and enhanced group calling capabilities.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGiven the privacy implications, WhatsApp users on iOS should update their app immediately through the App Store to ensure their View Once media remains ephemeral as intended.
