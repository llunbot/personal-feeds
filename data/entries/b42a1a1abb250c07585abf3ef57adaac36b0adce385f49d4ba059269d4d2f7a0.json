There are two motherboards: one with a predictable upgrade from 12th-generation Intel Core CPUs to 13th-generation chips and one that brings AMD's Ryzen laptop processors to the Framework Laptop for the first time.</p>\n\n<p>Framework has also formally renamed its first laptop design; the 13-inch model picks up the \"Framework Laptop 13\" retronym to distinguish it from the new Framework 16 gaming laptop.</p>\n<p>We know a little more about the Intel version of the laptop. There are versions with a 12-core (4 P-cores, 8 E-cores) Core i5-1340P and Core i7-1360P, and a high-end version with a 14-core (6 P-cores, 8 E-cores) Core i7-1370P. These P-series processors were partly responsible for <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/07/review-frameworks-next-gen-laptop-follows-through-on-its-upgradeable-promises/\">the most recent Framework Laptop's mediocre battery life</a>, but the company says the 13th-generation CPUs are more battery-efficient and that it has made further \"firmware optimizations\" to improve runtime. All Intel models continue to use DDR4-3200 memory, so if you upgrade your motherboard, the RAM can be swapped along with the SSD you're using.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1926202#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1926202&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b42a1a1abb250c07585abf3ef57adaac36b0adce385f49d4ba059269d4d2f7a0","category":"Tech"}
