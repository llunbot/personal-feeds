{"title":"How to play audio files in the Terminal","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/194771/105audioterm.html","date":1630826940000,"content":"<div>\n<section><div></div></section><p>If you’re a command line aficionado and you want to play an audio file, there’s no need to leave the Terminal. There are Terminal commands you can use to not just play audio, but to convert files as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll go over the <code>afplay</code>, <code>afinfo</code>, and <code>afconvert</code> audio commands in this article. There’s not much in the way of help available for these new commands; their <code>man</code> pages are pretty much empty. You can get more help for <code>afplay</code> and <code>afconvert</code> by running them with the <code>-h</code> option (type <code>afplay -h</code> or <code>afconvert -h</code> into Terminal). Thankfully, usage of all three commands is relatively straightforward. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Play an audio file</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To play an audio file, type the <code>afplay</code> command followed by the path of file. For example:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>afplay /Users/macworld/Desktop/Opening.aif</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once a song starts, you can stop it by pressing Control-C to terminate the <code>afplay</code> command.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’d like to close the Terminal window after starting a song, you can do so by appending <code>&amp; disown</code> after the path to the audio file. For example:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>afplay /Users/macworld/Desktop/Opening.aif &amp; disown</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, this makes it tougher to stop playback. You have to open a new Terminal window and then type <code>killall afplay</code> to stop the audio.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Get info on an audio file</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The command <code>afinfo</code> works much like <code>afplay</code>—just give it the path to an audio file, and you’ll get a slew of information about that file. For example, in Terminal, I entered:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>afinfo /Users/macworld/Desktop/Opening.aif</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this is what appears in Terminal:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre>File:           /Users/macworld/Desktop/Opening.aif\n File type ID:   AIFF\n Num Tracks:     1\n ----\n Data format:     2 ch,  44100 Hz, 'lpcm' (0x0000000E) 16-bit big-endian signed integer\n                 no channel layout.\n estimated duration: 32.693424 sec\n audio bytes: 5767120\n audio packets: 1441780\n bit rate: 1411200 bits per second\n packet size upper bound: 4\n maximum packet size: 4\n audio data file offset: 54\n not optimized\n source bit depth: I16\n ----\n \n</pre>\n\n\n\n<h2>Covert audio files</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <code>afconvert</code> command is a powerful and complicated one. I won’t even attempt to go into all the details on how it works—because I’m honest enough to admit that I don’t know them all! Read the help file (enter <code>afconvert -h</code> in the Terminal); it provides good detail on how to use this command.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can specify all sorts of options to control the input and output formats. A simple example:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>afconvert -v -f \"mp4f\" -d \"aac@44100\" /System/Library/Sounds/Basso.aiff ~/Desktop/basso_converted.mp4</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That will take the Basso system sound and convert it into an MP4 file (encoded with the AAC encoder at a 44.1kHz sample rate, which is stated in straight hz (44100) in the command). The converted file is saved to the Desktop with the name basso_converted.mp4. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve got a lot of audio files to convert, you can use <code>afconvert</code> to automate the process, though this will take a bit more work with shell scripting (as you need a simple loop to loop through the files).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What you do with these commands is really only limited by your imagination. If you’d rather not fire up the Music app for some simple audio playback, you can use them that way. If you have remote login (ssh) abilities on another machine in your house or business, you can play a song for a housemate or coworker, perhaps as an alarm clock if they’re oversleeping.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While not useful to everyone, perhaps, having tools such as these available for those who need them is one of the reasons macOS appeals to such a diverse audience.</p>\n</div>","author":"Rob Griffiths","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"aa22256413daa22c898cf1ae1b4e56bbd9050993e5e5dedf105e9af7be1bc7ce","category":"Apple"}
