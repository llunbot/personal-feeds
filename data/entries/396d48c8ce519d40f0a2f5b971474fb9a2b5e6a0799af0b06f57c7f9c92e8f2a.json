This \"will make it unmistakably the highest-end model,\" Gurman says. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nHe also highlighted that the ‌iPad Air‌ and ‌iPad Pro‌ will feature slightly different display sizes, just like the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a> and MacBook Pro, where the high-end models have larger screens. The ninth-generation ‌iPad‌ will reportedly be discontinued upon the release of the 11th-generation version, allowing the company to ultimately phase out the first-generation ‌Apple Pencil‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple also plans to use the Magic Keyboard as a differentiator for the ‌iPad Pro‌ in 2024. The redesigned version of the accessory will not be compatible with the ‌iPad Air‌, being exclusive to the ‌iPad Pro‌. The 10.9- and 12.9-inch ‌iPad Air‌ models will only be able to use the current Magic Keyboard accessories. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman said that the new ‌iPad Air‌ and ‌iPad Pro‌ models are due to launch around March 2024, with the updated entry-level ‌iPad‌ and ‌iPad mini‌ set to arrive later in the year.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air </a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad\">iPad (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air\">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini\">iPad Mini (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/what-the-2024-ipad-lineup-could-look-like/\">Here's What the iPad Lineup Could Look Like in 2024</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/heres-what-the-ipad-lineup-could-look-like-in-2024.2413375/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"396d48c8ce519d40f0a2f5b971474fb9a2b5e6a0799af0b06f57c7f9c92e8f2a","category":"Apple"}
