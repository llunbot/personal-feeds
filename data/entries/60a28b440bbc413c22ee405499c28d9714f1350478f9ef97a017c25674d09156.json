But that doesn’t mean all wireless chargers offer the same degree of convenience or functionality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the convenience front, the most obvious “added value” bonus feature to look for is a magnetic connection, such as the one offered by Apple’s own MagSafe standard. A strong and accurate connection means you don’t need to carefully place your phone in the charger’s sweet spot, or worry about the phone slipping off the pad later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For functionality, meanwhile, the discerning iPhone user should be looking for high charging speeds and excellent heat management, since all wireless chargers generate heat. This is a challenge for designers: overheating can cause charging to slow or even stop, so temperature management is key to performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In all of these respects, ESR’s range of Qi2 wireless iPhone and Apple Watch MagSafe chargers are well worth your consideration. Manufactured by a leading MagSafe accessories brand with more than 410,000 five-star reviews on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/C481BD72-9AE2-4927-B290-BC543AD7B0DA?maas=maas_adg_DA5DCD41115FB88482B66DF1BDA3D8D7_afap_abs&amp;ref_=aa_maas&amp;tag=maas\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, they’re dependable, quality products. And the company’s <strong>CryoBoost™</strong> cooling technology keeps heat (and noise) to a minimum to ensure ultra-fast charging.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s so special about CryoBoost?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all wireless chargers are created equal, and the same is true of the cooling systems they use. Many companies use fans to air-cool the wireless charger itself, relying on heat transfer from the hot phone to the cooler charger. But this is a mistake. If there’s a difference in temperature between phone and charger, as is the case with conventional fan setups, condensation can form and cause damage to both devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CryoBoost deploys its sophisticated heat-dissipating componentry–including patented parabolic ducts and specialized fans designed to suit the charger’s shape and structure–in a way that’s both safer and more efficient. By directing a smooth airflow on to the back of your phone, it avoids the problem of condensation while keeping temperatures low and charging speeds high. ESR’s testing indicates that an iPhone charging with a CryoBoost accessory stays 5.5°C cooler than one using a charger from a rival brand.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>CryoBoost: The next generation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>ESR has continued to refine CryoBoost since the technology launched in 2022. Its latest evolution features a modified duct design: the new open layout cools even more effectively and keeps noise below 25 decibels, which is quieter than a nearby whisper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company’s new second-gen CryoBoost products, certified with the Qi2 standard and compatible with every Apple smartphone from the iPhone 12 to this year’s iPhone 16, debut in September at the IFA 2024 tech event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For versatility, consider the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D7YXQ77M?maas=maas_adg_386518CB1F9952D1C56BECF2E1B09784_afap_abs&amp;ref_=aa_maas&amp;tag=maas\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>3-in-1 MagSafe Charger with Qi2 and CryoBoost</strong></a>.
