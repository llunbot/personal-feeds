Until recently, Microsoft had also said that users running the Microsoft Office apps on Windows 10 would also lose support on that date, whether they were using the continually updated Microsoft 365 versions of those apps or the buy-once-own-forever versions included in Office 2021 or Office 2024.</p>\n<p>Microsoft has recently tweaked this policy, however (as <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/665599/microsoft-365-office-apps-windows-10-end-of-support-extension-2028\">seen by The Verge</a>). Now, Windows 10 users of the Microsoft 365 apps will still be <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/what-windows-end-of-support-means-for-office-and-microsoft-365-34e28be4-1e4f-4928-b210-3f45d8215595#ID0EBH=Microsoft_365&amp;id0ebh=microsoft_365\">eligible to receive software updates and support through October of 2028</a>, \"in the interest of maintaining your security while you upgrade to Windows 11.\" Microsoft is taking a similar approach to Windows Defender malware definitions, which will be offered to Windows 10 users \"<a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2024/10/31/how-to-prepare-for-windows-10-end-of-support-by-moving-to-windows-11-today/\">through at least October 2028</a>.\"</p>\n<p>The policy is a change from a few months ago, when Microsoft insisted that Office apps running on Windows 10 would become officially unsupported on October 14. The perpetually licensed versions of Office will be supported in accordance with Microsoft's \"Fixed Lifecycle Policy,\" which guarantees support and security updates for a fixed number of years after a software product's initial release. For Office 2021, this means Windows 10 users will get support through October of 2026; for Office 2024, this should extend to October of 2029.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/microsoft-extends-office-support-on-windows-10-through-2028/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/microsoft-extends-office-support-on-windows-10-through-2028/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"eb9e8b42a46e7b745bbe772be9a089367a743cf620ca58d100033a3fe3bb9060","category":"Tech"}
