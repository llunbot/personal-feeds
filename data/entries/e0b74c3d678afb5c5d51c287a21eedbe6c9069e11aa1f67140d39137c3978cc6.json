{"title":"‘On Tyranny’ by Timothy Snyder","link":"https://timothysnyder.org/on-tyranny/","date":1742841764000,"content":"\n<p>I read Timothy Snyder’s <em>On Tyranny</em> after the election. A collection of 20 essays — each relatively brief, some exceptionally brief — it’s more booklet than book, and can easily be consumed in an afternoon or a few evenings. I finished it with an unsettled feeling. I read it again last week, and my feeling now is both more unsettled and more resolute.</p>\n\n<p>Snyder, a plain-speaking history professor at Yale, has a core message, <a href=\"https://snyder.substack.com/p/obeying-in-advance\">which he’s been hammering</a> since <em>before</em> Trump’s re-election: <em>Do not obey in advance. Resist.</em> The following passage hit me harder on this second reading, two months into Trump 2.0, than it did in November. From Chapter 19: “Be a Patriot”:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is not patriotic to admire foreign dictators. It is not\npatriotic to cultivate a relationship with Kim Jong Un; or to say\nthat Bashar al-Assad and Vladimir Putin are superior leaders. It\nis not patriotic to call upon foreign leaders to intervene in\nAmerican presidential elections. It is not patriotic to cite\nRussian propaganda at rallies. It is not patriotic to share an\nadviser with Russian oligarchs. It is not patriotic to appoint\nadvisers with financial interests in Russian companies. It is not\npatriotic to appoint a National Security Advisor who likes to be\ncalled “General Misha,” nor to pardon him for his crimes. It is\nnot patriotic when that pardoned official calls for martial law.\nIt is not patriotic to refer to American soldiers as “losers” and\n“suckers.” It is not patriotic to take health care from families,\nnor to golf your way through a national epidemic in which half a\nmillion Americans die. It is not patriotic to try to sabotage an\nAmerican election, nor to claim victory after defeat. It is not\npatriotic to try to end democracy.</p>\n\n<p>A nationalist might do all these things, but a nationalist is not\na patriot. A nationalist encourages us to be our worst, and then\ntells us that we are the best. A nationalist, “although endlessly\nbrooding on power, victory, defeat, revenge,” wrote Orwell, tends\nto be “uninterested in what happens in the real world.”\nNationalism is relativist, since the only truth is the resentment\nwe feel when we contemplate others. As the novelist Danilo Kiš put\nit, nationalism “has no universal values, aesthetic or ethical.”</p>\n\n<p>A patriot, by contrast, wants the nation to live up to its ideals,\nwhich means asking us to be our best selves. A patriot must be\nconcerned with the real world, which is the only place where his\ncountry can be loved and sustained. A patriot has universal\nvalues, standards by which he judges his nation, always wishing it\nwell — and wishing that it would do better.</p>\n\n<p>Democracy failed in Europe in the 1920s, ’30s, and ’40s, and it is\nfailing not only in much of Europe but in many parts of the world\ntoday. It is that history and experience that reveals to us the\ndark range of our possible futures. A nationalist will say that\n“it can’t happen here,” which is the first step toward disaster. A\npatriot says that it could happen here, but that we will stop it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I highly recommend the book.
