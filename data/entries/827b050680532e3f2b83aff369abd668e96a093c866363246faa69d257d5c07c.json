So they typically take 8 working days in production before sending them anywhere around the world. Nimbl then offers the shoes in whole EU sizes from 39 and half sizes from 41-47. And they craft the Urano on a wider than average last. Like many of Nimbl’s shoes, the Urano comes only in white with an exposed carbon structure, but the new gravel shoes do feature an all-new extra durable upper. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Nimbl-Urano-carbon-gravel-bike-shoes_riding-side-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Nimbl-Urano-carbon-gravel-bike-shoes_riding-side-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Nimbl Urano carbon gravel bike shoes, riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Nimbl-Urano-carbon-gravel-bike-shoes_riding-side-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Nimbl-Urano-carbon-gravel-bike-shoes_riding-side-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Nimbl-Urano-carbon-gravel-bike-shoes_riding-side-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Nimbl-Urano-carbon-gravel-bike-shoes_riding-side-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Nimbl-Urano-carbon-gravel-bike-shoes_riding-side-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Nimbl-Urano-carbon-gravel-bike-shoes_riding-side-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://nimbl.cc\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Nimbl.cc</em></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/nimbl-urano-handmade-carbon-gravel-bike-shoes-deliver-ultimate-performance/\">Nimbl Urano Handmade Carbon Gravel Bike Shoes Deliver Ultimate Performance</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"827b050680532e3f2b83aff369abd668e96a093c866363246faa69d257d5c07c","category":"Cycling"}
