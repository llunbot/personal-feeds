We \nstrongly disagree with the USITC decision and resulting orders. </p>\n\n<p>Pending the appeal, Apple is taking steps to comply with the \nruling while ensuring customers have access to Apple Watch with \nlimited disruption. These steps include introducing a version of \nApple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 in the United States \nwithout the Blood Oxygen feature.
