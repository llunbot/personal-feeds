Still, anyone upgrading from a machine several generations old should see significant speed improvements in a variety of day-to-day tasks. For a look at our early impressions of the new MacBook Air, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/12/m4-macbook-air-hands-on/\">be sure to check out our hands-on video</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Video Shows iPhone 17 Mockups Based on 'Internal Documents'</h2>\r<br />\nRumors about the designs for the iPhone 17 family continue to firm up, with a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/video-shows-iphone-17-mockups-internal-documents/\">new set of mockups once again showing off the expected designs</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/iphone-17-mockups-idevicehelp.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nWhile the standard iPhone 17 is expected to retain a very similar design to the iPhone 16, the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max are expected to see a significant redesign with a much larger camera bump spanning the entire upper rear portion of the devices. The all-new ultra-thin \"iPhone 17 Air\" should see a similar but slimmer bump given it only has one rear camera compared to three on the Pro models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Upgrades CarPlay in Two Ways</h2>\r<br />\nThe upcoming iOS 18.4 update will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/12/ios-18-4-upgrades-carplay-in-two-ways/\">include two enhancements that will benefit some CarPlay users</a>: a third row of app icons on certain larger infotainment displays and new EV routing to help Ford Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning owners find charging stations that use the North American Charging Standard (NACS).\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/ios-18-4-carplay.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nOn a related front, iOS 18.4 will allow users in the European Union to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/12/ios-18-4-new-setting/\">set their own default navigation app</a> such as Google Maps. The change, made in response to the EU's Digital Markets Act, will be a welcome one for users who prefer not to rely on Apple Maps for navigation.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Introduced Its Most Controversial MacBook 10 Years Ago This Week</h2>\r<br />\nApple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/09/12-inch-macbook-introduced-10-years-ago/\">announced the infamous 12-inch Retina MacBook a decade ago this week</a>, an experimental new Mac that was as controversial as it was revolutionary.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/2016-12-inch-macbook-feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nIntroduced by Apple CEO Tim Cook at Apple's \"Spring Forward\" event on March 9, 2015, as a \"reinvention\" of the notebook, the MacBook was extremely controversial due to its under-powered performance, single USB-C port for both charging and data transfer, short battery life, unreliable butterfly keyboard, and high price point ($1,299 starting price in 2015â€”the same as a MacBook Pro at the time).\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHowever, the 12-inch MacBook offered a glimpse at what was to come in the Mac lineup. It was the first Apple device with a USB-C port, terraced battery, butterfly keyboard, and haptic trackpad. It was also the first MacBook with a design focused on efficiency, a Retina display in a non-Pro model, multiple color options, and without a fan or an illuminated Apple logo.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>MacRumors Newsletter</h3>\r<br />\nEach week, we publish an email newsletter like this highlighting the top Apple stories, making it a great way to get a bite-sized recap of the week hitting all of the major topics we've covered and tying together related stories for a big-picture view.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSo if you want to have <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/macrumors/mar-13-2025\">top stories</a> like the above recap delivered to your email inbox each week, <b><a href=\"http://eepurl.com/OHdUX\">subscribe to our newsletter</a></b>!<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/top-stories/\">Top Stories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/15/top-stories-apple-intelligence-siri-delay/\">Top Stories: Apple Intelligence Siri Delay Sparks Concern, iOS 19 Redesign, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/top-stories-apple-intelligence-siri-delay-sparks-concern-ios-19-redesign-and-more.2453174/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"MacRumors Staff","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d6989fa1a0912be3cefe91df86831de1d00d3cace60a90a10282ea5ccb4313a5","category":"Apple"}
