This will enable a thinner panel, narrower bezels, and longer product lifespan.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe claim seemingly comes in contrast to a report from display analyst Ross Young, who yesterday said that Apple had <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/10/apple-27-inch-mini-led-display-cancelled/\">\"killed off\" the display</a> \"for now,\" despite shipping some display panels designed for the monitor last year. Young initially expected the monitor to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/05/20/apple-27-inch-mini-led-display-october-rumor/\">launch in 2022</a>, before shifting to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/06/apple-mini-led-display-q1-2023/\">first quarter of 2023</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/displays/\">Apple Pro Display XDR</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/studio-display/\">Apple Studio Display</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-accessories.77\">Mac Accessories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/11/kuo-apple-27-inch-mini-led-display-still-planned/\">Kuo: Apple 27-Inch Mini-LED External Display Still Planned, Mass Production Slated for 2024 to 2025</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-apple-27-inch-mini-led-external-display-still-planned-mass-production-slated-for-2024-to-2025.2386506/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"55ccf6dcbfe6035a49ef53215ea2326fb4f45d28b8827eb0df74d0d0602ccb68","category":"Apple"}
