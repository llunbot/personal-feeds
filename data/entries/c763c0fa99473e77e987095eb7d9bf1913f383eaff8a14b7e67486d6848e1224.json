Since founding in 2005, WBR has distributed more than 800,000 bicycles across 21 countries while training more than 3,000 mechanics to help keep them running. These are more than just bicycles though, they represent access to education, healthcare, and economic opportunities that rural communities would not have otherwise. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AK2-Freewheel-scaled.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1536\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AK2-Freewheel-1536x1536.jpg\" alt=\"WBR Buffalo Bike Utility S2 AK-2 freewheel\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AK2-Freewheel-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AK2-Freewheel-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AK2-Freewheel-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AK2-Freewheel-768x768.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AK2-Freewheel-2048x2048.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Buffalo-Bike-S2-utility-two-speed-3-scaled.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1025\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Buffalo-Bike-S2-utility-two-speed-3-1536x1025.jpg\" alt=\"WBR Buffalo Bike Utility S2two chain drive\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Buffalo-Bike-S2-utility-two-speed-3-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Buffalo-Bike-S2-utility-two-speed-3-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Buffalo-Bike-S2-utility-two-speed-3-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Buffalo-Bike-S2-utility-two-speed-3-768x513.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Buffalo-Bike-S2-utility-two-speed-3-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Buffalo-Bike-S2-utility-two-speed-3-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Buffalo-Bike-S2-utility-two-speed-3-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Buffalo-Utility-S2-2-Chain-Drivetrain.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Buffalo-Utility-S2-2-Chain-Drivetrain-1536x534.png\" alt=\"WBR Buffalo Bike Utility S2 two chain drive\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Buffalo-Utility-S2-2-Chain-Drivetrain-1536x534.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Buffalo-Utility-S2-2-Chain-Drivetrain-297x103.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Buffalo-Utility-S2-2-Chain-Drivetrain-120x42.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Buffalo-Utility-S2-2-Chain-Drivetrain-768x267.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Buffalo-Utility-S2-2-Chain-Drivetrain-2048x712.png 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Working along with many product testers over the years, WBR is introducing the next generation of the Buffalo bike, the Utility S2, designed in conjunction with SRAM, Trek, Giant, and Karasawa. Notably, this bike has a two-speed, two-chain drivetrain that allows riders to shift gears with a simple backpedal. This is not the first bike with the ability to change gears by backpedaling, but it is the first with essentially two completely separate single-speed drivetrains, only connected by the freewheel. The crankset features a 45/27t chainring setup, while the freewheel features a 19/18t combination for 45/19 and 27/18t gearing. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Buffalo-Bike-Utility-S2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1334\" height=\"716\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Buffalo-Bike-Utility-S2.png\" alt=\"WBR Buffalo Bike Utility S2 details\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Buffalo-Bike-Utility-S2.png 1334w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Buffalo-Bike-Utility-S2-297x159.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Buffalo-Bike-Utility-S2-120x64.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Buffalo-Bike-Utility-S2-768x412.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few benefits to this design including outright durability, and the ability to have two drastically different gear ratios which is very helpful for riders using the bike to carry heavy cargo. The drivetrain is reliant on the new AK-2 freewheel, which is “WBR’s first-ever patented innovation.” Compared to the previous Buffalo bike which used a coaster brake hub, the move to a freewheel allows for the use of caliper rim brakes, and heavy-duty box section aluminum rims with 3x lacing to create strong, but light wheels. Additionally, the standard freewheel interface makes the replacement of the AK-2 a cinch, and the unique dual chain arrangement means the rider can continue to their destination, even if they break one of the chains. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Buffalo-Bike-Utility-S2-prototype-in-use-2-scaled.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1025\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Buffalo-Bike-Utility-S2-prototype-in-use-2-1536x1025.jpg\" alt=\"WBR Buffalo Utility S2 prototype in use\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Buffalo-Bike-Utility-S2-prototype-in-use-2-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Buffalo-Bike-Utility-S2-prototype-in-use-2-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Buffalo-Bike-Utility-S2-prototype-in-use-2-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Buffalo-Bike-Utility-S2-prototype-in-use-2-768x513.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Buffalo-Bike-Utility-S2-prototype-in-use-2-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Buffalo-Bike-Utility-S2-prototype-in-use-2-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Buffalo-Bike-Utility-S2-prototype-in-use-2-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can help WBR reach their goal of providing one million bikes globally by donating at the link below. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://worldbicyclerelief.org/s2/\" target=\"_blank\">worldbicyclerelief.org</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/the-new-wbr-buffalo-bike-is-first-with-two-chain-two-speed-drivetrain/\">The New WBR Buffalo Bike is First with Two Chain, Two Speed Drivetrain</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"c763c0fa99473e77e987095eb7d9bf1913f383eaff8a14b7e67486d6848e1224","category":"Cycling"}
