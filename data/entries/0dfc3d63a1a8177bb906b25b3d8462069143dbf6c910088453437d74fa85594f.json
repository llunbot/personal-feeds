Perhaps more than any event—barring the origin of life itself—this merger radically changed the course of evolution on our planet.</p>\n<p>One cell ended up inside the other and evolved into a structure that schoolkids learn to refer to as the “powerhouse of the cell”: the mitochondrion. This new structure provided a tremendous energetic advantage to its host—a precondition for the later evolution of complex, multicellular life.</p>\n<p>But that’s only part of the story. The <a href=\"https://knowablemagazine.org/article/mind/2021/could-mitochondria-be-key-healthy-brain\" target=\"_blank\">mitochondrion</a> is not the only important structure within complex, eukaryotic cells. There’s the membrane-bound nucleus, safekeeper of the <a href=\"https://knowablemagazine.org/article/living-world/2020/the-blueprint-life-neatly-folded\" target=\"_blank\">genome</a>. There’s a whole system of internal membranes: the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, peroxisomes and vacuoles—essential for making, transporting, and recycling proteins and other cargo in and around the cell.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1979428#p3\">Read 42 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1979428&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Knowable Magazine","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0dfc3d63a1a8177bb906b25b3d8462069143dbf6c910088453437d74fa85594f","category":"Tech"}
