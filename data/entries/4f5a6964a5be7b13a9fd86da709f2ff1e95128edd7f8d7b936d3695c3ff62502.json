{"title":"AWS IoT SiteWise Edge Is Now Generally Available for Processing Industrial Equipment Data on Premises","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-iot-sitewise-edge-is-now-generally-available-for-processing-industrial-equipment-data-on-premises/","date":1627583071000,"content":"<p>At AWS re:Invent 2020, we <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/iot/introducing-aws-iot-sitewise-edge/\">announced the preview of AWS IoT SiteWise Edge</a>, a new feature of <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-iot-sitewise-now-generally-available/\">AWS IoT SiteWise</a> that provides software that runs on premises at industrial sites and makes it easy to collect, process, and monitor equipment data locally before sending the data to AWS Cloud destinations. AWS IoT SiteWise Edge software can be installed on local hardware such as third-party industrial gateways and computers, or on <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/outposts\">AWS Outposts</a> and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/snow/\">AWS Snow Family</a> compute devices. It uses <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/greengrass\">AWS IoT Greengrass</a>, an edge runtime that helps build, deploy, and manage applications.</p> \n<p>With AWS IoT SiteWise Edge, you can organize and process your equipment data in the on-premises SiteWise gateway using AWS IoT SiteWise asset models. You can then read the equipment data locally from the gateway using the same application programming interfaces (APIs) that you use with AWS IoT SiteWise in the cloud. For example, you can <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot-sitewise/latest/userguide/calculate-oee.html\">compute metrics such as Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE)</a> locally for use in a production-line monitoring dashboard on the factory floor.</p> \n<p>You can use AWS IoT SiteWise Edge for these use cases to quickly assess and demonstrate the value of industrial IoT to your organization:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><u>Localized testing </u><u>of products</u>: The testing of automotive, electronics, or aerospace products might generate thousands of data points per second from multiple sensors embedded in the product and the testing equipment. You can process data locally in the gateway for near-real-time dashboards and store just the results in the cloud to optimize your bandwidth and storage costs.</li> \n <li><u>Lean manufacturing in the smart factory</u>: You can compute key performance metrics such as OEE, Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF), and Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) in the gateway and monitor local dashboards that must continue to work even if the connection of the factory to the cloud is temporarily interrupted. This ensures that factory staff can identify and identify the root cause of every bottleneck as soon as it arises.</li> \n <li><u>Improving product quality</u>: Your local applications can read equipment and sensor data from AWS IoT SiteWise Edge on the gateway as it is collected, and combine it with data from other sources like enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems and manufacturing execution systems to help catch defect-causing conditions. The data can be further processed through machine learning models to identify anomalies that are used to trigger alerts for staff on the factory floor.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>To securely connect and read sensor data from historian databases or directly from equipment, AWS IoT SiteWise Edge supports three common industrial protocols: OPC-UA (Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture), Modbus TCP, and EtherNet/IP.</p> \n<p>After data is collected by the gateway, you can filter, transform, and aggregate the data locally using asset models defined in the cloud. You can also run <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/lambda\">AWS Lambda</a> functions locally on the gateway to customize how the data is processed. You can keep sensitive data on premises to help comply with data residency requirements, and you can send data to AWS IoT SiteWise or other AWS services in the cloud, such as <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/s3\">Amazon S3</a> and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/timestream/\">Amazon Timestream</a>, for long term storage and further analysis.</p> \n<p>At GA, we added new features and made improvements based on customer feedback during the preview:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Easy setup with Edge </strong><strong>Gateway Installer</strong>: You can obtain an edge device installer from the AWS IoT SiteWise console and run it on your industrial gateway to install AWS IoT SiteWise Edge software and all prerequisites, including the AWS IoT Greengrass v2 runtime, Docker, Python, and Java.</li> \n <li><strong>Support for </strong><strong>AWS IoT Greengrass v2</strong>: The OPC-UA data collection and data processing pack will be supported on AWS IoT Greengrass version 2.</li> \n <li><strong>Integration </strong><strong>with LDAP/Active Directory</strong>: Edge gateway now integrates with LDAP servers or a local user pool to authenticate users at the edge. These users will use their corporate or Linux credentials to authenticate themselves on OpsHub or monitor portals at the edge.</li> \n</ul> \n<p><strong><u>AWS IoT SiteWise Edge – Getting Started</u></strong><br /> To get started with AWS IoT SiteWise Edge, complete the following steps to create a gateway that connects to data servers to deliver your industrial data streams to the AWS Cloud:</p> \n<ol> \n <li>Create a gateway and an get edge installer.</li> \n <li>Install edge software onto your industrial gateway.</li> \n <li>Configure your edge gateway from the cloud.</li> \n <li>Configure your monitoring applications at the edge and in the cloud.</li> \n</ol> \n<p>To create your gateway, from the left navigation pane of the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/iotsitewise/home#/models\">AWS IoT SiteWise console</a>, expand <strong>Edge</strong>, and choose <strong>Gateways</strong>.
