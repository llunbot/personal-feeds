YouTube Music is launching an app for Wear OS.</p>\n<p>Google <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/10/rip-google-play-music-2011-2020/\">killed Google Music</a> last year in favor of YouTube Music, even though the latter wasn't nearly ready. While Google released an Apple Watch YouTube Music app before Google Music was shut down, one of the many regressions from the service switch was that Google Music supported Wear OS and YouTube Music did not. Now, after 10 months of Google smartwatch downtime, Google's music service is coming back to Wear OS.</p>\n<p>The really bad news is that the app is exclusive to Wear OS 3, which is currently exclusive to Samsung's new <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/08/samsung-announces-new-galaxy-watch-4-drops-ios-support/\">Galaxy Watch 4</a>. (The app is \"out now\" only because it is shipping preinstalled on the Galaxy Watch 4.) <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/07/googles-wear-os-3-update-plans-will-leave-most-existing-devices-behind/\">Almost no</a> Wear OS 2 watches will be upgraded to Wear OS 3, so unless you have a Mobvoi Snapdragon Wear 4100 watch, you'll need to go shopping at Samsung.com for some new hardware.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1789963#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1789963&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d7e377657294f0051fcefd4150741851564287bb120a7b0efd0dd9b9cd7723bd","category":"Tech"}
