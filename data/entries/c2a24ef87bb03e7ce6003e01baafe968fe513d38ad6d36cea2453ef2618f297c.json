The most serious of them, tracked as CVE-2023-36934, allows an unauthenticated attacker to gain unauthorized access to the application database. It stems from a security flaw that allows for SQL injection, one of the oldest and most common exploit classes.</p>\n<p>The vulnerability contains the same elements—and, likely, the same potentially devastating consequences—as one that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/06/mass-exploitation-of-critical-moveit-flaw-is-ransacking-orgs-big-and-small/\">came to light</a> in late May when members of the Clop ransomware crime syndicate began mass-exploiting it on vulnerable networks around the world. To date, the Clop offensive has hit 229 organizations and spilled data affecting more than 17 million people, <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/@brett/110674071369477243\">according to</a> statistics tracked by Brett Callow, an analyst with security firm Emsisoft. Casualties include <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/06/millions-of-americans-personal-dmv-data-exposed-in-massive-moveit-hack/\">Louisiana and Oregon DMVs</a>, the New York City Department of Education, and energy companies Schneider Electric and Siemens Electric.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1952233#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1952233&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c2a24ef87bb03e7ce6003e01baafe968fe513d38ad6d36cea2453ef2618f297c","category":"Tech"}
