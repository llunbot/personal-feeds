But as a modern Internet-connected laptop, its chunky design and (especially) its super-slow processor let it down.</p>\n\n<p>MNT Research has been upgrading the Reform laptop and its smaller counterpart, the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/03/all-open-source-7-inch-mnt-reform-laptop-starts-at-899-ships-in-october/\">Pocket Reform</a>, continuously since we took a look at it two-and-a-half years ago. The most significant upgrade is probably <a href=\"https://shop.mntre.com/products/mnt-reform-rcore-rk3588-processor-module\">the Rockchip RK3588 processor upgrade</a>, which offers four ARM Cortex-A76 CPU cores (the same ones used in the Raspberry Pi 5's Broadcom SoC) and four ARM Cortex-A55 cores, plus either 16GB or 32GB of RAM. While still not a high-end speed demon, these specs are enough to make it a competent workhorse laptop for browsing and productivity apps.</p>\n<p>Now, MNT is revisiting the Reform with a more significant design update. The <a href=\"https://mntre.com/media/reform_md/2024-09-09-introducing-mnt-reform-next.html\">MNT Reform Next</a> is smaller and thinner, defaults to a more traditional glass trackpad instead of a trackball, and is starting with the Rockchip RK3588 instead of the poky NXP/Freescale processor that the original laptop was saddled with.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048810#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048810&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7e91fb926245e00ffd61a0a1e6ab5cb478ad432b1bec6a841b9b6617327add8f","category":"Tech"}
