{"title":"A Visit To The Nutmeg Country Cycling Museum Part 2: Troy and Jen’s Stable of Bikes – Spencer Harding","link":"https://theradavist.com/nutmeg-country-cycling-museum-bikes/","date":1738843232000,"content":"<p><em>Today we have part two of Spencer’s journey to <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/tag/nutmeg-country/\" target=\"_blank\">Nutmeg Country</a>. <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/nutmeg-country-cycling-museum/\" target=\"_blank\">Yesterday we saw Troy’s “studio”</a> and today we see the artwork: his and Jen’s stable of amazing bikes. Let’s dive into this treasure trove of cycling builds…</em></p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<p>Troy has his own style of builds that pull influence from all over the cycling sphere. Equal parts Rivendell cult, classic MTB, randonneur, and sci-fi nerd. You’ll see many tropes such as XTR 950 derailleurs, Oury grips over cloth tape, dynamo lights all around, and homages to Nutmeg Country abound. Now we’re sniffing some saddles, so pick your jaw up off the floor and let’s get to it!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-1.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Litespeed Obed Drop Bar MTB</h3>\n<p>Troy’s current love affair is his latest Litespeed drop bar conversion. Rasta cables and housing, beautiful Grand Compe levers, Topline cranks, Pacenti rims, and plenty of XTR bits keep this bike so light. Paul Moto Lites allowed for a 26″ to 650b conversion to round out this deep custom build.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-18.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-18.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-18.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-18.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Bridgestone MB-Zip</h3>\n<p>Any good Rivendell connoisseur must have a Grant Peterson-era Bridgestone <em>in addition</em> to a few Rivendell bikes. There was another MB-0 hanging from the rafters of Troy’s shed unfortunately with a destroyed downtube. This fine specimen is still kicking as a beautifully executed singlespeed build.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-33.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-33.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-33.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-33.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Caterpillar P500 Power Loader</h3>\n<p>You may have noticed a plethora of Alien memorabilia in Troy’s shed yesterday. He obviously couldn’t resist making his Clydesdale fork conversion into a Power Loader homage. Yellow brake calipers might be tacky on any other build, but in this case, you gotta go hard.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-47.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-47.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-47.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-47.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Crust Nor’Easter</h3>\n<p>The second pro model to represent Nutmeg Country is the Crust Nor’Easter. As an homage to the storms that rock the area and the area’s nautical history. Troy designed the art for the headbadge on the Nor’Easter so you know he had to have one with his own signature touch, keeping 26″ alive with some properly plump plus tires.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-60.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-60.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-60.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-60.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Crust Alumalith</h3>\n<p>Troy’s take on Ronny’s first made in Vermont aluminum frame is a doozy. With a classic DEAN stem, gold ano bits throughout, Red Mars, Paul everywhere, and to cap it all off a Brooks Finesse on a Fox Transfer (Kashima, of course). I was so surprised with the light weight of this build, all said and done.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-74.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-74.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-74.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-74.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Rivendell Hunqapillar</h3>\n<p>The venerable and mythical Hunqapillar. First we take a look at Troy’s Hunq and later we’ll see Jen’s. A smattering of XTR, classic Ritchey, and of course a Salsa quill stem – this Rivendell is a <em>tres classique</em> ATB ready for the hills of Connecticut.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-91.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-91.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-91.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-91.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>JP Weigle Special</h3>\n<p>Having JP Weigle as a local framebuilder must be such a treat. This Weigle “Special” is full Campy (as it should be), laced with a set of Vittoria tires since Ultradynamico doesn’t make a tire small enough to fit in such a svelte frame. Just take in those sweet traditional lines and exquisite lugs.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-104.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-104.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-104.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-104.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Rivendell Hunqapillar</h3>\n<p>This is Jen’s Hunqapillar. While Troy and Jen can swap between bikes, they obviously both needed their own Hunqs. Equipped with 3×9 for proper touring, an OG Pec Deck supporting a  Fab’s Chest and dynamo light, and of course, an XTR 950 derailleur.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-116.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-116.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-116.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-116.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Bianchi Veloce</h3>\n<p>Jen’s Bianchi Veloce is a vintage all-road masterpiece, clearing 33s and equipped with a dynamo light for those late days in the saddle. With a full Campy build except for the Deore XT rear derailleur, the build is classy but still a proper hodge podge.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-126.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-126.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-126.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-126.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Crust Evasion</h3>\n<p>I’m pretty sure this is an Evasion prototype as the fork seems a bit different than the normal model. The iridescent paint job is truly spectacular as well.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-134.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-134.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-134.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-134.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>JP Weigle MTB</h3>\n<p>Rounding out our journey through Troy and Jen’s stable is this beautiful JP Wiegle MTB. Elegantly comfortable with a plethora of snazzy parts, from the Rene Herse triple cranks to the Shimano 600 arabesque headset.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-149.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-149.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-149.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Nutmeg_Country_Museum_Bikes-149.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Thanks to Troy and Ballz for sharing the stash with us!</p>\n<p><em>You might need a wet wipe to sop up the drool on your keyboard after experiencing that deep catalog of Northeastern beauties.
