Here, the two lines join back up.</p>\n<p>Finally, in the last 20 per cent of its travel, the new Vivid has hydraulic bottom-out adjustment.</p>\n<p>This increases compression damping in the last portion of its travel, helping the shock resist bottom outs.</p>\n<p>RockShox claims these three phases of damping work seamlessly from one to the next, with no perceptible steps in damper feel.</p>\n<h2>What are the on-trail benefits of the RockShox Vivid?</h2>\n<p>How does TouchDown benefit the rider when your bike is sitting at its sag point (which is usually 30 per cent into its travel) if it only works in the first 10 per cent of the shock’s stroke?</p>\n<p>If your <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/the-ultimate-guide-to-mountain-bike-rear-suspension-systems/\">rear suspension</a> never extends beyond its sagged position, TouchDown is unlikely to provide any benefits.</p>\n<p>However, in reality there are plenty of scenarios when the rear suspension extends to full travel, such as when the rear wheel lifts off the ground between bumps.</p>\n<p>It’s in these instances – which are going to be plentiful on the trail – that TouchDown should make the rear suspension feel smoother.</p>\n<h2>Vivid’s DebonAir linear air spring provides coil-like performance</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"RockShox Vivid Ultimate mountain bike rear shock\" title=\"RockShox Vivid Ultimate mountain bike rear shock-1\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Vivid Ultimate has a high-volume air spring.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Complementing the new damper tech is an up-sized DebonAir air spring.</p>\n<p>By increasing its air volume, RockShox has created a more linear spring rate, closely reflecting the linear rate of progression seen in coil springs.</p>\n<p>Thanks to the air-spring design, bottom-out adjustability is retained; installing more volume-reducer spacers will increase the forces required to compress the shock at the end of its travel.</p>\n<p>In the below graph, the grey dotted line represents a coil spring, while the coloured lines are the new Vivid air with different numbers of volume-reducer spacers.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"RockShox Vivid DebonAir spring forces\" title=\"RockShox Vivid DebonAir spring forces\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Vivid’s air spring performs similarly to a coil spring.</span></figcaption><span> <i>RockShox</i></span></div>\n<p>Note how close the coloured lines are to the dotted one, until the shock gets close to bottom out, where they slope upwards.</p>\n<p>RockShox has also moved the positive and negative spring chamber equalisation port deeper into the shock’s stroke.</p>\n<p>The negative spring’s job is to ‘suck’ the shock into its travel, encouraging it to compress more easily.</p>\n<p>The Vivid’s port location means the negative spring pressure is going to be higher compared to designs with the port higher in the shock’s stroke.</p>\n<p>This should help the shock compress into its travel more readily because the pressure in the negative chamber is going to be higher than the positive one at full travel, and until the equalisation port is opened.</p>\n<h2>Extended service intervals</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"RockShox Vivid Ultimate mountain bike rear shock\" title=\"RockShox Vivid Ultimate mountain bike rear shock-7\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The RC2T damper has a climb or threshold lever to firm up the shock.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Thanks to a new wiper seal design, higher oil volumes and Maxima’s Plush Dynamic Suspension Lube – that’s now used in all of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/rockshox-suspension-fork-guide/\">RockShox’s forks and shocks</a> – the brand quotes a 100-hour service interval. This is double the 50-hour timeframe on the Super Deluxe shocks.</p>\n<h2>Ultimate-level upgrades</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"RockShox Vivid Ultimate mountain bike rear shock\" title=\"RockShox Vivid Ultimate mountain bike rear shock-4\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Ultimate-level reservoir can be bought as an aftermarket upgrade.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Select+, Select and Vivid models all feature adjustable hydraulic bottom out, but can be upgraded with the Ultimate-level reservoir to increase adjustability.</p>\n<p>Adding low- and high-speed compression adjustment, the bolt-on reservoir upgrade costs £220/$230/€245.</p>\n<p>While RockShox supplies a host of instructions on how to do this upgrade yourself on the brand’s website, doing so requires a full rebuild, including setting the internal floating piston’s position and bleeding the damper. Only experienced mechanics should take this job on.</p>\n<p>Also upgradeable are Vivid’s eyelet bushings, which can be replaced with bearing hardware to help reduce friction further.</p>\n<p>This upgrade is only compatible with 8x30mm hardware, so not all bikes will benefit. It costs £29/$30/€32.</p>\n<h2>RockShox Vivid Ultimate initial ride impressions</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"RockShox Vivid Ultimate mountain bike rear shock fitted to a Marin Alpine Trail XR enduro mountain bike ridden by Alex Evans on a trail called Angry Sheep in Scotland's Tweed Valley.\" title=\"RockShox Vivid Ultimate mountain bike rear shock-9\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Alex tested the Vivid Ultimate on his Marin Alpine Trail XR.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p><em>Senior technical editor Alex Evans rode the new RockShox Vivid fitted to his trusty Marin Alpine Trail XR enduro bike on his home trails in Scotland’s Tweed Valley for a few weeks prior to the launch. His initial ride impressions are below.</em></p>\n<p>The metric-sized trunnion-mounted 205x65mm Vivid tipped my scales at 691g, heavier than <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/rear-shocks/fox-float-x2-factory-2pos-adjust-2022-review/\">Fox’s Float X2 Factory</a> (trunnion, 205x65mm), which weighed 664g.</p>\n<p>The Vivid RockShox supplied came fitted with a linear R55 rebound tune and a C30 compression tune, along with two volume-reducer spacers pre-installed. This tune, according to RockShox, is suited to the Alpine Trail XR.</p>\n<p>Setup was relatively straightforward. For my 77kg kitted-up weight, I inflated the air spring to 178psi and left the two volume-reducer spacers installed. This gave me 29 per cent sag.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"RockShox Vivid Ultimate mountain bike rear shock\" title=\"RockShox Vivid Ultimate mountain bike rear shock-6\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Sag gradients are marked on the shock’s stanchion.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>During the initial shakedown ride, I fully opened the external rebound adjustment and high-speed compression adjustment. I ended up with +1 click (from fully open) of low-speed compression damping and +1 click (from fully open) of hydraulic bottom out.</p>\n<p>While I felt satisfied these settings provided the performance I was after, they indicate the shock’s rebound and/or compression tunes are too hard for my requirements.</p>\n<p>Ideally, the rebound and compression-damping adjusters should be in the middle of their range. I have contacted RockShox to get a lighter tune installed in my Vivid so I can continue testing.</p>\n<p>Despite the tune, out on the trail, the Vivid’s smoothness is certainly impressive.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"RockShox Vivid Ultimate mountain bike rear shock\" title=\"RockShox Vivid Ultimate mountain bike rear shock-3\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> There are 20 clicks of rebound adjustment.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>It dips in and out of its travel with a noteworthy eagerness, providing a hushed and muted feel in rough, choppy terrain.</p>\n<p>I was convinced my rear tyre had lost pressure, which highlights its impressive bump-devouring performance and just how smooth it feels.</p>\n<p>The Vivid gives the bike a damped, grippy feeling, effectively flattening and filtering out the harsh spikes of repetitive bumps, something usually felt when your tyres are too soft.</p>\n<p>Multiple factors appear to be at play here; the TouchDown tech, the high-volume positive and negative spring chambers, and the spring’s linear design combine to create plenty of smoothness.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"RockShox Vivid Ultimate mountain bike rear shock fitted to a Marin Alpine Trail XR enduro mountain bike ridden by Alex Evans on a trail called Angry Sheep in Scotland's Tweed Valley.\" title=\"RockShox Vivid Ultimate mountain bike rear shock-10\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Initial performance was impressive, but a re-tune is required to suit Alex’s tastes, riding style and favoured terrain.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Despite the spring’s linear feel, the damping provides ample mid-stroke support to stop the bike sinking too deep into its travel in high-load berms or compressions.</p>\n<p>The end-stroke ramp-up – thanks to the volume-reducer spacers – and hydraulic bottom out both help the Alpine Trail XR use full travel softly, rather than with a harsh stop.</p>\n<p>Initial impressions indicate the Vivid is an impressive performer with plenty of scope to tune it to feel like a coil-sprung shock, a traditional air-sprung shock or anything in between.</p>\n<p>TouchDown’s effect is subtle and hard to distinguish on its own because the large air spring will be helping improve off-the-top smoothness compared to a smaller one.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the harder than ideal tune could be playing a role in muting its performance.</p>\n<p>Be sure to stay tuned for a full review once I’ve had the damper re-tuned and spent more time on the shock.</p>\n<h2>RockShox Vivid rear shock models and prices</h2>\n<h3>RockShox Vivid Ultimate</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"RockShox Vivid Ultimate mountain bike rear shock\" title=\"RockShox Vivid Ultimate mountain bike rear shock\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> RockShox Vivid Ultimate.</span></figcaption><span> <i>RockShox</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Damper:</strong> TouchDown RC2T</li>\n<li><strong>Adjustments:</strong> Low- and high-speed compression, low-speed rebound, hydraulic bottom out, threshold lever</li>\n<li><strong>Air spring:</strong> Vivid DebonAir</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £749/$699/€839 ­– £799/$729/€874</li>\n</ul><h3>RockShox Vivid Ultimate DH</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"RockShox Vivid Ultimate DH mountain bike rear shock\" title=\"RockShox Vivid Ultimate DH mountain bike rear shock\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> RockShox Vivid Ultimate DH.</span></figcaption><span> <i>RockShox</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Damper:</strong> TouchDown RC2T</li>\n<li><strong>Adjustments:</strong> Low- and high-speed compression, low-speed rebound, hydraulic bottom out,</li>\n<li><strong>Air spring:</strong> Vivid DebonAir</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £749/$699/€839 ­– £799/$729/€874</li>\n</ul><h3>RockShox Vivid Select+</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"RockShox Vivid Select+ mountain bike rear shock\" title=\"RockShox Vivid Select+ mountain bike rear shock\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> RockShox Vivid Select+.</span></figcaption><span> <i>RockShox</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Damper:</strong> TouchDown RCT</li>\n<li><strong>Adjustments:</strong> Low- and high-speed compression via a single adjuster, low-speed rebound, hydraulic bottom out, threshold lever</li>\n<li><strong>Air spring:</strong> Vivid DebonAir</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> OE only</li>\n</ul><h3>RockShox Vivid Select</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"RockShox Vivid Select mountain bike rear shock\" title=\"RockShox Vivid Select mountain bike rear shock\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> RockShox Vivid Select.</span></figcaption><span> <i>RockShox</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Damper:</strong> TouchDown RT</li>\n<li><strong>Adjustments:</strong> Low-speed rebound, hydraulic bottom out, threshold lever</li>\n<li><strong>Air spring:</strong> Vivid DebonAir</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> OE only</li>\n</ul><h3>RockShox Vivid</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"RockShox Vivid mountain bike rear shock\" title=\"RockShox Vivid mountain bike rear shock\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> RockShox Vivid base.</span></figcaption><span> <i>RockShox</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Damper:</strong> TouchDown R</li>\n<li><strong>Adjustments:</strong> Low-speed rebound, hydraulic bottom out</li>\n<li><strong>Air spring:</strong> Vivid DebonAir</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> OE only</li>\n</ul>","author":"Alex Evans","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"724bc23966086c134b65e9f817631e9b0fac308741396df0719a03b2b6a77ef8","category":"Cycling"}
