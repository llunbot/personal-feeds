In an email today, Apple shared additional details about how this process will work.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-EU-iOS-Changes.jpg\" width=\"1312\" height=\"738\" />\r<br />\nApple said iPhone users in the EU will be presented with a list of the 12 most popular web browsers from their country's local App Store at the time, and noted that the options will be shown in random order for every user.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple shared an alphabetical list of the browsers that will currently be shown in every EU country. It is a very long list, so we have elected to highlight browsers that will be shown in France, Germany, Italy, and Spain as examples.<ul><li><strong>France:</strong> Aloha, Brave, Chrome, DuckDuckGo, Ecosia, Edge, Firefox, Onion Browser, Opera, Private Browser Deluxe, Qwant, and Safari</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Germany:</strong> Aloha, Brave, Chrome, DuckDuckGo, Ecosia, Edge, Firefox, Ivanti Web@Work, Onion Browser, Opera, Safari, and You.com AI Search Assistant</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Italy:</strong> Aloha, Brave, Chrome, DuckDuckGo, Ecosia, Edge, Firefox, Ivanti Web@Work, Onion Browser, Opera, Safari, and You.com AI Search Assistant</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Spain:</strong> Aloha, Brave, Chrome, DuckDuckGo, Ecosia, Edge, Firefox, Onion Browser, Opera, Safari, Vivaldi, and You.com AI Search Assistant</li></ul>There are <a href=\"https://european-union.europa.eu/principles-countries-history/country-profiles_en\">23 other countries in the EU</a> that this change applies to. Notably, this no longer includes the UK, which withdrew from the EU in 2020.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt has already been possible to change an iPhone's default web browser through the Settings app since iOS 14. Apple has now gone a step further and added the default browser prompt in Safari to comply with new regulations under the EU's Digital Markets Act.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn the EU, iOS 17.4 also allows web browsers to use web engines other than Apple's WebKit.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple said iOS 17.4 will be released to the public in March.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242\">iPadOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/26/apple-explains-ios-17-4-default-browsers-eu/\">Apple Further Explains iOS 17.4's New Default Browser Prompt in EU</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-further-explains-ios-17-4s-new-default-browser-prompt-in-eu.2417507/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7c220d92fdb449672dc45dc43f9a53219c8d8899861c929fb22893e027e043d7","category":"Apple"}
