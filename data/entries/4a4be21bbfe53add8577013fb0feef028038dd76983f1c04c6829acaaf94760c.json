{"title":"Tour de France Bike Computers & Team Zone Behind The Scenes!","link":"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/07/france-computers-behind.html","date":1721601520000,"content":"<p><span>﻿</span></p>\n<p>It’s time to look at bike computers of the Tour de France. I finished up the video first, above, but haven’t quite had a moment to write up all the details yet. Though, in short it’s very similar to years past, except we call it 2024 instead. There were only a couple of sponsorship swaps within the Tour de France this year, so the total numbers stayed very similar (+/- 1)</p>\n<p>The majority of teams on Garmin Edge units, followed closely by Wahoo. And then we have one team each on Hammerhead and Bryton. As always of course, almost all of these are full sponsorships with bike computer companies sponsoring a variety of sports tech items on the team (e.g. trainers, watches, etc…).</p>\n<p>I’ve got a bunch of photos/data/etc and such to unload still, but wanted to at least share the above video in the meantime.</p>\n<p>Also, even if you don’t really care about cycling GPS units, I suspect you’ll still find the above video entertaining, as it’s more of a behind-the-scenes video with an excuse for me to talk about bike computers, some trainers, and fruit along the way.</p>\n<p>Thanks for watching – and more to come!</p>","author":"Ray Maker","siteTitle":"DC Rainmaker","siteHash":"32f541eec2062fbf675b0daf837db78b41cd6160cf993de3c4b5e9b44a978706","entryHash":"4a4be21bbfe53add8577013fb0feef028038dd76983f1c04c6829acaaf94760c","category":"Cycling"}
