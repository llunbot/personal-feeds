Reputable Apple industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has since <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/kuo-apple-foldable-iphone-book-style-2000/\">corroborated</a> these dimensions, additionally describing the inner screen as \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/kuo-apple-foldable-iphone-book-style-2000/\">crease-free</a>.\" However, talk of the device using under-screen camera technology has not been claimed up until now. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThat said, rumors have suggested Apple is also working on a foldable iPad, and Digital Chat Station has previously claimed that this device will use <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/foldable-ipad-pro-under-display-face-id/\">under-display Face ID technology</a>, so it could be that Apple is seeking design parity between the two foldable devices. Additionally, Kuo believes the rear-facing camera on the foldable iPhone will use dual lenses and that the device will forgo Face ID authentication, instead using a Touch ID side button as a means to save precious internal space. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple will launch its long-rumored foldable iPhone next year with a ~$2,000 premium price tag attached, expects well-connected <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/24/foldable-iphone-to-launch-next-year/\"><em>Bloomberg</em> reporter Mark Gurman</a>. According to analyst Jeff Pu, the device recently entered the New Product Introduction (NPI) phase at Foxconn, with mass production slated to begin in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/16/apple-foldables-mass-production-2026/\">second half of 2026</a>.\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/07/foldable-iphone-expected-2026-rumored-features/\">Foldable iPhone: All the Rumored Features So Far</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nAccording to Gurman, the device will take advantage of the display, battery, modem, and chip advances that Apple has made in its development of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/\">iPhone 17 Air</a>, which is expected to replace the \"Plus\" model in Apple's smartphone lineup this year.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digital-chat-station/\">Digital Chat Station</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/\">Foldable iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/14/iphone-fold-display-resolutions-cameras/\">Foldable iPhone Resolutions Leak With Under-Screen Camera Tipped</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/foldable-iphone-resolutions-leak-with-under-screen-camera-tipped.2455274/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"32d01c65bcfddf227381fc8f408cd8e9371766b3fa905377f0869ea367e0b5f2","category":"Apple"}
