The iPhone 15 Pro is priced starting at £869, and the iPhone 15 Pro Max is priced starting at £949. Prices are discounted about 15 percent compared to brand new models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSeveral color and storage options are available at the time of writing, but availability may change as Apple updates its inventory. If you're after a specific combination, it's worth checking back regularly to see what's in stock.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple first introduced iPhone 15 models in Europe back in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/07/apple-begins-selling-refurb-iphone-15-europe/\">January</a>, while the models were added to Apple's refurb stores in the U.S. and Canada <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/06/refurbished-iphone-15-us-store/\">this week</a>. Archived webpage snapshots indicate the iPhone 15 models were added to the regional UK online store sometime around late April.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's refurbished iPhones are unlocked, meaning they work with any carrier. Each device comes with a brand-new battery, a fresh outer shell, and a new USB-C cable—making them virtually indistinguishable from brand-new models. Refurbished iPhones also include Apple's standard one-year warranty, with the option to add AppleCare+ for extended coverage.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/07/refurbished-iphone-15-models-apple-online-store-uk/\">Refurb iPhone 15 Models Now Available From Apple's UK Online Store</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/refurb-iphone-15-models-now-available-from-apples-uk-online-store.2456650/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0b399fd98a0a984e6c7948d277e714dfe71b42883c19fdc9fea824cdae2e4e5b","category":"Apple"}
