This means two things: great prices on superb tech products, and lots of difficult buying decisions. It’s hard enough knowing what to buy for yourself, but how do you choose gifts for your friends and loved ones?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we offer our advice on great gifts to buy for the Apple fans in your life.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What you shouldn’t buy</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First things first. Should you buy them an Apple device? If you’re very rich, and absolutely confident that you know exactly the right configuration and model to get, then… maybe. But in general, Apple fans plan their major purchases a long time in advance, and will know best which product to buy and when.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How about an accessory for a device your loved one already owns? A case, stand, charging dock, or battery pack will cost far less than an entirely new device, and is therefore less of a commitment, and less of a risk. High-quality accessories are a great way to super-power iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches, and AirPods, enabling your loved one to get more out of the products they’ve spent a big chunk of money on. And best of all, you don’t need to worry about picking the correct storage capacity or configuration.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What you should buy</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, so a premium accessory for your loved one’s favorite Apple product is the right general choice. But what specifically should we buy? The first step is to make sure you buy from a reputable manufacturer with a track record in the industry. The second is to check that you’re getting high-quality products at a sensible price, so online reviews will be an important resource.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The choice of vendor is up to you, but one option worth considering is <a href=\"https://www.esrgear.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ESR</a>, a leading mobile accessories brand. The company has been in the industry for 15 years, amassing more than 100 million users­ and a huge number of positive reviews–and no wonder, bearing in mind the wide range of quality products it sells at reasonable prices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take the <strong>3-in-1 MagSafe Charger with Qi2 and CryoBoost™,</strong> for example. This attractive and versatile accessory can wirelessly charge your loved one’s iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods case at the same time, and does so at market-leading speeds thanks to the company’s proprietary cooling technology. This is currently 22% off, only <a href=\"https://amz.run/9pFV\" target=\"_blank\">$69.99 from Amazon</a>. And you can get an extra 10% off with the code <strong>ESRFDL99</strong>!</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ESR-Qi2-3-in-1-Charger-with-CryoBoost.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"ESR Qi2 3-in-1 MagSafe charger with CryoBoost\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ESR-Qi2-3-in-1-Charger-with-CryoBoost.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1280w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ESR-Qi2-3-in-1-Charger-with-CryoBoost.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ESR-Qi2-3-in-1-Charger-with-CryoBoost.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ESR-Qi2-3-in-1-Charger-with-CryoBoost.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ESR-Qi2-3-in-1-Charger-with-CryoBoost.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/ESR-Qi2-3-in-1-Charger-with-CryoBoost.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>ESR</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Or the <strong>Qi2 MagSafe Battery Pack with Kickstand</strong>, a sleek and slim iPhone power bank featuring an integrated kickstand for portrait and landscape viewing: the perfect way to upgrade iPhone battery life while boosting its capabilities for TV or movie watching, and for FaceTiming friends and family (including you, the gift giver!).

Or pay slightly more for the 10,000mAh option that’s now 25% off, costing just <a href=\"https://amz.run/9pFX\" target=\"_blank\">$37.49 from Amazon</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your loved one drives, perhaps the <strong>MagSafe Car Charger with Qi2 and CryoBoost</strong> (41% off and only <a href=\"https://amz.run/9pFR\" target=\"_blank\">$31.49 from Amazon</a>; you can get extra 10% off with the code <strong>ESRCZQI2</strong>) is the right choice.

That’s a solid 10% better than rival Qi2 chargers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What about ESR’s <strong>Classic Hybrid Case with Stash Stand</strong>? Engineered to survive drops from up to 11 feet, this smart case is nevertheless amazingly slim and light, adding just 1.6mm to the thickness of your loved one’s iPhone. The clever design means you can keep on using MagSafe accessories while using the stand, and charging speeds are exceptional.
