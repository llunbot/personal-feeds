{"title":"iPhone 15 'FineWoven' Cases May Match New Magnetic Apple Watch Band and Come in 10 Color Options","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/03/finewoven-cases-may-match-new-watch-band/","date":1693740916000,"content":"Apple's upcoming \"FineWoven\" cases for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> lineup, designed to be a replacement for its leather cases, will match a new Apple Watch band and be available in ten different color options, according to the device collector and leaker known as \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kosutami/\">Kosutami</a>.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/apple-finewoven-case-colors.jpg\" alt width=\"4800\" height=\"2700\" />\r<br />\nIn a recent <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KosutamiSan/status/1698153140527514029\">tweet</a>, Kosutami explained that the new line of cases will be available in Black, Mulberry, Taupe, Evergreen, Pacific Blue, Wisteria, Antique White, Butter Yellow, Orange, and Pink color options. As illustrated by several of the alleged pictures of the new cases that have recently circulated online, Kosutami added that the cases have rubber-wrapped edges that are a little darker than the color of the rear \"woven\" part of the case. The leaker believes that \"FineWoven\" is Apple's officially chosen name for the new material.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKosutami previously claimed that Apple is planning to release a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/09/new-apple-watch-magnetic-band/\">new woven fabric band with a magnetic buckle</a> alongside the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-series-9/\">Apple Watch Series 9</a>. Now, the leaker has clarified that the band is set to be made out of the same material as the new line of premium <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> cases. The magnetic band will apparently retail for $99, the same price tag as the Braided Solo Loop, and could be similar to the Modern Buckle in terms of design.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEarlier this month, rumors suggested that Apple plans to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/17/apple-may-not-offer-leather-cases-for-iphone-15/\">eliminate leather cases</a> for the ‌iPhone 15‌ lineup, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/28/apple-non-leather-iphone-15-cases/\">subsequent information</a> pointed toward the possibility of a leather alternative with a woven fabric look, with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/30/iphone-15-finewoven-case-rumors/\">some reports</a> pointing to the name \"FineWoven.\" \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p><a href=\"https://t.co/ghO6A4uS4O\">https://t.co/ghO6A4uS4O</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/BrmR47XzEY\">pic.twitter.com/BrmR47XzEY</a></p>— DuanRui (@duanrui1205) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/duanrui1205/status/1696905407703462102?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 30, 2023</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nImages of ‌iPhone‌ cases with the \"FineWoven\" name have been shared online in recent weeks, but the pictured accessories are almost certainly Chinese clones.
