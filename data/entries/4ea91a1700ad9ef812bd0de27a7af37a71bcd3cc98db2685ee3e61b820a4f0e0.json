Wearables was down by one percent, to $8.8 billion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/05/this-is-tim-apples-q2-2023-analyst-call-transcribed/\">Six Colors’s transcript</a> of Tim Cook’s prepared statement and Apple’s Q&amp;A with analysts. I thought it was interesting which shows and movies from TV+ Cook chose to highlight:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>During the past quarter, fans tuned in to incredible new series\nlike “Shrinking” and “The Big Door Prize” and got to welcome “Ted\nLasso” back into their homes for a third season. Movies like\n“Tetris” are captivating viewers with many more to come, including\nMartin Scorsese’s “Killers of the Flower Moon” later this year.</p>\n\n<p>Three years since its launch, Apple TV+ programming has been\ncelebrated across the globe with over 1,450 nominations and more\nthan 350 wins. Recently, we were thrilled to cheer on “The Boy,\nThe Mole, The Fox, and The Horse,” which won an Academy Award for\nBest Animated Short Film.</p>\n\n<p>This season of our historic 10-year partnership with Major League\nSoccer is well underway. With MLS Season Pass, we’ve created the\nultimate destination for soccer fans, offering subscribers the\nability to watch every match with no blackouts. And with baseball\nseason in full swing, Apple TV+ subscribers can watch their\nfavorite teams with a return of Friday Night Baseball.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Sidenote:</strong> Two weeks ago <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/04/13/idc-pc-sales-slump\">IDC projected Mac sales as being down 40 percent year-over-year</a>, which shows how large IDC’s margin of error is.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/04/apple-q2-2023-results\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"4ea91a1700ad9ef812bd0de27a7af37a71bcd3cc98db2685ee3e61b820a4f0e0","category":"Tech"}
