That is, they contained over 10 percent more or less melatonin than what was listed on the packaging. Together, the dietary supplement products contained a range of melatonin that spanned 1.3 mg to 13.1 mg per serving. And those actual quantities represented a range of 74 percent to 347 percent of what they were supposed to contain based on their labeling.</p>\n<p>The finding highlights a larger concern over the quality, safety, and effectiveness of dietary supplements, which are not vetted or approved by the Food and Drug Administration like over-the-counter medicines, such as ibuprofen and allergy medicines.
