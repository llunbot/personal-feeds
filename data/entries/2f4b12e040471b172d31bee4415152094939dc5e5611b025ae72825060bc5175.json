The federal government said in its 2023 budget released Tuesday that it will bring the right to repair to Canada. At the same time, it's considering a universal charging port mandate like the European Union (EU) is implementing with USB-C.</p>\n<p>The Canadian federal government's 2023 <a href=\"https://www.budget.canada.ca/2023/report-rapport/toc-tdm-en.html\">budget</a> introduces the right to repair under the chapter “Making Life More Affordable and Supporting the Middle Class.\" It says that the \"government will work to implement a right to repair, with the aim of introducing a targeted framework for home appliances and electronics in 2024.\" The government plans to hold consultations on the matter and claimed it will \"work closely with provinces and territories\" to implement the right to repair in Canada:</p>\n<blockquote><p><span>When it comes to broken appliances or devices, high repair fees and a lack of access to specific parts often mean Canadians are pushed to buy new products rather than repairing the ones they have. This is expensive for people and creates harmful waste. </span><span><br />\n</span><span><br />\n</span><span>Devices and appliances should be easy to repair, spare parts should be readily accessible, and companies should not be able to prevent repairs with complex programming or hard-to-obtain bespoke parts. By cutting down on the number of devices and appliances that are thrown out, we will be able to make life more affordable for Canadians and protect our environment.</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span>The budget also insinuates that right-to-repair legislation can make third-party repairs cheaper than getting a phone, for example, repaired by the manufacturer, where it could cost \"</span><span>far more than it should.” </span></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1928301#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1928301&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2f4b12e040471b172d31bee4415152094939dc5e5611b025ae72825060bc5175","category":"Tech"}
