The airline first received Federal Aviation Administration approval to give iPads to all pilots in 2013, which enabled pilots to use the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> for operational tracking apps, hosting system maintenance checks, checking real-time weather patterns to avoid turbulence, accessing procedures and manuals, and more. In 2015, JetBlue became the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2015/02/10/apple-pay-jetblue/\">first airline to accept Apple Pay in-flight</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nNow, JetBlue will begin rolling out Apple's latest ‌iPad Pro‌ featuring the ‌M1‌ chip to all new pilots and will replace older models that are currently in use over time.<blockquote>‌iPad Pro‌ is the right fit for the cockpit, with its thin, light design and large, bright Liquid Retina display. The new ‌iPad Pro‌ features the industry-leading ‌M1‌ chip, which offers next-level performance when pilots are running more than a dozen apps throughout the duration of the flight. ‌iPad Pro‌'s fast 5G capabilities delivers better performance and access to next-generation download and upload speeds.</blockquote>The ‌iPad Pro‌ will provide \"safety-critical functions\" to crewmembers and will future-proof the company with powerful hardware for years to come.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jetblue/\">JetBlue</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/13/jetblue-pilots-to-receive-m1-ipad-pro/\">JetBlue Pilots to Receive M1 iPad Pro</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/jetblue-pilots-to-receive-m1-ipad-pro.2304121/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=BaLqiEdAE8c:PPDUXQa8Ws4:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=BaLqiEdAE8c:PPDUXQa8Ws4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/BaLqiEdAE8c\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9e9098707c622b75dc8c4a0918c0f6b1da4cdfe828dffaf9d5b842895bf078a8","category":"Apple"}
