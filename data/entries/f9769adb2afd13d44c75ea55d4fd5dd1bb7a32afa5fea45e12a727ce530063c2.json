(And <em>Jedi: Fallen Order</em>, of course.) Now, a cornerstone of that era is set to be revived in the form of the <em>Star Wars Battlefront Classic Collection</em>.</p>\n<p>Announced this morning, the collection includes two beloved LucasArts-developed online multiplayer shooters from the 2000s: <em>Star Wars Battlefront</em> and <em>Star Wars Battlefront 2</em>. Although it debuted during a Nintendo livestream, the collection won't just be coming out on Nintendo Switchâ€”it's coming to PC, PlayStation, and Xbox, too.</p>\n<p>The collection will include \"restored online play for up to 64 players\" of all the previous Galactic Conquest and Campaign mode content from both games on all platforms, including bonus maps and extras that were previously exclusive to specific consoles. Additionally, the Hero Assault mode will now be playable on all ground maps.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2004939#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2004939&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f9769adb2afd13d44c75ea55d4fd5dd1bb7a32afa5fea45e12a727ce530063c2","category":"Tech"}
