The last electrified Mazda we drove was <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/10/making-sense-of-mazdas-mx-30-electric-commuter-car/\">the abysmal MX-30</a>, a cynical compliance car that proved <a href=\"https://electrek.co/2023/07/29/mazda-kills-off-mx-30-ev-in-us-again-after-selling-just-66-cars/\">too unpopular to remain on sale</a>.
