The plan limits users to 720p resolution and one device and lets people download content. Netflix stopped offering the Basic plan to new subscribers <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/netflix-hungry-for-more-growth-signals-more-price-hikes/\">in January.</a> In June, Netflix started <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/all-the-ways-streaming-services-are-aggravating-their-subscribers-this-week/\">booting subscribers</a> in the UK and Canada off the plan and automatically put them onto a cheaper subscription plan with ads.</p>\n<p>In a letter to shareholders today [<a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/FINAL-Q2-24-Shareholder-Letter.pdf\">PDF</a>], Netflix confirmed publicly for the first time that it “will now start” to phase out the ad-free Basic plan in the US and France. This will make the cheapest commercial-free Netflix plan $15.49/month in the US. That Standard plan supports up to two devices, downloads, and 1080p resolution.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038032#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038032&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4048923115767c675f1be5e9dda2f992fd7b34b32ea8ff2e57c895e6780227fe","category":"Tech"}
