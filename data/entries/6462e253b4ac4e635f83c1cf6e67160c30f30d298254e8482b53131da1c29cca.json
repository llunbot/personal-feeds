Their report is part of a growing body of research into using signals from low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites for navigation, similar to how GPS works.</p>\n<p>This technology won't replace your smartphone's map application any time soon, and this initial experiment apparently required 13 minutes of tracking six Starlink satellites to pinpoint a location on Earth. But researchers were able to achieve the locational feat without any help from SpaceX, and they say the test proves the method could be used for navigation.</p>\n<p>\"The researchers did not need assistance from SpaceX to use the satellite signals, and they emphasized that they had no access to the actual data being sent through the satellitesâ€”only to information related to the satellite's location and movement,\" an <a href=\"https://news.osu.edu/spacex-satellite-signals-used-like-gps-to-pinpoint-location-on-earth/\">Ohio State News article</a> said.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1798722#p3\">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1798722&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6462e253b4ac4e635f83c1cf6e67160c30f30d298254e8482b53131da1c29cca","category":"Tech"}
