I love that my bike carries me away from the noise of the world and out into the peace of the woods. I always feel a bit uncomfortable when I realize I work in marketing (I blame my formative years listening to Bill Hicks), so I have done my best to be sincere in what I do. This is how I really feel on almost every ride. I hope this inspires you to get out into the trees and take some deep breaths.”</em></p>\n<p>Well done, y’all.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/taj-mtb-fairdale/\">Taj in the Woods on His Fairdale MTB</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"a74d281ffde28f4f57c4dfa33f4721969e62316e76405a6375b4645f91db34d7","category":"Cycling"}
