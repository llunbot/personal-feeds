It also shares the same geometry and kinematics as their full-power MITH eMTB, just lighter and lower-powered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Built around the TQ HPR50 drive unit, which adds just 3,900g (8.6lbs), complete bike weights are just 18.5-18.9kg (40.8-41.7lbs). That’s with the same 160mm rear wheel travel and 170mm forks.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/unno-ikki-lightweight-enduro-eMTB-3.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/unno-ikki-lightweight-enduro-eMTB-3.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of Unno IKKI lightweight eMTB\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/unno-ikki-lightweight-enduro-eMTB-3.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/unno-ikki-lightweight-enduro-eMTB-3-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/unno-ikki-lightweight-enduro-eMTB-3-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/unno-ikki-lightweight-enduro-eMTB-3-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/unno-ikki-lightweight-enduro-eMTB-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/unno-ikki-lightweight-enduro-eMTB-3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/unno-ikki-lightweight-enduro-eMTB-3-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The frame is a lightweight carbon monocoque front end with virtual pivot point suspension with their trademark ultra-low standover, making the bike compact and highly maneuverable.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/unno-ikki-cutaway-view-suspension-linkage.jpg\"><img width=\"1920\" height=\"1510\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/unno-ikki-cutaway-view-suspension-linkage.jpg\" alt=\"cutaway view of Unno IKKI suspension linkage\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/unno-ikki-cutaway-view-suspension-linkage.jpg 1920w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/unno-ikki-cutaway-view-suspension-linkage-297x234.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/unno-ikki-cutaway-view-suspension-linkage-800x629.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/unno-ikki-cutaway-view-suspension-linkage-120x94.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/unno-ikki-cutaway-view-suspension-linkage-768x604.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/unno-ikki-cutaway-view-suspension-linkage-1536x1208.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A mixed-wheel setup helps keep a tighter, more playful rear end with 27.5″ in the back, 29er in the front.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/unno-ikki-lightweight-enduro-eMTB-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/unno-ikki-lightweight-enduro-eMTB-1.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of Unno IKKI lightweight eMTB\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/unno-ikki-lightweight-enduro-eMTB-1.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/unno-ikki-lightweight-enduro-eMTB-1-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/unno-ikki-lightweight-enduro-eMTB-1-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/unno-ikki-lightweight-enduro-eMTB-1-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/unno-ikki-lightweight-enduro-eMTB-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/unno-ikki-lightweight-enduro-eMTB-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/unno-ikki-lightweight-enduro-eMTB-1-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It gets stealth routing under an ultra-short stem length on the integrated one-piece bar/stem unit to complement the long reach.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/unno-ikki-lightweight-enduro-eMTB-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1323\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/unno-ikki-lightweight-enduro-eMTB-2.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of Unno IKKI lightweight eMTB\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/unno-ikki-lightweight-enduro-eMTB-2.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/unno-ikki-lightweight-enduro-eMTB-2-297x196.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/unno-ikki-lightweight-enduro-eMTB-2-800x529.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/unno-ikki-lightweight-enduro-eMTB-2-120x79.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/unno-ikki-lightweight-enduro-eMTB-2-768x508.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/unno-ikki-lightweight-enduro-eMTB-2-1536x1016.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The TQ display is integrated into the top tube, and the charging port on the downtube doubles as a plug port for the auxiliary battery.
