The video shows that the iPhone 16e has a 4,005 mAh battery capacity, which is a 12% increase compared to the regular iPhone 16 with a 3,561 mAh battery capacity at the same voltage.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor those who prefer watt-hours as a unit of measurement, the iPhone 16e has a 15.55 Wh battery, while the iPhone 16 has a 13.83 Wh battery.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition to being larger, the iPhone 16e battery uses a type of adhesive that can be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/18/iphone-16-and-16-plus-9v-battery-removal/\">loosened with low-voltage electrical current</a> from a 9V battery, USB-C charger, or another power source. This change debuted on the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus last year, and it is rumored to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/10/iphone-17-pro-electrical-battery-removal-rumor/\">extend to the iPhone 17 Pro models</a> later this year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nThe teardown also provides a look at the iPhone 16e's logic board, including the A18 chip and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-unveils-c1/\">Apple's custom-designed C1 cellular modem</a>. The video said the A18 chip will be harder to repair because it is apparently more difficult to remove. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nFinally, the video showed the iPhone 16e's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/28/apple-provides-reason-iphone-16e-no-magsafe/\">lack of MagSafe magnets</a> for wireless charging.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFollowing pre-orders over the past week, the iPhone 16e began arriving to customers today, and the device is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/28/iphone-16e-available-today-pickup/\">now available to purchase in Apple Stores</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/\">iPhone 16e</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/teardown/\">Teardown</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16e\">iPhone 16e (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/28/iphone-16e-teardown/\">iPhone 16e Teardown Reveals Larger Battery, C1 Modem, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16e-teardown-reveals-larger-battery-c1-modem-and-more.2450371/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"52ef3eb138d2e7ac8d47bc82e26ef3d2b36242038a382a364996e030e58d9c42","category":"Apple"}
