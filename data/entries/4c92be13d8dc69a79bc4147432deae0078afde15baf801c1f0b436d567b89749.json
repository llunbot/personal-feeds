And yet here we are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The least-expensive new MacBook Pro you can get costs $1,599 and includes only 8GB of RAM, an insultingly miserly amount for this day and age. Want more? That will be at least $200, take it or leave it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has a long history of providing less RAM than it should for the price of its laptops and overcharging to get more, but it’s reached ridiculous proportions. The <em>cheapest</em> standard configuration with more than 8GB of RAM is 2 grand! The cheapest MacBook Pro you can <em>configure</em> with more than 8GB is $1,800!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Yes, you need more than 8GB</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I will be the first chip nerd on the block to sing the praises of Apple’s M-series memory management. A big on-chip system-level cache and a fast SSD, along with some really smart code, means that a Mac with Apple Silicon doesn’t feel nearly as hamstrung with 8GB of RAM as, say, a Windows laptop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That does not mean that 8GB is “enough,” though. Even relatively casual users who load up on browser tabs and inefficient <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.electronjs.org/apps&amp;xcust=1-1-2130071-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Electron apps</a> (household names like Slack, Teams, Discord, etc.) can find performance compromised by running out of RAM.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/space-black-macbook-pro-steep-angle.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"space black macbook pro\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/space-black-macbook-pro-steep-angle.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 3000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/space-black-macbook-pro-steep-angle.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/space-black-macbook-pro-steep-angle.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/space-black-macbook-pro-steep-angle.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/space-black-macbook-pro-steep-angle.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/space-black-macbook-pro-steep-angle.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/space-black-macbook-pro-steep-angle.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/space-black-macbook-pro-steep-angle.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" /><figcaption><p>Any MacBook with Pro branding should have a minimum of 16G of RAM.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>As I write this, with just a handful of browser tabs open, Slack, and a distraction-free writing app (<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://ia.net/writer&amp;xcust=1-1-2130071-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">iA Writer</a>—it’s great), I’m consuming just about 11GB on my M2 MacBook Air.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is it a problem to sell a Mac with 8GB in 2023-2024? No. Is it a problem to sell a <em>MacBook Pro</em> for $1,600 with only 8GB of RAM? Oh god, yes. If 8GB will be a bottleneck for many today, imagine the performance of that non-upgradeable laptop in a few years’ time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not that Windows laptops and Macs are directly comparable, but comparably-priced Microsoft Surface, HP Envy, Alienware, Dell XP, and Lenovo Thinkpad laptops all have 16GB of RAM or more, standard. You can spend all day mired in laptop configurations (and I have) but the bottom line is this: 16GB is standard at prices over $1,000 even in laptops with premium displays and other high-end features. Apple is <em>way</em> off base with its RAM here, more so than usual, especially in products that carry the “Pro” name.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The upgrade extortion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want more than 8GB, you have to pay for it. Either with a big $400 upgrade to the M3 Pro—which is not even an option in the just-released <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2126614/24-inch-imac-m3-review.html\">M3 iMac</a>—or by paying Apple $200 for another 8GB.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be clear, 8GB of LPDDR5-6400 (the RAM used in these products) costs Apple a tiny fraction of that amount. Nobody knows precisely what Apple pays its suppliers, but the going price for 64Gbits (8GB) of that sort of RAM is less than $40 in quantity. Apple’s deal likely has them paying $30 or less.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/space-black-macbook-pro-hdmi.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Space Black MacBook Pro ports: SDXC Card slot, Thunderbolt, HDMI\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/space-black-macbook-pro-hdmi.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 3000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/space-black-macbook-pro-hdmi.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/space-black-macbook-pro-hdmi.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/space-black-macbook-pro-hdmi.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/space-black-macbook-pro-hdmi.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/space-black-macbook-pro-hdmi.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/space-black-macbook-pro-hdmi.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/space-black-macbook-pro-hdmi.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" /><figcaption><p>The M3 MacBook Pro has a great screen and a nice selection of ports—but 8GB of RAM is a joke.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s nothing special about Apple’s RAM. It’s high quality, and it’s integrated on a very wide memory bus very close to the M3 chip, but those manufacturing complexities don’t make the RAM cost more. Apple’s charging you $200 for RAM it buys for $30.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s a fun experiment: Configure a MacBook Pro with the M3 Max, the full 16-core CPU version. Every additional 16GB of RAM costs $200, the same as 8GB of RAM on the lower configurations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any time an upgrade carries a perfectly round price–<em>exactly</em> $200–you should be wary of it. Some product manager priced it by what “looks good” and what they think customers will pay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Apple’s case, you have no choice. You can’t upgrade later. You can’t pay anyone else’s price. You have to pay Apple’s exorbitant $200-for-8GB upgrade cost. Make no mistake: the true starting cost of a M3 MacBook Pro is $1,699 because to buy one with only 8GB of RAM is crazy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>We shouldn’t accept this</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Are the new M3 Macs great computers? Sure. Are they expensive? You betcha. Does any excuse for Apple’s stingy 8GB RAM configurations or highway-robbery RAM upgrade prices? Absolutely not. This is pure corporate greed from the world’s biggest and richest technology company, and as Apple customers, we shouldn’t stand for it.</p>\n\nMacBook</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"4c92be13d8dc69a79bc4147432deae0078afde15baf801c1f0b436d567b89749","category":"Apple"}
