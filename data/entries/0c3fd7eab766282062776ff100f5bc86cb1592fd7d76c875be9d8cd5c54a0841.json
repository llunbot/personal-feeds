For those who are looking for a more stylish alternative to Apple's Sport Band, Lululook has <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLULULOOK-iWatch-Original-Wristband-Replacement%2Fdp%2FB0CQY562ZJ%3F\">the FKM Sport Band</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/lululook-fkm-bands.jpg\" width=\"970\" height=\"497\" />\r<br />\nPriced at $50, the FMK Sport Band is made from a soft silicone material that's water and sweat resistant. It has a matte finish for a soft, plush feel that makes it comfortable to wear all day, and Lululook says that the design is breathable, lightweight, and irritation-free.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/lululook-sport-band-blue.jpg\" width=\"1273\" height=\"716\" />\r<br />\nCompared to other silicone bands on the market, the FMK band is made from a denser material that gives it more pliability, and the wave design is meant to give it a unique look that transitions from workouts to the office. The band uses a pin-and-tuck closure that ensures it remains secured on the wrist. Lululook offers this band in multiple fun colors, including forest green, bright yellow, gray, black, blue, orange, and glow-in-the-dark.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/lululook-silicone-band-green.jpg\" width=\"853\" height=\"583\" />\r<br />\nFor those who prefer metal bands, Lululook has quite a few options.

It comes in several colors, including black, silver, gold, rose gold, and starlight. The band is designed to be thin, cutting down on weight and making it comfortable to wear.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/lululook-milanese-modern.jpg\" width=\"1308\" height=\"736\" />\r<br />\nThe $24 <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLULULOOK-Compatible-Stainless-Magnetic-iWatch%2Fdp%2FB0CKYJZ5B9%2F\">Retro Milanese Loop</a> is similar to the Modern version, but it has a more classic watch design. This model is limited to black and silver, but it has the same lightweight build and magnetic wrap closure for easy removal.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/lululook-milanese-retro.jpg\" width=\"1313\" height=\"739\" />\r<br />\nThe $35 <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLULULOOK-Needed-Compatible-Stainless-Ultra2%2Fdp%2FB0CL68KRZM%2F%3Fth%3D1\">Stainless Steel Band</a> is an alternative to Apple's expensive Link Bracelet. There are four to five removable links on each side depending on the size of the band, which allows it to be quickly adjusted to an appropriate size. Links can be removed by hand without a tool, and there's a simple but secure magnetic buckle that keeps it on the wrist.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/lululook-link-band.jpg\" width=\"1309\" height=\"736\" />\r<br />\nAll of Lululook's bands work with any modern Apple Watch model, and Lululook often has deals so it's worth checking in every now and then if you're in need of a new watch band.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe have a 45mm ‌Apple Watch Series 9‌ and a Lululook band to give away to one lucky <em>MacRumors</em> reader.
