There is also the 350-mile XL, plus 100-, 50- and 25-mile events.</p>\n<p>Held on the rolling Flint Hills outside Emporia, Kansas, the race is notorious for tough conditions.</p>\n<p>Sometimes it’s blisteringly hot and humid; some years it pours rain. Perhaps the most difficult is when rain hits dirt roads that don’t drain well, and soupy mud turns to ultra-sticky, peanut-butter mud that brings wheels and riders to a standstill, and ejects chains from chainrings.</p>\n<p>While the forecast for this weekend’s race was largely dry, rain the day before sent many riders scrambling for thinner tyres for better mud clearance. And boy did they need it. Conditions for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/events/unbound/\">Unbound 2023</a> made for a particularly challenging edition of the event – for riders and their bikes alike.</p>\n<p>Tyre selection varied wildly; some riders had 38mm slicks, and others had 2.1in knobbly tyres. Outside of the 70 Grand Prix competitors, gear selection is an even wider cornucopia, with everything from singlespeeds to fat bikes and tandems seen in the Flint Hills.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n<p>We’ve already covered the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/shimano-grx-r820/\">new Shimano GRX groupset</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/unbound-2023-new-canyon-grail/\">new Canyon Grail</a> spotted at Unbound, so let’s get into the tech detail.</p>\n<p>Here’s our Unbound 2023 gravel tech mega-gallery, covering everything from tyre choices and puncture precautions, to aero setups and custom hacks, as well as the bikes of some of the fastest riders in the race.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"New Canyon Grail at Unbound 2023\" title=\"New Canyon Grail at Unbound 2023\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> We’ve already brought you news of Shimano GRX 12-speed and what we believe to be a new Canyon Grail (pictured).

While the top riders are limited to their sponsor’s options, there are still myriad choices for tread, width, pressure and the use or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-tubeless-tyre-inserts/\">tyre inserts</a> or not. </span></p>\n<p><span>With rain soaking parts of the course and rendering some miles-long stretches difficult if not downright unrideable, many riders opted for skinnier than usual tyres, in an attempt to cut through the mud and leave additional clearance between the frame and tyre. A few riders ran a knobbly tyre up front and a slick in the rear.</span></p>\n<div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/06/Unbound-22-6f91abc.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Lachlan Morton of EF's Cannondale SuperSix EVO SE features a 2.1in front and a 44mm rear tyre.\" title=\"Lachlan Morton of EF's Cannondale SuperSix EVO SE features a 2.1in front and a 44mm rear tyre.\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Lachlan Morton of EF’s Cannondale SuperSix EVO SE features a 2.1in front and a 44mm rear tyre.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Ben Delaney / Our Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/06/Unbound-30-ecc5466.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"A 44mm rear...\" title=\"A 44mm rear...\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>A 44mm rear…</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Ben Delaney / Our Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/06/Unbound-31-898925f.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"... and a 2.1in front.\" title=\"... and a 2.1in front.\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>… and a 2.1in front.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Ben Delaney / Our Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/06/Unbound-28-71b4998.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Lachlan Morton's cockpit with a Wahoo front and centre.\" title=\"Lachlan Morton's cockpit with a Wahoo front and centre.\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Lachlan Morton’s cockpit with a Wahoo front and centre.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Ben Delaney / Our Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/06/Unbound-23-396a5b7.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"WorldTour riders push bigger gears than the rest of us, even in the mud.\" title=\"WorldTour riders push bigger gears than the rest of us, even in the mud.\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>WorldTour riders push bigger gears than the rest of us, even in the mud.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Ben Delaney / Our Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/06/Unbound-24-f1ee3b7.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Not only mud but tall grass found its way into every bike.\" title=\"Not only mud but tall grass found its way into every bike.\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Not only mud but tall grass found its way into every bike.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Ben Delaney / Our Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p><span>Lachlan Morton chose a mismatched tyre setup. </span><span>He paired a 44mm rear tyre with a massive 2.1in front tyre. </span></p>\n<p><span>Morton ran the Vittoria Terreno Dry up front, with a slightly more knobbly tyre on the rear.</span></p>\n<p><span>Note also his wheel choices.
