{"title":"AWS Week in Review: New Service for Generative AI and Amazon EC2 Trn1n, Inf2, and CodeWhisperer now GA – April 17, 2023","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-week-in-review-new-service-for-generative-ai-and-amazon-ec2-trn1n-inf2-and-codewhisperer-now-ga-april-17-2023/","date":1681758729000,"content":"<p>I could almost title this blog post the “AWS <strong>AI/ML</strong> Week in Review.” This past week, we announced several new innovations and tools for building with generative AI on AWS. Let’s dive right into it.</p> \n<p><strong><span>Last Week’s Launches</span> </strong><br /> Here are some launches that got my attention during the previous week:</p> \n<p><strong>Announcing Amazon Bedrock and Amazon Titan models </strong>– <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\">Amazon Bedrock</a> is a new service to accelerate your development of generative AI applications using foundation models through an API without managing infrastructure. You can choose from a wide range of foundation models built by leading AI startups and Amazon. The new <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/titan/\">Amazon Titan</a> foundation models are pre-trained on large datasets, making them powerful, general-purpose models. You can use them as-is or privately to customize them with your own data for a particular task without annotating large volumes of data. Amazon Bedrock is currently in limited preview. <a href=\"https://pages.awscloud.com/generative-AI-interest-learn.html\">Sign up here</a> to learn more.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/04/14/building-generative-ai-on-aws-fullsize.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/04/14/building-generative-ai-on-aws-fullsize.png\" alt=\"Building with Generative AI on AWS\" width=\"1005\" height=\"497\" /></a></p> \n<p><strong>Amazon EC2 Trn1n and Inf2 instances are now generally available</strong> – <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/trn1/\">Trn1n instances</a>, powered by <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/trainium/\">AWS Trainium</a> accelerators, double the network bandwidth (compared to Trn1 instances) to 1,600 Gbps of Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFAv2). The increased bandwidth delivers even higher performance for training network-intensive generative AI models such as large language models (LLMs) and mixture of experts (MoE). <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/inf2/\">Inf2 instances</a>, powered by <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/inferentia/\">AWS Inferentia2</a> accelerators, deliver high performance at the lowest cost in Amazon EC2 for generative AI models, including LLMs and vision transformers. They are the first inference-optimized instances in Amazon EC2 to support scale-out distributed inference with ultra-high-speed connectivity between accelerators. Compared to Inf1 instances, Inf2 instances deliver up to 4x higher throughput and up to 10x lower latency. Check out <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-ec2-trn1-instances-for-high-performance-model-training-are-now-available/\">my blog posts on Trn1 instances</a> and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-ec2-inf2-instances-for-low-cost-high-performance-generative-ai-inference-are-now-generally-available/\">Inf2 instances</a> for more details.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon CodeWhisperer, free for individual use, is now generally available</strong> – <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/\">Amazon CodeWhisperer</a> is an AI coding companion that generates real-time single-line or full-function code suggestions in your IDE to help you build applications faster. With GA, we introduce two tiers: CodeWhisperer Individual and CodeWhisperer Professional. CodeWhisperer Individual is free to use for generating code. You can sign up with an AWS Builder ID based on your email address. The Individual Tier provides code recommendations, reference tracking, and security scans. CodeWhisperer Professional—priced at $19 per user, per month—offers additional enterprise administration capabilities. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-codewhisperer-free-for-individual-use-is-now-generally-available/\">Steve’s blog post</a> has all the details.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon GameLift adds support for Unreal Engine 5</strong> – <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/gamelift/\">Amazon GameLift</a> is a fully managed solution that allows you to manage and scale dedicated game servers for session-based multiplayer games. The latest version of the Amazon GameLift Server SDK 5.0 lets you integrate your Unreal 5-based game servers with the Amazon GameLift service. In addition, the latest Amazon GameLift Server SDK with Unreal 5 plugin is built to work with <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-creating-anywhere.html\">Amazon GameLift Anywhere</a> so that you can test and iterate Unreal game builds faster and manage game sessions across any server hosting infrastructure. Check out the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/release-notes.html#release-notes-04132023\">release notes</a> to learn more.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon Rekognition launches Face Liveness to deter fraud in facial verification</strong> – Face Liveness verifies that only real users, not bad actors using spoofs, can access your services. Amazon Rekognition Face Liveness analyzes a short selfie video to detect spoofs presented to the camera, such as printed photos, digital photos, digital videos, or 3D masks, as well as spoofs that bypass the camera, such as pre-recorded or deepfake videos. This <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/detect-real-and-live-users-and-deter-bad-actors-using-amazon-rekognition-face-liveness/\">AWS Machine Learning Blog post</a> walks you through the details and shows how you can add Face Liveness to your web and mobile applications.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/new/\">For a full list of AWS announcements, be sure to keep an eye on the What's New at AWS page.</a></p> \n<p><strong><u>Other AWS News<br /> </u></strong>Here are some additional news items and blog posts that you may find interesting:</p> \n<p><strong>Updates to the AWS Well-Architected Framework</strong> – The most recent content updates and improvements focus on providing expanded guidance across the AWS service portfolio to help you make more informed decisions when developing implementation plans.
