Designed for improved aerodynamic performance even in crosswinds, the new undulating wheels look to improve in almost every performance characteristic. Varying from 40-45mm in depth, the new aero carbon Campagnolo Shamal wheels are also substantially deeper, wider, and lighter than the previous generation, making them truly versatile, whatever type of roads you ride…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Campagnolo Shamal ‘Dual-Profile’ aero carbon road wheels</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Campagnolo-Shamal-Dual-Profile-varying-depth-wavy-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_G3-grouped-spokes.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Campagnolo-Shamal-Dual-Profile-varying-depth-wavy-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_G3-grouped-spokes.webp\" alt=\"Campy Shamal Dual-Profile aero carbon all-road wheels, G3 lacing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Campagnolo-Shamal-Dual-Profile-varying-depth-wavy-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_G3-grouped-spokes.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Campagnolo-Shamal-Dual-Profile-varying-depth-wavy-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_G3-grouped-spokes-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Campagnolo-Shamal-Dual-Profile-varying-depth-wavy-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_G3-grouped-spokes-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Campagnolo-Shamal-Dual-Profile-varying-depth-wavy-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_G3-grouped-spokes-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Campagnolo-Shamal-Dual-Profile-varying-depth-wavy-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_G3-grouped-spokes-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Campagnolo-Shamal-Dual-Profile-varying-depth-wavy-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_G3-grouped-spokes-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Campagnolo)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Campy’s new wavy Shamal carbon wheels seem like a big design departure, but they really aren’t all that different than their recent alloy <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/campagnolos-race-ready-everyday-shamal-ultra-tubeless-aluminum-disc-brake-wheels/\" target=\"_blank\">Shamal Ultra</a> predecessors. There, Campagnolo already had a deeper section at their G3 spokes, machining away excess material in between to shave weight. Then, sister brand Fulcrum debuted its own wavy aero <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/fulcrum-sharq-takes-bite-out-of-gravel-racing-on-wild-sharktooth-carbon-aero-wheels/\" target=\"_blank\">Sharq</a> wheels last summer, making them 47mm deep at each spoke and 42mm deep in between. Here, Campagnolo just combines the two, and it looks a bit less dramatic due to the 7 groups of G3 spokes per wheel.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Why go to the wavy trouble?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Campagnolo-Shamal-Dual-Profile-varying-depth-wavy-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_40mm-to-45mm-deep-profile.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Campagnolo-Shamal-Dual-Profile-varying-depth-wavy-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_40mm-to-45mm-deep-profile.webp\" alt=\"Campy Shamal Dual-Profile aero carbon all-road wheels, wavy profile\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Campagnolo-Shamal-Dual-Profile-varying-depth-wavy-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_40mm-to-45mm-deep-profile.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Campagnolo-Shamal-Dual-Profile-varying-depth-wavy-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_40mm-to-45mm-deep-profile-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Campagnolo-Shamal-Dual-Profile-varying-depth-wavy-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_40mm-to-45mm-deep-profile-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Campagnolo-Shamal-Dual-Profile-varying-depth-wavy-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_40mm-to-45mm-deep-profile-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Campagnolo-Shamal-Dual-Profile-varying-depth-wavy-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_40mm-to-45mm-deep-profile-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Much of the same benefits carry over from each prior generation. You mix the stiffness of the deeper rim section, and the lightness of the lower section. Plus, now according to Campagnolo’s CFD design &amp; wind tunnel data – there’s also improved overall aerodynamic performance while being less susceptible to crosswinds.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Campagnolo-Shamal-Dual-Profile-varying-depth-wavy-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_MoMag-uninterupted-tubeless-rim-bed-without-tape.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1198\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Campagnolo-Shamal-Dual-Profile-varying-depth-wavy-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_MoMag-uninterupted-tubeless-rim-bed-without-tape.webp\" alt=\"Campy Shamal Dual-Profile aero carbon all-road wheels, MoMag tubeless without tape\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Campagnolo-Shamal-Dual-Profile-varying-depth-wavy-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_MoMag-uninterupted-tubeless-rim-bed-without-tape.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Campagnolo-Shamal-Dual-Profile-varying-depth-wavy-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_MoMag-uninterupted-tubeless-rim-bed-without-tape-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Campagnolo-Shamal-Dual-Profile-varying-depth-wavy-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_MoMag-uninterupted-tubeless-rim-bed-without-tape-1536x920.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Campagnolo-Shamal-Dual-Profile-varying-depth-wavy-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_MoMag-uninterupted-tubeless-rim-bed-without-tape-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Campagnolo-Shamal-Dual-Profile-varying-depth-wavy-aero-carbon-all-road-wheels_MoMag-uninterupted-tubeless-rim-bed-without-tape-768x460.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, add in a 23mm internal for more wide modern road tire and gravel tire compatibility.
