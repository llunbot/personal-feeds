In a blog post, the company said this functionality will be available to all Windows 11 users around the world by mid-May.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/Windows-11-Phone-Link-iMessage.jpeg\" alt width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" />\r<br />\nWith the <a href=\"https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/phone-link/9NMPJ99VJBWV\">Phone Link app for Windows 11</a> and the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/link-to-windows/id6443686328\">Link to Windows app for iOS</a>, iPhone users can make and receive phone calls, send and receive text messages, and view notifications directly on their PC. Notably, this means Windows 11 kind of supports iMessage, although there are several limitations, including a lack of support for group chats, photos, videos, and conversation history beyond the current chat session.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll messages appear as gray bubbles in the Phone Link app, meaning iMessages and SMS text messages cannot be differentiated on a PC. In addition, messages are only delivered to a PC while the iPhone is connected via Bluetooth. Microsoft says the iPhone must be running iOS 14 or later, and this feature is not available for the iPad or Mac.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMicrosoft had been testing iPhone support for the Phone Link app in beta <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/28/microsoft-windows-imessage/\">since February</a>.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/microsoft/\">Microsoft</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/imessage/\">iMessage</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/windows/\">Windows</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/26/microsoft-rolling-out-phone-link-imessage/\">Microsoft Now Rolling Out iMessage Support on Windows With Several Limitations</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/microsoft-now-rolling-out-imessage-support-on-windows-with-several-limitations.2387882/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"30aa9ad9cff9348c0b63e76ba7cc7c237d0651cfb3b8d27d2153e47de61a6219","category":"Apple"}
