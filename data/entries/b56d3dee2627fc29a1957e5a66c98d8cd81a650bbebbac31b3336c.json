One of my favorite items from the company is a smart door lock that combines three products in one, and it's now discounted by 15 percent.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3ZGH77s\" target=\"_blank\">Eufy Security S330</a> integrates a fingerprint keyless entry door lock, a smart lock that can be accessed via your phone or keypad, and an integrated smart doorbell with a chime and camera to detect visitors at your front door. The S330 isn't at the lowest price we've ever seen, but it still knocks $53 off the cost of this all-in-one front door smart home accessory. If you don't need a three-in-one lock, Eufy also sells standalone smart deadbolts, doorbells, and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Jjzxu4\" target=\"_blank\">cameras</a> at various prices.</p>\n<h2>Eufy Security products for your front door</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Eufy Security S330 Smart Video Lock for $297 (was $350) at <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3ZGH77s\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>: </strong>Eufy's S330 is more than just a smart deadbolt for your home. This Wi-Fi-connected lock integrates a fingerprint reader for easy access, a smart doorbell with a 2K camera to monitor your front entryway, and a keypad with chime. A traditional key can also be used to access your home. One of the nicest things about Eufy compared to some competitors is that no subscription is required to access these smart features, including video recording and live feeds. You can store your video footage locally on a memory card in the included doorbell chime.</li>\n<li><strong>Eufy Security C210 Smart Lock for $100 after coupon (was $140) at <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3JhFzvq\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>:</strong> If you don't need all the bells and whistles of the Eufy Security S33 and would prefer a simpler smart lock, the C210 is a deadbolt with a keypad on the front, a key slot for traditional access, and Wi-Fi connectivity that eliminates the need for a hub or bridge. Eufy promises access to your home in five different ways, including through the Eufy Security app, the keypad or a physical key, your Apple Watch, or Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.</li>\n<li><strong>Eufy Security Dual Camera Video Doorbell for $150 after coupon (was $200) at <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3YHxPHH\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>:</strong> Eufy's Dual Camera Video Doorbell sets itself apart from the competition with its dual-camera setup designed to deter porch pirates. This model comes with a traditional forward-facing 2K camera to check for visitors and alert you when someone is at the door, but it also includes a bottom-mounted camera that's ideally placed to monitor packages and notify you if you have a delivery. It's perfect for online shoppers.</li>\n<li><strong>Eufy Security Video Doorbell (Battery) for $80 after coupon (was $100) at <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3L2zOms\">Amazon</a>: </strong>For those who prefer simplicity, this video doorbell is battery operated, meaning you won't have to mess with wiring inside your home, and it comes with an FHD 1080p resolution camera. While affordable, the Eufy Security Video Doorbell comes with AI-driven features that will detect if there's a human presence at your door. Eufy also includes a wireless chime in the package.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><i>The coupons referenced in our deals do not require a specific code.
