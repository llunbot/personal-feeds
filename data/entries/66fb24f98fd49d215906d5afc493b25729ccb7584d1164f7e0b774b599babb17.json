It has 120 mm front/rear travel and is built in-house at Starling in Bristol, UK. At the risk of spoiling the punchline, the frame is now available to order via Starling Cycles, alongside a range of 32”-specific components, including the IntendBC Samurai fork and Maxxis Aspen tyre.</p>\n<p>But, does that mean Joe and the team are 100% convinced with 32”? No, not entirely.</p>\n<p>In Joe’s words: “It’s really fun to ride. But in my opinion, 32” doesn’t make mountain biking more fun, more affordable, or more accessible to more people. In the short term, people with money can gain an advantage (if there is one), but this is lost if everyone is forced to change wheel size and we end up back where we started. It potentially devalues the perfectly good wheel sizes that came before it.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Starling-Cycles-Big-Bird-21.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Starling-Cycles-Big-Bird-21.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Starling-Cycles-Big-Bird-21.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Starling-Cycles-Big-Bird-21.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Starling-Cycles-Big-Bird-35.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Starling-Cycles-Big-Bird-35.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Starling-Cycles-Big-Bird-35.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Starling-Cycles-Big-Bird-35.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>“But it seems the change is coming, and as a small company, we can get ahead of the curve, so we’re interested to give it a go. I’m an engineer, I like to make things and test them out.”</p>\n<p>Building the frame was pretty straightforward. Starling builds many of its own frames in-house in Bristol and can make small batches, limited editions, experiments, and one-offs. They call these their ‘RARE’ frames.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Starling-Cycles-Big-Bird-10.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Starling-Cycles-Big-Bird-10.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Starling-Cycles-Big-Bird-10.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Starling-Cycles-Big-Bird-10.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Starling-Cycles-Big-Bird-38.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Starling-Cycles-Big-Bird-38.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Starling-Cycles-Big-Bird-38.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Starling-Cycles-Big-Bird-38.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Starling-Cycles-Big-Bird-35.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Starling-Cycles-Big-Bird-35.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Starling-Cycles-Big-Bird-35.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Starling-Cycles-Big-Bird-35.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>They started with the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/starling-cycles-murmur-v3-review\" target=\"_blank\">Murmur</a> (Starling’s 29” frame) as the base and adapted the front end for the bigger wheel. The axle of a 32” wheel is approximately 40 mm higher than a 29er, so the headtube went up to accommodate that. They also reduced the reach a little to account for that higher front end. A standard large Murmur is 485 mm, the Big Bird gets 470 mm.</p>\n<p>But why no 32” rear wheel? This was part engineering and part rider preference. It was more straightforward to build and didn’t need Starling to reinvent its swingarm. Plus, the crew really likes mixed-wheels, and keeping the rear end as playful as possible felt like a good move.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Starling-Cycles-Big-Bird-23.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Starling-Cycles-Big-Bird-23.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Starling-Cycles-Big-Bird-23.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Starling-Cycles-Big-Bird-23.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>A far bigger challenge was the components. Right now, 32” components are rarer than unicorn eggs, even less so if you want some choice about what you run. Starling went with a prototype 32” <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/intend-bc-samurai-32er-suspension-fork\" target=\"_blank\">IntendBC Samurai 120 mm fork</a>, made using an adapted 29” fork with extended dropouts. Wheels were handmade by <a href=\"https://www.ryanbuildswheels.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">RyanBuildsWheels</a> using Nextie carbon rims and Hope Hubs. Tires are especially rare, and the fast-rolling Maxxis Aspen is one of the few 32″ options available.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Starling-Cycles-Big-Bird-44.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Starling-Cycles-Big-Bird-44.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Starling-Cycles-Big-Bird-44.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Starling-Cycles-Big-Bird-44.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Starling-Big-Bird-Geometry.png?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Starling-Big-Bird-Geometry.png?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Starling-Big-Bird-Geometry.png?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/Starling-Big-Bird-Geometry.png?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://starlingcycles.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=75e3abf73a2481bd50882028b&amp;id=aaff854058&amp;e=9af8f37410\" target=\"_blank\">Starling Cycles</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/starling-big-bird-32er\">Starling Big Bird Uses a 32er Front Wheel and IntendBC Samurai Fork</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cms.theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"66fb24f98fd49d215906d5afc493b25729ccb7584d1164f7e0b774b599babb17","category":"Cycling"}
