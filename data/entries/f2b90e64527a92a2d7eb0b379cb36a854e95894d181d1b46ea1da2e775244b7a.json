{"title":"Google to Delete Search Data From Tens of Millions of Users Who Used ‘Incognito’ Mode in Chrome","link":"https://www.npr.org/2024/04/01/1242019127/google-incognito-mode-settlement-search-history","date":1712104012000,"content":"\n<p>Bobby Allyn, reporting for NPR:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Google will destroy the private browsing history of millions of \npeople who used “incognito” mode in its Chrome browser as a part \nof <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24527110-google-unopposed-settlement\">a settlement</a> filed to federal court on Monday in a \ncase over the company’s secret tracking of web activity. For \nyears, Google simply informed users of Chrome’s internet browser \nthat “you’ve gone Incognito” and “now you can browse privately,” \nwhen the supposedly untraceable browsing option was turned on — without saying what bits of data the company has been harvesting. </p>\n\n<p>Yet, according to <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24527422-amended-google-complaint\">a 2020 class-action lawsuit</a>, the tech \ngiant continued to scrape searches by hoovering up data about \nusers who browsed the internet in incognito mode through \nadvertising tools used by websites, grabbing “potentially \nembarrassing” searches of millions of people. Google then used \nthis data to measure web traffic and sell ads. [...] </p>\n\n<p>As the suit was pending, Google changed the splash screen of \nincognito mode to state that websites, employers and schools and \ninternet service providers can view browsing activity in incognito \nmode. But under the deal, Google will have to state that the \ncompany itself can also track browsing during incognito mode. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That was quite the omission. I’m not sure there was ever a product in history more purposefully misleadingly named than Chrome’s “Incognito” mode.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/02/google-incognito\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f2b90e64527a92a2d7eb0b379cb36a854e95894d181d1b46ea1da2e775244b7a","category":"Tech"}
