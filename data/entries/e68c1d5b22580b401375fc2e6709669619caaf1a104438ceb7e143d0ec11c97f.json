There’s been quite a lot of racing since the last edition. Following their victories at the Amstel Gold Race, which marked the opener for Ardennes Week, both Demi Vollering (SD Worx) and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/tadej-pogacar-greatest-of-all-time\" target=\"_blank\">Tadej Pogačar</a> (UAE Team Emirates) won La Flèche Wallonne.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conversation quickly turned to whether the duo could complete the triple and win all three of the Ardennes Classics races in the same season, a feat only completed by Anna van der Breggen with Boels-Dolmans in 2017, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/philippe-gilbert-interview\" target=\"_blank\">Philippe Gilbert</a> for Silence-Lotto in 2011 and Davide Rebellin for Gerolsteiner in 2004.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><p><em>Results powered by <a href=\"https://firstcycling.com/race.php?r=9052&amp;y=2023\" target=\"_blank\">FirstCycling.com</a></em></p></div>\n\n\n\n<div><p><em>Results powered by <a href=\"https://firstcycling.com/race.php?r=11&amp;y=2023\" target=\"_blank\">FirstCycling.com</a></em></p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Demi Vollering won Liège-Bastogne-Liège in a sprint against Elisa Longo Borghini (Trek-Segafredo) to complete the set on her side, but Remco Evenepoel (Soudal-QuickStep) soloed to victory in the men’s race ahead of Tom Pidcock (Ineos Grenadiers) and Santiago Buitrago (Bahrain Victorious).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1.

It’s the cherry on top of a phenomenal Classics campaign for the 26-year-old. Since winning Strade Bianche at the beginning of March, Vollering has either won or placed second in every race she has participated in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her star continues to rise and rise. Up next on her calendar is the first women’s Grand Tour of the year in La Vuelta Femenina.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Tadej Pogačar breaks hand during Liège-Bastogne-Liège</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><div> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CrauTymMVg2/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"> <div> <div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div><div></div> <div></div><div> <div>View this post on Instagram</div></div><div></div> <div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></a><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CrauTymMVg2/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by Tadej Pogačar (@tadejpogacar)</a></p></div></blockquote> </div>\n\n\n\n<p>After Vollering’s success, all eyes turned to Tadej Pogačar to repeat the feat. It was not to be. Before live images were broadcast, EF Education-EasyPost’s Mikkel Honoré crashed hard, with Pogačar caught behind with no way out. Pogačar fractured multiple bones in his wrist and, after having successful surgery yesterday, will be out for four to six weeks. Education-EasyPost last reported that Honoré has a concussion and is undergoing further tests on elbow and shoulder injuries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s an abrupt end to the winning rampage Pogačar was unleashing on the peloton. The 24-year-old had already won 12 races this season before his crash at La Doyenne, looking in sensational form ahead of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tour-de-france\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de France</a> in July. He congratulated Evenepoel and posted a photo of his cast on Instagram, saying ‘shit happens’ and that Remco’s and his ‘battle will wait until next time’. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3.

Vuelta a España 2023 official song </h2>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>More races should have official songs. For the 2023 <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/vuelta-a-espana\" target=\"_blank\">Vuelta a España</a>, which begins in Barcelona on the 26<sup>th</sup> August, the official song will be ‘Corazón sin Salida’ by Spanish band Estopa. It was revealed at the Barcelona Open tennis tournament. The song is described as an ode to emotions and optimism and was released as part of the album Fuego in 2019. The music video (above) was created during lockdown in 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Estopa is a Spanish band consisting of brothers José Manuel and David Muñoz from Barcelona. Their first album Estopa was released in 1999 and sold two million copies, setting the Spanish record at the time for the highest-selling debut from a group. The band’s style is a combination of flamenco and urban rhumba.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I propose Måneskin for the next edition of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/giro-ditalia\" target=\"_blank\">Giro d’Italia</a>.
