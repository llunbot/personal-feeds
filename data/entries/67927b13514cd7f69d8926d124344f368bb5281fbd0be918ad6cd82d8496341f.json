Almost 4,000 dealers from around the United States have sent an open letter to President Joe Biden calling for the government to slow down <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/04/automakers-may-have-to-sell-4x-more-evs-under-new-proposed-cafe-rules/\">its plan to increase EV adoption between now and 2032</a>.</p>\n<p>Despite our robust economy, the US trails both Europe and China in terms of EV adoption. More and more car buyers are opting to go fully electric each year, although <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2023/11/23/us-electric-vehicle-sales-2023-record/\">even a record 2023</a> will fail to see EV uptake reach double-digit percentages.</p>\n<p>Mindful of the fact that transportation accounts for the largest segment of US carbon emissions and that our car-centric society encourages driving, the US Department of Energy published a proposed rule in April that would alter the way the government calculates each automaker's corporate average fuel efficiency. If adopted, the new rule would require OEMs to sell many more EVs to avoid large fines. This is in addition to an earlier goal from the White House that calls for <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/08/biden-reveals-lackluster-new-ev-policy-no-plans-to-phase-out-gasoline/\">one in two new cars sold in 2030</a> to be EVs.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1986891#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1986891&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
