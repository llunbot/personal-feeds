The software comes a week after the release of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/23/apple-releases-visionos-1-0-1/\">visionOS 1.0.1 update</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/Apple-Vision-Pro-with-battery-Feature-Blue-Magenta.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThere is no word on what is included in ‌visionOS‌ 1.0.2, and while the Vision Pro has yet to be released, review units are in the hands of members of the media, and they will be able to download and install this update.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌visionOS‌ 1.0.2 <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT214070\">addresses a WebKit vulnerability</a> that Apple says may have been actively exploited. The issue was also fixed in ‌visionOS‌ 1.0.1 for developers, but the fix is in ‌visionOS‌ 1.0.2 for those updating from ‌visionOS‌ 1.0.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is worth noting that Vision Pro owners will have a day one update to install this software when they begin receiving their headsets on Friday.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Vision Pro will ship with version one of the ‌visionOS‌ software, but we are expecting to see ‌visionOS‌ 2 with new features at WWDC in June.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/\">visionOS</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/31/apple-releases-visionos-1-0-2/\">Apple Releases visionOS 1.0.2 Two Days Before Vision Pro Launch</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-visionos-1-0-2-two-days-before-vision-pro-launch.2417983/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"fea3981639d141ad7e1816e63c15d08439462f75e618fe8083d8e28120295257","category":"Apple"}
