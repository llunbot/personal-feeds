This could mean another delay-stricken Christmas, following problems in <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/677971/severe-christmas-shortages-predicted-for-apple.html\">2021</a> and, to a lesser extent, <a href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/11/06/apple-confirms-chinese-factorys-iphone-14-pro-output-hit-by-covid-restrictions\">2022</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As in 2021, multiple factors are combining to give Apple headaches–several of them, we should stress, causing far more serious harm to affected parties than merely slowing the distribution of smartphones. Hurricane Helene, for instance, has caused the closure of a quartz mine which is crucial to Apple’s semiconductor supply. A factory in India has been <a href=\"https://www.cultofmac.com/news/apple-might-rely-china-iphone-parts-fire-destroys-indian-factory\" target=\"_blank\">destroyed by fire</a>, necessitating a shift in manufacturing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dock workers in the U.S. have gone on strike, and this will have more effect than it would in previous years because of Apple’s push to become carbon neutral and use ocean shipping instead of air where possible. And worldwide economic conditions are uncertain, which could reduce the appetite for new iPhones (and ironically help Apple to cope with demand) but may also hamstring the company’s funding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just one of these factors would make life difficult over the notoriously demanding holiday shopping period, which Apple’s product launch calendar is built around. But all of them together almost certainly means stock shortages and shipping delays. So it’s probably wise to buy sooner than later if you want an iPhone in time for Christmas.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"d17ac97d2482c5fb6d7c90d8877e568230a633c943fec9dd3e5da063720de141","category":"Apple"}
