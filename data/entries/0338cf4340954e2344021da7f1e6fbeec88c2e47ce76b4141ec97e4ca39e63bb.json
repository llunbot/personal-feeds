I used that jacket on just about every ride, tossing it in a handlebar or hip bag, any time I pedaled into the unknown microclimates of the coastal California mountain ranges and beyond. Then, one day at a bike event, it went missing. It’s been a while since Search and State have made the S1-J but it’s back this year after a two-year hiatus. Take it from someone who let one get away, don’t miss this opportunity if you’re shopping for a new jacket…</p>\n<p><strong>Specs:</strong><br />\nDurability: Ultra High<br />\nFabric: Synthetic Blend with an Active Climate Membrane for all-season performance.<br />\nCare: Easy<br />\nFit: True to Size – refined, slimming, and plenty aero.<br />\nBest For: All riding in all seasons.<br />\nTemperature Range: 32’F-65’F<br />\nRetail: $275.00</p>\n<p>See more at <a href=\"https://searchandstate.com/products/s1-j-riding-jacket/?mc_cid=626ad78197&amp;mc_eid=0293dfd496\" target=\"_blank\">Search and State</a>.</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"0338cf4340954e2344021da7f1e6fbeec88c2e47ce76b4141ec97e4ca39e63bb","category":"Cycling"}
