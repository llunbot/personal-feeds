The recall initially only applied to owners of the faulty cranksets in the US, but has since been rolled out into Europe, with further territories to folllow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Update 17:18 BST: Shimano has put together <a href=\"https://bike.shimano.com/en-US/information/customer-services/corrective-actions/11-speed-hollowtech-ii-crankset-recall-notice.html\" target=\"_blank\">a detailed guide</a> for riders worried about their cranks.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"766\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/04032036/shimano_dura-ace_chainset_and_power_meter_1-970x766.jpg\" alt=\"shimano_dura-ace_chainset_and_power_meter_1\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/04032036/shimano_dura-ace_chainset_and_power_meter_1-970x766.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/04032036/shimano_dura-ace_chainset_and_power_meter_1-300x237.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/04032036/shimano_dura-ace_chainset_and_power_meter_1-768x607.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/04032036/shimano_dura-ace_chainset_and_power_meter_1-750x593.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/02/04032036/shimano_dura-ace_chainset_and_power_meter_1.jpg 1000w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>However, only consumers whose cranksets show signs of bonding separation or delamination during the inspection will be provided a free replacement crankset and installation, and replacements will consist of adjusted current generation cranksets paired with 11-speed chainrings, as opposed to a like-for-like replacement. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users with affected power-equipped cranks will receive the same approved replacements along with a voucher to offset the cost of replacing the meter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Should the cranks fit the production criteria but not show signs of fault, users are free to carry on riding them, albeit with the advice to regularly inspect them.

While that absolute number is high, due to the volume these cranksets have been sold in the figure represents a less than 1% failure rate. </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/shimano-cranks-recall\">Shimano recalls 760,000 Dura-Ace and Ultegra cranks after thousands of failures</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Sam Challis &#124; Tech Editor","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"fe5fa73154334d4c782311ab14a113b83c77d6dd95a66d98fa3cb6c821914a23","category":"Cycling"}
