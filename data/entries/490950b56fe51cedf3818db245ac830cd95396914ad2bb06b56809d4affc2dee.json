No matter how much time has passed since your last playthrough, those same old test chambers will feel a bit too familiar if you revisit them today.</p>\n<p>Over the years, community mods like <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/317400/Portal_Stories_Mel/\"><em>Portal Stories: Mel</em></a> and <em>Portal: Revolution</em> have tried to fix this problem with extensive work on completely new levels and puzzles. Now, though, a much simpler mod is looking to recapture that \"first time\" feeling simply by adding random gameplay modifiers to <em>Portal</em>'s familiar puzzle rooms.</p>\n<p>The <em>Portal Randomized</em> demo <a href=\"https://www.moddb.com/mods/portal-randomized/downloads/portal-randomized-demo\">recently posted on ModDB</a> activates one of eight gameplay modifiers when you enter one of the game's first two test chambers. The results, while still a little rough around the edges, show how much extra longevity can be wrung from simple tweaks to existing gameplay.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/how-portal-randomized-breathes-new-life-into-a-pc-gaming-classic/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/how-portal-randomized-breathes-new-life-into-a-pc-gaming-classic/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"490950b56fe51cedf3818db245ac830cd95396914ad2bb06b56809d4affc2dee","category":"Tech"}
