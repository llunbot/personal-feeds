There is no Apple Watch charging available with the new BoostCharge Pro, and because this is a flat charger, it is not compatible with the StandBy mode coming to the ‌iPhone‌ in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe AirPods charging station can also be used to charge other Qi-based devices such as an additional ‌iPhone‌, albeit at a slower speed than ‌MagSafe‌. The 2-in-1 Charging Pad is available in either black or white, and it has a slim design that is ideal for travel.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe BoostCharge Pro 2-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad can be <a href=\"https://www.belkin.com/2-in-1-wireless-charging-pad-with-official-magsafe-charging-15w/P-WIZ019.html\">purchased from the Belkin website</a> for $80.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/belkin/\">Belkin</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/02/belkin-launches-2-in-1-charging-pad/\">Belkin Launches New 2-in-1 MagSafe Charging Pad</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/belkin-launches-new-2-in-1-magsafe-charging-pad.2397576/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"10e694672310a163fcdddbf7778b59d296f936c8d47633217049603bc50294c2","category":"Apple"}
