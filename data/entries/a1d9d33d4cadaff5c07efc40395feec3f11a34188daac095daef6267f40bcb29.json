The capital of Galicia hosts the conclusive Vuelta stage for the third time, after</span><span> staging the culminating time trials in 1993 and 2014.

The road is initially flat, but after 10km it punches uphill. The climb is short at 1.7km, but averages a tricky 7.5%. The riders reach the first time check at kilometre 13.</span></p>\n<p><span>Much of the next section is downhill, with the riders passing through the village of </span><span>Bertamiráns 23km into the stage. The road then punches uphill for 1km at 6% on average, where they'll reach the second intermediate at kilometre 25.</span></p>\n<p><span>Following a plateau section, the road rises via numerous steps to the finish in Santiago de Compostela. The final kilometre in the city is technical, with plenty of corners, a changeable road surface and narrow roads.</span></p>\n<p><span>The riders will climb more than 600 metres over the time trial. Although the stage winner must be a capable climber, the most important factor is their ability on the time trial bike.</span></p>\n<h4><b>Contenders</b></h4>\n<p><i><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GettyImages-1334143806-min_1024x1024.jpg?v=1630665380\" />Primož Roglič is looking to seal a third consecutive Vuelta a España title (Image credit: Stuart Franklin/Getty Images)</span></i></p>\n<p>Due to his sizeable lead,<b><span> </span>Primož Roglič</b><span> only needs to make it round the course safely to secure a third consecutive red jersey. He looked to have the Tour de France wrapped up in 2020 before losing out in a time trial. His victory isn't guaranteed</span><span>, but a repeat is highly improbable. </span>His two-minute and thirty second lead over Enric Mas in second place should be more than enough, even if his run is far from perfect. At his best, <span>Roglič</span><span> can gain more than a minute on all of his GC rivals. He do</span><span>esn’t need to attack the stage to secure red, but if he does, he’s the favourite to win his fourth stage of the race.</span></p>\n<p><span>However, the battle for the podium places could be much closer. Movistar’s </span><b>Enric Mas</b><b><span> </span></b><span>starts within three minutes of Roglič, but after stage 20 Movistar no longer hold second and third overall. Mas is a much more consistent time trialist than López, who dropped out of the race in stage 20, so his two minute lead over Jack Haig should be enough to hold onto second overall.</span><span> If Mas does hold his position, it'd be a very successful day for Movistar.</span></p>\n<p><span>With Mas looking over his shoulder, </span><b>Jack Haig</b><span> and </span><b>Egan Bernal</b>, who are closest to him in the general classification,<span> could be licking their lips.</span><span> Bernal and Haig will hunt Mas<em> en route</em> to Santiago de Compostela.</span></p>\n<p><b>Adam Yates, Sepp Kuss</b><span> and </span><b>Gino Mäder<span> </span></b><span>will battle for the other places in the top ten. </span><span>Further down, <strong>David de la Cruz</strong> looks to jump ahead of </span><b>Louis Meintjes<span> </span></b><span>and </span><b>Guillaume Martin<span> </span></b>into the top ten.<span> The Spaniard is a strong time trialist, which means he could gain numerous positions on the final day.</span></p>\n<p>Alex Aranburu<span> was closest to Roglič in the stage one Burgos time trial, but he has since abandoned the race. Ineos Grenadiers’</span><span> </span>Dylan van Baarle<span> is another who could’ve threatened Roglič, but has departed.</span></p>\n<p><i><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GettyImages-1310921806-min_1024x1024.jpg?v=1630665405\" />Josef Černý is a stage contender (Image credit: David Ramos/Getty Images)</span></i></p>\n<p><span>Instead, Deceuninck - Quick Step’s </span><b>Josef<span> </span><span>Černý </span></b><span>could be Roglič's closest challenger. The Czech time trial champion was fifth in Burgos, ten seconds behind Roglič. That was Černý's best TT result this season, bar his national championships victory. The 28-year-old is competing in his third Grand Tour. In his previous two, he finished sixth on the stage 21 time trial. Can he improve to finish in the top five this year?</span></p>\n<p><span>Roglič's compatriot </span><b>Jan Tratnik</b><span> is another potential challenger. Tratnik defeated Jan Polanc and Tadej Pogačar to win the Slovenian national championships in June. Could he beat another Slovenian in Santiago de Compostela to win his first stage at La Vuelta a España? </span></p>\n<p><span>Other riders with a chance include </span><b>Lawson Craddock, </b><strong>Tobias Ludvigsson, </strong><b>Tom Scully<span> </span></b><span>and </span><b>Chad Haga</b><span>. Haga won the stage 21 time trial at the Giro d’Italia in 2019, though his best WorldTour result since is seventh. The American is Team DSM's best chance of claiming an incredible fourth stage win.</span></p>\n<h4><span>Prediction</span></h4>\n<p><span>While </span>Primož Roglič can ride well within himself, and remain cautious to retain his red jersey, the Slovenian has proven himself to be a showman as well as a once-in-a-generation time triallist. So Roglič is our pick for the final stage of the 2021 Vuelta a España, sealing his GC victory in style.</p>\n<p><i><span>Cover image: Stuart Franklin/Getty Images</span></i></p>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Peter Stuart","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"a1d9d33d4cadaff5c07efc40395feec3f11a34188daac095daef6267f40bcb29","category":"Cycling"}
