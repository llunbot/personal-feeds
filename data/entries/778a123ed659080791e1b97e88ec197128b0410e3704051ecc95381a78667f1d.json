What if That Changes?”:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Bezos has given the paper the resources to be bigger and better,\nand, by most accounts, pretty much stayed out of the newsroom’s\nhair, besides appearing one day to present a bicycle to former\neditor Marty Baron. The Amazon boss has never been an overtly\npolitical man, except to the extent that he supports whatever\nhelps him stay rich and take over the world with his robotic form\nof ultra-capitalism. But he is not inclined to spend his time on\nthe phone haranguing Post editors about coverage decisions. When\nyou are worth close to $200 billion, your time is too valuable\nfor that.</p>\n\n<p>There is no guarantee, however, that that will always be\ntrue. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Discussing this question with nuance is not easy. The paper will\nalways say that Bezos does not interfere. Bezos himself will\nalways say that he does not interfere. Factions of the public on\nthe right and the left will always hold that Bezos’s ownership\ninherently corrupts the paper’s coverage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I do give Bezos credit for taking public ownership of his assertion of control over the paper’s opinion pages now. This is a major change, and he’s not trying to hide it or shy away from responsibility for it.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/28/what-if-indeed\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"778a123ed659080791e1b97e88ec197128b0410e3704051ecc95381a78667f1d","category":"Tech"}
