{"title":"‘An Experiment in Lust, Regret, and Kissing’","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/20/opinion/beach-read-ai.html","date":1724693854000,"content":"\n<p>Novelist Curtis Sittenfeld, writing for The New York Times:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This summer, I agreed to a literary experiment with Times Opinion:\nWhat is the difference between a story written by a human and a\nstory written by artificial intelligence?</p>\n\n<p>We decided to hold a contest between ChatGPT and me, to see who\ncould write — or “write” — a better beach read. I thought going\nhead-to-head with the machine would give us real answers about\nwhat A.I. is and isn’t currently capable of and, of course, how\nbig a threat it is to human writers. And if you’ve wondered, as I\nhave, what exactly makes something a beach read — frothy themes\nor sand under your feet? — we set out to get to the bottom of\nthat, too. [...]</p>\n\n<p>As for the results of the contest — which one was the better\nstory — I invite you to be the judge. My story and ChatGPT’s\nstory are below. Read to the bottom to find out which is which.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I guessed correctly, and was pretty sure about my guess. But not certain. And without question, I enjoyed Sittenfeld’s story more.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/08/26/sittenfeld-chatgpt-writeoff\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"4b5f0d17f2afa7b99048235f87f2a19d97363f2d2b53ba95a24a707c12fe8760","category":"Tech"}
