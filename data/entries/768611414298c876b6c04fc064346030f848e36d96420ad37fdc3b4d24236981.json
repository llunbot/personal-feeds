After listening to feedback, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/ios-15-safari-address-search-bar-top/\">added a toggle</a> to show the address bar at the top of the ‌iPhone‌ rather than the bottom, for users who preferred the more iOS 14-like experience. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's not clear whether Chrome will roll out the change to all users – Google tried a similar change in Chrome for Android in 2017, then subsequently removed the feature. However, with iPhone screens historically getting iteratively bigger, many will likely welcome the change, should it stick.\r<br />\n<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google-chrome/\">Google Chrome</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/24/chrome-testing-bottom-placed-url-bar/\">Google's Chrome Browser Testing Bottom-Placed Address Bar on iOS</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/googles-chrome-browser-testing-bottom-placed-address-bar-on-ios.2399497/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"768611414298c876b6c04fc064346030f848e36d96420ad37fdc3b4d24236981","category":"Apple"}
