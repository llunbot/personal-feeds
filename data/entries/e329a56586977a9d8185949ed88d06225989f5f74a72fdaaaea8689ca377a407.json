For a fixed budget, you’ll certainly get a better-specced hardtail for your money, although an entry-level full-suspension bike might still be more capable on rougher trails.</p>\n<p>Again, it comes back to what kind of riding you enjoy. In a game of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/hardtail-vs-full-suspension-mountain-bike-which-is-best-on-a-budget/\">hardtail vs full-suspension</a>, a hardtail tends to win for climbing, with a direct connection from crank to axle giving a more efficient response to pedalling, as well as being a little lighter.</p>\n<p>Hardtails are easier to maintain too, needing less intensive servicing, as well as tending to be more budget-friendly.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Orange Alpine Evo LE enduro mountain bike\" title=\"Orange Alpine Evo LE enduro mountain bike-29\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Full-suspension mountain bikes are more capable on technical terrain.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Some people recommend the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-hardtail-mountain-bikes/\">best hardtail mountain bikes</a> for beginner riders, because they’ll teach you about the importance of line choice.</p>\n<p>Affordable beginner bikes will often have quite conservative geometry and basic kit, while more specialised ‘hardcore hardtail’ options will have longer and slacker geometry, along with burlier parts to help them handle better at speed and in the rough.</p>\n<p>Full-suspension mountain bikes really excel when things get rougher, so if you think you’ll be wanting to tackle more technical trails and features, then you might want to consider one.</p>\n<p>You can read up on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/the-ultimate-guide-to-mountain-bike-rear-suspension-systems/\">mountain bike rear-suspension systems</a> before you buy to check out the different options and how they work.</p>\n<p>However, the good news is that, these days, the vast majority of rear-suspension designs work pretty well. Shortlisting bikes based on their linkage doesn’t make sense unless you’re after a specific ride characteristic.</p>\n\n<h3>How much suspension travel do I need?</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Cube Stereo 120 HPC TM full suspension mountain bike\" title=\"Cube Stereo 120 HPC TM - 02\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Deciding on the amount of travel you need can be difficult.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>It’s a frequently asked question: <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/how-much-suspension-travel-do-i-need-on-my-mountain-bike/\">how much suspension travel do I need</a>?</p>\n<p>Less suspension travel usually means a lighter, faster bike uphill. More travel equals better downhill capability. If you’re new to the sport and want to try a bit of everything, then a mid-travel trail bike is the best all-rounder.</p>\n<p>Generally speaking, the amount of suspension travel is a good indicator of which category a bike falls into.</p>\n<h4>60-110mm: Cross-country race bike</h4>\n<ul><li><strong>Trail types:</strong> Fast-flowing, smooth</li>\n<li><strong>Excels:</strong> Climbing and acceleration</li>\n</ul><p>Roughly speaking, with 60-110mm of travel, you’ll get a cross-country race bike, which excels at climbing and rapid acceleration on fast-flowing and smooth trails.</p>\n<h4>110-130mm: Cross-country/trail bike</h4>\n<ul><li><strong>Trail types:</strong> Purpose-built loops and less rocky natural routes</li>\n<li><strong>Excels:</strong> Covering distance fast</li>\n</ul><p>Moving up to 110-130mm of travel, you can cover distance fast on a cross-country, downcountry or short-travel trail bike, taking in both purpose-built loops and less technical natural trails.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Female cyclist in green riding the Juliana Wilder CC X01 AXS TR Reserve full suspension women's mountain bike downhill over rough ground\" title=\"Juliana Wilder CC X01 AXS TR Reserve 02\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> What type of riding do you intend to do on your bike?</span></figcaption><span> <i>Our Media</i></span></div>\n<h4>130-160mm: Trail bike</h4>\n<ul><li><strong>Trail types:</strong> More technical tracks with some bigger features</li>\n<li><strong>Excels:</strong> Equally capable up and downhill</li>\n</ul><p>A trail bike with between 130 and 160mm travel will be able to take on more technical tracks, including some larger features, and will be equally capable up and downhill.</p>\n<h4>160-180mm: Enduro bike</h4>\n<ul><li><strong>Trail types:</strong> Steep, gnarly off-piste; rocky tech; bike park tracks</li>\n<li><strong>Excels:</strong> Rapid on the descents, but can still be pedalled back to the top</li>\n</ul><p>When you move up to the 160-180mm bracket with enduro bikes, you sacrifice some of the pedalling efficiency to be able to excel on steep, gnarly off-piste trails, rocky tech and bike park tracks.</p>\n<h4>180-200mm: Downhill race bike</h4>\n<ul><li><strong>Trail types:</strong> The fastest, roughest descents known to man!</li>\n<li><strong>Excels:</strong> Descending; there’s no way you’re pedalling one uphill</li>\n</ul><p>Forget pedalling back up to the trailhead when it comes to downhill race bikes. With around 180-200mm of travel, these are designed purely for going downhill, taking in the fastest and roughest descents.</p>\n<h3>What wheel size should I choose?</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"844\" height=\"563\" alt=\"29in, 27.5in and 26in mountain bike wheel sizes\" title=\"29in, 27.5in and 26in mountain bike wheel sizes\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> 29in, 27.5in and 26in mountain bike wheel sizes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>BikeRadar</i></span></div>\n<p>For a long time, 26in <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/mtb/mountain-bike-wheel-sizes-26in-650b-and-29in-explained/\">mountain bike wheels</a> were the standard, but with the exception of dirt-jump and slopestyle bikes, they’ve been phased out in favour of larger, faster-rolling hoops.</p>\n<p>Any new adult bike will likely come with either 27.5in (also known as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/what-is-650b/\">650b</a>) or 29in-diameter wheels. If our local trails are anything to go by, the market is now split roughly 50/50.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/what-is-a-29er/\">29er wheels</a> have the advantages of carrying momentum better, rolling over obstacles more easily and providing more traction (due to the longer contact patch of their tyres).</p>\n<p>The disadvantages are that the bigger wheels accelerate slower, take more effort to slow down and are harder to initiate a turn with. This isn’t a problem in most scenarios, but if you have quite a dynamic riding style or like to ride trails that are tight, twisting and steep, then 650b can be preferable.</p>\n<p>Early 29ers had some handling quirks, but modern geometry means they now ride as well as smaller-wheeled bikes.</p>\n<p>The extra height of 29in wheels is a factor to consider though, especially if you’re not very tall. Summed up in one line, we’d say 650b is fun, 29in is fast – which, of course, can also be fun…</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/what-is-faster-mullet-bike-29er/\">Mullet bikes</a> use different-sized wheels at either end of the bike, most commonly a 29in front wheel for speed and rolling over obstacles, and a 27.5in back wheel for sharp handling at the rear.</p>\n<h3>Which frame material is best?</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Specialized Stumpjumper Alloy Comp trail mountain bike\" title=\"Specialized Stumpjumper Alloy Comp trail mountain bike 07\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Aluminium is often favoured thanks to its strength and affordability.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>You have four main options when it comes to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-frame-materials/\">frame material for bikes</a>: aluminium, steel, titanium and carbon fibre.</p>\n<p>Aluminium is the most commonly used frame material for mountain bikes because it offers a good balance of strength, weight and cost.</p>\n<p>Steel is a popular choice with smaller boutique brands, not only because it’s widely available and easy to work with, but also because the same strength can be achieved with thinner-walled and smaller-diameter tubes, resulting in a desirable amount of bump-absorbing ‘compliance’ (flex). This is particularly applicable to hardtails.</p>\n<p>Titanium does the same with less of a weight penalty, but expect to pay upwards of £1,000 for a Ti frame.</p>\n<p>Carbon has long been one of the buzz words used to ‘upsell’ to bike buyers. To some extent, this is justified, because carbon fibre gives designers near-limitless control over frame shapes and ride characteristics, as well as the potential to build an incredibly light and strong chassis. This is important if you’re choosing a featherweight XC race bike.</p>\n<p>Cheaper carbon frames aren’t necessarily laid up with the same care and attention to detail, though. Also, be aware that at lower price points, brands will often spec cheaper build kits to prevent the complete bike looking too expensive compared to the next (aluminium) model down.</p>\n<p>A better-specced aluminium bike will almost always ride better than a carbon frame decked out with cheap kit.</p>\n<section><div>\n        \n<h3>A quick word about geometry</h3>\n<p>The geometry of a mountain bike is largely dictated by what discipline it’s made for, whether that’s a fast and responsive cross-country bike, a slack downhill race rig for gnarly trails or anything in between.</p>\n<p>For the sake of simplicity, we won’t go into the specifics of geometry here – it’s another complex area of mountain bike tech.</p>\n<p>However, you can check out our ultimate guide to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/the-ultimate-guide-to-bike-geometry-and-handling/\">bike geometry</a> if you want to learn more.</p>\n<p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section><h2>How to choose a mountain bike by price</h2>\n<p>Complete bikes can be divided roughly into seven price brackets, from under £500 to more than £5,000, although it’s possible to spend a lot more.</p>\n<p>Your budget will dictate the bikes available to you, whether that’s hardtail or full-suspension, different frame materials, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/drivetrains-explained-all-of-the-parts-that-make-your-bike-go/\">drivetrain</a> options and braking systems.</p>\n<p>Here’s what you can expect to find in each of these price brackets.</p>\n<h3>Mountain bikes under £500</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Voodoo's Aizan is a great budget 29er.\" title=\"aizan-1532014149385-1rabci3xsnmzj-6d2ba7e\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Voodoo’s Aizan is a great budget 29er.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Consider the £500 mark the rough starting point for a ‘proper’ mountain bike.

You should also choose a bike that comes fitted with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-brakes/\">disc brakes</a> rather than rim brakes, because they’ll keep working in the wet and provide more consistent power.</p>\n<p>As you spend more, you’ll get a bike with a lighter frame and more refined equipment.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Blue Saracen Mantra hardtail mountain bike\" title=\"Saracen Mantra 02\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Saracen Mantra is another option in this price range.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton</i></span></div>\n<p>At this price, you’ll often encounter double and triple chainsets, although it’s not uncommon to find <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/1x-drivetrains/\">1x drivetrains</a> – which offer reduced maintenance, complexity and, in many circumstances, improved performance over multi-chainring setups.</p>\n<p>The tyres fitted should have a pronounced tread profile that’s designed for proper off-road use and should be made from a softer rubber compound than basic tyres, giving better grip in the wet.</p>\n<p>A suspension fork with a smooth and controlled action should also be fitted.

We're hiring two new writers\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> When you get the size right, your bike should ride like a dream.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Behr / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Getting a bike that fits you properly is extremely important. Not only will it ensure you’re more comfortable on the bike, but you’ll also be able to ride the bike to your maximum potential.</p>\n<p>Our guide to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/sizing-and-fit/mountain-bike-sizing-what-size-bike-do-i-need/\">mountain bike sizing</a> is a good starting point – but remember, geometry and sizing aren’t consistent between brands, so always make sure to check the measurements. Don’t be tempted to compromise on fit.</p>\n<p>If it isn’t quite right for you – the top tube’s a little short or you can’t get the seat low enough, for example – it’ll affect your fun far more than a fancy paintjob and a posh suspension fork. Riding the correct-size bike will also help you position your body on technical terrain.</p>\n<p>If this is your first new bike in a while, it might surprise you how much longer they’ve got in recent years. This isn’t because we’ve all suddenly got taller, but because designers have figured out that stretched-out bikes with slacker head angles handle better at speed.</p>\n<p>Any initial awkwardness you may feel when trying to manoeuvre a bigger bike around will soon disappear (assuming it’s the right size for you) and you’ll wonder how you ever managed on that cramped little bike you had before.</p>\n<p>Traditionally, bikes were sized by seat-tube length. This is still an important factor, because you need to make sure you can get the saddle to an efficient height for pedalling, as well as drop it out of the way for descending.</p>\n<p>However, the advent of long-travel dropper seatposts has permitted bike designers to reduce seat-tube lengths. As well as giving more freedom of movement, this enables riders to ‘upsize’ to a larger frame if they want more length, or vice versa.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the most important metric when it comes to how big a bike will feel to ride is its ‘reach’ – the horizontal distance from the centre of the bottom bracket to the centre of the top of the head tube. This measurement gives a good indication of how stretched out you’ll feel when standing on the pedals.</p>\n<p>From surveying our team of <em>MBUK</em> and BikeRadar testers, we found the interesting correlation that our ideal reach in millimetres was consistently between 2.6 and 2.7 times our height in centimetres. This calculation should give you a good starting point.</p>\n<p>It’s often best to head down to your local bike shop to try the bike you’re looking at in person. If possible, try to arrange a test ride so you can see how the bike feels on the trail. Many brands have demo days, where they bring their entire range along for potential customers to try.</p>\n<p>As a general rule, if you’re after a high-end bike, many shops will be happy to tweak certain components such as the saddle, tyres or grips to the ones you prefer if it means they can seal a deal.</p>\n<p>With online or direct-sales bike shops, you don’t get the option to try before you buy, but most have a robust returns policy if you decide you’re not happy with the fit of your new machine.</p>\n<section><div>\n        \n<h3>Buying direct</h3>\n<p>More and more brands are cutting out bike shops and distributors, and selling directly to their customers, via the internet. As a buyer, there are both advantages and disadvantages to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/buying-a-bike-from-a-bike-shop-vs-buying-online/\">buying online vs buying from a bike shop</a>.</p>\n<h4>Pros</h4>\n<ul><li>You’ll get more for your money. By cutting out the middlemen, brands such as YT Industries, Canyon, Commencal, Radon and Vitus can turn out top-performing bikes with impressive build kits at extremely competitive prices</li>\n<li>Buying a new bike is quick, easy and can be done from the comfort of your sofa, assuming it’s in stock</li>\n</ul><h4>Cons</h4>\n<ul><li>There’s less chance to try before you buy. While some direct-sale brands hold occasional demo days, it’s not as convenient as dropping into your local shop and sitting on a range of different bikes. Don’t underestimate the value of this, especially if you’re unsure exactly what it is you want</li>\n<li>Lead times can be long. You’ll likely have to order your bike well ahead of time and it’s not uncommon for delivery dates to get pushed back</li>\n<li>After-sales support may not be as good. Bikes bought through your local shop will often come with the perk of a free service and, potentially, a loyalty discount on parts. Building up a good rapport with the mechanic can save a lot of stress if you need something fixing last-minute</li>\n<li>Bike shops can be valuable community hubs and great places to seek advice and meet like-minded people. Use them or lose them!</li>\n</ul><p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section><h2>What else do I need to get started?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Smith Engage helmet\" title=\"Smith Engage helmet\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A quality helmet is the first thing you’ll need before you ride.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>So you’ve made your decision on your new bike, but if you’re new to mountain biking, what else do you need to be trail-ready?</p>\n<h4>Protection</h4>\n<p>The most important thing you’ll need is a good-quality <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-helmets-for-trail-riding/\">mountain bike helmet</a>.
