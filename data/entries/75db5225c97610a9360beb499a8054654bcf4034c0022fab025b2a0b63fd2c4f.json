Specifically, the Android devices achieved up to 35% faster download speeds compared to the iPhone 16e, and up to 91% faster upload speeds. The report also found that the iPhone 16e frequently became hot to the touch during testing, but it could not confirm if this directly impacted performance.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe two Android smartphones were priced at $619 and $799 in the U.S., the report said, while the iPhone 16e starts at $599.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBased on its findings, Cellular Insights concluded that the Qualcomm-powered devices \"hold a clear edge\" over the iPhone 16e for individuals seeking \"consistent, high-throughput 5G performance.\" Qualcomm's PR department is now touting the favorable results, which they relayed to us in an email sent earlier today.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe full report is <a href=\"https://cellularinsights.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/5G-sub6-Report-Final-Cellular-Insights.pdf\">available as a PDF</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's C1 modem achieved equal to faster performance than some Qualcomm modems <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/28/apple-c1-modem-5g-speed-tests/\">in some earlier tests</a>, but a Qualcomm spokesperson said this study is the \"only comprehensive, scientific\" comparison completed on a U.S. network so far.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPerformance is not the only metric that matters for a smartphone modem, with power efficiency also being an important factor. Apple has advertised the C1 modem as being the most power-efficient iPhone modem ever, which contributes to the iPhone 16e offering the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/iphone-16e-battery-life/\">longest battery life of any 6.1-inch iPhone model ever</a>. With its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/apples-second-5g-modem-said-to-support-mmwave/\">next-generation C2 and C3 modems</a>, Apple hopes to continue to close the gap on the performance front.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/\">iPhone 16e</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/c1/\">C1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/qualcomm/\">Qualcomm</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16e\">iPhone 16e (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/27/qualcomm-vs-iphone-16e-study/\">Android Phones With Qualcomm Modems Top iPhone 16e in New 5G Test</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/android-phones-with-qualcomm-modems-top-iphone-16e-in-new-5g-test.2457774/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"75db5225c97610a9360beb499a8054654bcf4034c0022fab025b2a0b63fd2c4f","category":"Apple"}
