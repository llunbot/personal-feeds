For laptops, it’s particularly useful in conserving battery life. For an AC-powered desktop Mac, however, sleep these days has a very modest reduction in wattage, and you may want your Mac to stay alert to perform actions or respond to remote queries, like a remote screen-sharing session.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ventura made these settings harder to understand, so much so that I didn’t realize until testing a remote-access app that my Mac was going to sleep, as the Monterey settings didn’t produce the same result.</p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div><div><div>At a glance </div></div><ul><li><span>Time to complete: </span><span>  5 minutes</span></li><li>Materials required: macOS Ventura</li></ul></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div><span>1.</span>\n<h3>Lock Screen settings</h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/ventura-lock-screen.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"macOS Ventura Lock Screen settings\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>To avoid using unwanted energy and burning hours on your display while it’s not in use, start with <em>System Settings</em> &gt; <em>Lock Screen</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On a MacBook, enable “Turn display off on power adapter when inactive” by choosing any time. On a desktop Mac, adjust the “Turn display off when inactive” setting.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div><span>2.</span>\n<h3>Displays setting</h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mac911-automatic-sleeping-ventura-bordered.png\" alt=\"Ventura automatic sleeping\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>To prevent your Mac from sleeping due to the display powering down, go to <em>System Settings</em> &gt; <em>Displays</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Click the Advanced button at the bottom of the view.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enable “Prevent automatic sleeping when the display is off.”</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>You may have thought your Mac wasn’t sleeping in this fashion, also as I did, if you tried to access it over your local network and it was quickly responsive. That would be the case if you had what’s called across the computer world Wake-on-LAN and is found in Energy Saver in Ventura as “Wake for network access.” With this setting active, your Mac is listening for a special wake signal while it slumbers; an attempt to access it from another network device sends that signal. While this can be enabled to work over the internet, it’s a much more complicated setup and may fail. It’s better to disable sleep while allowing the display to go into standby than rely on Wake-on-LAN.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ask Mac 911</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve compiled a list of the questions we get asked most frequently, along with answers and links to columns: <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/3077986/os-x/your-top-questions-to-mac-911-and-some-answers.html\">read our super FAQ</a> to see if your question is covered.
