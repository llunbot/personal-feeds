Otherwise, the machines are identical, with the same excellent ProMotion displays and ports as the M3 model (three Thunderbolt ports, an SD card reader, and HDMI 2.1), as well as the same colors options (silver and space gray).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you’re looking for more than 8GB of RAM, save a couple hundred bucks and grab this deal before it’s gone.</p>\n\nMacBook</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"8994a10999353c454aae50ba8addeb558be1d9a193966803e1028d052e0d6c01","category":"Apple"}
