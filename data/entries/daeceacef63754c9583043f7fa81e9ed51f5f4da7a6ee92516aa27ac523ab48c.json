Version 1.7 of the app now allows players to compete against each other in classic DS titles like <em>Mario Kart DS</em>, <em>Bomberman</em>, and <em>Animal Crossing</em>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/04/Delta-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nNintendo officially shut down the original DS online services back in 2014, so Delta relies on alternative Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection servers maintained by the community. The way it works is very straightforward â€“ simply select your preferred server within the emulator settings. No complex DNS or network configuration is required.  A list of supported games can be found on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nintendo_DS_Wi-Fi_Connection_games\">Wikipedia</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBeyond online multiplayer, version 1.7 also introduces several other notable improvements. Nintendo 64 emulation has been enhanced, with new options to upscale resolution and use custom texture packs for improved visuals. A quick screenshot feature has also been added, alongside various bug fixes and performance optimizations.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDelta is regarded as one of the most polished game emulators available on iOS, supporting multiple Nintendo platforms including NES, SNES, N64, Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, and Nintendo DS. The app offers robust controller support, save states, cheats, game backups, and cloud syncing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor players looking to try these new features, <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/delta-game-emulator/id1048524688\">Delta 1.7</a> is currently available through <a href=\"https://altstore.io/\">AltStore PAL</a> for users in the European Union, with a global App Store release expected soon. The emulator remains free to download.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/01/delta-emulator-online-multiplayer-nintendo-ds/\">Delta Emulator Gains Online Multiplayer for Nintendo DS Games</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/delta-emulator-gains-online-multiplayer-for-nintendo-ds-games.2454450/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"daeceacef63754c9583043f7fa81e9ed51f5f4da7a6ee92516aa27ac523ab48c","category":"Apple"}
