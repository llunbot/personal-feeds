Maybe try a full-alloy Robert Axle Project UDH replacement hanger vs. the original aluminum and plastic offering from SRAM.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not really thicker, it’s not lighter, and it costs twice as much. But it promises to be a stiffer, more precise connection between your derailleur, frame, and thru-axle for improved shift performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why Robert Axle Project machined an alloy UDH replacement?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/podcast-interview-about-sram-UDH-tech-details-and-materials-4-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"999\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/podcast-interview-about-sram-UDH-tech-details-and-materials-4-jpg-edited.webp\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/podcast-interview-about-sram-UDH-tech-details-and-materials-4-jpg-edited.webp 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/podcast-interview-about-sram-UDH-tech-details-and-materials-4-jpg-edited-297x185.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/podcast-interview-about-sram-UDH-tech-details-and-materials-4-jpg-edited-1536x959.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/podcast-interview-about-sram-UDH-tech-details-and-materials-4-jpg-edited-120x75.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/podcast-interview-about-sram-UDH-tech-details-and-materials-4-jpg-edited-768x480.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you know that the standard SRAM Universal Derailleur Hanger was half plastic? A co-molded plastic sleeve, plastic chain ramp, and plastic threads interface with the dropout of your frame. With a flat aluminum hanger sandwiched in between, which your derailleur actually hangs off. Then, and aluminum bolt squeezes it all together and serves as the 12×1.0mm thread that your thru-axle secures to.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/SRAM-UDH-podcast-interview-feature-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SRAM-UDH-podcast-interview-feature-jpg-edited.webp\" alt=\"podcast cover image of SRAM universal derailleur hanger\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SRAM-UDH-podcast-interview-feature-jpg-edited.webp 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SRAM-UDH-podcast-interview-feature-jpg-edited-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SRAM-UDH-podcast-interview-feature-jpg-edited-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SRAM-UDH-podcast-interview-feature-jpg-edited-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SRAM-UDH-podcast-interview-feature-jpg-edited-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SRAM-UDH-podcast-interview-feature-jpg-edited-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We knew. Tyler broke it down in our <em><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/podcast-066-whats-up-with-the-sram-udh/\" target=\"_blank\">What’s up with the SRM UDH?</a> </em>Bikerumor Podcast about a year and a half ago. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But frankly, I forgot. The <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/sram-introduces-universal-derailleur-hanger-concept-and-its-brilliant/\" target=\"_blank\">UDH design</a> is genuinely simpler and has effectively been trouble-free for me on every gravel and mountain bike I’ve ridden with one in the last few years. So, even though it was developed to make hanger replacement easier (<em>well, and to sneak in direct mount derailleur <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/sram-transmission-eagle-mountain-bike-drivetrain/\" target=\"_blank\">transmissions</a></em>), I haven’t yet needed to replace a UDH.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the Robert Axle Project also knew. And they set out to eliminate that plastic to improve how accurately your bike shifts. “<em>Modern drivetrains are precise and exacting and deserve to be mounted to a derailleur hanger of equally precise quality. The Robert Axle Project Universal Derailleur Hanger is made to the exact same geometry as the stock SRAM hanger ensuring a perfect fit to your bike and any drivetrain you’d like to mount to it.</em>“</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Robert Axle UDH Replacement  – Tech, Pricing &amp; Compatibility</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/The-Robert-Axle-Project-CNC-machined-6061-alloy-full-aluminum-stiffer-UDH-replacement-derailleur-hanger.jpg\"><img width=\"1100\" height=\"619\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/The-Robert-Axle-Project-CNC-machined-6061-alloy-full-aluminum-stiffer-UDH-replacement-derailleur-hanger-edited.jpg\" alt=\"The Robert Axle Project CNC-machined 6061 alloy full aluminum stiffer UDH replacement derailleur hanger\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/The-Robert-Axle-Project-CNC-machined-6061-alloy-full-aluminum-stiffer-UDH-replacement-derailleur-hanger-edited.jpg 1100w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/The-Robert-Axle-Project-CNC-machined-6061-alloy-full-aluminum-stiffer-UDH-replacement-derailleur-hanger-edited-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/The-Robert-Axle-Project-CNC-machined-6061-alloy-full-aluminum-stiffer-UDH-replacement-derailleur-hanger-edited-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/The-Robert-Axle-Project-CNC-machined-6061-alloy-full-aluminum-stiffer-UDH-replacement-derailleur-hanger-edited-768x432.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Robert Axle UDH replacement hanger is CNC-machined in one piece from 6061 aluminum. That does essentially mean the alloy part is thicker in some places (<em>not where your derailleur hangs, though</em>). So maybe it’s less susceptible to bending, too. Then, it gets a matching 6061 alloy retaining bolt with a 12×1.0mm thread pitch to secure the hanger to your thru-axle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It sells for $32 and comes only in anodized black. (<em>If you need some shiny color, maybe try the more expensive option from <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wheels-mfg-adds-bright-new-bb-udh-colors-e-bike-chainring-lockring-tools/\">Wheels Mfg</a>.</em>) But, while there’s just one Robert Axle Project UDH, it will work with all UDH-ready frames, including Trek Active Braking Pivot frame designs. And it will work with all conventional derailleur drivetrains, including ebikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get one <a href=\"https://robertaxleproject.com/product/sram-udh/\" target=\"_blank\">direct</a> from Robert Axle or your local bike shop now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://robertaxleproject.com\" target=\"_blank\"><em>RobertAxleProject.com</em></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/the-robert-axle-project-machined-alloy-udh-replacement-derailleur-hanger/\">Robert Axle Project Machined All-Alloy UDH Replacement Promises Extra Precise Shifts</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"28d8e01ff399dd167f589fb37cab172f8c19eb230f2906a99580ddb88011fa37","category":"Cycling"}
