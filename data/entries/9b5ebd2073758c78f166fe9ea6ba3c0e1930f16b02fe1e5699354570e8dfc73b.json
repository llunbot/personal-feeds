The updated version features much of the same familiar makeup as <a href=\"/brompton/4503/brompton-s2l-superlight-folding-bike-review\">the previous Brompton Superlight</a>, but the P Line offers a lighter, faster ride with refined key elements.</p>\n<p>The update comes as Brompton simplified the rest of its product naming system in October 2021. The P Line joins the A Line, C Line and Electric C Line – for full details don't miss our <a href=\"/brompton/8859/brompton-folding-bikes-a-full-guide-to-the-range\" target=\"_blank\">buyer's guide to the Brompton range</a>.</p>\n<p>Weighing a claimed 9.65kg (1.95kg less than the A Line), the P Line is made from a combination of titanium and steel and can be folded into a package measuring 645mm × 585mm × 270mm.</p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cyclist.b-cdn.net/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/11/brompton_p_line_rear_fork.jpeg?itok=PFF2Il9t\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>The rear frame and fork are made from titanium, weighing a claimed 700g less than the all-steel equivalent, and comes with a redesigned suspension block (the polyurethane bushing that provides rear end squish) which Brompton says helps improve control and handling performance. Essential for navigating commuters glued to their phones?</p>\n<p>The updated lightweight bike has a newly developed 4-speed freehub body, and a <a href=\"/tutorials/74/how-to-adjust-a-rear-derailleur\" target=\"_blank\">rear derailleur</a> weighing a claimed 60g. According to the brand this provides a similar ratio to its popular C Line 3-speed bikes and 60% more than the 2-speed A Line bike.<a href=\"https://www.brompton.com/\"></a></p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cyclist.b-cdn.net/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/11/brompton_p_line_folded_.jpeg?itok=FpXK9FNP\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>The P Line also features a dual locking seatpost system which has two positions, either fully down which is ideal for storing, or halfway up which is meant for making it easy to transport the bike around a city.</p>\n<p>For visibility, the P Line has front and rear reflectors, a USB rechargeable Brompton 500 lumen front light, and a standard battery powered rear light.</p>\n<p>The P Line is available with three types of handlebars – low, mid and high – three different seatpost lengths, and three tyre options.<a href=\"/brompton/8859/brompton-folding-bikes-a-full-guide-to-the-range\"><br />\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cyclist.b-cdn.net/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/11/brompton_p_line_grey_.jpeg?itok=RheKgdOW\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p></p></a></p>\n<p>The bike is available in either Storm Grey or Midnight Black.</p>\n<p>With prices starting at £2,100, the Brompton P Line comes in at the higher price bracket of the brand's range but its lightweight, nifty features should go some way to justifying the extra outlay. </p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/4405/lizzie-deignan-equal-prize-money-is-more-than-a-gesture\">Lizzie Deignan: Equal prize money is 'more than a gesture'</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/1038/equal-prize-fund-for-men-and-women-at-prudential-ridelondon\">Equal prize fund for men and women at Prudential RideLondon</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/6154/womens-tour-guaranteed-same-prize-money-as-tour-of-britain-for-second-year\">Women's Tour guaranteed same prize money as Tour of Britain for second year</a></div>    </div></div><p></p>\n<h2>Brompton P Line price, specs and availability</h2>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cyclist.b-cdn.net/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/11/brompton_p_line_black_.jpeg?itok=CTNG5Ksq\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Frameset:</strong> Brompton Steel and titanium</li>\n<li><strong>Groupset:</strong> Brompton 4-speed</li>\n<li><strong>Wheels:</strong> Brompton</li>\n<li><strong>Availability:</strong> From today</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £2,100</li>\n<li><strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.brompton.com/\">Buy the Brompton P Line now</a></strong></strong></li>\n</ul>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"ecole","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"9b5ebd2073758c78f166fe9ea6ba3c0e1930f16b02fe1e5699354570e8dfc73b","category":"Cycling"}
