And today it’s cheaper than we’ve ever seen: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CSTJ2Y5F?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Amazon is selling the 41mm</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CSTY93PP?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">45mm Apple Watch Series 9</a> for $299 and $329, respectively, a savings of $100 each, well below the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2175152/grab-a-new-apple-watch-series-9-while-you-still-can-and-save-70.html\">lowest price we had previously tracked</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple Watch Series 9 has either a 41mm or 45mm display with two exclusive features: an S9 chip that’s faster and smarter with a new four-core Neural Engine, and the new double-tap gesture that lets you control apps without touching the screen. Otherwise, it’s got the same array of sensors—ECG, heart rate, and temperature. (It also has a blood-oxygen sensor, though Apple has turned off functionality due to an ongoing patent dispute.) You’ll also get 18 hours of battery life, 50 meters of water resistance, Emergency SOS and Crash Detection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2114964/apple-watch-series-9-review.html\">4-star review</a>, we praised the Apple Watch Series 9 as “the best smartwatch Apple has ever made.” And at this price, it’s also a fantastic bargain.</p>\n\nApple Watch</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"ba3678d008d087c2d24ab01dbb782f0c2f96e5e0cffdc1d69b0723f1e88e6428","category":"Apple"}
