That’s an issue because your choice of chain lube can make a substantial difference to the durability and efficiency of your drivetrain. To help unravel these issues we called up Adam Kerin of <a href=\"https://zerofrictioncycling.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\">Zero Friction Cycling</a> and the founder of FrictionFacts Jason Smith to talk all things within their domains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here they reveal what makes a great chain lube, what tests work and why, and what tests you should be sceptical of.  For related reading, stick your head down the rabbit hole of <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/tag/bicycle-chains/\" target=\"_blank\">all things related to bicycle chains</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/c74257e0-deda-49fc-b2ea-551819ac9483.gif\" />     SUBSCRIBE TO THE ‘NERD ALERT’ PODCAST</strong><br />Never miss an episode.
