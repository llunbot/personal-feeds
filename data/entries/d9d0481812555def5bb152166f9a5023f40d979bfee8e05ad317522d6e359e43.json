{"title":"Apple Lends Support to California ‘Right to Repair’ Bill","link":"https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/23/apple-lends-support-to-california-state-right-to-repair-bill/?guccounter=1","date":1692924613000,"content":"\n<p>Brian Heater, reporting for TechCrunch:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In a surprise move, Apple this week penned a letter to\nCalifornia state senator Susan Talamantes Eggman, voicing\nsupport for SB 244, a “right to repair” bill currently making\nits way through Sacramento’s State Capitol building. [...] Apple\nhas, of course, softened its stance on right to repair\nlegislation in recent years, including last year’s addition of a\n<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/20/iphone-14-and-m2-macs-get-added-to-apples-self-service-repair-program/\">Self Service Repair program</a>. The offering, which was\nviewed by many as a preemptive measure against looming state and\nfederal legislation, provides users with rental tools to repair\niPhones and Macs at home.</p>\n\n<p>In the letter, Apple expresses its support on the grounds of\noffering consumers the ability to repair their devices safely,\nwithout risking privacy or data issues. “Apple supports\nCalifornia’s Right to Repair Act so all Californians have even\ngreater access to repairs while also protecting their safety,\nsecurity, and privacy,” the company says in a statement provided\nto TechCrunch. “We create our products to last and, if they ever\nneed to be repaired, Apple customers have a growing range of safe,\nhigh-quality repair options.”</p>\n\n<p>This sort of backing from a specific manufacturer is unusual — particularly from Apple. It is thus far the only major\nmanufacturer to express its support for the bill in this manner.\nThese kinds of statements are generally made through industry\nconsortiums, such as TechNet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don’t find Apple’s support for this legislation surprising, but <a href=\"https://www.techmeme.com/230823/p29#a230823p29\">most people commenting on it do</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mas.to/@carnage4life/110943929863426254\">Dare Obasanjo</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This is less of a pivot and more of just accepting reality.</p>\n\n<p>Apple pushing aesthetics such as no seams in their phones over\nconsumer benefits like being able to replace your phone’s\nbatteries has been deemed unacceptable by a number of governments\nincluding the EU.</p>\n\n<p>Regulation is coming whether they like it or not, so they might as\nwell get some positive PR for “supporting” the regulations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.404media.co/apple-endorses-california-right-to-repair-bill/\">Jason Koebler, writing at 404 Media</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple told a California legislator that it is formally supporting\na right to repair bill in California, a landmark move that\nsuggests big tech manufacturers understand they have lost the\nbattle to monopolize repair, and need to allow consumers and\nindependent repair shops to fix their own electronics.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Koebler’s use of “monopoly” hints at the assumption that authorized repairs are a profit center. That is true for some manufacturers in some industries. Koebler himself has copiously documented <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/xykkkd/why-american-farmers-are-hacking-their-tractors-with-ukrainian-firmware\">the saga with John Deere tractors</a>. All <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/the-printers-that-require-ink-to-scan-and-fax/\">the nonsense</a> inkjet printer makers go through to try to keep people from using third-party replacement ink cartridges is another. That’s never been Apple’s reason for opposing these laws. Apple’s stance is more about control.</p>\n\n<p>And I’d argue that Obasanjo is missing the possibility that Apple actually thinks California’s SB 244 is a well-written law. Would Apple prefer no such law at all? I think the answer is obviously yes. Providing all the necessary documentation, tools, and parts for every new device the company makes is a pain in Apple’s corporate ass, and I think <em>that’s</em> why Apple resisted such legislation. From their perspective any such law is an unnecessary annoyance. But it’s undeniably reasonable for there to be consumer protection laws, and if there are going to be Right to Repair laws that cover computing devices, those laws ought to be good ones. And the plain language of Apple’s letter is that the company thinks this is a good one.</p>\n\n<p>I highly doubt we’re going to see any such letter from Apple to the EU endorsing their <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/25/22996248/apple-sideloading-apps-store-third-party-eu-dma-requirement\">Digital Markets Act</a>, the law that, among numerous other sweeping provisions, is poised to mandate sideloading on all phones. Apple continues to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/sep/23/apple-opposes-eu-plans-to-make-common-charger-port-for-all-devices\">oppose</a> the EU law requiring USB-C ports in all rechargeable devices, and that law is already passed. Apple has complied, begrudgingly, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2022/02/going_dutch\">with the Netherlands’s rather specific regulations regarding dating apps</a> and in-app payments — but they’ve issued no praise for the law.</p>\n\n<p>If Apple <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23925286-apple-support-sb-244\">says they support California’s SB 244</a>, it probably just means they actually support it.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/24/apple-california-right-to-repair\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d9d0481812555def5bb152166f9a5023f40d979bfee8e05ad317522d6e359e43","category":"Tech"}
