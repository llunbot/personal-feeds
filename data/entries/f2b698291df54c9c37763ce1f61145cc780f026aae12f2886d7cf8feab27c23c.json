Now the results of dating the samples are in, and it's clear that while the deposits are old, they're young enough to be a bit of an oddity.</p>\n<h2>To the Moon and back</h2>\n<p>China has now successfully landed several probes and rovers on the lunar surface as part of a larger exploration program. Chang'e 5 represented the next step, as it had a drill to obtain subsurface samples and a return vehicle that could take them back to Earth. The spacecraft <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/12/china-likely-to-attempt-its-change-5-moon-landing-on-tuesday/\">successfully landed</a> almost two years ago, and a few weeks later, it returned <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/12/china-completes-lunar-sampling-mission-eyes-next-steps-on-the-moon/\">roughly 2 kilograms of rock</a> to Earth from the Moon.</p>\n<p>China has the benefit of decades of knowledge gained since the Apollo missions, along with a greater theoretical understanding of the Moon's formation. And it carefully chose Chang'e 5's landing site, a large volcanic deposit called the Oceanus Procellarum, thought to be one of the younger areas of the Moon's surface. But \"younger\" covers a lot of ground, as estimates based on its crater count ranged from 3.2 billion years old down to just 1.2 billion.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1802125#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1802125&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f2b698291df54c9c37763ce1f61145cc780f026aae12f2886d7cf8feab27c23c","category":"Tech"}
