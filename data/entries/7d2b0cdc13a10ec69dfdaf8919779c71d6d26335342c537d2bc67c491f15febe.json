While we need to start decarbonizing immediately with the tech we have now—the sprint—the process will go on for decades, during which technology that's still in development could potentially play a critical role.</p>\n<p>The technology at issue in the report is a new generation of nuclear reactors based on different technology; they're smaller and easier to build, and they could potentially use different coolants. The next generation of designs is working to avoid the delays and cost overruns that are crippling attempts to build additional reactors both here and overseas. But their performance in the real world will remain an unknown until next decade at the earliest, placing them squarely in the \"marathon\" portion of the race.</p>\n<p>The new report focuses on what the US should do to ensure that the new generation of designs has a chance to be evaluated on its merits.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1935232#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1935232&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7d2b0cdc13a10ec69dfdaf8919779c71d6d26335342c537d2bc67c491f15febe","category":"Tech"}
