Turns out, it’s also really good at absorbing vibrations, too. So, <a href=\"https://www.odigrips.com\" target=\"_blank\">ODI is using it</a> in their new Vanquish mountain bike grips.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It uses a new D3O Grip Compound that, they claim, absorbs 2x the vibrations of standard grip compounds. It’s the same tech used in F1 cars and NASA’s Valkyrie robot, and now it’s for riders, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-ODI-Vanquish-MTB-grips-with-D3O-vibration-damping-01.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"667\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-ODI-Vanquish-MTB-grips-with-D3O-vibration-damping-01-1536x667.jpg\" alt=\"odi mountain bike grips with d30 vibration damping material\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-ODI-Vanquish-MTB-grips-with-D3O-vibration-damping-01-1536x667.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-ODI-Vanquish-MTB-grips-with-D3O-vibration-damping-01-297x129.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-ODI-Vanquish-MTB-grips-with-D3O-vibration-damping-01-120x52.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-ODI-Vanquish-MTB-grips-with-D3O-vibration-damping-01-768x333.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/soc-24-ODI-Vanquish-MTB-grips-with-D3O-vibration-damping-01-2048x889.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>ODI then gives the grips a specific pattern and geometry to further reduce vibrations, helping your hands, arms, and brain stay fresher for longer.

The collars are available in all of their anodized colors (black, red, orange, blue, purple, gold, silver, espresso, and olive) they measure 132mm wide. Sets retail for $34.95. The ends are open so you can add their optional color-matched alloy bar-end plugs or their EnCase bar-end tool kits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>asdf</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/odi-d3o-grips-wolf-tooth-fat-paw-lock-on-grips/\">New Vibration Damping MTB Grips from Wolf Tooth &amp; ODI x D3O</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"216f4eb1641efd31bdede463f52cc957f3a4e5c77777fa426a5441f82ae5866d","category":"Cycling"}
