{"title":"Yahoo Is Acquiring Artifact, Folding It Into Yahoo News","link":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/2/24118436/yahoo-news-artifact-acquisition","date":1712103312000,"content":"\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/02/google-podcasts\">Also</a> from David Pierce at The Verge:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The two sides declined to share the cost of the acquisition, but \nboth made clear Yahoo is acquiring Artifact’s tech rather than its \nteam. Mike Krieger and Kevin Systrom, Artifact’s co-founders, will \nbe “special advisors” for Yahoo but won’t be joining the company. \nArtifact’s remaining five employees have either gotten other jobs \nor are planning to take some time off. </p>\n\n<p>The acquisition comes a bit more than <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/31/23579552/artifact-instagram-cofounders-kevin-systrom-mike-krieger-news-app\">a year after Artifact’s \nlaunch</a> and about three months after Systrom and Krieger \n<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/12/24036539/artifact-shutting-down-kevin-systrom\">announced its death</a>. “We have built something that a core \ngroup of users love,” the co-founders <a href=\"https://medium.com/artifact-news/shutting-down-artifact-1e70de46d419\">wrote in January</a>, \n“but we have concluded that the market opportunity isn’t big \nenough to warrant continued investment in this way.” They said \nthat the biggest reason to shut down was in order to focus on \n“newer, bigger and better things that have the ability to reach \nmany millions of people.” The bet behind Artifact was always that \nAI had the potential to be a huge, internet-changing technology; \nmaybe there were just more interesting things to work on than a \nnews app without a big news audience. [...] </p>\n\n<p>Artifact, the app, will go away once the acquisition is \ncomplete. But Artifact’s underlying tech for categorizing, \ncurating, and personalizing content will soon start to show up \non Yahoo News — and eventually on other Yahoo platforms, too. \n“You’ll see that stuff flowing into our products in the coming \nmonths,” says Downs Mulder. It sounds like there’s also a good \nchance that Yahoo’s apps might get a bit of Artifact’s speed and \npolish over time, too. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>“<em>Yahoo, where scrappy startup acquisitions go to thrive</em>”, said no one, ever.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/02/yahoo-acquires-artifact\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"856b519db992f1d6c187cc993b2d5ae4f12fcd519ebc620595d4d0f1f07a4609","category":"Tech"}
