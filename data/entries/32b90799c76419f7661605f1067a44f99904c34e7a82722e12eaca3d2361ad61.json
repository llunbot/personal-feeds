There’s a lot of grunting and eye-swivelling against a soundtrack of mournful string vibrato. The pair almost seem to embrace, their eyes locked, and then with a final descending cry they plunge into the water and disappear over the edge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So ends the will-they-won’t-they (kill each other) arc of Sherlock and Moriarty at the Reichenbach Falls in Switzerland, at least in the 1985 Granada Television telling of the story – possibly the only portrayal to be filmed at the real location.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/col-de-couraduque-climb-cycling\">Classic climb: Col de Couraduque, the Pyrenean climb you’ve never heard of</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/classic-climbs-furka-pass\">Classic climb: Furka Pass, the Swiss climb with the Midas touch</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 138: on sale now!</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>Of course, it later turned out Holmes somehow didn’t perish, because Arthur Conan Doyle needed the royalties, but that’s not going to stop us from making some tenuous allusions because the Grosse Scheidegg climb takes you past the falls, and that’s good enough for us.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pass water</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Scheidegg means ‘watershed’ in German and the Grosse Scheidegg is named for a very large one, a mountain pass that separates the waters of the Lütschine and Rychenbach rivers – the latter feeding those falls – and joins the towns of Meiringen and Grindelwald. We’re climbing the east side of the pass ourselves, a moderately tough 16km ascent to the lonely Berghotel Grosse Scheidegg.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/grosse-scheidegg-02-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"Grosse Scheidegg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/grosse-scheidegg-02-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/grosse-scheidegg-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/grosse-scheidegg-02-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/grosse-scheidegg-02-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/grosse-scheidegg-02-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/grosse-scheidegg-02-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/grosse-scheidegg-02-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/grosse-scheidegg-02-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/grosse-scheidegg-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>The Grosse Scheidegg pass is exceptionally quiet by the standards of Alpine roads</figcaption><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Typically closed completely for around seven months of the year because of snow, the upper part of the Grosse Scheidegg is never open to normal motor traffic, making it rather appealing to those of us supplying our own power.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Switzerland offers countless spectacular routes, those open to cars are invariably busy when the weather is good, so the luxury of a mostly empty climb can’t be underestimated.

This is a country with a unique flair for blending postcard prettiness with a sense of well-managed order.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It continues in this vein for some time: more forest, a bridge crossing a rocky river, yet more forest, all while increasingly spectacular views peek through the trees. Some of it is reminiscent of a steep Ardennes ramp, but one that has been multiplied in length many times over.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/grosse-scheidegg-07-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"Grosse Scheidegg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/grosse-scheidegg-07-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/grosse-scheidegg-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/grosse-scheidegg-07-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/grosse-scheidegg-07-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/grosse-scheidegg-07-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/grosse-scheidegg-07-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/grosse-scheidegg-07-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/grosse-scheidegg-07-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/grosse-scheidegg-07.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Patrik Lundin / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The Reichenbach Falls come early on at the first set of proper hairpins and, if you stay on the bike, you could quite easily miss them – you’ll need to dismount and explore a little for the full experience.
