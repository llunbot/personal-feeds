There are no classified climbs to speak of, and the peloton has shown the past two stages that it <em>can</em> actually bring the break back when there’s enough motivation in the bunch.</p><p>The biggest challenge may be the weather – it can get hot and windy in the Extremadura region. The forecast for Friday currently calls for moderate winds and temperatures in the realm of 33° C (92° F).</p><p><strong>Who’s it for: </strong>Sprinters.</p><p><strong>Dane Cash’s picks: </strong><em>With Jasper Philipsen out of the race, Fabio Jakobsen is a clearer favorite for the sprints. He’s got the speed and the support to win again here. If Arnaud Démare and Groupama-FDJ can get their lead-out sorted after some underwhelming showings, Démare should be a contender as well. Alberto Dainese and Jordi Meeus are others to watch, as is Michael Matthews, although he didn’t quite have it in the finale of stage 12.</em></p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021-vuelta-profile-stage13.jpeg\"></figure><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/stage13.jpeg\"></figure></div></div>","author":"Matt de Neef","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"9a9ba2d3c1543499f973e0791a3dd76405bc7917d7d1da9d3e387009f5e32221","category":"Cycling"}
