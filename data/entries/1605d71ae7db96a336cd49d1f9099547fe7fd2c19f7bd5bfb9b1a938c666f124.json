Debuting with a new Shimano CUES freehub, rear derailleur, and wireless shifter, this self-powered system aims to provide automatic and/or wireless shifting to non-electric urban, trekking, and gravel bikes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While automatic shifting has really only been possible on electric bike models, Shimano’s new Q’AUTO technology intends to make it a reality for analog bikes, too. In addition to auto-shifting, the system includes a wireless Di2 shifter for manual electronic shifting when you want to be in control. Perhaps the best part, however, is that the dynamo freehub generates power while you ride, so you’ll never need to worry about charging a derailleur battery.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><figcaption>Animation of the Q’AUTO system in action (all photos/Shimano)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Shimano Q’AUTO: How Does It Work?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Shimano’s Q’AUTO is comprised of three main components. The CUES FH-U6060 freehub is the backbone of the system. The dynamo function generates power for the derailleur and houses three internal sensors tracking speed, cadence, and slope. These sensors, along with an adaptive learning function, aim to provide smooth and precise shifting that adapts to real-world riding conditions while also adjusting to your riding style and shifting preferences over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This hub works in combination with the new CUES RD-U8050-SGS/GS rear derailleur, which has been specifically designed to be Q’AUTO compatible. It is powered by the dynamo hub, so it never needs to be charged. It automatically shifts into the optimal gear so riders can focus on riding, not shifting. It also pairs with the new wireless Di2 shifter for auto-shift overrides and manual shifting. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the SW-EX605-R wireless Di2 shifting switch makes it possible to make gear changes manually. With this shifter, riders can toggle between auto-shifting and manual modes and shift up and down with the wireless Di2 shift buttons. When using auto-shift mode, the shifter can be used to override the automatic shifts. Shimano states that “Q’AUTO remembers these corrections and optimizes the shifting behavior for future trips.” In manual mode, riders have full control over gear changes.

gravel riders and bike touring. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Our Take</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Shimano Q’AUTO is a unique system with compelling new technology that makes automatic shifting possible on non-electric bikes. It strikes us as an interesting new option for non-electric bike riders interested in the effortlessness of automatic shifting. Likewise, with its dynamo-powered design, it seems like it could be a great option for gravel, adventure, and touring riders interested in automatic and/or wireless shifting but not interested in charging batteries. With standard urban, gravel, and touring bike axle spacing of 142×12 mm, it should be fairly easy to put on just about any modern bike of the aforementioned varieties. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rose-Sneak-3-EQ-with-QAUTO.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rose-Sneak-3-EQ-with-QAUTO.webp\" alt=\"Stock image of the Rose Sneak 3EQ urban bike equipped with the Shimano Q'AUTO CUES drivetrain\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rose-Sneak-3-EQ-with-QAUTO.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rose-Sneak-3-EQ-with-QAUTO-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rose-Sneak-3-EQ-with-QAUTO-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rose-Sneak-3-EQ-with-QAUTO-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rose-Sneak-3-EQ-with-QAUTO-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rose-Sneak-3-EQ-with-QAUTO-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rose-Sneak-3-EQ-with-QAUTO-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Shimano Q’AUTO: Pricing and Availability</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, Shimano didn’t include any prices with the information provided about the new Q’AUTO system. We know that it will be coming on some complete bikes, including the ROSE Sneak 3 EQ urban bike that also launches today. We assume that it will be available aftermarket as well. Those interested in learning more about this innovative, self-powered, auto-shifting wireless system can find more information on Shimano’s website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://bike.shimano.com/\">bike.shimano.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/shimano-qauto-brings-dynamo-powered-wireless-auto-shifting-to-analog-bikes/\">Shimano Q’AUTO Brings Dynamo-Powered Wireless Auto-Shifting to Analog Bikes</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jeremy Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"1605d71ae7db96a336cd49d1f9099547fe7fd2c19f7bd5bfb9b1a938c666f124","category":"Cycling"}
