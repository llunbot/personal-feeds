There’s gravel bars in alloy or carbon, a couple of alloy gravel stem options, a new carbon seatpost, and even some grippy bar tape. Combine that with some crossover MTB kit like pedals, tubeless valves &amp; bottle cages, and you can fully kit out your next gravel bike with Sixpack Racing gear…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sixpack Racing debuts Gravel Series cockpit components</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_rider-view.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_rider-view.webp\" alt=\"Sixpack Gravel Series cockpit components, rider view\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_rider-view.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_rider-view-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_rider-view-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_rider-view-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_rider-view-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(Photos/Sixpack)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Mountain bikes are the heart of <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?s=sixpack\" target=\"_blank\">Sixpack Racing</a> for sure. But gravel has blurred the lines with off-road riding, and a lot of mountain bikers have taken to dropbars for longer adventure rides, too. So Sixpack was happy to create a new component range focusing more on this MTB-inspired type for riding, think more rugged bikepacking, long-distance off-road touring, and mixed-surface adventuring more than fast-paced gravel racing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What you get is a reasonably-priced, reasonably light range of components built tough to handle anything you can throw at them and with comfort &amp; ergonomics so you’ll be able to enjoy the ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Gravel handlebars: a riser bar in Carbon or downswept in Alloy</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_gravel-drop-bars.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_gravel-drop-bars.webp\" alt=\"Sixpack Racing Gravel Series cockpit components, angled view\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_gravel-drop-bars.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_gravel-drop-bars-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_gravel-drop-bars-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_gravel-drop-bars-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_gravel-drop-bars-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_gravel-drop-bars-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Sixpack’s Gravel bars take two completely different approaches, depending on material. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_11mm-riser-carbon-handlebar-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_11mm-riser-carbon-handlebar-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Sixpack Gravel Series cockpit components, carbon dropbar\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_11mm-riser-carbon-handlebar-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_11mm-riser-carbon-handlebar-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_11mm-riser-carbon-handlebar-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_11mm-riser-carbon-handlebar-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_11mm-riser-carbon-handlebar-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_11mm-riser-carbon-handlebar-2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_11mm-riser-carbon-handlebar-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The lightweight carbon bar gets an uncommon 11mm rise inspired by MTB bars. Riding with on the tops lets you sit up a bit higher for less pressure on your hands, while an otherwise deep bend gives the bars a pretty common compact position in the drops – 115mm Drop &amp; 75mm Reach. The carbon bar promises “enhanced vibration dampening” on the 7.5° backswept tops, while maintaining handling stiffness in the 18° flared drops.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_carbon-bar-bend.webp\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_carbon-bar-bend.webp\" alt=\"Sixpack Gravel Series cockpit components, carbon handlebar drops bend\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_carbon-bar-bend.webp 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_carbon-bar-bend-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_carbon-bar-bend-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_carbon-bar-bend-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The 250€ Sixpack Gravel Handlebar CF is available in 420 &amp; 440mm widths, with a 60mm wide 31.8mm clamping area, and a 235g claimed weight for the narrower bar.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_alloy-handlebar-downsweep-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_alloy-handlebar-downsweep-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Sixpack Gravel Series cockpit components, alloy drop bar\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_alloy-handlebar-downsweep-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_alloy-handlebar-downsweep-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_alloy-handlebar-downsweep-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_alloy-handlebar-downsweep-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_alloy-handlebar-downsweep-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_alloy-handlebar-downsweep-2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_alloy-handlebar-downsweep-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On the alloy front, Sixpack goes the opposite direction with a lot more drop, starting off with 11° of downsweep and 8° of backsweep for the tops. They describe this bar as closely matching your natural hand position to “reduce fatigue over long adventures”. The alloy bar features a bend that looks compact for a smooth transition from hoods to the 16° flared drops, but because of the downsweep it technically has a deep 136mm Drop paired to short 70mm Reach.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_alloy-bar-bend.webp\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_alloy-bar-bend.webp\" alt=\"Sixpack Gravel Series cockpit components, alloy handlebar bend\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_alloy-bar-bend.webp 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_alloy-bar-bend-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_alloy-bar-bend-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_alloy-bar-bend-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The 65€ Sixpack Gravel Handlebar AL is available in 400, 420, 440 &amp; 460mm widths, with 31.8mm clamp, and 355g claimed weight (420mm).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sixpack Gravel bar tape, too</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_grippy-bar-tape.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_grippy-bar-tape.webp\" alt=\"Sixpack Gravel Series cockpit components, grippy bar tape\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_grippy-bar-tape.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_grippy-bar-tape-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_grippy-bar-tape-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_grippy-bar-tape-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_grippy-bar-tape-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Sixpack also decided to make their own gravel-specific bar tape. It’s a medium thickness 3mm  (x 30mm wide) and gets a grippy dot texture for all-weather, even wet conditions grip. The 30€ tape is available only in black, weighs 196g for two uncut rolls, and comes with bolt-on alloy expander bar plugs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Gravel stems: Classic or Integrated</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_ICR-stem-on-bike.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_ICR-stem-on-bike.webp\" alt=\"Sixpack Gravel Series cockpit components, ICR stem on bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_ICR-stem-on-bike.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_ICR-stem-on-bike-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_ICR-stem-on-bike-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_ICR-stem-on-bike-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_ICR-stem-on-bike-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Sixpack Gravel Stems are a pretty straightforward flat boxy forged alloy design with a 4-bolt removable faceplate and a -7° angle for a flat-ish look on most gravel bikes. The two gravel stems are pretty much identical, only the ICR integrated version adds direct compatibility with Acros integrated headsets via an included split-spacer stack. Cable routing is still outside of your stem, but everything is tidy and directed smoothly through your compatible bike’s upper headset bearing.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_stems-standard-or-ICR-integrated-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_stems-standard-or-ICR-integrated-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Sixpack Gravel Series cockpit components, stems - standard or ICR integrated cable routing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_stems-standard-or-ICR-integrated-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_stems-standard-or-ICR-integrated-297x119.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_stems-standard-or-ICR-integrated-1536x614.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_stems-standard-or-ICR-integrated-120x48.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_stems-standard-or-ICR-integrated-768x307.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Sixpack-Gravel-Series-cockpit-components_stems-standard-or-ICR-integrated-2048x819.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The standard Sixpack Gravel Stem sells for 70€, or 90€ for the ICR version with spacers.
