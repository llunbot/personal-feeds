A <a href=\"https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/directv-disney-reach-agreement-in-principle/\">joint announcement</a> said the companies reached an agreement in principle and that \"Disney's full linear suite of networks has been restored to DirecTV, DirecTV Stream and U-verse customers while both parties work to finalize a new, multi-year contract.\"</p>\n<p>While Disney previously accused DirecTV of \"undervaluing\" its content, DirecTV said during the blackout that it was seeking flexibility to sell slimmed-down channel packages that don't force customers to buy channels they don't want. The joint announcement of the resolution said the new deal \"provides greater choice, value, and flexibility to [the companies'] mutual customers.\"</p>\n<p>The deal includes ABC and ESPN networks, Disney-branded channels, Freeform, FX networks, and National Geographic channels. DirecTV will be able to \"offer multiple genre-specific options—sports, entertainment, kids &amp; family—inclusive of Disney's linear networks along with Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+,\" the companies said.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049969#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049969&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5ff2f5f45bba5ebd0cce468449f68c5b5b658416eb0105b6017932f859152361","category":"Tech"}
