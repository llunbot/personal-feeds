As a result, Pu no longer expects iPhone 15 Pro models to be equipped with two additional Taptic Engines that would have provided haptic feedback when the solid-state buttons were pressed.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>iPhone 15 Pro Now Expected to Feature Two Volume Buttons and Mute Switch Replaced With Button</h2>\r<br />\nWhat a whirlwind of a week for iPhone 15 Pro rumors. The latest information suggests that the device will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/13/iphone-15-pro-two-button-volume/\">still be equipped with two volume buttons like existing models</a>, but the longstanding Ring/Silent switch is expected to be replaced with a button. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/11/iPhone-14-Pro-Purple-Side-Perspective-Feature-Purple.jpg\" alt width=\"2250\" height=\"1265\" />\r<br />\nWhile a unified volume button is no longer expected for the iPhone 15 Pro, we <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/13/iphone-15-pro-volume-button-renders/\">shared exclusive renders</a> of what the design would have looked like. It's possible that Apple will move forward with this design with the iPhone 16 Pro next year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>iOS 17 Rumored to Improve Search, Dynamic Island, Control Center, and More</h2>\r<br />\nAhead of Apple unveiling iOS 17 at WWDC in June, an anonymous source who shared accurate information in the past has revealed <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/12/ios-17-rumored-features/\">potential new features coming with the update</a>, including improvements to Search, the Dynamic Island, Control Center, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/iOS-17-Control-Center-Feature.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThe source also claimed that Apple is internally <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/12/ios-17-interactive-widgets-rumor/\">testing interactive Home Screen widgets on iOS 17</a>, but they are unsure if this feature will make the final cut.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Production of 15-Inch MacBook Air Components Underway, WWDC Launch Looking Likely</h2>\r<br />\nDisplay panel production for a larger-screened 15.5-inch MacBook Air has been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/10/15-inch-macbook-air-component-production/\">ramping up since February</a>, according to analyst Ross Young. He says he doesn't know the \"precise launch timing\" and assumes it could happen in \"late April/early May,\" but a debut at WWDC in early June is perhaps more likely to give Apple an opportunity to show it off on stage.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/MacBook-Air-Multiple-Sizes-Feature.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nDesign wise, the larger ‌MacBook Air‌ is expected to feature essentially the same design as the current 13.6-inch model and it appears it will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/14/15-inch-macbook-air-m2-like-chip-logs/\">use a similar M2-like chip</a> rather than a next-generation M3 chip.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Card Savings Account Likely Launching Next Week</h2>\r<br />\nApple Card Savings will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/13/apple-card-savings-account-launch-date-rumor/\">likely be available starting Monday, April 17</a>, according to backend code on Apple's servers uncovered by @aaronp613. The code also suggests that an iPhone with iOS 16.3 or later will be required to use the feature.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/apple-card-savings-account-april-17-feature.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThe feature will let Apple Card users open a high-yield savings account from Goldman Sachs in the Wallet app and start earning interest on their Daily Cash balance.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>iPhone SE 4: Here's What the Latest Rumors Say</h2>\r<br />\nRumors about a fourth-generation iPhone SE have been circulating since just months after the current model launched in 2022.
