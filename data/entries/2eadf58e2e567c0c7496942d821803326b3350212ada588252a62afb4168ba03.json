All of the bikes in this article have been ridden and rated by BikeRadar’s expert testers.</p>\n<p>Gravel and all-road are terms used for this rapidly growing segment of the drop-bar bike market. These bikes have generous tyre clearances and gravel-specific geometry that is typically more stable and forgiving than traditional <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/sizing-and-fit/road-bike-geometry-explained/\">road bike geometry</a>.</p>\n<p>Modern gravel bikes were born out of the American Midwest, where <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/gravel-racing/\">gravel racing</a> took hold a decade ago and has gained popularity steadily.</p>\n<p>In the early days, riders tackled these endurance events on cyclocross bikes. Today, there are numerous purpose-built machines, from <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-race-bikes/\">gravel race bikes</a> and versatile <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/all-road-bikes-explained/\">all-road bikes</a> that rival the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bikes/\">best road bikes</a>, to progressive gravel bikes that resemble drop-bar mountain bikes.</p>\n<p>Our team of testers have been involved in the world of gravel bikes since its inception. Our senior tech editor Warren Rossiter first tested a thoroughbred gravel bike at the beginning of the 2010s and since then he reckons he’s tested close to 200 gravel bikes.</p>\n<p>Many of our testers have also come to gravel via road riding or mountain biking. They bring a unique mix of insight and expertise, analysing how these bikes compare to the best road or best mountain bikes.</p>\n<p>The selection of gravel bikes in this list represents the very best gravel bikes we’ve tested, across frame materials, riding styles and price points. This means there should be something for everyone, from those looking for a cheap entry into off-road riding to those looking to take on the Silk Road Mountain Race or Unbound.</p>\n<p>The best gravel bike frames come in the same variety of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-frame-materials/\">frame materials</a> as other bike types, with carbon, aluminium, titanium and steel options commonly available.</p>\n<p>We have split our list of top-performing gravel bikes into each different frame material.

The Seigla isn’t compatible with front derailleurs and it uses a wider BSA73 bottom bracket shell, limiting crankset options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/gravel-bikes/lauf-seigla-review/\">Read our full Lauf Seigla Weekend Warrior review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h4>Orbea Terra M21e Team 1X</h4>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Orbea Terra M21e Team 1X gravel bike\" title=\"Orbea Terra M21e Team 1X - 01\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Orbea Terra M21e is one of the most appealing gravel bikes on the market.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li>£5,358/$5,874/€5,364 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Compliant and comfortable; quick handling; fast</li>\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Wheels warrant an upgrade</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Orbea Terra M21e Team 1X is one of the most appealing gravel bikes on the market, offering all-round capability, speed, comfort, confident handling and last but not least, fun.</p>\n<p>The lightweight frame doesn’t drag on long climbs and would be a good choice for gravel racing.

Since these bicycles are designed to traverse miles of unpaved roads, their tyres are substantially larger. Likewise, mud clearance is also a concern in these conditions.</p>\n<p>Tyre widths range anywhere from 30mm to 48mm. In addition to 700c wheels, it is also common to see smaller-diameter 650b wheels used with higher-volume tyres. Many of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-tyres/\">best gravel bike tyres</a> feature a fast-rolling centre tread with knurling or side knobs to improve cornering ability on mixed surfaces.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/tubeless/\">Tubeless tyres</a> are also commonly found on gravel bikes because the latex <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/which-tubeless-sealant-works-the-best/\">tubeless sealant</a> provides a degree of insurance against punctures.</p>\n<h3>Geometry</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Cannondale Topstone Carbon Lefty 1\" title=\"Cannondale Topstone Carbon Lefty 1 08\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Given the terrain gravel bikes are expected to cover, frame geometry often rests somewhere between road bikes and cross-country mountain bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>In addition to wider tyres, gravel bikes have geometry that favours stability and comfort.</p>\n<p>The best gravel bikes have a longer wheelbase than most road bikes thanks to longer chainstays and slacker head-tube angles.</p>\n<p>Head tubes are generally taller as well, placing the rider in a more relaxed, upright position. Bottom brackets are often lower, which gives the rider the sensation of riding in, rather than on the bicycle.</p>\n<p>The end result of these geometry differences is a more comfortable, confidence-inspiring and forgiving ride than you would find in a typical road bike.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-womens-road-bikes/\">best women’s gravel bikes</a> follow the same principles in terms of geometry but are often tailored to better suit women riders.</p>\n<h3>Frame features</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Toptube with mounts on the Pearson Off Grid gravel bike\" title=\"Pearson Off Grid 11\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Gravel bikes often have mounting points for bags on the frame and even on the fork legs.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Another thing you’ll usually find on gravel bikes that road bikes don’t have is extra mounting points for luggage. That allows them to be used for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/bikepacking/\">bikepacking</a> or just lets you add a third water bottle for long rides in the outback where water sources may be scarce. Likewise, there are often mounts on the top tube for a feed bag.</p>\n<p>Gravel bikes also usually have mounts for a rack and mudguards/fenders, so they can do double duty as poor weather road bikes.</p>\n<p>There’s a newer category of gravel race bikes though, like the Pinarello Grevil F and the Cervélo Áspero, which abandon their bikepacking pretensions and just have a fairly standard set of road-type mounts, maybe with extra bottle cage bosses under the down tube. They’ll have a more racy geometry, more like a road bike, and often include aero features and tube profiles.</p>\n<h3>Handlebars and stem</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"XR D-Fuse bar on the Giant Revolt Advanced gravel bike\" title=\"Giant Revolt Advanced 2022 news - 13\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Flared handlebars are increasingly common on gravel bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Warren Rossiter / Immediate media</i></span></div>\n<p>Gravel bikes typically have a shorter stem and wider handlebars than road-going drop bar bikes. That mirrors mountain bike geometry and leads to a bike that’s more easily manoeuvred over variable terrain.</p>\n<p>The handlebars usually have a flare to them, where they widen out from the tops to the drops. That gives you more control when descending in the drops. It also means that if you decide to fit a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-handlebar-bags/\">handlebar bag</a>, there’s more space to grab the drops without the bag getting in the way.</p>\n<h3>Gearing</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Specialized S-Works Crux gravel bike\" title=\"Specialized S-Works Crux - 04\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Wide range 1x drivetrains are common for gravel riding.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Gearing is another area where gravel bikes diverge from the pack.</p>\n<p>The rise of gravel bikes has, in turn, been accompanied by the arrival of gravel-specific groupsets. While early gravel bikes might have featured <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/road-bike-groupsets-everything-you-need-to-know/\">road bike groupsets</a> with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/cranksets/\">compact cranksets</a>, the latest gravel groupsets – including <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/shimano-grx-review/\">Shimano GRX</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/campagnolo-ekar-groupset-review/\">Campagnolo Ekar</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/gravel-groupset/sram-red-etap-axs-xplr/\">SRAM XPLR</a> – provide a more suitable and forgiving selection of gears.</p>\n<p>Given the terrain, many gravel bikes feature sub-compact <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/cranksets/\">cranksets</a> and wide-range <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/bike-cassettes/\">cassettes</a>, to give a spread of gearing that remains fast on the road, while providing a low enough bottom gear for off-road climbing.</p>\n<p>Double cranksets with 48/32t chainrings are common. Likewise, many gravel bikes come with 1x gearing and super-wide cassettes, keeping the drivetrain simple by removing the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/front-derailleur/\">front derailleur</a>.</p>\n<p>You can read our guide to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/gravel-bike-setup/\">gravel bike setup</a> for more on gearing choices.</p>\n<h3>Suspension</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"RockShox Rudy Ultimate XPLR fork for gravel bikes\" title=\"RockShox Rudy Ultimate XPLR fork - Rudy\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Suspension forks are increasingly common on gravel bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>In addition to wide tyres, relaxed geometry and low gearing, many of the latest machines have active or passive <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/gravel-bike-suspension/\">gravel bike suspension</a> systems built into them.</p>\n<p>Much like bikes in the endurance road category, these features could take the form of slender chainstays, a bowed top tube or a skinny seatpost, all of which are designed to flex in order to absorb road chatter.</p>\n<p>Some of the best gravel bikes take things one step further by using short-travel suspension forks, such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/cannondale-lefty-oliver-road-bike-fork-confirmed/\">Lefty Oliver</a> or aesthetically odd but very effective <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/forks/suspension-forks/lauf-grit-fork-review/\">Lauf Grit fork</a>.</p>\n<p>We’ve also seen the arrival of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/forks/suspension-forks/rockshox-rudy-ultimate-xplr-fork-review/\">RockShox Rudy XPLR</a> gravel fork and the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/fox-32-tc-gravel-fork/\">Fox 32 Taper-Cast Gravel</a>.</p>\n<h3>How much do I have to spend on a gravel bike?</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Cannondale Topstone Alloy 2 gravel bike\" title=\"Cannondale Topstone Alloy 2 gravel bike_2\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Cannondale Topstone Alloy 2</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Well, that depends on what you define as a gravel bike.
