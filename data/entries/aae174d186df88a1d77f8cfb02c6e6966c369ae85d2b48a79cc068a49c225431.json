On the downside, QLC has comparatively slower read and write speeds.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's worth noting that in the last couple of years we have seen rumors that both the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/01/iphone-14-to-feature-2tb-storage/\">iPhone 14 Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/07/iphone-15-pro-2tb-storage-option/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a> would feature 2TB options for the same reason, but they turned out to be false. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThat said, this year Apple is expected to add a new \"Capture Button\" to the iPhone 16 models for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/18/iphone-16-capture-button-touch-pressure/\">taking video</a>. According to <em>The Information</em>, the button is being introduced to further push the iPhone as a camera alternative for shooting horizontal video, so offering higher storage options could be part of that plan.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/naver/\">Naver</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/iphone-16-pro-2tb-option-rumor/\">iPhone 16 Pro Models to Come With 2TB Storage Option, Claims Rumor</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-pro-models-to-come-with-2tb-storage-option-claims-rumor.2416765/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"aae174d186df88a1d77f8cfb02c6e6966c369ae85d2b48a79cc068a49c225431","category":"Apple"}
