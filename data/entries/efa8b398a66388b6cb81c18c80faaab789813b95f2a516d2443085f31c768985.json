A project in development “for several years”, Carbon Wasp describes their new Gearbox Hardtail as the “ultimate” bike for winter mountain biking, combining modern trail geometry, hardtail simplicity, and gearbox durability. A bike “<em>designed to stand up to the worst conditions you can throw at it and still come back for more</em>“.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Carbon Wasp Gearbox Hardtail: UK-made mountain bike frame</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Carbon-Wasp-Gearbox-Hardtail_UK-made-trail-mountain-bike-frame_winter-blue-sky-riding-in-Yorkshire-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Carbon-Wasp-Gearbox-Hardtail_UK-made-trail-mountain-bike-frame_winter-blue-sky-riding-in-Yorkshire-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Carbon Wasp Gearbox Hardtail, a UK-made trail mountain bike frame, winter riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Carbon-Wasp-Gearbox-Hardtail_UK-made-trail-mountain-bike-frame_winter-blue-sky-riding-in-Yorkshire-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Carbon-Wasp-Gearbox-Hardtail_UK-made-trail-mountain-bike-frame_winter-blue-sky-riding-in-Yorkshire-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Carbon-Wasp-Gearbox-Hardtail_UK-made-trail-mountain-bike-frame_winter-blue-sky-riding-in-Yorkshire-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Carbon-Wasp-Gearbox-Hardtail_UK-made-trail-mountain-bike-frame_winter-blue-sky-riding-in-Yorkshire-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Carbon-Wasp-Gearbox-Hardtail_UK-made-trail-mountain-bike-frame_winter-blue-sky-riding-in-Yorkshire-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(All photos/Carbon Wasp)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Carbon Wasp is all about their handmade carbon mountain bikes. Now, their new Carbon Gearbox Hardtail looks like a cool option for riders looking for a low-maintenance trail bike to get them through mud &amp; snow season! And while it’s not exactly cheap, the Carbon Wasp Gearbox Hardtail has a totally palatable pricetag, especially when you consider that it is made in the UK, with lots of customization possibilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/carbon-wasp-3d-printed-ti-crankset-pinion-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/carbon-wasp-3d-printed-ti-crankset-pinion-2-edited.webp\" alt=\"carbon wasp titanium crank arms for pinion gearbox\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/carbon-wasp-3d-printed-ti-crankset-pinion-2-edited.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/carbon-wasp-3d-printed-ti-crankset-pinion-2-edited-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/carbon-wasp-3d-printed-ti-crankset-pinion-2-edited-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/carbon-wasp-3d-printed-ti-crankset-pinion-2-edited-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/carbon-wasp-3d-printed-ti-crankset-pinion-2-edited-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/carbon-wasp-3d-printed-ti-crankset-pinion-2-edited-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We mostly know the frame builder for their UK-made carbon trail bike – the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2024-carbon-wasp-truffle-uk-made-carbon-xc-mountain-bike-updated/\" target=\"_blank\">120mm Truffle</a>.

One benefit of only selling frames is that every bike is a custom build. They also wanted riders to pick which gearbox they prefer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pinion seems like the industry default these days, and the new electronic shift SmartShift versions also make for a clean setup. But there’s another interesting French gearbox maker that we haven’t really talked about much in years, although we have seen them pop up from time-to-time… <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?s=Effigear\" target=\"_blank\">Effigear</a>. Their latest Effigear <a href=\"https://www.effigear.com/en/135-The-Mimic.html\" target=\"_blank\">Mimic</a> gearbox bolts up to the same mount as Pinion, but actually has faster engagement and can be run with a fixed rear hub, unique variable steps between its gears more like a traditional derailleur system, and it is operated with standard mechanical SRAM dropbar or flat bar shifters. More options is always better, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carbon Wasp also builds their bikes with pretty standard tapered steerer headsets, too. But if you want they’ll make you a straight 56mm headset to run an angle adjust headset to further tweak your geometry. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Carbon-Wasp-Gearbox-Hardtail_UK-made-trail-mountain-bike-frame_geometry-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2400\" height=\"1800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Carbon-Wasp-Gearbox-Hardtail_UK-made-trail-mountain-bike-frame_geometry-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Carbon Wasp Gearbox Hardtail, a UK-made trail mountain bike frame, geometry\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Carbon-Wasp-Gearbox-Hardtail_UK-made-trail-mountain-bike-frame_geometry-jpg.webp 2400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Carbon-Wasp-Gearbox-Hardtail_UK-made-trail-mountain-bike-frame_geometry-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Carbon-Wasp-Gearbox-Hardtail_UK-made-trail-mountain-bike-frame_geometry-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Carbon-Wasp-Gearbox-Hardtail_UK-made-trail-mountain-bike-frame_geometry-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Carbon-Wasp-Gearbox-Hardtail_UK-made-trail-mountain-bike-frame_geometry-768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Carbon-Wasp-Gearbox-Hardtail_UK-made-trail-mountain-bike-frame_geometry-2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Carbon Gearbox Hardtail does feature pretty modern trail geometry – a slack 65° headtube angle, steep 76° seat angle, chainstays as short as 430mm, and medium-long 480mm Reach on the size Large that I would ride. But they also customize geometry a bit if have some other needs in mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a

Or get it with a Pinion gearbox already installed for £2550 (<em>~$3230/3065€</em>).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Carbon-Wasp-Gearbox-Fat-Bike_UK-made-carbon-fatbike-frame_complete-bike-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Carbon-Wasp-Gearbox-Fat-Bike_UK-made-carbon-fatbike-frame_complete-bike-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Carbon Wasp Gearbox Fat Bike, UK-made carbon fatbike frame, complete bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Carbon-Wasp-Gearbox-Fat-Bike_UK-made-carbon-fatbike-frame_complete-bike-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Carbon-Wasp-Gearbox-Fat-Bike_UK-made-carbon-fatbike-frame_complete-bike-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Carbon-Wasp-Gearbox-Fat-Bike_UK-made-carbon-fatbike-frame_complete-bike-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Carbon-Wasp-Gearbox-Fat-Bike_UK-made-carbon-fatbike-frame_complete-bike-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Carbon-Wasp-Gearbox-Fat-Bike_UK-made-carbon-fatbike-frame_complete-bike-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Carbon-Wasp-Gearbox-Fat-Bike_UK-made-carbon-fatbike-frame_complete-bike-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>Carbon Gearbox Fat Bike</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Especially interesting this time of year, Carbon Wasp also makes a <a href=\"https://carbonwasp.com/products/carbon-gearbox-fat-bike\" target=\"_blank\">Gearbox Fat Bike</a> hardtail for the same price designed for up to 26×5″ tires (or likely ~27.5×4.5″ if that’s your preference.)

They say it better protects wear areas of the frame, while also highlighting the frame’s straight-out-of-the-mold carbon fiber weave in between. They do like their classic Wasp yellow, but any single-color wrap is included in the standard frame prices. More complex patterns &amp; colors are also possible, for an additional fee.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Carbon-Wasp-Gearbox-Hardtail_UK-made-trail-mountain-bike-frame_winter-riding-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Carbon-Wasp-Gearbox-Hardtail_UK-made-trail-mountain-bike-frame_winter-riding-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Carbon Wasp Gearbox Hardtail, a UK-made trail mountain bike frame, winter riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Carbon-Wasp-Gearbox-Hardtail_UK-made-trail-mountain-bike-frame_winter-riding-jpg.webp 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Carbon-Wasp-Gearbox-Hardtail_UK-made-trail-mountain-bike-frame_winter-riding-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Carbon-Wasp-Gearbox-Hardtail_UK-made-trail-mountain-bike-frame_winter-riding-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Carbon-Wasp-Gearbox-Hardtail_UK-made-trail-mountain-bike-frame_winter-riding-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Carbon-Wasp-Gearbox-Hardtail_or-maybe-a-fatbike-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Carbon-Wasp-Gearbox-Hardtail_or-maybe-a-fatbike-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Carbon Wasp Gearbox Fat Bike, UK-made carbon fatbike frame, winter riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Carbon-Wasp-Gearbox-Hardtail_or-maybe-a-fatbike-jpg.webp 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Carbon-Wasp-Gearbox-Hardtail_or-maybe-a-fatbike-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Carbon-Wasp-Gearbox-Hardtail_or-maybe-a-fatbike-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2024-Carbon-Wasp-Gearbox-Hardtail_or-maybe-a-fatbike-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Even with its fully handmade construction in Yorkshire, Carbon Wasp says they can get a new Gearbox Hardtail to you in just 4 weeks, if you order yours today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://carbonwasp.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>CarbonWasp.com</em></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/carbon-wasp-lays-up-new-gearbox-hardtail-mountain-bike-in-the-uk/\">Carbon Wasp Lays Up New Gearbox Hardtail Mountain Bike in the UK</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"efa8b398a66388b6cb81c18c80faaab789813b95f2a516d2443085f31c768985","category":"Cycling"}
