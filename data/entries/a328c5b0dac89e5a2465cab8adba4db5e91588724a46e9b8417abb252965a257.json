At knifepoint, they proceeded to ransack our belongings,” Cavendish wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cavendish said that “two watches of great sentiment and value” were among the items that the thieves stole, “but far, far worse to be taken was the sense of security, safety, privacy, and dignity that my young family and everybody else is entitled to in their own home.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cavendish also asked that anyone with information come forward and help, saying that “the effect that this nightmare has had on my family is already heart-breakingly evident.”</p>\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<div> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CXOlREkoSQZ/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"> <p></p>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div>View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</a><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CXOlREkoSQZ/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CXOlREkoSQZ/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by Mark Cavendish (@markcavendish)</a></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p><p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/12/cavendish-and-family-robbed-by-armed-men-who-broke-into-home/\">Read More</a>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"a328c5b0dac89e5a2465cab8adba4db5e91588724a46e9b8417abb252965a257","category":"Cycling"}
