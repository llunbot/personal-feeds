Most of these involve evolutionary improvements on previous generations of hardware. But this year, we have something new: the first company to market with a new qubit technology.</p>\n<p>The technology is called a dual-rail qubit, and it is intended to make the most common form of error trivially easy to detect in hardware, thus making error correction far more efficient. And, while tech giant Amazon has <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/03/quantum-computing-progress-higher-temps-better-error-correction/\">been experimenting with them</a>, a startup called Quantum Circuits is the first to give the public access to dual-rail qubits via a cloud service.</p>\n<p>While the tech is interesting on its own, it also provides us with a window into how the field as a whole is thinking about getting error-corrected quantum computing to work.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/first-commercial-dual-rail-qubit-hardware-announced/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/first-commercial-dual-rail-qubit-hardware-announced/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"23246f319316d5f08c3366e82f2d3a339255fa02adc11b20853771cfccab6894","category":"Tech"}
