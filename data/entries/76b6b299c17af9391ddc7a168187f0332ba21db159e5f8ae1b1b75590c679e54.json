The subscription includes winching, fuel delivery, battery jumpstarts, tire changes, towing, and more, though there are limits on all services.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRoadside Assistance through Verizon includes four service claims in a wireless coverage area and one claim outside of wireless coverage, though Verizon notes that non-coverage area service requests are only available on iOS 17.2 ‌iPhone 14‌ and ‌iPhone 15‌ models that offer satellite connectivity.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nVerizon does offer its subscribers pay per use roadside assistance without a subscription. Towing is priced starting at $154, a jump start is $92, and a tire change is $98.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple announced Roadside Assistance via Satellite alongside the new ‌iPhone 15‌ models, adding it to the Emergency SOS via Satellite function. Apple routes customers to either AAA or Verizon, and does not provide any roadside assistance itself.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple includes two years of Emergency SOS via Satellite and Roadside Assistance via Satellite connectivity for free with the purchase of an ‌‌iPhone 14‌‌ or ‌‌iPhone 15‌‌, but actual roadside assistance fees need to be paid to Verizon or AAA. Roadside Assistance via Satellite is limited to the United States at this time.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/verizon/\">Verizon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/emergency-sos-via-satellite/\">Emergency SOS via Satellite</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/19/verizon-roadside-assistance-apple-satellite/\">Verizon Roadside Assistance Now Works With Apple's Satellite Connection</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/verizon-roadside-assistance-now-works-with-apples-satellite-connection.2414185/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"76b6b299c17af9391ddc7a168187f0332ba21db159e5f8ae1b1b75590c679e54","category":"Apple"}
