The V2 dropper had a Schrader valve under the saddle that let you adjust air pressure to customize the return speed and force required to compress it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/OneUp-Components-V3-Dropper-Post-3.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/OneUp-Components-V3-Dropper-Post-3.jpg\" alt=\"oneup v3 dropper seatpost shown from side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/OneUp-Components-V3-Dropper-Post-3.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/OneUp-Components-V3-Dropper-Post-3-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/OneUp-Components-V3-Dropper-Post-3-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/OneUp-Components-V3-Dropper-Post-3-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/OneUp-Components-V3-Dropper-Post-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/OneUp-Components-V3-Dropper-Post-3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/OneUp-Components-V3-Dropper-Post-3-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, it’s fixed, which removed all of the hardware necessary to add that valve. They also trimmed and cut here and there to shave as many grams as possible. They say it’s:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>238g lighter than Reverb AXS</li>\n\n\n\n<li>155g lighter than Fox Transfer</li>\n\n\n\n<li>up to 60g lighter than the two-position Transfer SL</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>And you can save another 10g with their ti bolt kit upgrade. Claimed weights, travel options, and sizes are:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><table><thead><tr><th><br />Diameter</th><th>90mm</th><th>120mm</th><th>150mm</th><th>180mm</th><th>210mm</th><th>240mm</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>30.9</td><td>325g</td><td>370g</td><td>415g</td><td>460g</td><td>515g</td><td>585g</td></tr><tr><td>31.6</td><td>337g</td><td>385g</td><td>433g</td><td>480g</td><td>538g</td><td>610g</td></tr><tr><td>34.9</td><td>408g</td><td>472g</td><td>535g</td><td>600g</td><td>675g</td><td>765g</td></tr><tr><td>27.2</td><td>304g</td><td>340g</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Total Length</td><td>295mm</td><td>350mm</td><td>415mm</td><td>480mm</td><td>545mm</td><td>610mm</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One of OneUp’s claims to fame with their dropper seatpost is the incredibly low stack height thanks to a sunken saddle clamp. This gives them one of the longest drops with the shortest lengths, often letting you run a longer dropper post than you can with competing brands, and the V3’s total length per drop is 10mm shorter than V2.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/OneUp-Components-V3-Dropper-Post-2.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/OneUp-Components-V3-Dropper-Post-2.jpg\" alt=\"closeup of a oneup v3 dropper seatpost on a bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/OneUp-Components-V3-Dropper-Post-2.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/OneUp-Components-V3-Dropper-Post-2-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/OneUp-Components-V3-Dropper-Post-2-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/OneUp-Components-V3-Dropper-Post-2-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/OneUp-Components-V3-Dropper-Post-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/OneUp-Components-V3-Dropper-Post-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/OneUp-Components-V3-Dropper-Post-2-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The extended length is in the chart above, and the total compressed stack height that sticks above your frame’s seatpost collar is just 30mm (25mm for 34.9) which is 3mm shorter than before.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Upgraded Internals, too</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/OneUp-Components-V3-Dropper-Post-Exploded-View.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/OneUp-Components-V3-Dropper-Post-Exploded-View.jpg\" alt=\"internals for oneup v3 dropper seatpost\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/OneUp-Components-V3-Dropper-Post-Exploded-View.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/OneUp-Components-V3-Dropper-Post-Exploded-View-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/OneUp-Components-V3-Dropper-Post-Exploded-View-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/OneUp-Components-V3-Dropper-Post-Exploded-View-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/OneUp-Components-V3-Dropper-Post-Exploded-View-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/OneUp-Components-V3-Dropper-Post-Exploded-View-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/OneUp-Components-V3-Dropper-Post-Exploded-View-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside is an all-new cartridge that requires 75% lever force to open, and much less breakaway force to initiate compression. That means quicker, easier drops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of the bushings are now self-lubricating IGUS bushings with increased overlap, which makes them smoother and stiffer. Longer travel 180/210/240mm droppers have an extra bushing to support the increased stanchion length.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They also doubled the number of anti-rotation pins to keep the saddle pointing where it should, reducing rotational play without adding friction. Two additional oversized polymer pins help further. Lastly, the seals are all new with an improved collar and SKF wiper seal to keep crud out and lubrication in. These new collars with SKF seal will also be available for V2 droppers soon, and they promise parts for all V2 droppers will remain available for at least five years</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pricing, Warranty &amp; Service Details</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The new OneUp V3 dropper retails for $269.99 ($399.99 CAD / €299.99 / £289.99). It’s compatible with their V3 remote (sold separately, or as a bundle for a slight discount), all with a 2-year warranty. The Ti Bolt Upgrade kit is $14.99 and also fits the V2 posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The post can be easily disassembled with only a 14mm wrench and 2mm/5mm hex wrenches. No custom tools are needed. They recommend cleaning and greasing it after 120 hours, and a full rebuild after 350 hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.OneUpComponents.com\">OneUpComponents.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/oneup-components-v3-dropper-post-gets-lighter-smoother/\">OneUp Components V3 Dropper Post gets Lighter &amp; Smoother</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"ffe805306e2229d1189ad9932bfd844b456a4acc1b1f3b6c34017063529a83a4","category":"Cycling"}
