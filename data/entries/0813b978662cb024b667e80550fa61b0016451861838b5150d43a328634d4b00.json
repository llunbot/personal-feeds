Most framebuilders will have a common template and then they’ll tweak the geometry for the customer. I like to do everything a little bit custom, a little bit different, and that doesn’t scale well. For me it’s a passion project.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the past five years Ryden has created bespoke bikes from his home in  Berkshire. An IT professional by day, he spends his spare time taking on one-off projects for customers with big ideas. Previous ones include a 650b flat-bar gravel bike built for Grinduro, an autumn-specific WRC Subaru-blue road bike and, most recently, this Lucienne Day-inspired Columbus XCr racer with a custom 3D printed headset.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/silva-cycles\">Meet the makers: Guy Munnings and Dai Williams of Silva Cycles</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/sideways-viola-townsend\">Meet the maker: Viola Townsend of Sideways</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 140: on sale now!</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>‘I work for Google at the moment,’ says Ryden. ‘I’ve always cycled, though. I had a bike when I was three with solid rubber tyres and I remember mum and dad saying they had to buy me a new one because I’d completely worn them out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I was into mountain biking initially. I did some crazy stuff like the TransRockies, all the standard 24-hour races in the UK and that kind of thing. I’ve always tried to do at least one cool thing every year – it’s good to have a bit of a target to keep me focussed and fit.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Ryden’s not working or plotting his next multi-day adventure, he can be found at home welding tubes, filing fillets and 3D printing various bits and bobs for his bikes. He has even created a smart setup tool for checking and replicating bike-fit measurements.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"646\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/meet-the-maker-ryden-bikes-02-646x970.jpg\" alt=\"Meet the maker Ryden Bikes\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/meet-the-maker-ryden-bikes-02.jpg 646w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/meet-the-maker-ryden-bikes-02.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/meet-the-maker-ryden-bikes-02.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/meet-the-maker-ryden-bikes-02.jpg 1022w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/meet-the-maker-ryden-bikes-02.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/meet-the-maker-ryden-bikes-02.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/meet-the-maker-ryden-bikes-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Darren Ryden juggles working at Google by day with building one-off bikes such as this Lucienne Day-inspired racer. Don’t rush him, though – the paint alone on this took seven weeks.</figcaption><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘I took ten of them with me to Bespoked [the handmade bicycle show] a couple of years ago,’ says Ryden. ‘I sold them all before the doors opened. I don’t make much money from them – the idea is just to get people to realise they can enjoy riding their bike more if it’s set up right, and to give them a low-cost tool that enables them to do that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘When you go to a bike-fitter, they’ve generally got something big and metal and expensive, whereas this is available on printables.com to 3D print for free.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Frame of the Day</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bike-fit gizmos aside, one of Ryden’s most impressive creations is the one pictured here. It’s an XCr stainless steel road bike with a 12-speed Shimano Ultegra Di2 groupset and Zipp 454 NSW wheelset. It has a Scott fork and Syncros cockpit, with fully integrated cables thanks to a custom 3D printed headset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The main structure of the frame is standard TIG-welded, but the headset cups are custom with internal routing. It uses the Syncros handlebar as the routing system for the cables.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/meet-the-maker-ryden-bikes-03-970x645.jpg\" alt=\"Meet the maker Ryden Bikes\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/meet-the-maker-ryden-bikes-03.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/meet-the-maker-ryden-bikes-03.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/meet-the-maker-ryden-bikes-03.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/meet-the-maker-ryden-bikes-03.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/meet-the-maker-ryden-bikes-03.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/meet-the-maker-ryden-bikes-03.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/meet-the-maker-ryden-bikes-03.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/meet-the-maker-ryden-bikes-03.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/meet-the-maker-ryden-bikes-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘When you build something custom it doesn’t cost any more money to make it perfect. So the fact that you can get every angle right and every length of every tube right to make it exactly what you want is fascinating to me.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One key feature of all his most recent builds is the ‘bend’ in the seatstays, which first came about when he was working on a bike for a previous customer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘He wanted the seatstays and down tube as parallel as possible. Obviously the more you drop the stays, the closer they get to the wheel. And with stainless steel you can’t bend the tubes. So I just sat down, looked at it, opened a beer and thought, “Ah screw it, I’ll just cut them, weld it and put them back in.” It came out really well and I thought, “Right, I could do that on all of my bikes now.”’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\"><img width=\"842\" height=\"297\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3.jpg\" alt=\"Subscribe to Cyclist Magazine\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3.jpg 842w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3.jpg 750w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The striking paint job comes courtesy of Quintessential Customs Workshop and is inspired by British textile designer Lucienne Day’s vibrant patterned fabrics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘There are 17 different processes on this frame,’ says Ryden. ‘That’s seven weeks’ worth of painting. You’ve got raw exposed stainless steel in places. The shiny bits are the actual tube. You can’t prime it so you use a clear coat as a primer, then rub it down and start your colours. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/meet-the-maker-ryden-bikes-04-970x645.jpg\" alt=\"Meet the maker Ryden Bikes\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/meet-the-maker-ryden-bikes-04.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/meet-the-maker-ryden-bikes-04.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/meet-the-maker-ryden-bikes-04.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/meet-the-maker-ryden-bikes-04.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/meet-the-maker-ryden-bikes-04.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/meet-the-maker-ryden-bikes-04.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/meet-the-maker-ryden-bikes-04.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/meet-the-maker-ryden-bikes-04.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/meet-the-maker-ryden-bikes-04.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘There’s a base yellow and then it’s got what’s called a drop coat where there are two different yellows on top of that. When you look up close it’s textured, a bit like sandpaper. Even the Columbus logo has five colours in it, and that’s just one tiny thing – totally crazy.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ryden’s creations have garnered plenty of interest but he won’t take on just any old build.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘What I say is that I do interesting projects with bikes rather than builds. There are plenty of really good builders out there who are doing it for a living. Go to them. For anyone who does want to come to me, there’s got to be a good reason or a story behind it. This one was designed for a friend of mine who found out that he has a hole in his heart. We did it while he was waiting for treatment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘You can go and buy a technically better or lighter carbon bike, but I want to make those bikes that you just want to ride. It might not be the fastest but it’s the one in your garage you’re drawn to, and it will stand the test of time in a way that a carbon bike won’t.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>• This article originally appeared in issue 139 of <em>Cyclist </em>magazine. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to subscribe</a></strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/ryden-bikes\">Meet the maker: Darren Ryden of Ryden Bikes</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"0813b978662cb024b667e80550fa61b0016451861838b5150d43a328634d4b00","category":"Cycling"}
