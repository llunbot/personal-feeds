This new beta version, separate from the Monterey beta or the ‌Safari Technology Preview‌, makes Safari 15 available for users of macOS Catalina.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/safari-15-beta-catalina.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nEarlier versions of Safari 15 included a significant redesign that did away with the dedicated URL and search interface, instead allowing any individual tab to be used for navigation input. Tabs were also all arranged at the top of the display to minimize the space taken up at the top of a Safari window.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAfter a number of complaints about the new interface from users, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/14/macos-monterey-safari-redesign/\">macOS Monterey beta 3</a> made these design changes optional. Safari 15 also includes <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/#safari_-_tab_groups\">new features</a> such as tab groups and a redesigned sidebar.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Safari 15 beta and the ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ allow users of macOS Catalina and ‌macOS Big Sur‌ to try the new design and features without needing to update their entire Mac's OS to a beta version of ‌macOS Monterey‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nNevertheless, <em>9to5Mac</em> reports that some users are also being invited by Apple to join the AppleSeed program to try a pre-release version of Safari 15 and provide feedback.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari/\">Safari</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/27/apple-releases-safari-15-beta-for-macos-catalina/\">Apple Releases Safari 15 Beta for macOS Catalina</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-safari-15-beta-for-macos-catalina.2305635/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=dJmnk2HFLMU:uh_4tk2Hkhk:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=dJmnk2HFLMU:uh_4tk2Hkhk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/dJmnk2HFLMU\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"01831817308fc01a16579d59c533831e081a200491f0eabe61ac879be74cd160","category":"Apple"}
