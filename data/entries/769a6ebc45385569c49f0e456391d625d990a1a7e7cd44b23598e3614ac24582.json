{"title":"It’s easier than ever to scrub your personal info from Google Search","link":"https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/02/google-makes-it-easier-to-remove-your-personal-data-from-search/","date":1740592962000,"content":"<p>As Google's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/google-loses-dojs-big-monopoly-trial-over-search-business/\">2024 antitrust loss</a> proved, the company has worked very, very hard to ensure its search engine is the primary roadmap for the Internet. Google scours the Internet for data about everything—even you. And if you don't want your personal info to wind up in Google search results, you can use the just-redesigned \"Results About You\" tool. The tool, which <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/google-can-now-remove-your-identifying-search-results-if-theyre-the-right-kind/\">began its rollout</a> in 2022, is easier to use now, and some of the most useful features are now better integrated with search results.</p>\n<p>The first step in using Results About You—which has not changed—is a bit alarming when you've set out to obscure your personal information. Just head to the new hub for <a href=\"https://myactivity.google.com/results-about-you\">Results About You</a> and enter your personal information. Google probably already knows your phone number, email, and even physical address, but this tells the tool what specific information to pluck out of search results. If that data is out there, Google has it whether or not you remove it from search results.</p>\n<p>Before this update, most of the Results About You features were limited to this console, but the most important features are now integrated with the search results. They're not exactly prominently displayed, though. When scrolling through a Google search (after the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/01/just-give-me-the-fing-links-cursing-disables-googles-ai-overviews/\">AI overview</a>, ads, knowledge graph, and more ads), you can use the three-dot menu next to a result to get data about it. This menu now includes options to remove the result right at the top.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/02/google-makes-it-easier-to-remove-your-personal-data-from-search/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/02/google-makes-it-easier-to-remove-your-personal-data-from-search/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ryan Whitwam","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"769a6ebc45385569c49f0e456391d625d990a1a7e7cd44b23598e3614ac24582","category":"Tech"}
