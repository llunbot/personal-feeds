Does Lenovo have a product for you!</p>\n<p>The Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid laptop at CES 2024 is both a Windows laptop and an Android tablet. The bottom half contains all the usual Intel laptop parts, while the top half packs a Qualcomm chip and a whole duplicate set of computing components. A detachable screen lets both halves come apart and operate separately, and you'll be spending your life riding the line between the Windows and Android ecosystems. Because you're getting two entirely separate computers, you'll also have to <em>pay</em> for two entirely separate computersâ€”the device costs $2,000.</p>\n<p>Because the device houses two entirely separate computers, you can separate them and run them at the same time. Of course, the tablet acts as an Android tablet when it's detached, but you can also plug the headless laptop base into a monitor and use Windows. Lenovo calls the tablet the \"Hybrid Tab\" while the bottom is the \"Hybrid Station,\" and the whole thing voltroned together forms the \"ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid.\" The laptop base runs Windows 11 and has an Intel Core Ultra 7 processor, 32GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, Intel graphics, and a 75 Whr battery. The tablet runs Android 13 on a Snapdragon 8+ gen 1 SoC, along with 12GB of RAM, 256GB of UFS 3.1 storage, and a 38 Whr battery.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995067#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995067&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fdf1d44dc2a0ed1cc66caaef27175b84c9078f6c5bad6aa2a4d882dd5d8fd294","category":"Tech"}
