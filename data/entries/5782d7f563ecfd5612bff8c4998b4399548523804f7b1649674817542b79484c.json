Though this is water’s freezing point, pure water will only freeze when temperatures plummet as low as minus 46° C (minus 50.8° F). So why does it usually freeze at zero anyway? Organisms such as bacteria, insects, and fungi produce proteins known as </span><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1693005/\"><span>ice nucleators</span></a><span> (non-protein nucleators can also be of abiotic origin).
