He was a full-time ‌iPad‌ user for several years, conducting all of his content creation, including video editing and podcasting, from the device, before feeling forced to switch back to the Mac due to the direction of iPadOS.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe get his insights on Apple's upcoming iPadOS 17 update and the areas he feels Apple should focus on this year, with particular attention to some of the key issues he believes Apple needs to address with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/stage-manager/\">Stage Manager</a>. We also touch on the need for \"Pro\" apps like Final Cut Pro and Xcode, a Notification Center and Control Center redesign, Lock Screen customization, and more. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition, we talk through some of the most important information around the next-generation ‌iPad Pro‌ models, which are rumored to sport <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/29/oled-ipads-2024/\">11.1-inch and 13-inch</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/05/ipad-pro-ltpo-oled-display-2023-rumor/\">OLED displays</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/12/oled-ipad-lightweight-design-and-image-quality/\">thinner and lighter</a> designs, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m3/\">M3</a> chip, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/14/ipad-pro-glass-apple-logo-prototype-report/\">wireless charging</a>. We also briefly discuss the rumored <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/09/2024-oled-ipad-pro-starting-prices/\">price rises</a> that are planned for the device owing to its more costly OLED display components – meaning that the 11.1- and 13-inch models could start at approximately $1,500 and $1,800, respectively.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs usual, we look at some of the week's biggest rumors, including the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/17/iphone-15-pro-max-thinnest-bezels-ever/\">slimmer bezels</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/20/iphone-15-volume-mute-buttons-cad/\">new mute button</a>, as well as the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/20/homepod-with-screen-delayed-next-year/\">delay</a> of Apple's first <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a> with a display.
