That helps to set Proton VPN apart from some of its rivals, and while it’s naturally a very limited membership, it’s ideal for anyone dipping their toe into the ever-shifting world of digital privacy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After all, VPNs are much more common these days than they have been for years, but all the “money back” guarantees in the world pale in comparison to a free trial. We’ll get onto the free version of the Proton VPN shortly, but it’s not just the low price of entry that makes Proton VPN easy to recommend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also offers a sleek interface with minimal chances of getting lost, all while offering impressive connection speeds and just about enough features to improve your day-to-day web experience without throwing too many complex concepts at new users</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, whether you’re looking for true internet privacy, want to see what’s on Netflix in Tunisia, or a little of both, Proton will provide.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Features &amp; Apps</h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Proton-VPN-Advanced-Features.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Proton VPN Advanced Features\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Proton-VPN-Advanced-Features.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 4112w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Proton-VPN-Advanced-Features.jpeg?resize=300%2C194&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Proton-VPN-Advanced-Features.jpeg?resize=768%2C496&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Proton-VPN-Advanced-Features.jpeg?resize=1200%2C776&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Proton-VPN-Advanced-Features.jpeg?resize=1536%2C993&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Proton-VPN-Advanced-Features.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1324&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"776\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption>Advanced Features: Proton keeps its advanced features within easy reach for all users.</figcaption>\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Proton VPN Advanced Features\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Proton-VPN-Advanced-Features.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 4112w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Proton-VPN-Advanced-Features.jpeg?resize=300%2C194&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Proton-VPN-Advanced-Features.jpeg?resize=768%2C496&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Proton-VPN-Advanced-Features.jpeg?resize=1200%2C776&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Proton-VPN-Advanced-Features.jpeg?resize=1536%2C993&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Proton-VPN-Advanced-Features.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1324&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"776\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption>Advanced Features: Proton keeps its advanced features within easy reach for all users.</figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Proton VPN Advanced Features\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Proton-VPN-Advanced-Features.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 4112w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Proton-VPN-Advanced-Features.jpeg?resize=300%2C194&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Proton-VPN-Advanced-Features.jpeg?resize=768%2C496&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Proton-VPN-Advanced-Features.jpeg?resize=1200%2C776&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Proton-VPN-Advanced-Features.jpeg?resize=1536%2C993&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Proton-VPN-Advanced-Features.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1324&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"776\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption>Advanced Features: Proton keeps its advanced features within easy reach for all users.</figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s kick off with that <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://protonvpn.com/free-vpn&amp;xcust=1-1-345937-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">free version of the Proton VPN</a> then – you can use Proton VPN for nothing, as long as you’re happy with U.S., Japan, and Netherlands as your server locations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Naturally, you can only connect a single device, and speeds are slower than the paid plans, but it’s handy in a pinch or for testing the waters.

Secure Core routes traffic through one of the company’s ‘Secure’ servers, minimizing the potential of a data leak if the destination VPN server is compromised. Better yet, it’s as easy as hitting a button in any of the apps. These secure servers are owned directly by Proton.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In total, Proton’s servers are located in more than 90 countries, and you can personalize your favorites with a color coding. That means you can instantly recognize them and log straight in, and the menu bar option on Mac means it’s only a couple of clicks away at any time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of the Mac app, I had some minor issues on setup. Once installed, I was prompted to enable a VPN configuration, but the pop-up led me into System Settings and just left me there. As I’ve been testing these VPNs for a while I was able to work through it, but it’s worth mentioning that newcomers may find the lack of handholding an issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a nifty GIF to push you through the steps, but it actually cut off part of the menu (at least on my screen). Thankfully the company has a detailed walkthrough online, but it’s something to consider.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Performance</h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Proton-VPN-iPhone.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Proton VPN iPhone\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Proton-VPN-iPhone.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 959w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Proton-VPN-iPhone.jpg?resize=277%2C300&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 277w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Proton-VPN-iPhone.jpg?resize=768%2C831&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"959\" height=\"1038\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption><strong>Secure Core does slow traffic, but adds additional peace of mind.</strong></figcaption>\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Proton VPN iPhone\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Proton-VPN-iPhone.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 959w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Proton-VPN-iPhone.jpg?resize=277%2C300&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 277w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Proton-VPN-iPhone.jpg?resize=768%2C831&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"959\" height=\"1038\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><strong>Secure Core does slow traffic, but adds additional peace of mind.</strong></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Proton VPN iPhone\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Proton-VPN-iPhone.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 959w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Proton-VPN-iPhone.jpg?resize=277%2C300&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 277w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Proton-VPN-iPhone.jpg?resize=768%2C831&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"959\" height=\"1038\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><strong>Secure Core does slow traffic, but adds additional peace of mind.</strong></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not any good to have all of this flexibility if your internet speeds are throttled too far, but Proton has its bases covered here, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Proton VPN does increase latency, but only by about 29% in our testing on a modest 60 Mbps broadband. In fact, it’s only about 7% slower when downloading and 5.5% slower when uploading, making it one of the slicker VPNs we’ve tested.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of included VPN protocols, Smart will be ideal for most users, automatically setting the right protocol for your current usage, but WireGuard, WireGuard (TCP), IKEv2 and Stealth are all included, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For my money, leaving it set to Smart is the best way to go, but knowing you can switch to help with compatibility if you need to is a nice backup option. Secure Core servers, because they bounce traffic between at least one additional location, add a little latency, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s worth noting that free users, who have access to limited servers, will see some speed drop – but that you’ll still find it pretty usable. The drop isn’t necessarily facilitated on Proton’s end, it’s just that the free-tier user traffic is all pushed through the same servers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Privacy &amp; Security</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s worth noting that while some VPN services offer features like dark web data notifications, Proton VPN sticks to the basics – and does so very well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://protonvpn.com/support/no-logs-vpn/&amp;xcust=1-1-345937-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">company’s “no-logs” policy</a> confirms it doesn’t track sites, IP addresses, communications, or session lengths, nor does it track location-based information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for data laws, Proton is Swiss-based, and only Swiss court orders can request data from the company – and the user would need to be informed in such an instance. Since it doesn’t log data, though, there’s very little it can offer to law enforcement should they come knocking. In fact, in 2023, the company received 60 orders, and all were denied (see the <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://protonvpn.com/blog/transparency-report/&amp;xcust=1-1-345937-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Transparency Report</a> for further information).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Proton VPN’s apps are open-source, too, meaning they’re able to be taken apart and put back together in the search for vulnerabilities, and a bug bounty helps identify any potential issues, while the site has undergone multiple audits.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pricing and plans</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As with any VPN, you’ll get a discount on Proton’s offering if you opt for a longer plan. Aside from the free tier, there’s a $9.99/€9.99 monthly cost that drops to $4.99/€4.99 or $4.49/€4.49 for one-year and two-year plans respectively. Proton is Swiss and as such prices in euros rather than pounds for the U.K. market. You can see dollar prices, but you need to scroll to the section about halfway down to switch to U.S. dollar prices. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s excellent value for money, admittedly, but as we always say, VPN legislation could change at any point and the service you’re happy to be locked into for two years could be useless tomorrow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that caveat in mind, if you’re interested in Proton’s Mail, Drive, or Pass services as well, the Proton Unlimited plan might be worth a peek.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At $12.99/€12.99 a month or $9.99/€9.99 monthly for a year or $7.99/€7.99 monthly for two years, you at least know you’re getting a whole host of additional features included should VPN laws change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cheapest plan for Proton VPN will set you back €4.49 per month on a two year plan, with a current saving of 55% over the course of the plan. There is a free tier, too, though, as well as a more expensive Unlimited membership that folds in additional Proton services.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Verdict</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Proton VPN is an excellent service, with a pretty impressive free tier for anyone looking to see if a VPN is for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Backed up by solid speeds and a variety of nifty features, it’s an easy recommendation both for new and experienced users.</p>\n\niOS, MacOS, VPN</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"d6b5b172c42844c962e13afaeb1facce3ecdd1f1e798d82d7ab58b4657086ef4","category":"Apple"}
