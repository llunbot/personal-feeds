Wilier has its own racks and bags purpose-designed for the bike.</p>\n<p>Wilier already has quite a range of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bikes/\">gravel bikes</a> in its quiver. The Adlar sits alongside the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/gravel-bikes/wilier-rave-slr-ekar-review/\">Rave SLR</a>, designed for fast gravel racing or all-road use, and the more off-road focussed Jena.</p>\n<p>The Adlar goes further than the Jena, though, with clearance for 52mm <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-tyres/\">gravel tyres</a> or 2in mountain bike tyres, while the Jena stops at 44mm.</p>\n<h2>Designed for a suspension fork</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Adlar_LimeBlack_Closeup-08\" title=\"Adlar_LimeBlack_Closeup-08\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Adlar’s longer fork and shorter head tube are designed to allow you to swap in a suspension fork.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>The Adlar frameset weighs a claimed 1,100g and is available in five sizes. It comes with its own widely flared handlebars and has integrated cable/hose routing through the stem to keep things clean and tidy.</p>\n<p>The Adlar frame has also been designed around a rigid fork with longer blades. This opens up the option to add a 40mm travel suspension fork without affecting the bike’s geometry.</p>\n<p>The option to incorporate <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/gravel-bike-suspension/\">gravel bike suspension</a> is a feature that we’ve also seen on the recently updated <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2023-santa-cruz-stigmata/\">Santa Cruz Stigmata</a> and looks as if it might be the latest trend in gravel bike design.</p>\n<p>The supplied rigid fork has <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-dynamos/\">dynamo</a> cable routing in its right leg.</p>\n<h2>Borrowing from mountain bike geometry</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Adlar_LimeBlack_Closeup-14_1024x768\" title=\"Adlar_LimeBlack_Closeup-14_1024x768\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Wilier has designed the shape of the down tube so that it acts as an in-built mudguard.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>Also new to the Adlar is a slacker 70-degree head tube angle across the size range, down a degree or so from the Jena’s, which varies across the size range. Again, it’s a trend in gravel bike design, which is aimed at providing more stable handling on tougher off-road terrain.</p>\n<p>In fact, the Adlar frame borrows heavily from MTB <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/sizing-and-fit/gravel-bike-geometry-sizing/\">geometry</a>, with a longer reach and shorter stem, also designed to provide better handling and control.</p>\n<p>The Adlar frame is designed for a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/1x-drivetrains/\">1x drivetrain</a>, only. Wilier says this has allowed it to broaden the seat tube laterally so that it acts as a mini-mudguard to help protect you, your bottles and the bottom bracket area from spray.</p>\n<h3>Wilier Adlar geometry chart</h3>\n<div>\n                <table>\n                <colgroup>\n                            <col></col>\n                            <col></col>\n                            <col></col>\n                            <col></col>\n                            <col></col>\n                            <col></col>\n                    </colgroup>\n        <thead>\n<tr>\n                                                                                                        <th></th><th>XS</th><th>S</th><th>M</th><th>L</th><th>XL</th></tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n\n        <tr>\n            <td><b>Seat tube length</b> (mm)</td><td>440</td><td>470</td><td>500</td><td>530</td><td>570</td>        </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td><b>Top tube length</b> (mm)</td><td>542</td><td>562</td><td>583</td><td>599</td><td>621</td>        </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td><b>Head tube length</b> (mm)</td><td>79</td><td>104</td><td>130</td><td>155</td><td>181</td>        </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td><b> Head tube angle</b> (degrees)</td><td>70</td><td>70</td><td>70</td><td>70</td><td>70</td>        </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td><b>Seat tube angle</b> (degrees)</td><td>75</td><td>74.5</td><td>74</td><td>74</td><td>73.5</td>        </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td><b>Chainstay length</b> (mm)</td><td>423</td><td>423</td><td>423</td><td>423</td><td>423</td>        </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td><b>Wheelbase</b> (mm)</td><td>1,030</td><td>1,048</td><td>1,065</td><td>1,083</td><td>1,101</td>        </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td><b>Stack</b> (mm)</td><td>538</td><td>562</td><td>586</td><td>610</td><td>634</td>        </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td><b>Reach</b> (mm)</td><td>395</td><td>404</td><td>413</td><td>422</td><td>431</td>        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n    </table>\n                    \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                \n    \n    \n</div>\n\n<h2>Purpose-designed racks</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Adlar_LimeBlack_Closeup-05_1024x768\" title=\"Adlar_LimeBlack_Closeup-05_1024x768\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The purpose-designed racks mount to the thru-axles for a more robust connection to the bike.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>A bike designed for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/bikepacking/\">bikepacking</a> wouldn’t be complete without mounts for bags and the Adlar frameset duly delivers, with the option to spec front and rear racks.</p>\n<p>The racks mount to special thru-axles rather than needing separate bolts on the frame for their lower mounts, helping to support the load better.</p>\n<p>You can buy a set of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bikepacking-bags/\">bikepacking bags</a> from Italian brand <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/accessories/bags/seat-bag-and-seat-wedges/miss-grape-cluster-13-saddle-bag-review/\">Miss Grape</a> purpose-designed for the Adlar’s racks.</p>\n<p>There are bosses on the fork legs as well as those for a third bottle cage, a top tube bag and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bike-mudguards/\">mudguards</a>. Wilier says the frame has been beefed up to allow you to carry as much as 35kg of extra load.</p>\n<h2>Wilier Adlar range and prices</h2>\n<p>At launch, Wilier will sell the Adlar with five specs, including the latest 12-speed Shimano GRX:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>SRAM Rival XPLR AXS, including bikepacking kit:</strong> €5,400</li>\n<li><strong>SRAM Rival XPLR AXS, without bikepacking kit:</strong> €4,800</li>\n<li><strong>Shimano GRX 12-speed, including bikepacking kit:</strong> €4,600</li>\n<li><strong>Shimano GRX 12-speed, without bikepacking kit:</strong> €4,000</li>\n<li><strong>Shimano GRX 11-speed, without bikepacking kit:</strong> €3,700</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All bikes are fitted with Miche Graff XL alloy wheels, except the Shimano GRX 11-speed build which has Miche Contact wheels.</p>\n<p>The bikepacking kit includes the front and rear racks and the special thru-axles to support them, as well as standard thru-axles should you want to remove the racks, plus a full set of four Miss Grape bags.
