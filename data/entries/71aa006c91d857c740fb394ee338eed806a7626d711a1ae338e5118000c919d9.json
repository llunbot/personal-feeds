Today, Microsoft is <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/devices/2023/06/14/announcing-the-availability-of-consumer-replacement-components-for-surface-devices/\">taking the next step</a>, listing <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/b/surface-repair-parts\">dozens of replacement parts</a> for Surface tablets, laptops, and all-in-ones on the Microsoft Store.</p>\n\n<p>The screens, kickstands, batteries, keyboards, camera modules, and other odds and ends are available for the Surface Pro 8, 9, and X; Surface Laptops 2 through 5 plus the Go 2 and the Studio; and the Studio and Studio 2+ all-in-one desktops. Most of the major components are pretty expensive—the display for a Surface Studio 2+ is $1,750 all by itself—but they're cheaper than buying a new device, you won't have to pay for labor costs, and you can be sure you're getting genuine first-party components.</p>\n<p>\"When purchasing a replacement component, you will receive the part and relevant collateral components (such as screws if applicable),\" wrote Microsoft VP Tim McGuiggan. \"Tools needed for the repair are sold separately through iFixit. It is essential to follow the instructions in the applicable Microsoft Service Guide or article.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1947841#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1947841&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"71aa006c91d857c740fb394ee338eed806a7626d711a1ae338e5118000c919d9","category":"Tech"}
