This isn't the absolute best price we've tracked—the earbuds fell as low as $169 <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/staff/2020/11/best-black-friday-deals-2020/\" target=\"_blank\">last Black Friday</a>—and while Apple itself sells <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/1305166/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMWP22AM%2FA%2Fairpods-pro&amp;subid1=dealmaster081421\" target=\"_blank\">them for $249</a>, the pair's average price on Amazon has hovered closer $200 in recent months.</p>\n<p>Still, we've only seen them hit this price or lower on a couple of occasions in 2021, making this a good opportunity to pounce if you've already had your eye on a pair. Recent <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/report-apple-plans-to-release-new-airpods-in-2021-new-airpods-pro-in-2022/\" target=\"_blank\">reports have said</a> that Apple plans to reveal new base-level AirPods that take after the Pro's design later this year, with a redesigned set of Pros coming sometime in 2022. For now, though, the AirPods Pro are an aging but still worthwhile set of wireless earbuds, especially if you use an iPhone and prioritize strong active noise cancelation. We've recommended them <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/09/home-office-setup-ideas/4/#h5\" target=\"_blank\">in past gift guides</a>.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, our deals roundup features a Humble Bundle sale that nets you the first six editions of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/02/26-best-co-op-games-to-play-with-your-partner/#h15\" target=\"_blank\">the co-op-friendly</a> <em>Jackbox Party Pack</em> games on PC for about $20 (with some, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/07/humble-bundle-imposing-limits-on-users-charitable-giving-percentages/\" target=\"_blank\">but not all</a>, of the proceeds going to charity). We also have good prices on Nintendo's Switch Pro Controller, recommended internal SSDs and external HDDs, the latest iPad Air, and more.
