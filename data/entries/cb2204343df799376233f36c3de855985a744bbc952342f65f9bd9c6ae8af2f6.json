So far, the update seems to have resolved the issue, but users were left wondering exactly what had happened. Now Apple has clarified the issue somewhat, describing the nature of the bug to 9to5Mac.</p>\n<p>Apple told the publication that the photos were not regurgitated from iCloud Photos after being deleted on the local device; rather, they were local to the device. Apple says they were neither left in the cloud after deletion nor synced to it after, and the company did not have access to the deleted photos.</p>\n<p>The photos were retained on the local device storage due to a database corruption issue, and the bug resurfaced photos that were flagged for deletion but were not actually fully deleted locally.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026970#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026970&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cb2204343df799376233f36c3de855985a744bbc952342f65f9bd9c6ae8af2f6","category":"Tech"}
