Judge Ada Brown in the Northern District of Texas <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txnd.389064/gov.uscourts.txnd.389064.211.0_3.pdf\">granted a motion for summary judgment</a> that was requested by a tax services firm and business groups such as the US Chamber of Commerce.</p>\n<p>\"The Court sets aside the Non-Compete Rule. Consequently, the Rule shall not be enforced or otherwise take effect on its effective date of September 4, 2024 or thereafter,\" the ruling said.</p>\n<p>The judge wrote in a previous ruling that the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/07/judge-says-ftc-lacks-authority-to-issue-rule-banning-noncompete-agreements/\">FTC lacks authority</a> to issue a rule banning noncompete agreements and granted a preliminary injunction. But that previous ruling only postponed the effective date of the rule as it applied to the plaintiffs, whereas yesterday's order blocks the FTC rule entirely.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044482#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044482&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e70a10f87242d646600dd9b506ce104a5e44f7ffa70788b6e62290b072f37f08","category":"Tech"}
