Not only did John’s beautiful photography immediately catch my eye, but the introductory paragraph asking, “What’s not to love about a pink bike?” definitely hit home and started the process of pulling together the puzzle pieces of this project.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Untitled-Custom-Paint_IndyFab_Spot-the-frame2.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Untitled-Custom-Paint_IndyFab_Spot-the-frame2.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Untitled-Custom-Paint_IndyFab_Spot-the-frame2.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Untitled-Custom-Paint_IndyFab_Spot-the-frame2.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Untitled-Custom-Paint_IndyFab_Spot-the-frame.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Untitled-Custom-Paint_IndyFab_Spot-the-frame.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Untitled-Custom-Paint_IndyFab_Spot-the-frame.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Untitled-Custom-Paint_IndyFab_Spot-the-frame.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Untitled-Custom-Paint_IndyFab_Pink-paint.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Untitled-Custom-Paint_IndyFab_Pink-paint.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Untitled-Custom-Paint_IndyFab_Pink-paint.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Untitled-Custom-Paint_IndyFab_Pink-paint.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Imagining my own version of Chris’ bike, I already knew where I could potentially lay my hands on a similar frame. In fact, I’d seen it every time I visited my local bike shop, whenever I needed to work on one bike or another. Because that’s what’s so crazy about this story: the fact that in the very middle of Middle England, my LBS was once an Independent Fabrication dealership.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Untitled-Custom-Paint_IndyFab_Bidons.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Untitled-Custom-Paint_IndyFab_Bidons.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Untitled-Custom-Paint_IndyFab_Bidons.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Untitled-Custom-Paint_IndyFab_Bidons.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Untitled-Custom-Paint_IndyFab_Stencil.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Untitled-Custom-Paint_IndyFab_Stencil.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Untitled-Custom-Paint_IndyFab_Stencil.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Untitled-Custom-Paint_IndyFab_Stencil.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Sitting slightly forlornly in the shop window—a layer of dust and cobwebs attesting to its dormant state—this Indy Fab had the requisite canti brakes and was built up with an interesting mix of race components: Thomson seat post and stem, Phil hubs, Salsa Bell-Lap bars, and Race Face cranks. There was only one problem. Resplendent from nose to tail in signal red paint, it was the wrong color.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Untitled-Custom-Paint_IndyFab_Paint2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Untitled-Custom-Paint_IndyFab_Paint2.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Untitled-Custom-Paint_IndyFab_Paint2.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Untitled-Custom-Paint_IndyFab_Paint2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Untitled-Custom-Paint_IndyFab_Paint1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Untitled-Custom-Paint_IndyFab_Paint1.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Untitled-Custom-Paint_IndyFab_Paint1.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Untitled-Custom-Paint_IndyFab_Paint1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>So why did I now approach the bike shop proprietor to discuss a potential sale when I’d been walking past this same bike for upwards of 15 years? The answer lies in last year’s Bespoked handmade bike show, where I first met Jason Bennett of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/untitled_custom_paint\" target=\"_blank\">Untitled Custom Paint</a>.</p>\n<p>Approaching his display stand—fronted by a beautifully painted Santa Cruz gravel frame which went on to win best finish—I made my introductions and soon discovered that Jason was a graphic designer by profession but in the process of setting up a dedicated paint studio in the industrial fringes of nearby Stockport. A few days after the show, I reached out with my proposition and a link to The Radavist photo story.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Untitled-Custom-Paint_IndyFab_Drying.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Untitled-Custom-Paint_IndyFab_Drying.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Untitled-Custom-Paint_IndyFab_Drying.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Untitled-Custom-Paint_IndyFab_Drying.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Untitled-Custom-Paint_IndyFab_Jason-with-finished-frame.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Untitled-Custom-Paint_IndyFab_Jason-with-finished-frame.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Untitled-Custom-Paint_IndyFab_Jason-with-finished-frame.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Untitled-Custom-Paint_IndyFab_Jason-with-finished-frame.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>With Jason happy to help, I struck a deal at the LBS and delivered the bike ready for dismantling and bead-blasting down to bare metal. But first, we needed to discuss what—and what not—would make the final design, eventually deciding on a faithful reproduction of the pink and white fade, gloss black fork, and a smattering of stars.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Indy_Fab_Custom_Paint-14.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Indy_Fab_Custom_Paint-14.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Indy_Fab_Custom_Paint-14.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Indy_Fab_Custom_Paint-14.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Indy_Fab_Custom_Paint-11.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Indy_Fab_Custom_Paint-11.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Indy_Fab_Custom_Paint-11.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Indy_Fab_Custom_Paint-11.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Indy_Fab_Custom_Paint-10.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Indy_Fab_Custom_Paint-10.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Indy_Fab_Custom_Paint-10.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Indy_Fab_Custom_Paint-10.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Indy_Fab_Custom_Paint-13.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Indy_Fab_Custom_Paint-13.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Indy_Fab_Custom_Paint-13.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Indy_Fab_Custom_Paint-13.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Over the ensuing weeks, whenever I visited Jason in his new studio, the bike was one further stage closer to its final transformation. Stripped of the original paint and with a coating of primer, the smooth lines of the tubes and dropouts were a revelation. Then, after the base fade was laid down, the delicate process of designing vinyl masking for all the frame details began. Painstaking and requiring a steady hand, the resultant finish protected under clear coat was quite magical.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Indy_Fab_Custom_Paint-4.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Indy_Fab_Custom_Paint-4.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Indy_Fab_Custom_Paint-4.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Indy_Fab_Custom_Paint-4.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Indy_Fab_Custom_Paint-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Indy_Fab_Custom_Paint-3.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Indy_Fab_Custom_Paint-3.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Indy_Fab_Custom_Paint-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Pictured here against a backdrop of the city center of Manchester, I can perhaps imagine there might be individuals who feel this project was a missed opportunity. It may have been preferable to keep the original paint or opt for a new, totally unique design. But when the bike was finally finished and rebuilt, ready for its first ride, I had that same feeling of excitement that I experienced when first viewing the photo story.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Indy_Fab_Original_new_paint-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Indy_Fab_Original_new_paint-1.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Indy_Fab_Original_new_paint-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Indy_Fab_Original_new_paint-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Indy_Fab_Original_new_paint-6.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Indy_Fab_Original_new_paint-6.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Indy_Fab_Original_new_paint-6.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Indy_Fab_Original_new_paint-6.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Indy_Fab_Original_new_paint-3.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Indy_Fab_Original_new_paint-3.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Indy_Fab_Original_new_paint-3.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Indy_Fab_Original_new_paint-3.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Indy_Fab_Original_new_paint-4.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Indy_Fab_Original_new_paint-4.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Indy_Fab_Original_new_paint-4.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Indy_Fab_Original_new_paint-4.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Only more so because I would be taking this homage to a beautiful bicycle home with me, and, at the end of the day, if something looks right, then it’s right.
