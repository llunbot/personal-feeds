Assos' three-layer 3D waffle foam offers some serious squishiness, and its 'goldenGate' tech essentially means the chamois doesn’t move around.</p>\n<p>Add in the brands A-Lock engineering, whereby the bib straps are attached lower down to the chamois which also prevent movement, and you have a very comfortable and secure pair of bib shorts.</p>\n<p>I wore these on both long and short rides and experienced zero movement or saddle pain. In fact, they are so comfortable I almost forgot I was wearing them.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/11/assos_dyora_rs_summer_bibshorts_2_.jpg?itok=OzphN--e\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.chainreactioncycles.com/assos-women-s-dyora-rs-bib-shorts-s9/rp-prod199272\">Buy the Assos Dyora RS Summer Bib Shorts S9 now</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Assos Dyora RS Summer Bib Shorts S9 fit</h2>\n<p>The material is lightweight and compressive enough to give a close fit but not too restrictive.</p>\n<p>The feel of these bib shorts is durable and silky smooth and the straps feel sturdy too. Wear it with the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/10162/assos-dyora-rs-spring-fall-jacket-review\">Assos Dyora RS Spring Fall Jacket</a> and you have a high quality race-ready outfit which should last a few seasons.</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/11/assos_dyora_rs_summer_bibshorts_3_.jpg?itok=zplgsd50\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>As a tall person, bib shorts can often come up short, quite literally.</p>\n<p>In the case of the Assos Dyora RS Summer bib shorts, this wasn’t an issue as the shorts are nice and long, a definite plus.</p>\n<p>They also have a wide elastane band with silicone leg grippers woven into them which keep the shorts nicely in place.</p>\n<p>As is standard with Assos garments, the branding is subtle, meaning you get high performance wear without making a big deal about it.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.chainreactioncycles.com/assos-women-s-dyora-rs-bib-shorts-s9/rp-prod199272\">Buy the Assos Dyora RS Summer Bib Shorts S9 now</a></strong></p>\n<div>\n<div>\n    <img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/11/assos_dyora_rs_summer_bibshorts_and_jacket_.jpg?itok=Llst8Gyc\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/tour-de-france/10192/tour-de-france-femmes-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\">Tour de France Femmes 2022: Everything you need to know </a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/1755/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\">Tour de France 2022: Everything you need to know</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/buying-guides/677/gifts-for-cyclists\">Best gifts for cyclists: presents for the cyclist in your life</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nHowever, despite all the silky smoothness and longer length, the Assos Dyora RS Summer Bib Shorts S9 aren’t the most flattering.</p>\n<p>The defined high waisted pant line look draws the eye into the area and highlights an already stand-out chamois. Something which is not to my taste but might not be an issue for others.</p>\n<p>The bib shorts also do not have a comfort break feature which makes them less convenient than others on the market.</p>\n<h2>Assos Dyora RS Summer Bib Shorts S9 bottom line</h2>\n<p>These shorts aren’t perfect and at £175 they aren’t cheap.</p>\n<p>But if you are after a high-quality pair of shorts with phenomenal saddle comfort and don’t mind the defined chamois, then the Assos Dyora RS Summer Bib Shorts S9 are worth a try.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.chainreactioncycles.com/assos-women-s-dyora-rs-bib-shorts-s9/rp-prod199272\">Buy the Assos Dyora RS Summer Bib Shorts S9 now</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/reviews/10226/assos-dyora-rs-summer-bib-shorts-s9-images\">Assos Dyora RS Summer Bib Shorts S9 images</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/reviews\">Reviews</a></span>\n  </span><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/authors/emma-cole\">Emma Cole</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>1 Nov 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Freviews%2F10226%2Fassos-dyora-rs-summer-bib-shorts-s9-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Assos%20Dyora%20RS%20Summer%20Bib%20Shorts%20S9%20images%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Freviews%2F10226%2Fassos-dyora-rs-summer-bib-shorts-s9-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Assos%20Dyora%20RS%20Summer%20Bib%20Shorts%20S9%20images%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Freviews%2F10226%2Fassos-dyora-rs-summer-bib-shorts-s9-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Assos%20Dyora%20RS%20Summer%20Bib%20Shorts%20S9%20images&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Freviews%2F10226%2Fassos-dyora-rs-summer-bib-shorts-s9-images\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/10226/assos-dyora-rs-summer-bib-shorts-s9-images#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 4</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/11/assos_dyora_rs_summer_bibshorts_1_.jpg?itok=iTHffjPd\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div><div><h4><span>Read more about:</span></h4><div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/bibshorts\">Bibshorts</a></div>    </div></div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/bibshorts\">Bibshorts</a></div>    </div></div></div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div>","author":"ecole","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"e33ba4a3d6d16e4f9bc580533b678faf49e2f475f564a8057a4d2d104943c3f0","category":"Cycling"}
