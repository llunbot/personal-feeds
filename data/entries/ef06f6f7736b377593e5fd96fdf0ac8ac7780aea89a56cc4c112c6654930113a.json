At his first meeting with Biden, Ron Klain, his former\nWhite House chief of staff, who was in charge of debate prep, was\nstartled. He’d never seen Biden so exhausted and out of it. He\nseemed unaware of what was happening in his own campaign. The\npresident appeared obsessed with foreign policy and uninterested\nin his second-term plans. During one prep session in Aspen Lodge,\nthe presidential cabin, Biden suddenly got up, walked out to the\npool, collapsed on a lounge chair, and fell sound asleep. Yet his\nadvisers were undaunted. With unintended irony, one of them\nexplained their strategy to me: “An early debate would quiet fears\nthat the president was infirm.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Jiminy.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/13/whipple-biden-final-days\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"ef06f6f7736b377593e5fd96fdf0ac8ac7780aea89a56cc4c112c6654930113a","category":"Tech"}
