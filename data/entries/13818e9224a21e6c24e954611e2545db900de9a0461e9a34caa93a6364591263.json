This must mean one thing: we’ve reached autumn once again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week at <em>Cyclist</em> we’ve been living in the afterglow of the Grand Tours. I dissected <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/primoz-roglic-legacy\" target=\"_blank\">Primož Roglič’s legacy</a>, Andy McGrath dived into<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tudor-pro-cycling-giro-ditalia\" target=\"_blank\"> Tudor Pro Cycling’s Giro debut</a> and we’ve taken stock of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cycling-transfer-rumours\" target=\"_blank\">the final signings of the season</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only that, we mapped out an ambitious <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/three-week-tour-of-ireland\" target=\"_blank\">Irish Grand Tour</a>.

Not only is the ride more expansive, but the wheels have increased by four inches.

Just take a look down Brick Lane and you’re bound to find a couple of mulleted individuals sporting a patchwork Carhartt jacket.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Isadore has been edging its way into the hip circles of cycling fashion. Headed by Slovakian former pros Peter and Martin Velits, the central European brand has joined the merino wool trend and created a jersey that ticks all the street fashion boxes. Enter, the Isadore Patchwork Jersey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The patchwork design hits the spot. In this ‘steel grey’ design, the patchwork leans into dark earthy tones. It’s not trying too hard to be quirky or overbearing with its asymmetry either, which is a big plus. The merino wool texture is cosy. The material reminds me of a more lush 1990s rugby jersey. As for the tailoring, the jersey is a snug fit, however, Isadore advised me to choose a size smaller than normal. Maybe bear that in mind if you’re looking to get your hands on one of these jerseys.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Isadore’s research has concluded that the Patchwork Jersey is fit for three seasons in temperatures between 16°C and 24°C. 36% of the jersey is laced with merino wool for a flexible thermal tough. The jersey also boasts a renewable edge. The zips and silicone taping are made from leftover materials from the brand’s factory. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy the IsadorePatchwork jersey from <a href=\"https://isadore.com/patchwork-jersey-steel-gray\" target=\"_blank\">Isadore (£130)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Road Book 2011, Cycling Almanack</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/road-book-nr1-970x647.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/road-book-nr1-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/road-book-nr1-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/road-book-nr1-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/road-book-nr1-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/road-book-nr1-2048x1365.png 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/road-book-nr1-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/road-book-nr1-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/road-book-nr1-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/road-book-nr1-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/road-book-nr1-350x233.png 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s take a trip down memory lane to a time when Rolling In The Deep by Adele was ruling the charts, Rihanna found Love in a Homeless Place, the final Harry Potter film came out and Juan José Cobo ‘won’ the Vuelta a España.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2011 is slightly before my cycling time. I was only 10 years old. I hadn’t quite caught the cycling bug by this point, but I recall diving deep into the YouTube archives to watch the heroics of Andy Schleck on the Col du Galibier and Johan Vansummeren’s surprise win at Paris-Roubaix. To relive those glory days, the Road Book 2011 has gone back in time in an attempt to rival the format of cricket’s Wisden or the Match of the Day annuals from back in the day. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/the-road-book-970x647.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/the-road-book-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/the-road-book-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/the-road-book-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/the-road-book-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/the-road-book-2048x1365.png 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/the-road-book-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/the-road-book-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/the-road-book-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/the-road-book-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/the-road-book-350x233.png 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Road Book 2011, like the others in the series, is peppered with long-form essays from some of the sport’s most gifted writers, including <em>Cyclist </em>contributor Andy McGrath and TV commentator Ned Boulting, as well as the riders themselves.

Summer is gone and autumn is here with all its damp leaves and grey sky glory. As the seasons change, the vests have been coming out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canadian brand 7Mesh have me covered this autumn period with its S2S Vest. With a claimed weight of 152g in a medium size, the S2S Vest is designed for water and wind resistance as well as comfort and air permeability. To add, around 90% of the jacket’s face layer is made from recycled nylon. The vest comes equipped with 7Mesh’s StashSystem. This neat pocket can be used to pack the vest away, plus elastic straps allow for it to be attached to the bike when stowed away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The vest fits well. It tapers at just the right point around the waistline. For the safety-conscious, the vest comes with some high-vis dashings around the armpits and the bottom hem. The vest is available in black, and I have also been informed that a new ‘raisin’ colour will be released later in the year. Keep your eyes out for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy the 7Mesh S2S Vest from <a href=\"https://7mesh.com/en-GB/products/mens-s2s-vest\" target=\"_blank\">7Mesh (£170)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>What we’re into this week: <em>Romance</em> by Fontaines DC</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"693\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GettyImages-2168231826-970x693.jpg\" alt=\"Fontaines D.C.

That’s for good reason. The band’s 2022 release <em>Skinty Fia</em> – an untranslatable Irish-language expletive – is one of my all-time favourite records.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Skinty Fia</em> unapologetically captures the sense of leaving behind the Celtic homeland to snuggle up to London life, swamped by a feeling of otherness. The record was propelled by a pang of Celtic guilt and angst – with lyricism straddling themes of Irish identity, cultural alienation and historical antagonism. If you want to feel this all in the space of four minutes, listen to the track <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yj3oDS6VM2o\" target=\"_blank\">Roman Holiday</a>.</em> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A stylistic change later, Fontaines DC return with their new project <em>Romance</em>. Unlike their previous work, <em>Romance </em>isn’t anchored by an angered exploration of Irishness. Instead, it’s a measured rock album that leans on melodies and grandiose production more than post-punk.
