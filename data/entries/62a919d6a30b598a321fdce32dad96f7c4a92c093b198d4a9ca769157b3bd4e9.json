Apple's former design chief <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/04/jony-ive-shares-remembrance-of-steve-jobs/\">Jony Ive shared similarly heartfelt comments</a> about Jobs this week, describing him as the most inquisitive human he has ever met.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nCook's full memo reads as follows:<blockquote>Team,\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nToday marks the 10th anniversary of Steve's passing. It's a moment to celebrate his life and to reflect on the extraordinary legacy he left behind.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSteve believed that \"people with passion can change the world for the better.\" That's the philosophy that inspired him to create Apple. And it lives in us today.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSteve was so many things: brilliant, funny, and wise, a husband, a father, a friend, and, of course, a visionary. He challenged us to see the world not for what it was, but for what it could be. And he helped so many people, myself included, see the same potential in ourselves. Not a day goes by that I don't think about him.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThis year, as much as any other, we're reminded of the profound impact our products have on the world. I feel so lucky that we spend our days creating wildly innovative tools that connect people, inspire them to think differently, and empower them to make their own dent in the universe, too. It's one of the many gifts that Steve gave to all of us.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nI wish Steve were here to see the way his spirit lives on in all of your amazing work. But most of all, I wish he could see what you do next. Steve once said that his proudest achievements were the ones that were yet to come. He spent every day imagining a future that no one else could see and working relentlessly to bring his vision to life.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSteve was a singular figure, but he taught us all how to soar. I miss him, and I will cherish him always.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nTim</blockquote>Apple also commemorated Jobs with a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/05/apple-10th-anniversary-steve-jobs-death/\">full-page tribute on its website</a> today, including a statement from his family.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/steve-jobs/\">Steve Jobs</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/05/tim-cook-memo-about-steve-jobs/\">Apple CEO Tim Cook Reflects on Steve Jobs in Heartfelt Memo to Employees</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-ceo-tim-cook-reflects-on-steve-jobs-in-heartfelt-memo-to-employees.2315531/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=44p6ZoMYSRg:fxAxIK4AQgA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=44p6ZoMYSRg:fxAxIK4AQgA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/44p6ZoMYSRg\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"62a919d6a30b598a321fdce32dad96f7c4a92c093b198d4a9ca769157b3bd4e9","category":"Apple"}
