It's available in both men's and women's variants, with the men's version costing £10 more than the women's.</p>\n<p>It is also completely thermowelded, which means it isn't made by the traditional sewing method, but instead using bonding machines to form the seams.</p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cyclist.b-cdn.net/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/11/santini_multi_vega_front.png?itok=WnrddnGQ\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>The brand says this helps the jacket lay flat and closer to the body, and the combination of the thermowelding and Polartec fabric means water can't get through the seams.</p>\n<p>This I can confirm to be true as I tried it out in some drizzle (all the wet weather that was available – sob) and to make sure it could handle a downpour I also ran it under the tap where it performed marvellously.</p>\n<p>There is something deeply satisfying seeing water droplets wobble around as they fail to penetrate material. </p>\n<p>Notably, Santini says the jacket is designed for 'the harshest weather conditions'.</p>\n<p>I can't say I took this jacket to the Arctic to try out such conditions, but I can say it has kept me warm and dry on very cold morning rides.</p>\n<h2>Santini Vega Multi comfort and fit</h2>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cyclist.b-cdn.net/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/11/santini_multi_vega.png?itok=RInxtmJy\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>With some waterproof jackets there can be a tendency to lean less on the side of comfort, but the Santini Vega Multi is very soft to the touch and feels great on the skin.</p>\n<p>Having followed Santini's size chart, I tested a size XL which fit well, although it could have fit a bit tighter around the chest area and collar but I'm really nit-picking here. Sizing down to a large didn't work, so it was definitely a fit rather than sizing issue.</p>\n<p>I wore a base layer and a jersey underneath the jacket, and a pair of H20 Vega gloves.</p>\n<p>I should add the H20 Vega gloves are great for keeping hands warm, are touch screen compatible and water resistant, but don't have the pressure-relieving pad you might want for long distance cycling.</p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cyclist.b-cdn.net/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/11/vega-multi-women-s-rain-jacket_2_.jpeg?itok=5tuZEvWH\" />

aero piece of kit, unlike the <a href=\"/reviews/10162/assos-dyora-rs-spring-fall-jacket-review\">Assos Dyora Spring Fall jacket</a>, and it isn't trying to be, instead the Vega Multi offers a comfy, relaxed fit, ideal for everyday riding both long and short and for layering up in the cold.</p>\n<p>I didn't have any issues with the jacket riding up when on the back as it has silicon strips along the bottom which help keep it firmly in place.</p>\n<p>The jacket also features three decent sized rear pockets plus a neat zip pocket for valuables which is really handy. </p>\n<p>Personally, I really like the reflective stripe down the back of the jacket which makes you brilliantly bright for whoever else is on the road to see.</p>\n<p>It also has some reflective detailing on the shoulder band and back tail.</p>\n<h2>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cyclist.b-cdn.net/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/11/santini_multi_vega_jacket_back.png?itok=kQQt7rtz\" />  </div>\n</div>\n</h2>\n<h2>Santini Vega Multi bottom line</h2>\n<p>The Santini Vega Multi is a warm and functional winter jacket.</p>\n<p>It might look simple to the untrained eye but it's actually a highly technical piece of kit which will keep you warm and dry in the worst of weathers and at £229 it is also reasonably priced.</p>\n<p>Maybe I’ll take mine to the Arctic.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.santinisms.co.uk/jackets-c40/santini-vega-multi-womens-jacket-p555#attribute%5B4%5D=19\">Buy the Women's Santini Vega Multi jacket now</a></li>\n<li><a
