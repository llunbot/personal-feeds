{"title":"★ The iOS Continental Drift Fun Gap","link":"https://daringfireball.net/2024/09/ios_continental_drift_fun_gap","date":1725810707000,"content":"\n<p>There’s a scene in Martin Scorsese’s <em>Casino</em>. Gangster Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) and two of his goon friends are in a nightclub in the Tangiers casino resort (a fictionalized version of the old Stardust), which is run by Ace Rothstein (Robert De Niro). Santoro and Rothstein, who’d been friends for decades, are now on the outs. The Tangiers is a front for the mafia and the Teamsters. Rothstein, a gambling genius who was born to run a casino, is earning major bank for the bosses back home. Santoro is gangstering up Las Vegas, and is under severe law enforcement scrutiny. They just held a contentious meeting, just the two of them, at Santoro’s request, in the middle of the desert — a meeting Rothstein wasn’t sure wouldn’t conclude with him dead in a freshly dug hole in the sand.</p>\n\n<p>Santoro and his two friends are just a threesome. All men. Morose.</p>\n\n<p>Rothstein comes in with Billy Sherbert (Don Rickles) and a party of half a dozen or so men and women, including Oscar Goodman, famed defense attorney and future mayor of Las Vegas (playing himself), and several women. Everyone (but Rothstein, who’s not much for fun) is laughing. You’d be laughing too if you were out having drinks with Don Fucking Rickles and Oscar Goodman.</p>\n\n<p>Santoro gripes about Rothstein not acknowledging him, and, well, makes some comments that suggest he doesn’t hold Jews in the highest esteem. Santoro’s right-hand man, Frank Marino (played by the great Frank Vincent, of Billy “Go Get Your Fucking Shine Box” Batts fame), dryly observes, “They’re having a good time, too.”</p>\n\n<p>The camera pulls back to show their threesome, alone in their booth, isolated. Santoro, who is absolutely not having a good time, replies, “So are we.”</p>\n\n<p>I’ve been thinking about <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ezqy0v0qUig\">that scene</a> a lot, lately.</p>\n\n<p>Allison Johnson, in a piece for The Verge headlined “<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/24/24226946/iphone-eu-regulation-app-stores-fortnite\">European iPhones Are More Fun Now</a>”:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Whining about stuff is a treasured American pastime, so allow\nme to indulge: the iPhone is more fun in Europe now, and it’s\nnot fair.</p>\n\n<p>They’re getting all kinds of stuff because they have <em>cool</em>\nregulators, not, like, regular regulators. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24100979/altstore-europe-app-marketplace-price-games\">Third-party app\nstores</a>, the ability for browsers to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24050478/apple-ios-17-4-browser-engines-eu\">run their own\nengines</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/16/24221361/fortnite-iphone-epic-games-app-store\">Fortnite</a>, and now the ability to\n<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/22/24226110/apple-iphone-ipad-default-apps-eu-competition\">replace lots of default apps</a>? I want it, too! Imagine if\nChrome on iOS wasn’t just a rinky dink little Safari emulator!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Imagine if Chrome could deplete your iPhone battery as fast as it does your MacBook battery. Imagine if you were one of the millions (zillions?) of people whose “incognito mode” browsing history was observed and stored by Google and deleted <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/04/01/1242019127/google-incognito-mode-settlement-search-history\">only after they lost a lawsuit</a>. Imagine — and this takes a lot of imagination — if Google actually shipped a version of Chrome for iOS, only for the EU, that used its own battery-eating rendering engine instead of using the energy-efficient system version of WebKit.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Imagine downloading a new dialer app with a soundboard of fart\nsounds and setting it as your default! Unfortunately, Apple\ndoesn’t seem interested in sharing these possibilities with\neveryone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That sounds like fun.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Sure, we’ve got <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/5/24122341/apple-app-store-game-emulators-super-apps\">retro game emulators in the app store</a>. And\nthat rules. But that’s only because Apple was worried everyone in\nthe EU was about to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24100464/altstore-pal-dma-eu-launch-delta-nintendo-emulator-clip-clipboard-manager\">download AltStore PAL</a> so they could\nplay <em>Ocarina of Time</em> on their iPhones.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If the benefit of the DMA is allowing emulators worldwide how is that an advantage for people in the EU?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Here’s the thing: wouldn’t it just be good business to offer\neveryone the same choices no matter where they live? It’s not as\nif Apple was making two different iPhones to try to appeal to\ndifferent cultural preferences. It’s making one iPhone that’s more\nflexible and customizable and one that isn’t.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe, bit by bit, Apple will cave in and offer parity the way it\ndid with emulators. But I think the company should make an\nuncharacteristic move: drop the charade and let everyone,\neverywhere have the same iPhone. It would be bold! Courageous,\neven! But most importantly, it would be a lot more fun.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes, let’s allow everyone, around the world, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2024/09/the_ios_continental_drift_widens\">to delete their Camera app</a>. That sounds like fun.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@viticci/post/C--2G5btWWb\">Federico Viticci, on Threads</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>My realization in 2024 has been that the DMA fork of iOS is the\nbest iPhone experience. We can finally use our phones like actual\ncomputers with more default apps and apps from external sources.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/linked/the-dma-version-of-ios-is-more-fun-than-vanilla-ios/\">And on MacStories</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It’s still iOS, with the tasteful design, vibrant app ecosystem,\nhigh-performance animations, and accessibility we’ve come to\nexpect from Apple; at the same time, it’s a more flexible and fun\nversion of iOS predicated upon the assumption that users deserve\noptions to control more aspects of how their expensive pocket\ncomputers should work. Or, <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@viticci/post/C-_Ask_NiBx/\">as I put it</a>: some of the\nflexibility of Android, but on iOS, sounds like a dream to me.</p>\n\n<p>Apparently, this thought — that people who demand options should\nhave them — <em>really</em> annoys a lot of (generally American)\npundits who seemingly consider the European Commission a\ndraconian entity that demands changes out of spite for a\nparticular corporation, rather than a group of elected officials\nwho regulate based on what they believe is best for their\nconstituents and the European market.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Let’s run a tally. On the EU side, there is Fortnite and other games from Epic, a <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2023/03/ftc-finalizes-order-requiring-fortnite-maker-epic-games-pay-245-million-tricking-users-making\">shady</a> company that was justifiably booted from the App Store for bait-and-switch chicanery intended to provoke a lawsuit in which they <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/17/apple-epic-legal-fees\">got their asses handed back to them</a>. On the rest-of-the-world side we have the imminent release of iPhone Mirroring and Apple Intelligence. I don’t play Fortnite, and even if I did, I wouldn’t on my phone, but I find the latter far more interesting — and fun — than the former.</p>\n\n<p>The non-Epic iOS software available exclusively in the EU is ... well, nothing of interest. Maybe some apps that help with content piracy. Other than that, nothing. Admittedly, the DMA only went into effect 6 months ago. Long-term, maybe there will arise a thriving ecosystem of useful and fun apps and games that are exclusively available in EU marketplaces. Right now, it’s Fortnite. There are a bunch of articles (and surely soon to be more) informing EU citizens <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/get-apple-intelligence-in-the-eu/\">how to access Apple Intelligence</a> (by lying about where they are). There are crickets chirping regarding how iOS users outside the EU can cheat their way into the EU’s new DMA rules. No one cares. </p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile no one in the EU will get Apple Intelligence or iPhone Mirroring, both of which features are very useful, and, dare I say, quite fun. Should we judge how much fun each side of the continental divide is having by how much fun they theoretically <em>could</em> be having, or by how much fun they <em>are</em> having?</p>\n\n<p>As it stands, the fun side is not the EU. But hope springs eternal.</p>\n\n\n\n    ","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"104e4ef1deeb875a3f8fa9939c06e16897412332adfa22829c8566184bd2e40c","category":"Tech"}
