Apple, in return, takes up to a 30 percent cut of the revenue generated from these subscriptions. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nOne executive at an independent podcast told <em>Semafor</em> that Apple explicitly said to them that podcast subscription enrolment would help their chances of being promoted in the carousel, while another remarked that ‌Apple Podcasts‌ Subscriptions was worth participating in simply for in-app placement advantages. An individual at Apple added that the ‌Apple Podcasts‌ app is now designed to offer more features to shows that participate in the subscription program, with several key slots reserved for this purpose.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-podcasts/\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-podcasts-subscriptions/\">Apple Podcasts Subscriptions</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/02/apple-podcasts-favors-subscription-shows/\">Report: Apple Podcasts Favors Shows With Subscriptions</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/report-apple-podcasts-favors-shows-with-subscriptions.2423348/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d03e8fb16111298c34ab6feebc2d0ece1969187ef8dd66b3cfb4527b2c8e949e","category":"Apple"}
