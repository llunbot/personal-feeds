The release notes only state:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This update provides important bug fixes and security updates and is recommended for all users.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The highlight is probably the security updates, which are as yet unspecified. The <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201222&amp;xcust=1-1-2276332-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple security releases page</a> lists “details coming soon” for this release, which is often the case when it fixes a security flaw that has been actively exploited in the wild—waiting until the update is more broadly available and applied before letting bad actors know that the door has been closed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to update to visionOS 1.1.1</h2>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Go to Settings &gt; <em>General</em> &gt; <em>Software Update</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If an update is available, tap <em>Download and Install</em> or <em>Install Now</em>. You might need to enter your Apple Vision Pro passcode.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>When the update is ready to install, an alert asks you to take off your Apple Vision Pro. You can see the progress of the update on the front of your device with EyeSight.</li>\n</ol>\n\nVirtual Reality</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"76c7ddc5b899ffcd07f1c50bad7d9d0e44a31d78a6139fe001df26b986a4e0b2","category":"Apple"}
