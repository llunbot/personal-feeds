Apple says that the feature will not impact recurring purchases and subscriptions.<blockquote>Advanced Fraud Protection is a way to keep your Apple Card information even more secure. After turning on Advanced Fraud Protection, your three-digit Apple Card security code will change periodically after it's been viewed in the Wallet app or after it's been auto-filled from Safari.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nYou should check your security code each time you want to make a purchase with Apple Card to be sure you're using the most up-to-date code. You can also use Advanced Fraud Protection without affecting your recurring purchases and subscriptions, such as streaming services or memberships, because these merchants use your security code to authorize payment just once when you first sign up.</blockquote>As outlined in <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212328\">new Apple Card support document</a>, Advanced Fraud Protection can be enabled by following these steps:\r\n<br />\r\n<ol>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>Open up the Wallet app and tap on ‌Apple Card‌.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>Tap on the card number icon and then authenticate with Face ID, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a>, or a passcode.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n \t<li>Scroll down to the Advanced Fraud Protection option and toggle it on.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n</ol>\r\n<br />\r\nAdvanced Fraud Protection can also be turned on using an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> by following the same steps, but through the Wallet &amp; <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/\">Apple Pay</a> section of the Settings app. Turning it off can be done by following the first two steps and then toggling off the feature. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nYou can tell that the option for a rotating security toggle is turned on when the clock icon is displayed next to the three-digit security code. Those who enable the feature will need to make sure to check their security code for each online transaction to make sure the most current code is being used. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/apple-card-advanced-fraud-protection.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nToday's ‌iOS 15‌ update also makes it easier to find an ‌Apple Card‌ number by opening up the Wallet app and tapping on the card icon, plus there's a redesigned ‌Apple Pay‌ payment sheet that allows users to more easily add new cards and coupon codes.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-15/\">iPadOS 15</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/\">Apple Card</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-15.233\">iOS 15</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/20/apple-card-ios-15-advanced-fraud-protection/\">Apple Card Gains Advanced Fraud Protection in iOS 15</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-card-gains-advanced-fraud-protection-in-ios-15.2312155/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=2m6MXtnlMEc:mHLFuPoBSes:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=2m6MXtnlMEc:mHLFuPoBSes:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/2m6MXtnlMEc\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a75dd7de71f99b9ebade338507444a6e3bb6637a52a1f8c28109d4350d999227","category":"Apple"}
