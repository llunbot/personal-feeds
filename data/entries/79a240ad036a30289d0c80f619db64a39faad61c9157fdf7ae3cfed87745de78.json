It received a few updates in its first several years on the market, with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2015/10/26/beats-pill-speaker-launches/\">final revision being a redesigned Pill+</a> with a Lightning connector introduced under Apple's ownership in 2015.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Pill+ remained on the market for a number of years in that form before being <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/10/beats-pill-discontinued/\">quietly discontinued</a> in early 2022.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBased on today's video, it appears the Pill may soon be making a comeback, as the speaker in James' hand clearly shows a Beats logo and it includes a lanyard that was not present on previous versions of the speaker.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith the direction of Apple's product lineup, a USB-C port for charging appears likely. And given the previous Pill+ was introduced almost nine years ago, there have been significant advances in Bluetooth and other technologies since that time, so this upcoming version is likely to be a significant improvement. Specific details on the speaker, including a release date, however, remain unknown.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/beats/\">Beats</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/20/lebron-james-unreleased-beats-pill/\">LeBron James Spotted With Unreleased Beats Pill Speaker</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/lebron-james-spotted-with-unreleased-beats-pill-speaker.2424590/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Eric Slivka","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"79a240ad036a30289d0c80f619db64a39faad61c9157fdf7ae3cfed87745de78","category":"Apple"}
