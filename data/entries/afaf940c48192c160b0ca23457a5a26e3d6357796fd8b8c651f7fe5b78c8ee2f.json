This refers to the spring system used in the shock. Air shocks use a pressurised air spring to absorb forces from the trail, whereas coil shocks use a coil spring.</p>\n<p>You can jump to the different types of shock by hitting the links below:</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"#best-mtb-air-shocks\">Best MTB air shocks</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#best-mtb-coil-shocks\">Best MTB coil shocks</a></li>\n</ul><p>These two types of mountain bike shocks come with their own strengths and weaknesses.

It acts as a spring, absorbing the forces applied to the rear wheel to help isolate the bike and rider from the bumps. It then rebounds to its original position, in a controlled manner, ready to absorb the next obstacle so the rear tyre can maintain contact with the ground, increasing control for cornering and braking.</p>\n<p>This is where the often-mentioned spring rate, and compression and rebound damping come into play. The spring rate and compression damping control how much force is required to move the shock through its travel.</p>\n<p>Rebound adjustment controls how quickly the shock returns to its original position after absorbing an impact.</p>\n<h3>Should you buy an air or coil shock?</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Male cyclist in yellow top riding the Hope HB.916 full suspension mountain bike\" title=\"Hope HB.916 - 23\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Air shocks can deliver a livelier ride, but coil shocks are better on rougher trails.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>If your bike is compatible with both <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/coil-vs-air/\">air and coil shocks</a>, you may be asking which is best for you. While it comes down to personal preference, there are a few key differences to consider.</p>\n<p>Air springs are infinitely and easily adjustable, requiring just a simple shock pump. This is why most bike brands spec air shocks as standard. They can also be made more or less progressive by adding or removing volume spacers. Plus, air shocks tend to be lighter.</p>\n<p>Coil springs, on the other hand, can only be adjusted by swapping to firmer or softer coils, which come in specific increments and can be expensive and time-consuming to swap.</p>\n<p>Air shocks offer riders plenty of tunability. They tend to provide more comfort in the middle portion of their travel and have a progressive ramp-up that helps prevent harsh bottom-outs.</p>\n<p>Coil shocks are arguably slightly better on the roughest trails, being incredibly supple at the start of their travel, more supportive in the mid-stroke and offering more consistent performance on long descents.</p>\n<h3>What to look for in a mountain bike rear shock</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Vali Höll's Trek Session downhill mountain bike for the 2022 UCI MTB World Championships in Les Gets, France\" title=\"Vali Höll's Trek Session downhill mountain bike for the 2022 UCI MTB World Championships in Les Gets, France\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Rebound adjustment is on almost all shocks, but other features will depend on the intended use.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Tennyson / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>If you’re in the market for a new shock, there are some key things to look out for.</p>\n<h4>Rebound and compression adjustments</h4>\n<p>It’s important to take note of the rebound and compression adjustability on offer before making your purchase.</p>\n<p>Almost all shocks will provide rebound adjustment, which is crucial. Too slow, and your shock will pack down in chattery sections of trail because the shock can’t extend fast enough to full travel. Too fast, and you will experience a pogo-stick effect, where the shock extends too quickly and bucks you uncontrollably.</p>\n<p>Many of the higher-end options offer four-way external adjustment of high and low-speed compression and rebound damping. This is great if you understand the mechanics of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/the-ultimate-guide-to-mountain-bike-rear-suspension-systems/\">mountain bike </a><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/the-ultimate-guide-to-mountain-bike-rear-suspension-systems/\">rear </a><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/the-ultimate-guide-to-mountain-bike-rear-suspension-systems/\"> suspension</a> and the responses involved, but it can be a little tricky and time-consuming to set up correctly for some riders.</p>\n<h4>Climb switch</h4>\n<p>If your rides often involve winch-and-plummet laps of gnarly trails and smooth fire road climbs, a climb switch may save your legs by preventing the shock from sapping energy on the uphills.</p>\n<p>If you ride undulating terrain frequently, it may be better to leave the shock open for the duration of the ride. Most <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/enduro-vs-trail-bikes/\">modern enduro and trail bikes</a> are designed with polite climbing manners in mind, often negating the need for a climb switch.</p>\n<p>If you’re into covering ground as fast as possible – think <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cross-country-bikes/\">cross-country MTBs</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-downcountry-mountain-bikes/\">downcountry bikes</a> – a climb switch or lock-out may be what you want for maximum climbing efficiency.</p>\n<h4>External or internal reservoir?</h4>\n<p>The reservoir of a rear shock holds the shock’s damping oil.</p>\n<p>Many gravity-oriented shocks feature a large external reservoir (often called a piggyback reservoir), which helps keep the damping oil cooler for longer, something that’s crucial on long and rough descents.</p>\n<p>It also allows for additional oil displacement. Shocks of this type tend to have a large shock stroke, so they displace more oil inside them with each compression, and the oil has to flow somewhere.</p>\n<p>The downsides of a piggyback design are extra weight and size. Some frames will also be incompatible due to clearance issues.</p>\n<p>Mountain bike shocks with internal reservoirs tend to be smaller and lighter, suited to bikes with less travel and reduced demands on the shock.</p>\n<h3>How do I know what size rear shock I need for my mountain bike?</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Fuel EXe full suspension eMTB (electric mountain bike)\" title=\"Trek Fuel EXe news story - Shock\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> There are several factors to take into consideration when choosing a shock.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Behr / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>When it comes to identifying which shock is compatible with your bike, there are several factors to take into consideration.</p>\n<p>The first is called eye-to-eye length, and refers to the distance between the middle of both mounting eyelets at the top and bottom of the shock.</p>\n<p>Older shocks used an imperial measurement system, but modern shocks use a metric scale.</p>\n<p>The second measurement is called the stroke. This is the distance the shock’s shaft moves when fully compressed.</p>\n<p>Once you have the correct shock size, you need to check the mounting hardware required – this comes in the form of bushings and spacers. Each bike manufacturer has its own standards here, so it’s best to check with them directly.</p>\n<p>Some shocks also use a trunnion mounting design, where the shock is mounted directly to the linkage by threads in the shock body.</p>","author":"Finlay Anderson","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"afaf940c48192c160b0ca23457a5a26e3d6357796fd8b8c651f7fe5b78c8ee2f","category":"Cycling"}
