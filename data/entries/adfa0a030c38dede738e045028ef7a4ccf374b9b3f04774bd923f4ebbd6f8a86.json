Capable both on and off-road, they’re able to carry you across a variety of terrain types. They’re robust, they’re fun to ride and they generally employ a lot of the best in modern technology, including <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/disc-brakes-vs-rim-brakes-everything-you-need-to-know\" target=\"_blank\">disc brakes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-gravel-gearing-how-to-get-lower-gears\" target=\"_blank\">beginner-friendly wide-ratio gearing</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most gravel bikes are still light enough and quick enough for use on the tarmac despite their broad capabilities, making them a great all-round choice, and arguably the best option if you’re only going to own one bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A quick skim through our reviews over the past few years reveals just how quickly the gravel market has exploded. From the occasional inclusion to becoming a mainstay of our testing, gravel bikes are everywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best aluminium gravel bikes</h2>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Cannondale Topstone:</strong>

Based around a capable aluminium frame, its 40mm tyres provide plenty of versatility, while a double chainring Shimano GRX gravel groupset is an excellent find at this price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With DT Swiss supplying the lightweight wheelset, which arrives tubeless as standard, we couldn’t find any chinks in the Grail’s armour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This bike weighs much the same as you’d expect for a similarly priced road model, and with space for mudguards (Canyon’s own – there’s no seatstay bridge) mean it’s all the drop bar bike many riders will ever need.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/canyon-grail-al-70-review\" target=\"_blank\">Canyon Grail review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://www.canyon.com/en-gb/gravel-bikes/all-road/grail/al/grail-7/3093.html?dwvar_3093_pv_rahmenfarbe=YE%2FBK\" target=\"_blank\">Canyon (£1,749)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Canyon Grizl 7</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/10/03135201/canyon-grizl-al-3-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"canyon-grizl-al-3\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>£1,749 | <a href=\"https://www.canyon.com/en-gb/gravel-bikes/bike-packing/grizl/al/grizl-7/2709.html?dwvar_2709_pv_rahmenfarbe=GN\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Capable for bikepacking or short blasts</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Big 50mm clearance </strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>While the Canyon Grail is focussed on speedier rides, the Grizl heads for more technical gravel and bikepacking duties. Its geometry is more relaxed, it can take wider 50mm tyres and you can bolt a whole lot of stuff to it. With the fitted 45mm tyres, there’s room for mudguards, although the lack of a seatstay bridge means you’re best off sticking with Canyon’s proprietary ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The geometry is comfortable, with a long top tube and a short stem leading to good weight distribution. Although you can load up for a multiday trip, it’s still fun to take out for a short blast around the woods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though it sits near the bottom of the range, the Grizl 7 gets a Shimano GRX 2×11-speed groupset and DT Swiss Gravel LN wheels.

One of the first of an increasing number of gravel bikes to take aerodynamics seriously, the Exploro’s tight angles, dropped stays, and tucked rear wheel all echo 3T’s racing bike designs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, enormous tyres and the ability to run it with a single chainring and 650b wheels mean the Exploro is very capable. A great bike for a broad spectrum of gravel riders, it sits particularly well with all-road riders and competitive gravel racers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From its profile to its paint job, it’s also very handsome, which never hurts either.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/3t-exploro-racemax-first-ride-review\" target=\"_blank\">3T Exploro RaceMax review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://www.3t.bike/en/223-exploro-race\" target=\"_blank\">3T (from £4,599)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>3T Exploro Ultra</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/05/07100400/3t_exploro_ultra_sideon1-970x639.jpg\" alt=\"3t_exploro_ultra_sideon1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>£5,099 | <a href=\"https://www.3t.bike/en/240-exploro-ultra\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Exploro Ultra increases tyre clearance to 61mm</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Designed for the most technical terrain</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Exploro Ultra marries extreme off-road capability with a fast ride on-road to create a versatile and distinctive design. The third iteration of 3T’s popular but controversial aero gravel bike, the Exploro Ultra has been shaped to work best with wide 650b tyres around 55mm-61mm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Made for the most technical and therefore slowest terrain, the Ultra’s aero benefits are most likely to pay dividends on the rarer occasions it’s used on the road. At the same time, it utilises its big tyres to override the framesets’ otherwise aggressive attributes once off-road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other radical features include a dropper post and a super-wide single-ring drivetrain. So how does it add up? It’s undoubtedly the most exaggerated example of how designer Gerard Vroomen can successfully squish together two typically disparate drop-bar genres – aero and gravel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leveraging the transformative effect of tyre size and pressure, the Ultra switches personalities as extremely as it mixes genres. Off-road, its chunky Vittoria tyres offset the harshness of the aero frame and allowed it to take on technical terrain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet back on the tarmac, the frame’s attributes become more dominant, leaving it feeling far more like a quick road bike than its off-road capability would otherwise suggest.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/3t-exploro-ultra-review\" target=\"_blank\">3T Exploro Ultra review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://www.3t.bike/en/240-exploro-ultra\" target=\"_blank\">3T (from £5,099)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Basso Palta II</h3>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/12/03000150/basso_palta_ii_review_1-970x645.jpg\" alt=\"basso_palta_ii_review_1\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h4>£3,499 | <a href=\"https://fave.co/3M8oyop\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Racy feel both on and off tarmac</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Updated geometry and spec for added comfort</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The gravel renaissance has largely been propped up by people rediscovering their suspensionless mountain bike-oriented youth, but it’s also become a breath of fresh air for those with road fatigue, having spent ten years since the 2012 boom riding the same country lanes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basso’s Palta II appeals to the road cyclist who wants to get in on the action with a racier feel that will still take on rough surfaces with ease and helps build confidence on unfamiliar territory while still performing well on tarmac.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since its first edition the Italian brand has made some alterations to further enhance comfort through features that better damp bumps and vibrations including a gravel-specific carbon fibre handlebar as well as a more relaxed geometry.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/basso-palta-ii-review\" target=\"_blank\">Basso Palta II review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>BMC Kaius 01</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/bmc-kaius-review-1-970x647.jpg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>£5,699 | <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6821&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tredz.co.uk%2F.BMC-Kaius-01-Two-Force-AXS-Wide-2023-Gravel-Bike_259596.htm\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fast off-road feel</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>36cm integrated cockpit</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking point from its racy road cousin the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/bmc/8832/bmc-teammachine-slr01-one-review?_ga=2.136365113.868265785.1674464816-291706083.1668428322\" target=\"_blank\">Teammachine SLR 01</a> and its adventure-focussed sibling the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/10107/bmc-urs-01-review?_ga=2.102805257.868265785.1674464816-291706083.1668428322\" target=\"_blank\">URS 01</a>, the Kauis 01 One aims to be the best of both, with a sleek integrated design and excellent off-road handling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Kaius is BMC’s first race gravel bike and, as such, wants to go fast.
