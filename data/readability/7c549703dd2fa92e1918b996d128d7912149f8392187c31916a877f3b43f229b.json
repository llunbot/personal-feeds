It also features two dedicated ports for securely docking sunglasses while resting or climbing.</p><p>Beyond its venting prowess, the Veleno Mips is also exceptionally comfortable. The 360° head belt of the MET Safe-T Upsilon retention system ensures that there will be no pressure points on the skull and its internal shape welcomes almost all different shaped heads.</p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/met-veleno-mips-mtb-helmet-details-rentention-system-comfort.jpg\"></figure><p>Featuring the MIPS-C2® brain protection system, the MET Veleno Mips is able to slide relative to the head in the case of a crash, redirecting damaging rotational motion. MIPS is a brain protection system—engineered to add protection to the standard construction of helmets in case of certain impacts. The MIPS Brain Protection System (BPS) is attached inside the helmet, between the comfort padding and the EPS.</p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/met-veleno-mips-mtb-helmet-details-brain-protection-system.jpg\"></figure><h2>Key Details</h2><ul><li>360º retention system, vertical adjustment</li><li>Removable visor</li><li>Weight: 300 grams (medium)</li><li>S (52-56cm) | M (56-58cm) | L (58-61cm)</li><li>MSRP: 130€ | £120 | US$159</li></ul><figure><div><ul><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/met-veleno-mips-mtb-helmet-@ulyssedaessle-13.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/met-veleno-mips-mtb-helmet-@ulyssedaessle-6.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/met-veleno-mips-mtb-helmet-@ulyssedaessle-3.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/met-veleno-mips-mtb-helmet-@ulyssedaessle-18.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/met-veleno-mips-mtb-helmet-@ulyssedaessle-19.jpg\"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></li></ul></div></figure><div><h2>WHAT IS ‘FROM THE SOURCE’?</h2><p>When you see an article containing ‘From the source’ label on the homepage or with the headline in blue, note that this is content directly from the brand and it has been vetted by our Editors and deemed worthy of your attention.
