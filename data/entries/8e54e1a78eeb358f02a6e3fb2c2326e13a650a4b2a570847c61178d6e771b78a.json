Apple\nalso wants to permanently prevent NSO from using any Apple\nsoftware, services or devices, a move that could render the\ncompany’s Pegasus spyware product worthless, given that its core\nbusiness is to give NSO’s government clients full access to a\ntarget’s iPhone or Android smartphone.</p>\n\n<p>Apple is also asking for unspecified damages for the time and cost\nto deal with what the company argues is NSO’s abuse of its\nproducts. Apple said it would donate the proceeds from those\ndamages to organizations that expose spyware. [...]</p>\n\n<p>The sample of Pegasus gave Apple a forensic understanding of how\nPegasus worked. The company found that NSO’s engineers had created\nmore than 100 fake Apple IDs to carry out their attacks. In the\nprocess of creating those accounts, NSO’s engineers would have had\nto agree to Apple’s iCloud Terms and Conditions, which expressly\nrequire that iCloud users’ engagement with Apple “be governed by\nthe laws of the state of California.” The clause helped Apple\nbring its lawsuit against NSO in the Northern District of\nCalifornia.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Shades of nailing Al Capone for tax evasion.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/11/23/apple-sues-nso-group\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"8e54e1a78eeb358f02a6e3fb2c2326e13a650a4b2a570847c61178d6e771b78a","category":"Tech"}
