{"title":"Dithering, and This Week’s Apple Event","link":"https://dithering.fm/","date":1726338232000,"content":"\n<p><a href=\"https://dithering.fm/\">\n<img src=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2024/09/dithering-cover-sept-2024.jpeg\" alt=\"September 2024 cover art for Dithering, depicting Lynn Swann’s 53-yard circus catch during the Steelers’ 21-17 victory over the Cowboys in Super Bowl 10 in 1976.\" width=\"500\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I’m still collecting my thoughts on this week’s “It’s Glowtime” Apple event, and where Apple stands in general. But this episode of Dithering that dropped Friday morning captures my high-level thoughts well. We haven’t done this in a while, but we’re making it free for everyone to listen to. Give it a listen, while I continue to write and think. (We also have a feed of our occasional free episodes; search your podcast player for “Dithering” and it should show up.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dithering as a standalone subscription <a href=\"https://dithering.fm/\">costs just $7/month or $70/year</a>. You get two episodes per week, each exactly 15 minutes long, with yours truly and Ben Thompson. I just love having an outlet like Dithering for weeks like this one. People who try Dithering seem to love it, too — we have remarkably little churn.</p>\n\n<p>(You can also get Dithering by <a href=\"https://stratechery.passport.online/member/plan/4ycW4SE71Cy6ryrijywbTG\">subscribing to Stratechery</a>, a bundle that includes all of Ben’s writing, his interviews, plus the <a href=\"https://sharptech.fm/\">Sharp Tech</a>, <a href=\"https://sharpchina.fm/\">Sharp China</a>, and <a href=\"https://greatestofalltalk.com/\">Greatest Of All Talk</a> podcasts — all of that, including Dithering, for just $15/month or $150/year.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/14/dithering-apple-event\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d4aacbdac5011f6ebd57ed87325889ee1853eb94973e45c72c578d8d66c35e0d","category":"Tech"}
