The tariffs will significantly impact Apple, which still assembles the majority of iPhones and many other devices in China, which is facing a 54% tariff starting April 9.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAbout an hour into the trading session, however, Apple's stock briefly surged to as high as $194.14, following <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-reverses-course-hassetts-142738704.html\">reports</a> that the Trump administration was considering a 90-day pause on tariffs, in all countries except China. A spokesperson for the Trump administration later <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/04/07/white-house-says-fake-news-that-trump-is-considering-90-day-tariff-pause.html\">described that claim as \"fake news,\"</a> resulting in Apple's stock plunging below $180 again. As of writing, shares are trading around the $181 mark.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMany stocks have plummeted since Trump's announcement, amid fears of a prolonged trade war and economic downturn. Apple's stock price has dropped nearly 20% since closing at $223.89 last Wednesday. Trump threatened China with <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-threatens-additional-tariffs-china-terminates-talks-2025-04-07/\">additional tariffs</a> today, adding to the uncertainty that has sent shockwaves through global markets.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has yet to publicly comment on the tariffs, as customers fear that the price of iPhones and other devices <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/04/2300-dollar-iphone/\">may eventually increase</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/aapl/\">AAPL</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/07/apple-stock-wild-morning/\">Apple's Stock Had a Wild Morning</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-stock-had-a-wild-morning.2454898/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"171a1d85ec7c0c0cdd22aef8267d1cfd050d892e50de91850dfe653aafd84531","category":"Apple"}
