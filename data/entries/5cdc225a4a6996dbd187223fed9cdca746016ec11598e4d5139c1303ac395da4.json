The Prologue’s rim profile didn’t change, but the process is a bit more efficient and eco-friendly. The flat extrusion saves shipping space, so more material can fit on the same truck, boat, or train. And they’re anodizing the extrusion prior to rolling them, which lets them do roughly 100 at a time, versus 16 when trying to fit round, finished rims into a vat of anodizing chemicals.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boyd-cycling-us-made-alloy-bicycle-rims-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boyd-cycling-us-made-alloy-bicycle-rims-1-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"new boyd alloy rims are made in the USA, racked and awaiting finishing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boyd-cycling-us-made-alloy-bicycle-rims-1-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boyd-cycling-us-made-alloy-bicycle-rims-1-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boyd-cycling-us-made-alloy-bicycle-rims-1-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boyd-cycling-us-made-alloy-bicycle-rims-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boyd-cycling-us-made-alloy-bicycle-rims-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boyd-cycling-us-made-alloy-bicycle-rims-1-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boyd-cycling-us-made-alloy-bicycle-rims-1.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The higher end wheels are the revamped Altamonte road wheels and all-new Bracken MTB wheels are rolled first, then anodized.

Working with the machine’s manufacturer, they brought in enough extruded alloy sections to make 500 of their Prologue GVL gravel rims and got to work. From that batch, they got 390 production-quality rims, having worked through the rolling process, cutting and drilling, sleeving and bonding, and other final finishing.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boyd-cycling-us-made-alloy-bicycle-rims-7.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boyd-cycling-us-made-alloy-bicycle-rims-7-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"boyd cycling u.s. made alloy bicycle rim production equipment\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boyd-cycling-us-made-alloy-bicycle-rims-7-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boyd-cycling-us-made-alloy-bicycle-rims-7-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boyd-cycling-us-made-alloy-bicycle-rims-7-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boyd-cycling-us-made-alloy-bicycle-rims-7-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boyd-cycling-us-made-alloy-bicycle-rims-7-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boyd-cycling-us-made-alloy-bicycle-rims-7-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boyd-cycling-us-made-alloy-bicycle-rims-7.jpg 1800w\" /></a><figcaption>The joining machine is where sleeves and a bonding agent are inserted.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of the process was learning how to “not” make rims, how to properly heat them so the anodization doesn’t crack, and how to design the sleeves so they fit the finished rim once it’s been curved, which stretches and changes the shape of the blank extrusion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Boyd sleeves them together, with an adhesive bonding it all together without pins. They say the benefit of sleeving over welding is that you don’t have to smooth the weld afterward, which can leave a bit of a flat spot that’s virtually impossible to get perfectly matched to shapely modern rims.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boyd-cycling-us-made-alloy-bicycle-rims-3.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boyd-cycling-us-made-alloy-bicycle-rims-3-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"rim drilling machine at boyd cycling\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boyd-cycling-us-made-alloy-bicycle-rims-3-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boyd-cycling-us-made-alloy-bicycle-rims-3-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boyd-cycling-us-made-alloy-bicycle-rims-3-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boyd-cycling-us-made-alloy-bicycle-rims-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boyd-cycling-us-made-alloy-bicycle-rims-3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boyd-cycling-us-made-alloy-bicycle-rims-3-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boyd-cycling-us-made-alloy-bicycle-rims-3.jpg 1800w\" /></a><figcaption>The rim drilling machine creates the spoke and valve stem holes…the one shown here was a test dummy, hence all the holes close together.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boyd-cycling-us-made-alloy-bicycle-rims-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boyd-cycling-us-made-alloy-bicycle-rims-2-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"boyd us-made alloy rim checked for flatness\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boyd-cycling-us-made-alloy-bicycle-rims-2-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boyd-cycling-us-made-alloy-bicycle-rims-2-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boyd-cycling-us-made-alloy-bicycle-rims-2-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boyd-cycling-us-made-alloy-bicycle-rims-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boyd-cycling-us-made-alloy-bicycle-rims-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boyd-cycling-us-made-alloy-bicycle-rims-2-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boyd-cycling-us-made-alloy-bicycle-rims-2.jpg 1800w\" /></a><figcaption>Rims are checked for flatness and roundness on various jigs.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boyd-cycling-us-made-alloy-bicycle-rims-8.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boyd-cycling-us-made-alloy-bicycle-rims-8-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"boyd cycling u.s. made alloy bicycle rim production equipment\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boyd-cycling-us-made-alloy-bicycle-rims-8-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boyd-cycling-us-made-alloy-bicycle-rims-8-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boyd-cycling-us-made-alloy-bicycle-rims-8-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boyd-cycling-us-made-alloy-bicycle-rims-8-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boyd-cycling-us-made-alloy-bicycle-rims-8-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boyd-cycling-us-made-alloy-bicycle-rims-8-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/boyd-cycling-us-made-alloy-bicycle-rims-8.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, they’re doing water transfer decals in house, too, which they say isn’t done anywhere else in the US.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Bringing the process in house gives them more control, and because of the efficiencies gained in shipping and production, they’re able to keep the US-made wheels the same price as before.

Optimized for 2.4″ and larger tires, it has a 5mm offset spoke bed to help even out spoke tension. Rim weight is 485g, and 29er wheelsets come in at a claimed 1,850g for the set built on their Tripel MTB hubs with Pillar Wing 21 spokes (laced 32 spokes front and rear).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Boyd-Altamont-rim-profile.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"379\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Boyd-Altamont-rim-profile-800x379.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Boyd-Altamont-rim-profile-800x379.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Boyd-Altamont-rim-profile-297x141.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Boyd-Altamont-rim-profile-120x57.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Boyd-Altamont-rim-profile-768x363.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Boyd-Altamont-rim-profile.jpg 1253w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Boyd’s Altamont Rim Brake wheels provide a quality option for the holdouts, and now these rims are made in house, too. They feature front- and rear-specific profiles can can be built with 24, 28, or 32 spokes. Claimed weight for a 24/28 combo build is 1,620g.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Boyd says they will open up the rim manufacturing for third parties, too. They’ll take a client’s rim design and manage the extrusion, manufacturing, and rim rolling and finishing for them. This opens up more options for domestic brands who want to on-shore production and sourcing to better deal with supply chain issues and rising transportation costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.boydcycling.com\" target=\"_blank\">BoydCycling.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/boyd-cycling-moves-alloy-rim-production-in-house-w-two-new-models/\">Boyd Cycling moves alloy rim production in house w/ two new models</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"5cdc225a4a6996dbd187223fed9cdca746016ec11598e4d5139c1303ac395da4","category":"Cycling"}
