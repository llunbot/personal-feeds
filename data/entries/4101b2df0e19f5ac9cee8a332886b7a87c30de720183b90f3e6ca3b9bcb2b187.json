And Dave tells Ars that his recent \"hostile takeover\" started as an attempt to reclaim assets from a corporation he felt had lost its way.\n<h2>The motive</h2>\n<p>The story of Dave's EHEXP coup goes all the way back to 2011, when he founded EHEXP under the control of his <em>Eve Online</em> character Nikki Shea. Dave says he quickly transferred the CEO role to his \"original and first\" character, Sienna d'Orion.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1933280#p3\">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1933280&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4101b2df0e19f5ac9cee8a332886b7a87c30de720183b90f3e6ca3b9bcb2b187","category":"Tech"}
