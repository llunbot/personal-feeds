Now 15 stages in, the race pauses to allow the riders to rest up before one final push to the line in Nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On its second rest day, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tadej-pogacar\" target=\"_blank\">Tadej Pogačar</a> leads the overall classification with a 3:09 advantage over <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/jonas-vingegaard\" target=\"_blank\">Jonas Vingegaard</a> and a 5:19 buffer to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/remco-evenepoel\" target=\"_blank\">Remco Evenepoel </a>in third. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/biniam-girmay-profile\" target=\"_blank\">Biniam Girmay</a> continues to wear the green jersey, Tadej Pogačar is in the polka-dots (although, this will be worn in lieu by Jonas Vingegaard), and Remco Evenepoel has a firm grip on the white jersey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s look back on Stages 10 to 15 and draw some conclusions about the race. Who excelled in the middle section of the race, and who was left disappointed last week?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Winner: Tadej Pogačar </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T130216.806-970x647.png\" alt=\"tadej pogacar leads the tour de france 2024 and dominates on plateau de beille\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T130216.806-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T130216.806-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T130216.806-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T130216.806-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T130216.806-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T130216.806-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T130216.806-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T130216.806-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T130216.806-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T130216.806.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Charly Lopez</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, Tadej Pogačar leads this list. At the end of the first week, Pogačar had already prepared us for an impending GC strike in the mountains after having won the first mountain stage in Valloire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the second week, though, Pogačar has risen to the top of the GC standings with a three-minute gap to Jonas Vingegaard and a five-minute lead over Remco Evenepoel. Along the way, he claimed two stage wins and came close to another at Le Lioran on Stage 11.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no doubt that Pogačar is the strongest rider in the race. He has smashed climbing records (more on that to come) and dismantled the opposition with ease.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It would take a miracle comeback for anyone to overtake the Slovenian in his quest for a historic <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-tour-double\" target=\"_blank\">Giro-Tour double</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Look out for Tadej’s race-leading <a

rider of the week is undoubtedly Jasper Philipsen. After a disappointing first week, Jasper made it onto the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/winners-losers-week-one-tour-de-france-2024\" target=\"_blank\">losers section of last week’s review</a>. Since then, he has improved greatly and has two stage wins to show for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first of these wins came in Saint-Amand-Montrond courtesy of a perfect leadout from <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/mathieu-van-der-poel-monument-ranked\" target=\"_blank\">Mathieu van der Poel</a>. After a low-key first week, the two finally managed to break through the sprinting chaos. Similarly on Stage 13 in Pau, Philipsen’s kick was unmatched by his rivals, paving the way to another stage win.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Philipsen does not top the green jersey rankings, he has made some inroads in that classification. The Belgian fastman now sits 86 points behind Biniam Girmay. To overhaul this deficit, his Alpecin-Deceuninck team will need to keep a tight leash in the breakaway during the remaining sprinting days and hope Girmay suffers some bad luck.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Check out <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/jasper-philipsen-canyon-aeroad-tour-de-france-2024\">Jasper Philipsen’s unreleased Canyon Aeroad</a> he won two stages on board</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Winner: Climbing records</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T133337.665-970x647.png\" alt=\"tadej pogacar beats plateau de beille record\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T133337.665-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T133337.665-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T133337.665-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T133337.665-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T133337.665-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T133337.665-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T133337.665-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T133337.665-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T133337.665-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T133337.665.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Charly Lopez</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever you think about climbing records, the Pyrenean KOMs have received a right hammering this weekend. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Stage 15’s summit finish to Plateau de Beille, Pogačar smashed the time of Marco Pantani up the climb by 5min 47sec. <a href=\"https://x.com/NaichacaCycling\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter user NaichacaCycling</a> has calculated an estimated watts per kilo of 6.98 for this effort. For those unenlightened, 7W/kg is considered an all-time performance. On a climb of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/plateau-de-beille-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">Plateau de Beille’s length</a>, Pogačar’s effort sits among the greatest of all time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The day before at Pla d’Adet, this calculation produced a watts per kilo score of 6.85. Pogačar’s 27min 50sec climb is two minutes faster than the time of Lance Armstrong in 2001, and far faster than any recent attempts on the climb. With such records, we have some confidence in saying that we are in a golden era of cycling performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Winner: Soudal-QuickStep</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T130739.068-970x647.png\" alt=\"remco evenepoel and mikel landa tour de france 2024\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T130739.068-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T130739.068-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T130739.068-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T130739.068-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T130739.068-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T130739.068-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T130739.068-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T130739.068-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T130739.068-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T130739.068.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/soudal-quickstep\" target=\"_blank\">Soudal-QuickStep</a> usually target the sprints at the Tour de France, but in 2024, the Belgian team have been leaving their mark in the GC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a solid week of racing, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/remco-evenepoel\" target=\"_blank\">Remco Evenepoel</a> has made substantial progress on his podium bid.

At Plateau de Beille, Landa performed above expectations to claim fourth place on the stage. That enabled the Basque rider to jump up to fifth in the overall standings, an improvement of three places from the first rest day.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Winner: The super-domestiques</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T143614.492-970x647.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T143614.492-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T143614.492-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T143614.492-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T143614.492-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T143614.492-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T143614.492-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T143614.492-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T143614.492-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T143614.492-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T143614.492.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Charly Lopez</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The top ten of this year’s Tour de France features fewer teams than normal. This is due to the rise of the super-<em>domestiques</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from the aforementioned Mikel Landa, two teammates have stood out during this second week: <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/american-riders-tour-de-france\" target=\"_blank\">Matteo Jorgenson</a> (Visma-Lease a Bike) and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/adam-yates-profile\" target=\"_blank\">Adam Yates</a> (UAE Team Emirates). Both riders suffered disappointing opening weeks. Yates sat in 12th at the last rest day and Jorgenson was in 10th. Through the second week, both have moved up the pecking order despite supporting their respective team leaders. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yates gained some time back after a solid ride to Le Lioran, but made his most significant GC advances in the Pyrenees. Altogether, this has moved Yates, last year’s third-place finisher into seventh overall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jorgenson, on the other hand, has become Visma-Lease a Bike’s most reliable domestique in the mountains. Without Sepp Kuss, the Idaho-raised rider has yo-yoed on the fringes of top ten. In spite of the stacked startlist of out-and-out leaders, the super-<em>domestiques</em> have proven a steady force within the top ten of GC in this latter half of the Tour.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Loser: Primož Roglič</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T130930.062-970x647.png\" alt=\"primoz roglic crashes out tour de france 2024\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T130930.062-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T130930.062-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T130930.062-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T130930.062-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T130930.062-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T130930.062-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T130930.062-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T130930.062-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T130930.062-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T130930.062.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Charly Lopez</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It wouldn’t be a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/primoz-roglic\" target=\"_blank\">Roglič</a> Tour de France without a little bit of rough and tumble. Yes, there are no prizes for guessing that the Slovenian would feature on this list. Battered and bruised already, Roglič was handed a killer blow in the second week of racing. Out of the Tour for the third time in a row, it hurts to say that Roglič was a write-off in the second week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His woes began on Stage 11 where he crashed on a hairpin with only a couple of kilometres to go. Able to finish the stage, we were led to believe that this was an innocent spell of typical Roglič clumsiness. However, the following day, Roglič would crash more heavily in a mass pileup during the approach to the sprint finale. His teammates would help to chase on, but the injuries picked up would be too severe for his Tour to continue. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Red Bull-Bora-Hangrohe narrowly escaped <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/winners-losers-week-one-tour-de-france-2024\" target=\"_blank\">another inclusion in the losers’ section</a> this week.

Despite the presence of Remco Evenepoel and Primož Roglič at this year’s Tour, the GC fight has been seemingly decided much sooner than before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pogacar’s attacks on the Plateau de Beille look at have put any GC tension to bed. To add, Pogačar has won all three high mountain stages so far (Stages 4, 14 and 15). He has proved that he is the strongest climber by far at this Tour de France. Similarly, UAE Team Emirates have proved that they are the strongest team in the mountains, even if Juan Ayuso abandoned halfway through the second week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only wobble so far came in the Massif Central where Jonas Vingegaard outgunned Pogačar in a final sprint to the line. However, since then, Pogačar has gained two minutes on the Dane, extending his lead out to a mammoth 3min 9sec in the GC. It will take a big effort from Visma-Lease a Bike to overturn that deficit.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Losers: Crashes and Illness</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2160809685-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"tour de france 2024 crash\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2160809685-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2160809685-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2160809685-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2160809685-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2160809685-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2160809685-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2160809685-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2160809685-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2160809685-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-2160809685-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>ANNE-CHRISTINE POUJOULAT/AFP via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2024 Tour de France was <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/opinion-tour-de-france-2024-week-one\" target=\"_blank\">largely unaffected by crashes and illness during its first week</a>.

Little did the spectator know that he was caught in HD on the TV broadcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.leparisien.fr/sports/cyclisme/il-a-passe-un-apres-midi-bien-arrose-le-spectateur-qui-a-lance-des-chips-sur-pogacar-a-ete-arrete-14-07-2024-LNOKGO7AMBCTFJM3FRIM7HK7Z4.php\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Le Parisien</em></a><em> </em>reported that the man was arrested for ‘aggravated violence’ and faced questioning on Sunday. Witnesses on the climb say that the spectator was caught by police shortly after the lead riders came past.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The vandal was met with widespread negative reporting online and on social media. ‘There was quite a bit of booing and someone was throwing chips, I heard also they threw the chips at Tadej and that’s strange to do,’ <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/jonas-vingegaard\" target=\"_blank\">Jonas Vingegaard</a> recounts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We hope that fewer snacks will be thrown on the riders during the final week of the race.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/winners-losers-week-one-tour-de-france-2024\">The winners and losers of the first week of the Tour de France 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-predictions-2024\">Cyclist’s Tour de France predictions 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-climbs\">The climbs that will decide the 2024 Tour de France</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/how-to-watch-and-live-stream-the-tour-de-france\">How to watch the Tour de France 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\">Men’s Tour de France 2024: Route, how to watch and all you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/winners-losers-week-two-tour-de-france-2024\">The winners and losers of the second week of the Tour de France 2024</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Ewan Wilson &#124;
