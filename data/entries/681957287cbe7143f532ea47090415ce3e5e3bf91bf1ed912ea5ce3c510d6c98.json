But at one private event in 2022, a select group of researchers were actually <i>invited</i> to hack a Vegas hotel room, competing in a suite crowded with their laptops and cans of Red Bull to find digital vulnerabilities in every one of the room's gadgets, from its TV to its bedside VoIP phone.</p>\n<p>One team of hackers spent those days focused on the lock on the room's door, perhaps its most sensitive piece of technology of all. Now, more than a year and a half later, they're finally bringing to light the results of that work: a technique they discovered that would allow an intruder to open any of millions of hotel rooms worldwide in seconds, with just two taps.</p>\n<p>Today, Ian Carroll, Lennert Wouters, and a team of other security researchers are revealing a hotel keycard hacking technique they call <a href=\"https://unsaflok.com/\">Unsaflok</a>. The technique is a collection of security vulnerabilities that would allow a hacker to almost instantly open several models of Saflok-brand RFID-based keycard locks sold by the Swiss lock maker Dormakaba. The Saflok systems are installed on 3 million doors worldwide, inside 13,000 properties in 131 countries.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012114#p3\">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012114&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"681957287cbe7143f532ea47090415ce3e5e3bf91bf1ed912ea5ce3c510d6c98","category":"Tech"}
