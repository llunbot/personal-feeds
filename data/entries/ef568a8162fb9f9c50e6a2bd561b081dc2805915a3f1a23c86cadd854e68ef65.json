Wolfire argued that Valve was using its dominant market position in digital PC game sales (accepted in the lawsuit as 75 percent of the market for full PC game sales) to illegally prop up the platform in a way that was not conducive to competition.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.298754/gov.uscourts.wawd.298754.67.0.pdf\">a ruling issued late last week</a>, though, Western District of Washington Judge John Coughenour said that no illegal tying could take place because the Steam store and platform \"are a single product within the integrated game platform and transaction market.\" That's because the revenues from sales of games on the Steam store go directly toward supporting the \"free\" services available on the platform. And in the rare cases that games sold elsewhere make use of the Steam platform, Valve lets developers create free keys to enable that integration, obviating any potential harm.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1815641#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1815641&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ef568a8162fb9f9c50e6a2bd561b081dc2805915a3f1a23c86cadd854e68ef65","category":"Tech"}
