That's according to Richard Taylor, who served as the film director for <em>Atari Playland</em>, an unreleased arcade cabinet from classic Atari's waning days.</p>\n<p>Laserdisc games were already a hot commodity by 1983, as seen in the Don Bluth-directed <em>Dragon's Lair, </em>which used hand-drawn animation instead of an arcade's usual pixellated sprites. But unlike the single-game <em>Dragon’s Lair </em>cabinet, “the idea [or <em>Atari Playland</em>] was to make a freestanding arcade structure that, using Laserdisc, would have 10 games in it,” Taylor told Ars in a recent interview. Also, unlike <em>Dragon's Lair</em>, everything in <em>Playland</em> would be filmed with a real camera floating above elaborate miniatures on sizable sets.</p>\n\n<p><em>Atari Playland</em> featured multiple miniaturized sets; there were plans for an intro inside a killer clown’s dressing room, a shot outside the park’s entrance, and a fully filmed ride-selection screen. The construction of those sets was “not cheap,” according to Taylor, and required a lot of specifically filmed transitions.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1786962#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1786962&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Matt Paprocki","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2aa35bedf43314476ffce0435a5e668fac34d890f7fad668e596085b99fc5600","category":"Tech"}
