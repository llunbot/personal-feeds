So researchers at Cambridge established a synthetic “orthogonal” DNA replication system in<i> E. coli</i> that they can use as a risk-free way to generate and study such mutations. It is orthogonal because it is completely separate from the system that <i>E. coli</i> uses to copy its actual genome, which contains the genes <i>E. coli</i> needs to survive.</p>\n<p>The genes in the orthogonal system are copied with an extraordinarily error-prone DNA replication enzyme, which spurs rapid evolution by generating many random mutations. This goes on while <i>E. coli</i>’s genes are replicated by its normal high-fidelity DNA copying enzyme. The two enzymes work alongside each other, each doing their own thing but not interfering with the other’s genes.</p>\n<h2>Engineering rapid mutation</h2>\n<p>Such a cool idea, right? The scientists stole it from nature. Yeast already has a system like this, with a set of genes copied by a dedicated enzyme that doesn’t replicate the rest of the genome. But <i>E. coli </i>is much easier to work with than yeast, and its population can double in 20 minutes, so you can get a lot of rounds of replication and evolution done fast.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2001046#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2001046&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Diana Gitig","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"996e1b59baf5500de8c2ea21424af485441479acfcf942721ffd6d9a737fbcdb","category":"Tech"}
