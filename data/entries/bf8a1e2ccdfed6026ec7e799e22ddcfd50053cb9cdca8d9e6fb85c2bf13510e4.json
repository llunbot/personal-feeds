Its development was led by the automotive electronics supplier Elektrobit, and it's the first open source OS that complies with the automotive industry's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_Safety_Integrity_Level\">functional safety requirements</a>.</p>\n<p>One of the more interesting paradigm shifts underway in the automotive industry is the move to software-defined vehicles. Cars have increasingly been controlled by electronic systems during the past few decades, but it's been piecemeal. Each added new function, like traction control, antilock braking, or a screen instead of physical gauges, required its own little black box added to the wiring loom.</p>\n<p>There can now be more than 200 discrete controllers in a modern vehicle, all talking to each other through a CAN bus network. The idea behind the software-defined vehicle is to take a clean-sheet approach. Instead, you'll find a small number of domain controllers—what the automotive industry is choosing to call \"high performance compute\" platforms—<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/05/throw-out-all-those-black-boxes-and-say-hello-to-the-software-defined-car/\">each responsible for a different set of activities</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019282#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019282&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
