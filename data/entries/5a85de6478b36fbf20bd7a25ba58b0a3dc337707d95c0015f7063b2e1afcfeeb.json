{"title":"Apple Rumored to Launch 27-Inch Mini-LED iMac With ProMotion in Early 2022 [Updated]","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/19/apple-27-inch-xdr-display-early-2022-rumor/","date":1634701764000,"content":"Apple is planning to introduce a new 27-inch iMac in early 2022, according to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DSCCRoss/status/1450684151670009864\">Display Supply Chain Consultants CEO Ross Young</a>. This information comes from both Young's tweets and additional details that he shared with MacRumors.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/m1-imac-front.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nYoung told MacRumors that the 27-inch display for the iMac will feature mini-LED backlighting, which likely means that it will have XDR branding. Young tweeted that Apple is currently planning to release the new iMac <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DSCCRoss/status/1450662540002795526\">in the first quarter of 2022</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nYoung added that the 27-inch iMac display <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DSCCRoss/status/1450672633582735361\">will feature ProMotion</a>, allowing for an adaptive refresh rate between 24Hz and 120Hz. At the time this story was published, Young did not say what the display's resolution would be, but the current 27-inch iMac has 5K resolution.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has introduced a few other products with mini-LED displays, including the 12.9-inch iPad Pro earlier this year and the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro this week. Young expects Apple's recent leadership with mini-LEDs to continue with the new iMac.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhile he made an initial misstep with this rumor in stating it was for a standalone display rather than an iMac, Young has proven to be very accurate with display-related rumors, having accurately forecasted that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/26/ipad-mini-6-display-design-info/\">new iPad mini would feature an 8.3-inch display</a> and that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/12/macbook-pro-120hz-mini-led-display/\">new MacBook Pro models would feature ProMotion</a>. Young has 25 years of experience in the display industry and seems to be well connected with sources within the supply chain.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<b>Update 9:45 p.m.</b>: This article has been rewritten to reflect a correction issued by Young. While he initially stated the 27-inch mini-LED display was for an external monitor, he is now saying it is destined for an updated iMac. A monitor could come later.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ross-young/\">Ross Young</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac\">iMac (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91\">iMac</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/19/apple-27-inch-xdr-display-early-2022-rumor/\">Apple Rumored to Launch 27-Inch Mini-LED iMac With ProMotion in Early 2022 [Updated]</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-rumored-to-launch-27-inch-mini-led-imac-with-promotion-in-early-2022-updated.2318114/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=AQtbadmkkeM:6bbtXxviEnI:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=AQtbadmkkeM:6bbtXxviEnI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/AQtbadmkkeM\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5a85de6478b36fbf20bd7a25ba58b0a3dc337707d95c0015f7063b2e1afcfeeb","category":"Apple"}
