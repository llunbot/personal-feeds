{"title":"Who Needs to Shoot Photos in Low Light Anyway?","link":"https://twitter.com/reckless/status/1440309785295933447","date":1632322109000,"content":"\n<p>Nilay Patel, on Brian X. Chen’s iPhone 13 review for <s>Pravda</s> The New York Times:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The NYT does not believe regular people stand to benefit from\nbetter iPhone photos in the dark. I live for this review from\nanother planet every year.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I thought this was a really strange passage too. Quoting from <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/21/technology/personaltech/apple-iphone13-review.html\">Chen’s review</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>So in summary, the iPhone 13 cameras are slightly better than\nthose of last year’s iPhones. Even compared with iPhones from\nthree years ago, the cameras are much better only if you care\nabout taking nice photos in the dark.</p>\n\n<p>Just how important is night photography? I posed the question to\nJim Wilson, a longtime staff photographer for The New York Times,\nas he was taking pictures of the new iPhones for this review. He\nsaid it would be a crucial feature for people like him, but not as\nimportant for casual shooters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/benthompson/status/1440601049245491200\">Ben Thompson recalled</a> (as <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2019/09/you_could_always_just_use_flash\">I should have</a>, but did not) that this is something of a recurring theme. From <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/17/technology/personaltech/iphone-11-review.html\">Chen’s review of the iPhones 11 and 11 Pro two years ago</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Photos taken with the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro looked crisp and clear,\nand their colors were accurate. But after I finished these tests,\nI looked back at my archived photos taken with an iPhone X.</p>\n\n<p>Those pictures, especially the ones shot with portrait mode, still\nlooked impressive. Some of the low-light ones looked crummy in\ncomparison with the ones taken by the iPhone 11s, but I wouldn’t\nrecommend that you buy a new phone just to get better night\nphotos. You could always just use flash.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>“<em>You shouldn’t feel the need to buy a new iPhone every year</em>” is a fine sentiment, one that many, if not most, reviewers make each year. Arguing, repeatedly, that your readers should not be concerned at all about taking better photos in low light is bizarre. The single biggest change in consumer photography over the last 3–4 years is the exponential improvement in low light and night mode photography on new mobile phones.</p>\n\n<p>And again, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/21/chen-iphones-13\">as I mentioned yesterday</a>, Chen’s iPhone 13 review doesn’t even mention battery life, even though almost every other reviewer noted significant improvements across the lineup.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/22/review-from-another-planet\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"557817f9f3476097906a41278f0656cea401059f0255e8cb61188669ee45191f","category":"Tech"}
