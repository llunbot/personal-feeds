Like the metal-railed versions, Fizik creates a continuous loop at the back of the carbon rails, which they say offers better stability and enhances the Wingflex’s activity.</p><p>The X1 models come in about 43g lighter than the X3 (hollow ti Ki:um rails, $129) and X5 (Chromoly rails, $99). Claimed weights are 215g (150mm width) and 219g (160mm width). MSRP is $199.99, available now.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.fizik.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Fizik.com</em></a></p></section></article></div></div>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"bc231187b70681ac489503866c06ec79320c222e5e60c02ca43c0822e537c9c2","category":"Cycling"}
