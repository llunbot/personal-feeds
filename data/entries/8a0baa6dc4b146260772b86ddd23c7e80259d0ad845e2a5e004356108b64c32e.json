He also said that Apple ignored his request to not mention the planned \"Wolfs\" sequel in its press release regarding the movie switching to a limited, one-week theatrical release before becoming available to stream on Apple TV+.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple announced that a \"Wolfs\" sequel was planned <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2024/08/apple-original-films-sets-wolfs-sequel-in-advance-of-september-20-limited-theatrical-release-and-september-27-global-streaming-launch-of-new-feature-starring-and-produced-by-superstars-brad-pitt-and-george-clooney/\">in an August press release</a>. Apple's head of feature films Matt Dentler said the company was \"excited to see fans embrace the movie as we start working with Jon on the sequel.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHere is the full quote from Watts explaining why the sequel is off the table:<blockquote>\"I showed Apple my final cut of Wolfs early this year,\" Watts told Deadline. \"They were extremely enthusiastic about it and immediately commissioned me to start writing a sequel. But their last minute shift from a promised wide theatrical release to a streaming release was a total surprise and made without any explanation or discussion. I wasn't even told about it until less than a week before they announced it to the world. I was completely shocked and asked them to please not include the news that I was writing a sequel. They ignored my request and announced it in their press release anyway, seemingly to create a positive spin to their streaming pivot. And so I quietly returned the money they gave me for the sequel. I didn't want to talk about it because I was proud of the film and didn't want to generate any unnecessary negative press. I loved working with Brad and George (and Amy and Austin and Poorna and Zlatko) and would happily do it again. But the truth is that Apple didnâ€™t cancel the Wolfs sequel, I did, because I no longer trusted them as a creative partner.\"</blockquote>This drama might be enough for an Apple TV+ movie of its own!\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"Wolfs\" stars Brad Pitt and George Clooney as two professional \"fixers\" who are assigned to cover up a high-profile crime. The two \"lone wolves\" are forced to work together, despite not wanting to, and comedy ensues. The movie also stars Amy Ryan.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe movie debuted in select theaters on September 20, and on Apple TV+ a week later.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWatts is best known for directing the \"Spider-Man\" films within the Marvel Cinematic Universe.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/\">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/23/apple-tv-plus-wolfs-sequel-canceled/\">'Wolfs 2' Nixed at Apple TV+ Because Director 'No Longer Trusted' Apple</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/wolfs-2-nixed-at-apple-tv-because-director-no-longer-trusted-apple.2443825/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8a0baa6dc4b146260772b86ddd23c7e80259d0ad845e2a5e004356108b64c32e","category":"Apple"}
