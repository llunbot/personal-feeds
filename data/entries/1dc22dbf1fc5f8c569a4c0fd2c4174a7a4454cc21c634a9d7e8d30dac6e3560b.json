They even went back and forth with Shimano, then Campy, then SRAM for electrifying 10, 11 &amp; 12sp.

Replaceable batteries in each shifter, different rechargeable batteries in each derailleur that can be charged on or off the bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are also all-new 2-button fingertip shift controls, wider grip ergonomics, smaller compact crankset gearing that takes advantage of smaller cogs on their N3W freehub, new smaller 12-speed cassettes with 10T smallest cogs, a power meter-ready carbon crankset option, and even some upgraded brake pads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, there’s plenty of known and trusted Campy tech – modern angular aesthetics mixing Super Record and even Ekar heritage, tons of carbon, plenty of titanium, machined aluminum &amp; steel, ceramic bearings, the same 12-speed spacing you already have (even if Campy doesn’t suggest any mixing-and-matching), and some of the best-performing disc brakes on the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details: New Ergopower levers</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-lever-sahpe-and-type.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-lever-sahpe-and-type-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Campagnolo Super Record Wireless gruppo, electronic-shift hydraulic disc brake 12-speed road bike drivetrain, new levers\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-lever-sahpe-and-type-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-lever-sahpe-and-type-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-lever-sahpe-and-type-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-lever-sahpe-and-type-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-lever-sahpe-and-type-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-lever-sahpe-and-type-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-lever-sahpe-and-type.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s start with the shifters. Gone is the long-running thumb downshift lever and the ‘<em>One Lever, One Action</em>‘ ethos (<em>and Campy’s <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20230513050216/https://www.campagnolo.com/WW/en/Technologies/one_lever_one_action\" target=\"_blank\">technologies page</a> that explained why that was more intuitive to use</em>). Instead, you get 2 shift buttons behind the brake lever that look a bit like Di2-style, but with some extra spacing in between them and a different tactile finish on each to make it harder to accidentally hit the wrong lever.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-ergopower-controls-levers-scaled.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-ergopower-controls-levers-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Campagnolo Super Record Wireless gruppo, electronic-shift hydraulic disc brake 12-speed road bike drivetrain, new Ergopower levers\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-ergopower-controls-levers-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-ergopower-controls-levers-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-ergopower-controls-levers-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-ergopower-controls-levers-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-ergopower-controls-levers-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-ergopower-controls-levers-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-ergopower-controls-levers-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-ergopower-controls-levers-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new levers are said to be easy to adapt to, shifting the upper button with the tip of your index finger, and shifting the lower button with your middle finger. Campagnolo says they moved away from their classic inner thumb-shifter design to appeal to a broader pool of cyclists, some who had trouble operating the inner shift lever, especially those with smaller hands. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking both from the side profile and head-on, it’s clear that these new Ergopower hoods are both wider and larger volume than previous generations of Record &amp; Super Record. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_Egropower-controls-inside.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_Egropower-controls-inside-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Campagnolo Super Record Wireless gruppo, electronic-shift hydraulic disc brake 12-speed road bike drivetrain, new Ergopower levers inside\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_Egropower-controls-inside-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_Egropower-controls-inside-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_Egropower-controls-inside-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_Egropower-controls-inside-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_Egropower-controls-inside-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_Egropower-controls-inside-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_Egropower-controls-inside.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Presumably, that was a conscious decision to create a more comfortable place to rest your hands based on Campy’s first comments to us, since we’d expect electronics to take up less space inside than mechanical shift internals. But, compared to the EPS system – now Campagnolo Super Record Wireless levers have to pack processing power, communications hardware, and the replaceable CR2032 battery into the same same where there was just a switch before. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the insides of the new Ergopower levers, Campagnolo does add a bit more tech, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_inside-controls-close-up.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_inside-controls-close-up-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Campagnolo Super Record Wireless gruppo, electronic-shift hydraulic disc brake 12-speed road bike drivetrain, contro.l buttons\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_inside-controls-close-up-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_inside-controls-close-up-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_inside-controls-close-up-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_inside-controls-close-up-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_inside-controls-close-up-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_inside-controls-close-up.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Up top is a Mode button that is designed to be used during setup and diagnostics. Below is the Power or Wak-Up button that again has a mostly setup &amp; adjust function. But Campagnolo has mentioned that it is possible to customize at least one of these buttons on each shifter to control a connected Garmin GPS device. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We asked if it could be configured as a shift button to replicate classic Campy shift dynamics, but Campagnolo managed to not give a definitive answer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other dot there is a LED indicator that will flash red warning of low battery when there is &lt;15% charge remaining. Campagnolo says that in regular use, riders should get 1.5-2 years of battery life out of the non-rechargeable button-cell battery in each shifter.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>MyCampy in-app shift customization</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_MyCampy-in-app-customization.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_MyCampy-in-app-customization-800x427.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Campagnolo Super Record Wireless gruppo, electronic-shift hydraulic disc brake 12-speed road bike drivetrain, MyCampy in-app shift customization\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_MyCampy-in-app-customization-800x427.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_MyCampy-in-app-customization-297x158.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_MyCampy-in-app-customization-120x64.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_MyCampy-in-app-customization-768x410.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_MyCampy-in-app-customization.jpg 1500w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, one of the biggest benefits to electronic – and even more so, wireless – shifting is the ability to customize its controls. Campy didn’t share much about the new functionality of the updated MyCampy app other than to say that you can customize shift dynamics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Standard factory settings do use the idea of the right lever controlling the rear derailleur, the left lever controlling the front derailleur, top buttons to a harder gear, bottom buttons to an easier gear. But it is up to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A couple of screengrabs from Campagnolo’s Super Record Wireless presentation suggest some curious combinations. That one on the <em>right</em> looks like it might recreate the <em>One Lever, One Action</em> concept with the right levers making gears easier, and left levers harder? And the image on the left looks like it might be <em>Goblin Mode</em>, just push shifters and hope for the best. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>New battery-powered wireless derailleurs</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a

derailleur is much the same with a similar electronic motor up top and a removable battery on its front – no more wires.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An important note here is that both use different batteries, and both have a different mechanism to secure the battery in place. This was apparently a direct work around SRAM AXS patents.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_2-different-batteries-scaled.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_2-different-batteries-800x480.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Campagnolo Super Record Wireless gruppo, electronic-shift hydraulic disc brake 12-speed road bike drivetrain, differnt batteries\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_2-different-batteries-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_2-different-batteries-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_2-different-batteries-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_2-different-batteries-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_2-different-batteries-1536x921.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_2-different-batteries-2048x1229.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The big innovation here though, is that Campagnolo includes charging contacts for a magnetic USB-powered charger so you can either charge the batteries on the bike, or quickly pull them off and charge them on your desktop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quoted battery life for the derailleurs is &gt;750km for a race-level user, or more than 1000km for a regular cyclist. Recharge time is said to be super fast too, so something like a 75% recharge from flat in 30 mins.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>New compact crankset sizes</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_cranks-on-bike.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_cranks-on-bike-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Campagnolo Super Record Wireless gruppo, electronic-shift hydraulic disc brake 12-speed road bike drivetrain, cranks\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_cranks-on-bike-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_cranks-on-bike-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_cranks-on-bike-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_cranks-on-bike-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_cranks-on-bike-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_cranks-on-bike-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_cranks-on-bike.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Super Record Wireless crankset doesn’t look super new, but there’s plenty of new bits tucked inside what is essentially a cosmetic reshaping that combines the big ring reinforcement of the previous Super Record with a slightly flatter, more angular aesthetic inherited from Ekar.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_compact-crankset.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_compact-crankset-800x480.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Campagnolo Super Record Wireless gruppo, electronic-shift hydraulic disc brake 12-speed road bike drivetrain, crankset\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_compact-crankset-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_compact-crankset-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_compact-crankset-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_compact-crankset-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_compact-crankset-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_compact-crankset.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The big shift though ios to small rings. The cranks now are available with 50/34T new road, 48/32T new semi-compact, and 45/29T new compact gear ratios.

This one is now an all-new asymmetric 121/88mm BCD meaning only Campagnolo chainrings for the time being. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also of note even though we don’t have any official details or confirmation here… there’s a new flat spot on the back of each arm of this hollow carbon crankset. Campagnolo confirmed that there is not a powermeter in this crankset, and power is not a <em>current</em> option. But Campy are working on a power meter, and we’re pretty sure that’s where it is going to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>New smaller 12sp cassettes with 10T cog</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_10-29-or-10-25-cassettes-scaled.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_10-29-or-10-25-cassettes-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Campagnolo Super Record Wireless gruppo, electronic-shift hydraulic disc brake 12-speed road bike drivetrain, new cassette gearing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_10-29-or-10-25-cassettes-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_10-29-or-10-25-cassettes-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_10-29-or-10-25-cassettes-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_10-29-or-10-25-cassettes-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_10-29-or-10-25-cassettes-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_10-29-or-10-25-cassettes-2048x1536.jpg 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>10-29T (l) to 10-25T (r)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With new small chainrings comes new smaller gears. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>2023 Campagnolo Super Record Wireless gruppo, electronic-shift hydraulic disc brake 12-speed road bike drivetrain,</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-cassette-details.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"380\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-cassette-details-800x380.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Campagnolo Super Record Wireless gruppo, electronic-shift hydraulic disc brake 12-speed road bike drivetrain, new cassettes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-cassette-details-800x380.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-cassette-details-297x141.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-cassette-details-120x57.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-cassette-details-768x365.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-cassette-details-1536x730.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_new-cassette-details.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Carry-over chain &amp;

Campy has not yet clarified to us what that includes. It is lightweight, but essentially the same as the top Shimano Dura-Ace Di2 or SRAM Red AXS groups which have all coalesced around that same real 2.5kg weight target in their latest iterations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you ready to rethink Campy shifting? Wireless electronic shifting is only available at the Super Record level for now (<em>this year?</em>), but Campy effectively confirmed that they are working on bringing wireless electronic shifting to other groupsets, as well – an important shift from the previous generation of EPS that abandoned electronic shifting at Record &amp; Chorus levels. Fingers crossed that Ekar Wireless will be next!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2023 Campagnolo Super Record Wireless – Pricing &amp; Availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_riding.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_riding-800x480.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Campagnolo Super Record Wireless gruppo, electronic-shift hydraulic disc brake 12-speed road bike drivetrain, riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_riding-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_riding-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_riding-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_riding-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_riding-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-electronic-12-speed-road-bike-drivetrain_riding.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Officially the new 2023 Campagnolo Super Record Wireless gruppo goes on sale today for 5200€ for a complete 2×12 wireless-shift, hydraulic sic brake groupset with your choice of gearing. Campagnolo assures us that the new Super Record Wireless group is actually available starting today, and there will likely be a number of complete bike from brands including Canyon, Pinarello, Specialized, Wilier, and more that are available to order starting today. But beyond the high pricetag of the new group which will likely limit the number of people who can afford a new Super Record Wireless setup, Campy says the new groupset will be available in relatively limited numbers as production ramps up fully to meet demand. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://campagnolo.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Campagnolo.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2023-campagnolo-super-record-wireless-road-bike-groupset/\">Campagnolo Super Record Wireless Reshifts Compact Racing Gears in Carbon 2×12 Gruppo</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"1dc22dbf1fc5f8c569a4c0fd2c4174a7a4454cc21c634a9d7e8d30dac6e3560b","category":"Cycling"}
