The problems occur after installing iOS 18.5, which Apple <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2656294/ios-18-5-features-release-date-how-to-install.html\">released</a> about three weeks ago. Users report having the screen go blank, slow and laggy scrolling, an inability to load messages, crashes, and other problems. Macworld has experienced the problems firsthand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The temporary fix seems to be a restart of the iPhone, but the problem recurs after a period of time. Some users on Reddit had to resort to a forced restart of the iPhone, the procedure for which differs if you have <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/116940?iphone-authentication-type=iphone-with-face-id\">Face ID </a>or <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/116940?iphone-authentication-type=iphone-with-home-button\">Touch ID</a>. Here at Macworld, we can confirm that it is an issue an at least one of our phones and restarts have fixed the issue. However, after a day or so it crops up again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has not commented on the issue, nor has the company issued a new beta update after the official release of iOS 18.5, which would presumably include a fix. Apple has released iOS updates before without entering a beta cycle, usually for security fixes and emergency bug fixes. We haven’t heard anything about a potention iOS 18.5.1, but with WWDC beginning Monday, it’s likely that it would be at least another week before it gets fixed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is possible to downgrade from the iOS 18.5 update, but the procedure isn’t easy. It involves attaching the iPhone to a Mac, downloading the proper IPSW file, and doing an installation. It’s a drastic action to take, but you may want to consider it if Mail is vital to your communications. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2020596/downgrade-iphone-older-version-ios.html\">Learn more about downgrading an iOS installation</a>.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"4e163b003773a7f6b10b0179c7bdc54e7b6088c9017209c19253b175de43bf04","category":"Apple"}
