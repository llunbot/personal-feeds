Held on the roads around a lake in Albert Park, the track is one of F1's trickier challenges, made more so on Sunday thanks to rain that eased off before the start of the race, only to return with a vengeance a dozen or so laps before the end. It proved to be a tough day for four of the sport's six new drivers, as well as some more well-known names, and it gave us a clearer idea of the pecking order between the teams, at least for now.</p>\n<p>True F1 junkies were probably following the preseason test earlier this month in Bahrain, as the sport now helpfully shows those three days of running on its streaming platform. But those devoted enough to watch the cars circulate for hours with nothing on the line also know you shouldn't read too much into a preseason test, especially one held at a circuit that is unrepresentative of most of the others that F1 visitsâ€”and in unseasonably cold weather, to boot.</p>\n<p>Little has changed in the way of the technical regulations between the end of last year and the start of this one, other than an increasing scrutiny on the front and rear wings' ability to flex when they're not supposed to. Flexing or deflecting under load at opportune times reduces the drag and allows a car to go a little faster in a straight line for the same amount of power, giving that car an unfair advantage.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/a-tough-race-for-the-rookies-as-f1-starts-2025-in-australia/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/a-tough-race-for-the-rookies-as-f1-starts-2025-in-australia/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
