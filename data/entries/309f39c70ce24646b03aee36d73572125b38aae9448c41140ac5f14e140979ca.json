Just how many millions, the company isn't saying.</p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://apps.web.maine.gov/online/aeviewer/ME/40/3778e1fc-2ed5-461d-9cc5-df15c07f687c.shtml\">mandatory filing</a> with the Maine Attorney General’s office, the telecommunications company said 51.2 million account holders were affected. On its corporate website, AT&amp;T put the number at <a href=\"https://www.att.com/support/article/my-account/000101995\">73 million</a>. In either event, compromised data included one or more of the following: full names, email addresses, mailing addresses, phone numbers, social security numbers, dates of birth, AT&amp;T account numbers, and AT&amp;T passcodes. Personal financial information and call history didn’t appear to be included, AT&amp;T said, and data appeared to be from June 2019 or earlier.</p>\n<p>The disclosure on the AT&amp;T site said the 73 million affected customers comprised 7.6 million current customers and 65.4 million former customers. The notification said AT&amp;T has reset the account PINs of all current customers and is notifying current and former customers by mail. AT&amp;T representatives haven’t explained why the letter filed with the Maine AG lists 51.2 million affected and the disclosure on its site lists 73 million.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016342#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016342&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"309f39c70ce24646b03aee36d73572125b38aae9448c41140ac5f14e140979ca","category":"Tech"}
