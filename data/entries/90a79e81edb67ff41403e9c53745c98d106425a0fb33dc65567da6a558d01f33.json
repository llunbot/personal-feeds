Relax, it's iPhone 14 Plus.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn the second ad, \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9ZHIMZUimk\">Crash Test,</a>\" a car crash test takes place in a hangar, to the tune of \"You Can't Hurt Me No More\" by Gene Chandler. The collision occurs in slow motion and tracks a crash test dummy, until the vehicle comes to a rest. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nMounted on the dash is an iPhone 14 Pro with a display that reads \"It looks like you've been in a crash.\" Then the tagline reads: \"Crash Detection can sense a severe car crash and automatically call 911. Relax, it's iPhone 14 Pro.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAt this point, customers interested in purchasing a new iPhoneâ€Œ should consider waiting for the iPhone 15 series, which is expected to launch in September. Various changes are expected for the next iPhones, including Dynamic Island for all models, USB-C instead of Lightning, and a Periscope lens for at least one of the Pro models.
