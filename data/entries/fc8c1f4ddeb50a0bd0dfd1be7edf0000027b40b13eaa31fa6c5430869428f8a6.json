In more detail, the permissions are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tabs: manage and interact with browser windows</li>\n<li>Cookies: set and access stored browser cookies based on cookie or domain names (ex., \"Authorization\" or \"all cookies for GitHub.com\")</li>\n<li>WebRequest: intercept and modify web requests the browser makes</li>\n<li>Storage: ability to store small amounts of information persistently in the browser (these extensions store their command &amp; control configuration here)</li>\n<li>Scripting: the ability to inject new JavaScript into webpages and manipulate the DOM</li>\n<li>Alarms: an internal messaging service to trigger events. The extension uses this to trigger events like a cron job, as it can allow for scheduling the heartbeat callbacks by the extension</li>\n<li>:: This works in tandem with other permissions like webRequest, but allows for the extension to functionally interact with all browsing activity (completely unnecessary for an extension that should just look at your installed extensions)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These sorts of permissions give extensions the ability to do all sorts of potentially abusive things and, as such, should be judiciously granted only to trusted extensions that canâ€™t perform core functions without them.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/04/researcher-uncovers-dozens-of-sketchy-chrome-extensions-with-4-million-installs/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/04/researcher-uncovers-dozens-of-sketchy-chrome-extensions-with-4-million-installs/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fc8c1f4ddeb50a0bd0dfd1be7edf0000027b40b13eaa31fa6c5430869428f8a6","category":"Tech"}
