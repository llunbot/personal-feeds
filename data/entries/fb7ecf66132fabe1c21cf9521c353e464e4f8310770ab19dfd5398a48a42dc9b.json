{"title":"Full Wheel of Time trailer has monsters, magic, and a virtual 3D gimmick","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1808159","date":1635362458000,"content":"<div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<div><div></div><p>The new trailer for Amazon's <em>Wheel of Time</em> offers “a first-of-its-kind immersive experience that allows fans to view the traditional 2D trailer in a virtual three-dimensional ‘wheel.'\" </p></div>\n<p>It's been a long wait, but we finally have the full official trailer for <em>Wheel of Time</em>, Amazon's highly anticipated adaptation of the late <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Jordan\">Robert Jordan</a>'s bestselling (and much beloved) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time\">14-book series</a> of epic fantasy novels. It's a doozy, chock-full of monsters battling magic-wielding warriors set to appropriately dramatic music and an ominous voiceover by star Rosamund Pike, who plays the central character, Moraine.</p>\n<p>The only downside is that the streaming platform has decided to be a bit too clever for its own good. On YouTube, fans can view the trailer in the traditional 2D manner or in a virtual three-dimensional \"wheel.\" That's thanks to YouTube’s “360 Experience” immersive capabilities, which, for example, let viewers see two sides of the same fight. And clicking on an arrow in the upper left-hand corner will bring you enhanced imagery of the action. As Amazon described it in a press release:</p>\n<blockquote><p>To the left of the screen, [viewers will] discover Moiraine’s powerful ‘One Power’ channeling—featuring her voice and faces, artifacts, and symbols hidden amongst the energy weaves. On the right, the corruption of the Dark One represents a dissention [sic] into madness. The trailer also features spatial audio that gives fans a more immersive experience as objects appear from either side of the ‘wheel.’</p></blockquote>\n<p>I get that all this is meant to be a bonus, and there are probably fans who will appreciate it. But most of the <em>Wheel of Time</em> fans here at Ars found the gimmick annoying. We're still pumped to watch the series, though.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1808159#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1808159&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fb7ecf66132fabe1c21cf9521c353e464e4f8310770ab19dfd5398a48a42dc9b","category":"Tech"}
