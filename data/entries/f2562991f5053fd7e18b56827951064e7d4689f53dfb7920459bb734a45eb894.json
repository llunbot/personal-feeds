If by ‘good things’ you mean incredible e-mountain bikes, then waiting for the new Specialized Turbo Levo SL Gen 2 is definitely worth it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/first-look-all-new-specialized-turbo-levo-sl-shreds-with-a-seriously-nimble-lightweight-emtb/\" target=\"_blank\"> original Turbo Levo SL </a>was introduced back in 2020, and a lot has changed since then. The e-bike industry is still trying to figure out the sweet spot between power, torque, and range – but now the loudness of the motor is a factor as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take all of that into consideration, and you have the all-new Specialized Turbo Levo SL Gen 2. <em>Technically</em>, this is almost Gen 3 as Specialized had this frame ready to go last year.

Lear Miller / Specialized</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And it’s the motor that makes a big difference here compared to the original Turbo Levo SL. Notably, the new motor is <em>entirely</em> different. Specialized claims that not a single bolt was reused from the 1.1 to make the 1.2. They also managed to increase both power and torque without changing the motor size or weight. The Specialized e-Bike team obsessed over every detail on the new motor – right down to the finish on the casing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-2020-specialized-levo-sl-emtb-powers-up-big-days-on-big-trails/\" target=\"_blank\">Levo SL Gen 1 </a>had a Specialized SL 1.1 motor with a fairly meager 240W of power and just 35Nm of torque. Listening to feedback from test riders and customers, Specialized determined the bike needed more power. The new 320w motor provides 33% more power to be specific. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It gets an even bigger bump in torque moving from 35Nm to 50Nm, for a 43% increase. Specialized managed this without much of an impact on the range in spite of using the same SL1-320Wh internal battery. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on your feeling on e-bikes, one of the biggest improvements may be in the sound of the system itself. The Turbo Levo system is all about  “you, only faster,” but a whiny e-bike motor is a dead giveaway that it’s more than just you pedaling. Thanks to an updated gearbox design and a new two-piece motor housing with an integrated honeycomb structure, the new motor is quieter. A <em>lot</em> quieter. Specialized claims a 34-45% reduction of noise compared to the SL 1.1 motor. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Turbo Levo SL Battery Range</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Levo-SL-ebike-eMTB-Lear-Miller-Photo9.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Levo-SL-ebike-eMTB-Lear-Miller-Photo9-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"Specialized Turbo Levo SL ebike charging port\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Levo-SL-ebike-eMTB-Lear-Miller-Photo9-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Levo-SL-ebike-eMTB-Lear-Miller-Photo9-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Levo-SL-ebike-eMTB-Lear-Miller-Photo9-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Levo-SL-ebike-eMTB-Lear-Miller-Photo9-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Levo-SL-ebike-eMTB-Lear-Miller-Photo9-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Levo-SL-ebike-eMTB-Lear-Miller-Photo9-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Levo-SL-ebike-eMTB-Lear-Miller-Photo9.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Levo-SL-ebike-eMTB-Lear-Miller-Photo2.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Levo-SL-ebike-eMTB-Lear-Miller-Photo2-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"Specialized Turbo Levo SL ebike range extender\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Levo-SL-ebike-eMTB-Lear-Miller-Photo2-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Levo-SL-ebike-eMTB-Lear-Miller-Photo2-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Levo-SL-ebike-eMTB-Lear-Miller-Photo2-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Levo-SL-ebike-eMTB-Lear-Miller-Photo2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Levo-SL-ebike-eMTB-Lear-Miller-Photo2-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Levo-SL-ebike-eMTB-Lear-Miller-Photo2-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Levo-SL-ebike-eMTB-Lear-Miller-Photo2.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>BATTERY</strong></td><td><strong>ECO (35/35)*</strong></td><td><strong>TRAIL (75/80)*</strong></td><td><strong>TURBO (100/80)*</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Internal (320 wh)</strong></td><td>2000 – 2300m (climbed), <br /><br /><br />45 -55km (Total distance), 3:30 – 4:30h (ride time)</td><td>800 – 900m, 20 – 30km, 1:30 – 2:00 h</td><td>750 – 850m, 20 – 25km, 1:15 – 1:30 h</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Internal + Range Extender<br />(480 wh)</strong></td><td>3000 – 3450m, 70 – 85km, 5:15 – 7:00 h</td><td>1200 – 1350m, 30 – 45km, 2:15 – 3:00 h</td><td>1100 – 1300m, 30 – 38km, 1:45 – 2:15 h</td></tr></tbody></table><figcaption> <p>* Motor support/peak power in %, default values, customaizable in Mission Control App</p>   <p>Based on 15 mph/ 25kph max. motor assist speed.

Even though this is considered a lightweight e-bike, it still has an impressive range that can be increased if you add the 160Wh Range Extender external battery. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Out of the box, the new Levo SL will be set with a default mode with 80% of peak power in Turbo mode which is said to optimize easy climbing and extend battery life. If you want 100% peak power though, it’s easy to adjust using either the onboard MicroTune setting, the Mission Control App, or you can ask a retailer to do it for you in the shop using their Turbo Studio program. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-03-at-6.51.50-PM.png\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"593\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-03-at-6.51.50-PM-800x593.png\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-03-at-6.51.50-PM-800x593.png 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-03-at-6.51.50-PM-297x220.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-03-at-6.51.50-PM-120x89.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-03-at-6.51.50-PM-768x569.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-03-at-6.51.50-PM-1536x1138.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot-2023-05-03-at-6.51.50-PM.png 1961w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Factor in changes that you can make using the Specialized Mission Control App, and you can squeeze every last drop of range out of the battery to make sure you still get home with some juice.

Just about everything is new with FACT 11M carbon used for all models. With the Gen 2 Levo SL, Specialized is moving away from their Sidearm frame design relying on advanced FEA and Machine Learning to come up with the final design and layup schedule for the new frames. Like previous bikes though, it still relies on their Rider-First Engineered design process which results in similar ride qualities across frame sizes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only is the frame different, but the wheel sizes are different as well. Levo SL Gen 1 was 29/29 only, whereas Gen 2 moves to mixed wheel sizes with a 29″ up front and 27.5″ out back. This is not something Specialized took lightly, stating that they went back and forth multiple times, eventually settling on the mixed wheel size as the most fun configuration of the bike. However, if you want to run 29/29 you still can by taking advantage of the flip chip at the chainstay. Note that if you do want to run 29″ wheels front and back, only the chainstay and wheelbase numbers will change – all the other geometry figures remain the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Adjustable Geometry</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Levo-SL-ebike-eMTB-Lear-Miller-Photo17.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Levo-SL-ebike-eMTB-Lear-Miller-Photo17-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"Specialized Turbo Levo SL ebike dropout chip\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Levo-SL-ebike-eMTB-Lear-Miller-Photo17-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Levo-SL-ebike-eMTB-Lear-Miller-Photo17-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Levo-SL-ebike-eMTB-Lear-Miller-Photo17-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Levo-SL-ebike-eMTB-Lear-Miller-Photo17-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Levo-SL-ebike-eMTB-Lear-Miller-Photo17-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Levo-SL-ebike-eMTB-Lear-Miller-Photo17-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Levo-SL-ebike-eMTB-Lear-Miller-Photo17.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Levo-SL-ebike-eMTB-Lear-Miller-Photo11.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Levo-SL-ebike-eMTB-Lear-Miller-Photo11-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"Specialized Turbo Levo SL ebike rear brake\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Levo-SL-ebike-eMTB-Lear-Miller-Photo11-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Levo-SL-ebike-eMTB-Lear-Miller-Photo11-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Levo-SL-ebike-eMTB-Lear-Miller-Photo11-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Levo-SL-ebike-eMTB-Lear-Miller-Photo11-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Levo-SL-ebike-eMTB-Lear-Miller-Photo11-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Levo-SL-ebike-eMTB-Lear-Miller-Photo11-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Levo-SL-ebike-eMTB-Lear-Miller-Photo11.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Levo-SL-ebike-eMTB-Lear-Miller-Photo5.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Levo-SL-ebike-eMTB-Lear-Miller-Photo5-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"Specialized Turbo Levo SL ebike linkage\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Levo-SL-ebike-eMTB-Lear-Miller-Photo5-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Levo-SL-ebike-eMTB-Lear-Miller-Photo5-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Levo-SL-ebike-eMTB-Lear-Miller-Photo5-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Levo-SL-ebike-eMTB-Lear-Miller-Photo5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Levo-SL-ebike-eMTB-Lear-Miller-Photo5-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Levo-SL-ebike-eMTB-Lear-Miller-Photo5-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Levo-SL-ebike-eMTB-Lear-Miller-Photo5.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Further adjustment is offered at the shock extension with two positions that raise or lower the bottom bracket height by about 6mm.

The effective geometry is very similar to the excellent Stumpjumper EVO, for good reason – the EVO is incredibly fun to ride and is quite versatile. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of sizing, the Gen 2 is also different in that it moves to the Specialized S-Sizing system. Instead of the typical S-XL sizing, the S-1 through S-6 frame sizing is meant to allow the rider to pick the frame they’re most comfortable on for their riding style. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the exception of the S1, all of the Levo SL Gen 2 frames offer 150mm of rear travel paired with a 160mm travel suspension fork. In order to decrease standover height, the smallest S1 size runs 144mm of rear travel with a 150mm travel suspension fork. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the Levo Gen 2 SL, Specialized set out to create the “Ultimate Trail Bike”. To them, that means creating a bike that can do everything from flow trail laps, to big days in the alpine, or sending it down chunky terrain. To make a bike that is as fun as it is capable, the suspension leverage curve has been reworked to be flatter with more support off the top. That keeps the bike playful, but a more rearward axle path keeps the bike stable when plowing through rough sections of trail. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How Much Does Levo SL Gen 2 Weigh?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Specialized-Levo-SL-ebike-eMTB-Lear-Miller-Photo20.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\"

for nothing. Specialized claims you’ll find models that can be as light as 17.71kg (39.04lbs) – without any silly components. That’s a big part of the overall Levo SL package. This has to be a <em>capable</em> bike, so skimping on parts just to save weight is not an option. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of that, you’ll find spec like SRAM Code 4-piston brakes with 200mm rotors, Roval Traverse wheels, Fox 36 suspension forks and Float X rear shocks, and even room for 34.9mm dropper posts. Of course, higher end builds get the new SRAM Eagle Tranmission drivetrain too, with all models including a SRAM UDH.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You <em>could</em> make these bikes lighter. But Specialized thinks the build spec chosen will result in the most fun ride possible, without weighing you down. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Models, Pricing, and Availability</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially, there will be four levels of Levo SL Gen 2 complete builds, along with an S-Works frameset option. That starts with the Comp Carbon, then Pro, S-Works, and a crazy $16,000 S-Works LTD build. Notably, the UK will not get the S-Works LTD model or the Frameset option. Here in the United States, all of the models will be offered at launch with the exception of the Pro model, which will be “avaialble later.” </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Levo SL S-Works LTD – $16,000</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/96822-02_LEVO-SL-SW-LTD-BLK-CARB-SMK_D4-STTT-Large.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/96822-02_LEVO-SL-SW-LTD-BLK-CARB-SMK_D4-STTT-Large-800x534.jpeg\" alt=\"Specialized Levo SL S works LT flight attendant\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/96822-02_LEVO-SL-SW-LTD-BLK-CARB-SMK_D4-STTT-Large-800x534.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/96822-02_LEVO-SL-SW-LTD-BLK-CARB-SMK_D4-STTT-Large-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/96822-02_LEVO-SL-SW-LTD-BLK-CARB-SMK_D4-STTT-Large-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/96822-02_LEVO-SL-SW-LTD-BLK-CARB-SMK_D4-STTT-Large-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/96822-02_LEVO-SL-SW-LTD-BLK-CARB-SMK_D4-STTT-Large-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/96822-02_LEVO-SL-SW-LTD-BLK-CARB-SMK_D4-STTT-Large.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/96822-02_LEVO-SL-SW-LTD-BLK-CARB-SMK_D2-BAR-Large.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/96822-02_LEVO-SL-SW-LTD-BLK-CARB-SMK_D2-BAR-Large-800x534.jpeg\" alt=\"Specialized Levo SL flight attendant LTD\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/96822-02_LEVO-SL-SW-LTD-BLK-CARB-SMK_D2-BAR-Large-800x534.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/96822-02_LEVO-SL-SW-LTD-BLK-CARB-SMK_D2-BAR-Large-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/96822-02_LEVO-SL-SW-LTD-BLK-CARB-SMK_D2-BAR-Large-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/96822-02_LEVO-SL-SW-LTD-BLK-CARB-SMK_D2-BAR-Large-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/96822-02_LEVO-SL-SW-LTD-BLK-CARB-SMK_D2-BAR-Large-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/96822-02_LEVO-SL-SW-LTD-BLK-CARB-SMK_D2-BAR-Large.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/96822-02_LEVO-SL-SW-LTD-BLK-CARB-SMK_HERO-Large.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"452\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/96822-02_LEVO-SL-SW-LTD-BLK-CARB-SMK_HERO-Large-800x452.jpeg\" alt=\"Specialized Levo SL S Works LTD\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/96822-02_LEVO-SL-SW-LTD-BLK-CARB-SMK_HERO-Large-800x452.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/96822-02_LEVO-SL-SW-LTD-BLK-CARB-SMK_HERO-Large-297x168.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/96822-02_LEVO-SL-SW-LTD-BLK-CARB-SMK_HERO-Large-120x68.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/96822-02_LEVO-SL-SW-LTD-BLK-CARB-SMK_HERO-Large-768x434.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/96822-02_LEVO-SL-SW-LTD-BLK-CARB-SMK_HERO-Large-400x225.jpeg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/96822-02_LEVO-SL-SW-LTD-BLK-CARB-SMK_HERO-Large.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s no question when you look at that price tag, the S-Works LTD is the top of the range. It gets a special Black Carbon/Smoke finish, plus matching graphics on the Rock Shox Ultimate Flight Attendant electronically controlled suspension package. Specialized points out that they worked with RockShox on this build so you don’t have the use the standard pedal sensor for Flight Attendant. Instead, it relies on the cadence sensor built into the bike’s motor.

At $8,000 it’s still a very expensive ride, but you should be able to get out the door for under $10k – even if you need some new accessories as well. To get the price down to that level, the bike forgoes SRAM Transmission, instead opting for the SRAM GX Eagle 1×12 drivetrain. You’ll also find Code RS 4 piston brakes, the move to aluminum Specialized wheels instead of carbon, and Fox Performance series suspension. There’s also a slight change to the frame with an alloy shox extension instead of the carbon extension on the other models. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Turbo Levo SL Frameset – $8,000</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/76823-00_LEVO-SL-SW-CARBON-FRMSET-BRSH-BLKLQDMET-BLKCP_RDSQ-Large.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"594\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/76823-00_LEVO-SL-SW-CARBON-FRMSET-BRSH-BLKLQDMET-BLKCP_RDSQ-Large-800x594.jpeg\" alt=\"Specialized Levo SL frameset\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/76823-00_LEVO-SL-SW-CARBON-FRMSET-BRSH-BLKLQDMET-BLKCP_RDSQ-Large-800x594.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/76823-00_LEVO-SL-SW-CARBON-FRMSET-BRSH-BLKLQDMET-BLKCP_RDSQ-Large-297x221.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/76823-00_LEVO-SL-SW-CARBON-FRMSET-BRSH-BLKLQDMET-BLKCP_RDSQ-Large-120x89.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/76823-00_LEVO-SL-SW-CARBON-FRMSET-BRSH-BLKLQDMET-BLKCP_RDSQ-Large-768x571.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/76823-00_LEVO-SL-SW-CARBON-FRMSET-BRSH-BLKLQDMET-BLKCP_RDSQ-Large.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you just have to build up your bike yourself, the S-Works level bike will be available as a frameset. Now framesets are a little different in the e-bike world, so that price includes the S-Works frame with the carbon shock extension, a Fox Float X Factory rear shock, SRAM carbon crankset with 32t chainring, a seat post binder (38.6 to fit the bigger not-included 34.9mm seat posts), the 1.2 motor with remote, 320Wh battery, charger, and wiring harness. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the exception of the Pro Model in the U.S., all of these should be available at launch.
