Despite the best efforts of a handful of chasers, the pair held on out front into the final lap, where Vos hit the deck in the muddy conditions, leaving Brand to solo to the win.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 32-year-old Dutchwoman would cross the line seconds ahead of Betsema with Honsinger 16 seconds back. Vos would settle for fourth after heading to the pits for a new bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After finishing second behind Vos at the Waterloo round of the World Cup series this past weekend, Brand now leads the series, which she won last year.</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/10/world-champ-lucinda-brand-powers-to-fayetteville-world-cup-victory/\">Read More</a>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"eae791a710eb8740df174bfb443292aebbe3b6af58e354b97d0cb12e9d54ec61","category":"Cycling"}
