Great copy engages your readers, builds connections, turns readers into consumers and consumers into brand evangelists. Of course, this all means a fatter bottom line, which makes you the most popular person in the room!</p>\n<p>If you’re ready to acquire near-mystical powers of persuasion, check out these useful resources and tools that are bound to help strengthen your copywriting skills.</p>\nBrush Up On Your Language Skills\n<p>I’d like to introduce this section with a small proviso. Great grammar does not equal great copywriting. Copywriting is a unique animal, different from academic, journalistic or literary writing. Copywriting is about human psychology, consumer behaviour and applying tried and tested methodologies. It’s not about beautiful words, and I know many great writers who make poor copywriters and vice versa.</p>\n<p>That said, <strong>language mistakes matter</strong> if they get in the way of comprehension. So it’s worth brushing up on those language skills to avoid errors that will derail your message.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wikihow.com/Use-English-Punctuation-Correctly\">Use English Punctuation Correctly</a><br />An easy-to-follow crash course in English punctuation, starting with the basics.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.quickanddirtytips.com/grammar-girl/\">Grammar Girl</a><br />A welcome break from dull and dry grammar guides.

But the most common challenge budding copywriters tell me about is writing concisely. This is partly because of some very unhelpful lessons we learnt at school.</p>\n<p>So I’m going to ask you to forget all those long words and stop writing winding sentences.
