(credit: Analogue)</p>  </figure>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Analogue has released multiple variations of the Analogue Pocket, its Game Boy-style handheld console that can play old cartridges and game ROMs using its FPGA chip. But until now, all of those designs have been riffs on the regular Pocket’s black (or white) plastic shell.</p>\n<p>The company’s latest Pocket iteration might appeal more to people who prefer the solidity and durability of anodized aluminum to the cheap practicality of plastic. <a href=\"https://x.com/analogue/status/1811777618447888740\">On July 15</a>, the company will release <a href=\"https://www.analogue.co/editions/pocket-aluminum\">a limited run of all-aluminum Analogue Pocket consoles</a> in four different colors: white, gray, black, and a Game Boy Advance-esque indigo. The company says that \"every single piece\" of these consoles is \"entirely CNC'd from aluminum,\" including not just the frame but also all of the buttons.</p>\n<p>The new material will cost you, though: Each aluminum Pocket sells for $500, over twice as much as the $220 price of a regular plastic Pocket.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036791#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2036791&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"794bf452fded873de677bddb3e3f4e617f1e498f4d7c4684f0f0401ced044e13","category":"Tech"}
