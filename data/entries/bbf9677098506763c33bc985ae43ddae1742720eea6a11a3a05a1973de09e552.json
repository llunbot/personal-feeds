This is the way to compensate for this,” said Grace Loke, a food scientist at the RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia.</p>\n<p>Loke’s team did a study to take a closer look at those anecdotal reports and test if our perception of flavor really changes in an ISS-like environment. It likely does, but only some flavors are affected.</p>\n<h2>Tasting with all senses</h2>\n<p>“There are many environmental factors that could contribute to how we perceive taste, from the size of the area to the color and intensity of the lighting, the volume and type of sounds present, the way our surroundings smell, down to even the size and shape of our cutlery. Many other studies covered each of these factors in some way or another,” said Loke.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039520#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039520&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jacek Krywko","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bbf9677098506763c33bc985ae43ddae1742720eea6a11a3a05a1973de09e552","category":"Tech"}
