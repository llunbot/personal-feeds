In a world of aero-influenced bike design where almost every new bike looks like the next, this Lapierre Crosshill CF stands out with its uniquely curved and shaped rear end.

I suspect that the design of the new Lapierre Crosshill CF carbon gravel bike will have both lovers and haters.

But Amber Kraak raced the new Lapierre Crosshill to a podium spot at the <a href=\"https://www.knwu.nl/nieuws/uitslagen-en-terugblik-nks-gravel-en-mountainbike\" target=\"_blank\">Dutch Gravel Champs</a> a week ago, then a solid 18th place at Gravel Worlds this past weekend. Think about it this way, while almost every other rider was on an aero bike with relatively skinny tires, Kraak was riding a bike with a suspension fork, high-volume tires, and a dropper seatpost. So it still seems to deliver on the performance front, too.

Since 2016, it was their first official gravel bike, but still more of an affordable all-rounder with trekking &amp; commuter roots. If you wanted something lighter and faster, their only option was the carbon Pulsium Allroad with just 32mm tires (and several mms to spare) but not even the SAT elastomer they introduced on the Pulsiums for added comfort &amp; endurance <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/roubaix-tech-lapierre-pulsium-slips-in-new-elastomer-enhanced-endurance-race-bike-for-the-pave/\" target=\"_blank\">back in 2017</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now with gravel racing getting rougher and more technical, Lapierre took a page out of their mountain bike development to create a more comfortable carbon gravel race bike that still delivered race-ready performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s new?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Lapierre-Crosshill-CF-comfort-carbon-gravel-bike_double-S-bend-flexstays-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Lapierre-Crosshill-CF-comfort-carbon-gravel-bike_double-S-bend-flexstays-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Lapierre Crosshill CF carbon gravel bike, flex stays detail with removable seatstay bridge\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Lapierre-Crosshill-CF-comfort-carbon-gravel-bike_double-S-bend-flexstays-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Lapierre-Crosshill-CF-comfort-carbon-gravel-bike_double-S-bend-flexstays-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Lapierre-Crosshill-CF-comfort-carbon-gravel-bike_double-S-bend-flexstays-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Lapierre-Crosshill-CF-comfort-carbon-gravel-bike_double-S-bend-flexstays-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2025-Lapierre-Crosshill-CF-comfort-carbon-gravel-bike_double-S-bend-flexstays-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Directly inspired now by their latest ProRace CF carbon XC hardtail, the new carbon gravel Crosshill CF features the same 3D Tubular rear triangle concept.
