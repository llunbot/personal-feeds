It's an interesting challenge because there are so many ways of doing it and because people have spent a lot of time figuring out how to do this sorting as efficiently as possible.</p>\n<p>Sorting is so basic that algorithms are built into most standard libraries for programming languages. And, in the case of the C++ library used with the LLVM compiler, the code hasn't been touched in over a decade.</p>\n<p>But Google's DeepMind AI group has now developed a reinforcement learning tool that can develop extremely optimized algorithms without first being trained on human code examples. The trick was to set it up to treat programming as a game.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1946264#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1946264&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"77faffb887137aa56deec6816c1bff8a8edb15ded4633be82adfe00af990befb","category":"Tech"}
