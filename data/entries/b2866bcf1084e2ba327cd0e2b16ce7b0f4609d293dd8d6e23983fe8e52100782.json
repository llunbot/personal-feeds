Building on that critique, I would now like to go further, proposing specifications for developing a robust privacy protection regime in the US.</p>\n<p>Writers must overcome several hurdles to have a chance at persuading readers about possible flaws in the GDPR. First, some readers are skeptical of any piece criticizing the GDPR because they believe the law is still too young to evaluate. Second, some are suspicious of any piece criticizing the GDPR because they suspect that the authors might be covert supporters of Big Tech’s anti-GDPR agenda. (I can assure readers that I am not, nor have I ever, worked to support any agenda of Big Tech companies.)</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053275#p3\">Read 41 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053275&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b2866bcf1084e2ba327cd0e2b16ce7b0f4609d293dd8d6e23983fe8e52100782","category":"Tech"}
