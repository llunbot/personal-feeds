He said a \"sub-$100 price\" would be the \"sweet spot\" for the Apple TV, but exact pricing for the next model remains to be seen.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBoth the 2010 and 2012 versions of the Apple TV were priced at $99 in the U.S. at launch, and Apple eventually lowered the price of the 2012 model to $69, so there is precedent for a sub-$100 Apple TV that would better compete with lower-priced streaming devices like the Google TV Streamer, which costs $99.99. Amazon and Roku have even cheaper streaming stick options starting as low as $24.99 on sale.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn the U.S., the current Apple TV starts at $129 with 64GB of storage, and a 128GB model with an added Ethernet port is available for $149.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRumored features for the next Apple TV include a faster A-series chip and Wi-Fi 6E support.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/07/apple-tv-with-camera-again-rumored/\">built-in camera has also been rumored</a> for a future Apple TV model. tvOS 17 added a FaceTime app to the Apple TV, allowing for users to have video calls by using the rear camera on a connected iPhone or iPad. If the Apple TV gained a built-in camera, users would no longer need to rely on an external device for video calls on the TV.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is unclear exactly when in 2025 the new Apple TV will be released.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100\">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/24/99-dollar-apple-tv-is-a-possibility-next-year/\">$99 Apple TV Might Make a Comeback Next Year</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/99-apple-tv-might-make-a-comeback-next-year.2446051/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8b3b97c259c1570a78bd51eeada8e88cef3826876da4e0449721f1bef5dc573b","category":"Apple"}
