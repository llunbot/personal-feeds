It will require Apple and Google to allow third-party payment methods in their app stores in South Korea, and it will let developers use independent payment systems.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIf the amendment is approved by the committee, the National Assembly of South Korea will hold a final vote on Wednesday. Support for the bill has been picking up, and earlier this month, officials in South Korea met with the founder of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/24/epic-games-spotify-tile-coalition-for-app-fairness/\">Coalition for App Fairness</a> and the senior vice president of Match Group, both vocal anti-Apple critics.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn a statement to <em>Reuters</em>, Apple said that the legislation \"will put users who purchase digital goods from other sources at risk of fraud, undermine their privacy protections, make it difficult to manage their purchases.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIf passed, Apple believes the bill will cause user trust in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> purchases to fall, which will lead to \"fewer opportunities for the over 482,000 registered developers in Korea who have earned more than KRW8.55 trillion to date with Apple.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple currently collects 15 to 30 percent commission on in-app purchases made through the ‌App Store‌, and developers are required to use the company's in-app purchase system. Apple's ‌App Store‌ rules and restrictions are at the heart of its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/24/epic-games-v-apple-trial-ends/\">legal battle with Epic Games</a> and are the target of similar legislation in the United States and Europe.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAn antitrust bill <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/11/antitrust-app-store-bill-apple-google/\">proposed in the United States</a> earlier this month would force Apple and Google to allow third-party app stores and sideloading, while the European Commission <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/15/eu-introduces-strict-rules-on-big-tech-companies/\">last year introduced</a> the Digital Markets Act that would regulate how app stores operate in Europe.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/south-korea/\">South Korea</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/24/south-korea-apple-ban-in-app-purchase-system/\">South Korea Could Ban Apple From Requiring Developers to Use In-App Purchase System</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/south-korea-could-ban-apple-from-requiring-developers-to-use-in-app-purchase-system.2308535/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=gkhv7S6b7YI:JLoxUGYJ1wg:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=gkhv7S6b7YI:JLoxUGYJ1wg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/gkhv7S6b7YI\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5e65ce9f265f1c7f13763c445e04f8924bb6ced18b53a684216b8d5009460f0c","category":"Apple"}
