Not a minute less, not a minute more. If you’re not listening, you’re missing out. $5/month or $50/year. We’re now in our fourth year, and we’ve had remarkably little churn — people who subscribe to Dithering tend to stay subscribed, which warms my heart. It’s a fun show and everyone loves the enforced brevity and regularity.</p>\n\n<p>Bonus: At the end of March we started a Dithering group in <a href=\"https://wavelength.app/\">Wavelength</a>, the new private group messaging app <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2023/03/wavelength\">I started advising earlier this year</a>. It’s sort of an unofficial perk and an experiment. Subscribers can find the link to join the group in the show notes for each episode. We had no idea how this group would go, but it’s been wild. As of this typing there are over 2,900 members, and activity every day across a wide range of threads. I believe it’s the single largest group on all of Wavelength. (I just tonight told the story there of the piece of shit 2021 Kia Sorento I was bamboozled by Hertz into renting for a road trip to Boston this week, to pick my son up at the end of the college year.) It’s a nice, smart, fun little community.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/05/dithering\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"de1f163c84a813878478c176da7493d3802cc0e8b7ec6db19b6ee08350b10f2e","category":"Tech"}
