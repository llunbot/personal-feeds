Tesla, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/04/tesla-built-more-cars-than-it-could-sell-in-q1-2023/\">which we covered on Monday</a>, is far and away the leader when it comes to electric vehicle sales in the US. But as more and more automakers are bringing new EVs to market, Tesla's market share is eroding, from 72 percent at the beginning of last year to 54 percent now—<a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2023/04/05/tesla-ev-electric-vehicle-adoption\">and it may fall to less than 50 percent over the next few weeks</a>. Which of those other automakers are managing to move metal? We took a look through the Q1 sales announcements to get an idea.</p>\n<p>While most automakers have published their Q1 2023 sales, this is not a universal list. In particular, Porsche, Mercedes-Benz, Lucid, and Genesis have yet to reveal those numbers as of April 5. And the manufacturers don't all break out data in the same way, either lumping all EVs together (looking at you, General Motors) or grouping different powertrains together (as is the case with the Kia Niro and Hyundai Kona).</p>\n<p>It's also helpful to remember that, other than Tesla, Rivian, and Lucid, all the other automakers have product lines other than battery EVs, so such a company probably isn't going out of business next week because it only sold 3,000 EVs in three months. Supply chains still aren't back to what was considered normal pre-pandemic, and it's worth remembering that in most cases, these are global products. There are severe penalties for automakers who don't sell enough EVs in Europe and China, unlike here in the US. So in cases of finite supply, those markets will receive priority when it comes to deliveries—every EV you sell in the US is an EV you can't sell in Germany, after all.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1929230#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1929230&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
