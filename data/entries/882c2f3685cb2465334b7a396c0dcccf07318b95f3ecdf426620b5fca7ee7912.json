This is only a minor inconvenience, as charging the mouse is a quick and infrequent process, but it sounds like Apple will finally relocate the port.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Magic-Mouse-USB-C.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\n\"Apple is looking to create something that's more relevant, while also fixing longstanding complaints â€” yes, including the charging port issue,\" said Gurman.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHe also suggested the next Magic Mouse will be more ergonomic and comfortable to use.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile no specific design details about the next Magic Mouse were shared, perhaps Apple will take some inspiration from popular alternatives for the Mac, like Logitech's excellent MX Master 3S. That mouse features an ergonomic design with a thumb rest, a front-facing USB-C charging port, precision tracking, two scroll wheels, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/Logitech-MX-Master-3S.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" /><em>Logitech's MX Master 3S</em></div>\r<br />\nThe overall look of the Magic Mouse has not changed much since 2009, so a redesign has been a long time coming. Notable changes over the years include the mouse switching from AA batteries to a built-in rechargeable battery in 2015, new color-matching options with the iMac in 2021, and the switch from Lightning to USB-C this year. Overall, the Magic Mouse has not received much attention from Apple over the past decade.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWill the next Magic Mouse cost more? No word on that from Gurman, yet. The current model is priced at $79 in the U.S. on a standalone basis, and it is included at no additional cost with the purchase of an iMac or a Mac Pro.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magic-mouse/\">Magic Mouse</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/15/apple-working-on-new-magic-mouse-report/\">Apple 'Working' on Redesigned Magic Mouse With a Long-Awaited 'Fix'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-working-on-redesigned-magic-mouse-with-a-long-awaited-fix.2445481/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"882c2f3685cb2465334b7a396c0dcccf07318b95f3ecdf426620b5fca7ee7912","category":"Apple"}
