The two titles are, collectively, the <a href=\"https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/index.html\">fifth best-selling game in the Switch's history</a>, trailing only <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>, the Switch iterations of <em>Smash Bros. </em>and <em>Animal Crossing</em>, and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. </em>They're the best-selling <em>Pokémon </em>games since <em>Pokémon Gold </em>and <em>Silver</em> were released at the height of late-'90s/early-'00s Pokémania over two decades ago.</p>\n<p>Part of <em>Sword</em>'s<em> </em>and <em>Shield</em>'s appeal, as we explored a bit in <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/11/pokemon-sword-and-shield-review-two-steps-forward-one-dex-back/\">our review,</a> was that they used the Switch's extra hardware power to create a truly console-sized adventure, crafting a world with an impressive sense of scale and the series' first free-roaming overworld areas. There were still some weird quirks—story cutscenes with mouth movements but no actual spoken dialogue come to mind—but it felt like the series had finally broken free of some of the conventions it had been leaning on since the earliest Game Boy entries.</p>\n<p>In that context, <em>Pokémon Brilliant Diamond </em>and <em>Pokémon Shining Pearl </em>can't help but feel like a bit of a letdown. The games are faithful to their source material, but that source material is a pair of games released on the original Nintendo DS in 2007, and both the originals and the remakes hew much more closely to the series' Game Boy roots. It's not that there aren't improvements—it's just that, even relative to other <em>Pokémon </em>remakes, <em>Brilliant Diamond </em>and <em>Shining Pearl </em>feel inessential.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1813387#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1813387&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"286e0362babe2b852b84a37ac8502c7e7620e993eccf34ef5ba453e56edd4292","category":"Tech"}
