The fine is \"the largest standalone administrative penalty\" ever issued by the US Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), the agency <a href=\"https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/documents/about-bis/newsroom/press-releases/3264-2023-04-19-bis-press-release-seagate-settlement/file\">said</a>.</p>\n<p>\"Even after Huawei was placed on the Entity List for conduct inimical to our national security, and its competitors had stopped selling to them due to our foreign direct product rule, Seagate continued sending hard disk drives to Huawei,\" Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement Matthew Axelrod said.</p>\n<p>As part of the settlement, \"Seagate admitted to the conduct set forth in the Proposed Charging Letter involving Seagate US and Seagate Singapore,\" the BIS said. Seagate violated the rule \"by ordering or causing the reexport, export from abroad, or transfer (in-country)\" of 7.4 million disk drives to Huawei without BIS authorization, the agency said.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1933294#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1933294&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d4584b9a60d73c5d0417e60447e4f0564de0fdde6c43dfd95180347bbc477d3d","category":"Tech"}
