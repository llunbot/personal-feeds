It is called The Gravel Cycling Shoe, and it is – hold onto your hats, folks – a Gravel Cycling Shoe. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like pretty much every other shoe of the category, Adidas’s offering features a two-bolt SPD pattern on the sole. The upper is made of Primegreen recycled materials, and Adidas promises “no virgin polyester” has been used in the construction of them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Technical details are pretty light-on – Adidas doesn’t promise that the sole stiffness goes up to 11 (<a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/07/review-the-new-specialized-s-works-recon-lace-off-road-shoe/\">let alone 13</a>) and doesn’t even really get into what the sole is made out of, other than being ‘synthetic’ with TPU ‘walking pods’. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Gravel-Cycling-Shoes-Turqoise-2.png\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That grip looks pretty generous, extending along most of the outsole in a pattern of raised nubbins. That will help with walkability, although it seems like there’s a fair bit of potential for them to get clogged up in sloppy conditions, and who knows about durability. There’s a simple laced closure running through four loops, with a metal eyelet up top.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Adidas-Gravel-Cycling-Shoe-aqua_-1340x778.jpg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>An ankle cuff gives the shoe a kind of boot-like silhouette, which Adidas says will help keep gravel and dust out of the shoe. Giro offers something similar on its <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2017/08/giro-debuts-xnetic-knit-uppers-new-empire-republic-shoes/\">Empire VR70</a> knit shoe. And while this feature isn’t something I’ve personally ever felt like I was missing on a pair of cycling shoes, you do you.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Gravel-Cycling-Shoes-Turqoise-1.png\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two colours available at launch – a black-on-black-on-black ‘Core Black’ colour scheme, which is fine, and a much more interesting (but difficult to match with) ‘Pulse Aqua’, which stirs some deep-buried hypebeast yearnings. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Gravel Cycling Shoe is available in a wide range of sizes, running from European sizes 36–48 ⅔. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can track them down in select markets via Adidas.com and company stores, and they retail for US$170/€180. I am outraged to report that Australia is not one of those select markets.  </p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/08/adidas-is-at-it-again-with-the-gravel-cycling-shoe/\">Read More</a>","author":"Iain Treloar","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"40a09dffeba8d509112a3b055dae5340d12c651ac44a4585bb7c34c4d25b2bd5","category":"Cycling"}
