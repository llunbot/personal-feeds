Spying, by contrast, can take that kind of economically inspired monitoring to a completely new level:</p>\n<p>\"Spying and surveillance are different but related things,\" Schneier writes. \"If I hired a private detective to spy on you, that detective could hide a bug in your home or car, tap your phone, and listen to what you said. At the end, I would get a report of all the conversations you had and the contents of those conversations. If I hired that same private detective to put you under surveillance, I would get a different report: where you went, whom you talked to, what you purchased, what you did.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1988745#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1988745&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"140171de2b73faa4baf5c715c1ccaf2c93a1af64d8bcc2592a535cc54ea49d7f","category":"Tech"}
