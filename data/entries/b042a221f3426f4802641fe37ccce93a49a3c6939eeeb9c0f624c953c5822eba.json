Since its release, Analogue has added some new capabilities via firmware updates, most notably when it added support for emulating more consoles via its OpenFPGA platform <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/07/analogue-pocket-gets-future-minded-fpga-cores-update-with-mister-in-its-sights/\">in the summer of 2022</a>.</p>\n<p>But aside from finalizing and releasing that 1.1 firmware, 2023 was mostly quiet for Pocket firmware updates. That changed in December when the company released not <a href=\"https://www.analogue.co/support/pocket/firmware/1.2\">one</a> but <a href=\"https://www.analogue.co/support/pocket/firmware/2.0\">two</a> major firmware upgrades for the Pocket that slipped under our radar during the holidays. These updates delivered a combination of fixes and long-promised features to the handheld, which Analogue has been <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/08/analogues-supercharged-modern-day-game-boy-now-glows-in-the-dark/\">re-releasing in different color palettes</a> now that the original versions are more consistently in stock.</p>\n\n<p>The most significant update for OpenFPGA fans is the ability to use display filters with third-party FPGA cores. Part of the appeal of the Pocket is its 1,600Ã—1,440 screen, which is sharp enough to perfectly re-create the huge chunky pixels of the original Game Boy screens. By default, most FPGA cores now get access to a similarly high-quality CRT screen filter named after <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinitron\">the Sony Trinitron TV</a>, adding a touch of retro-blurriness to the sharp edges of 8- and 16-bit games. I've seen lots of bad, unconvincing scanline filters in retro game re-releases, and this isn't one of them.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1993667#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1993667&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b042a221f3426f4802641fe37ccce93a49a3c6939eeeb9c0f624c953c5822eba","category":"Tech"}
