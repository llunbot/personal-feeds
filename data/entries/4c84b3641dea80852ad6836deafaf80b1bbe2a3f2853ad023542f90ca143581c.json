Vulnerable devices include the Pixel 6 and 7, international versions of the Samsung Galaxy S22, various mid-range Samsung phones, the Galaxy Watch 4 and 5, and cars with the Exynos Auto T5123 chip. These devices are ONLY vulnerable if they run the Exynos chipset, which includes the baseband that processes signals for voice calls. The US version of the Galaxy S22 runs a Qualcomm Snapdragon chip.</p>\n<p>A bug tracked as CVE-2023-24033 and three others that have yet to receive a CVE designation make it possible for hackers to execute malicious code, Google’s Project Zero vulnerability team <a href=\"https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2023/03/multiple-internet-to-baseband-remote-rce.html\">reported</a> on Thursday. Code-execution bugs in the baseband can be especially critical because the chips are endowed with root-level system privileges to ensure voice calls work reliably.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1925040#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1925040&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4c84b3641dea80852ad6836deafaf80b1bbe2a3f2853ad023542f90ca143581c","category":"Tech"}
