It is designed to be \"ultra-customizable,\" featuring standard, high dome, and low dome caps, half dome back buttons, and lever back buttons so pro gamers can swap out their controls.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe buttons on the back are a new addition compared to the standard DualSense, as are the updated joysticks and trigger buttons. The controller also supports profiles with preset controls for different games. Priced at $199 in the United States, the controller includes a braided USB-C cable, a connector housing, and a dedicated carrying case. It is similar to the Xbox Elite 2 Wireless Controller.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-16/\">iOS 16</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-16/\">iPadOS 16</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-16.238\">iOS 16</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/27/ios-16-4-playstation-5-dualsense-edge/\">iOS 16.4 Adds Support for PlayStation 5 DualSense Edge Wireless Controller</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-16-4-adds-support-for-playstation-5-dualsense-edge-wireless-controller.2384989/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2c44301317d4ce803e366631ccb6b812924e83784fd618e3c8bc5bcea6091f51","category":"Apple"}
