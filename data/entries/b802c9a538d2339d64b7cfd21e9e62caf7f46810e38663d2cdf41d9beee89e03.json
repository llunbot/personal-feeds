This bike is a product of Matt’s affinity for the mighty <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nvan6v0F6ls\" target=\"_blank\">Postie Bike aka the Honda Trail 90</a> (or 110). In short, the Evasion Trail is exactly what it looks like: an Evasion rear end welded to a longer step thru front end, making it more compatible with a flat, riser, alt, townie, or whatever-you-call-it kind of bar.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Evasion-Trail-140_rear.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Evasion-Trail-140_rear.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Evasion-Trail-140_rear.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Evasion-Trail-140_rear.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Evasion-Trail-140_front.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Evasion-Trail-140_front.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Evasion-Trail-140_front.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Evasion-Trail-140_front.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>This wild version of the Evasion is also mountain bike boost-spaced on the front and rear of the bike.
