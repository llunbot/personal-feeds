The phones were infected with malware that collects microphone recordings, photos, geolocation, and other data, company officials said.</p>\n<p>“We are quite confident that Kaspersky was not the main target of this cyberattack,” Eugene Kaspersky, founder of the company, wrote in a <a href=\"https://eugene.kaspersky.com/2023/06/01/a-matter-of-triangulation/\">post</a> published on Thursday. “The coming days will bring more clarity and further details on the worldwide proliferation of the spyware.”</p>\n<h2>This clickless APT exploit will self destruct</h2>\n<p>The malware, which has been in use for at least four years, was delivered in iMessage texts that attached a malicious file that automatically exploited one or more vulnerabilities without requiring the receiver to take any action. With that, the devices were infected with what Kaspersky researchers <a href=\"https://securelist.com/operation-triangulation/109842/\">described</a> as a “fully-featured APT platform.” APT is short for advanced persistent threat and refers to threat actors with nearly unlimited resources who target individuals over long periods of time. APTs are almost always backed by nation-states.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1943622#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1943622&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bfe023402c5885138b4f26f9fb4f33def6969d55cd65d822277015f8f16c8fda","category":"Tech"}
