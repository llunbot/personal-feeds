{"title":"VisionOS SDK Is Now Available","link":"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/06/developer-tools-to-create-spatial-experiences-for-apple-vision-pro-now-available/","date":1687385020000,"content":"\n<p>Apple Newsroom:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple today announced the availability of new software tools and\ntechnologies that enable developers to create groundbreaking app\nexperiences for <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2023/06/introducing-apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a> — Apple’s first spatial\ncomputer. Featuring visionOS, the world’s first spatial operating\nsystem, Vision Pro lets users interact with digital content in\ntheir physical space using the most natural and intuitive inputs\npossible — their eyes, hands, and voice. [...] With the visionOS\nSDK, developers can utilize the powerful and unique capabilities\nof Vision Pro and visionOS to design brand-new app experiences\nacross a variety of categories including productivity, design,\ngaming, and more.</p>\n\n<p>Next month, Apple will open developer labs in Cupertino, London,\nMunich, Shanghai, Singapore, and Tokyo to provide developers with\nhands-on experience to test their apps on Apple Vision Pro\nhardware and get support from Apple engineers. Development teams\nwill also be able to apply for developer kits to help them quickly\nbuild, iterate, and test right on Apple Vision Pro.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My top three thoughts:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>This is the same SDK Apple itself is using to develop VisionOS apps. I mean, sure, Apple has access to private APIs, but that’s true on MacOS and iOS too. But this is not like the original WatchKit in 2015, where third-party developers were stuck with a severely limited SDK that was nothing like the APIs being used by Apple itself. This is real dogfooding.</p></li>\n<li><p>These in-person labs will prove essential for many developers during this prelude period, where developers won’t have access to Vision Pro itself while working on apps.</p></li>\n<li><p>I think Reality Composer Pro could be the sleeper hit of this SDK — a tool not (just) for programmers, but for creative artists.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/21/visionos-sdk-now-available\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"ede0bbd2e8a4861d959f85406af8906191694ecb56a38a913b46f3453ac52394","category":"Tech"}
