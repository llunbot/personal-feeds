That’s the same Pidcock who has notched just a single road win in 2024 and who reportedly clashed with team management over his poor performances in the Tour of Britain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Architect of two of those Kern Pharma victories was Pablo Castrillo – the same Castrillo whose links to Ineos Grenadiers resurfaced in the wake of his unexpected Stage 12 Vuelta triumph. No sooner had the 23-year-old emerged through the mist to double up at Cuitu Negru three days later, however, than doubts about his move began to arise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was at the beginning of September. Fast forward a month and a bit and Movistar have just announced <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cycling-transfer-rumours\" target=\"_blank\">Castrillo will ride for them in 2025</a>. How has it come to this – the WorldTour’s once most dominant force outmanoeuvred even in the bargain basement?</p>\n\n\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-09-02T104205.424-970x647.png\" alt=\"pablo castrillo vuelta a espana\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-09-02T104205.424-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-09-02T104205.424-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-09-02T104205.424-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-09-02T104205.424-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-09-02T104205.424-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-09-02T104205.424-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-09-02T104205.424-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-09-02T104205.424-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-09-02T104205.424-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/file-2024-09-02T104205.424.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>Unipublic/Sprint Cycling Agency</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>It has now been more than three years since Ineos won a Grand Tour – Egan Bernal in the 2021 Giro; more than four years since the last Tour win – the same rider in 2020; seven years since Chris Froome’s Vuelta victory. That period has produced just a single Monument win – Dylan van Baarle’s Paris-Roubaix triumph in 2022. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like many, Van Baarle has since flown the nest. At the Vuelta, the best-placed rider from Ineos was Carlos Rodríguez, who slumped to tenth behind former teammates Richard Carapaz, Mikel Landa and Pavel Sivakov. Two more riders released by Ineos – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/adam-yates-profile\" target=\"_blank\">Adam Yates</a> and Eddie Dunbar – picked up stage wins in Spain. Rodríguez finished behind Yates and Landa in the Tour. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/geraint-thomas-interview-2024\" target=\"_blank\">Geraint Thomas</a> made the final podium in the Giro, but behind another Ineos alumnus, Dani Martínez, who now rides for Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Luke Rowe retiring and Thomas entering what looks to be his last year, fans are entitled to ask what’s next? While Ethan Hayter and Jhonatan Narváez pack their bags, Ineos focus on extending the contracts of stagnating stalwarts like Omar Fraile. The outgoings are more acutely felt set against the quality of what’s coming in. Last year’s star signing was Tobias Foss, while 2025 welcomes veteran Bob Jungels and youngsters Axel Laurance and Sam Watson. Pulses have not been set racing. </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-does-tadej-pogacar-still-have-to-win\">GOAT Bingo: What does Tadej Pogačar still have left to win?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/primoz-roglic-legacy\">Opinion: What is Primož Roglič’s legacy?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cycling-transfer-rumours\">Pro cycling transfers 2024/2025: Elisa Longo Borghini finally confirms move to UAE Team ADQ, Kasper Asgreen signs for EF and Tom Pidcock rumoured to join second-division Q36.5</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/il-lombardia-preview\">Il Lombardia 2024: Everything you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/20240703TDF1076-A.S.O._Charly_Lopez-1-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/20240703TDF1076-A.S.O._Charly_Lopez-1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/20240703TDF1076-A.S.O._Charly_Lopez-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/20240703TDF1076-A.S.O._Charly_Lopez-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/20240703TDF1076-A.S.O._Charly_Lopez-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/20240703TDF1076-A.S.O._Charly_Lopez-1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/20240703TDF1076-A.S.O._Charly_Lopez-1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/20240703TDF1076-A.S.O._Charly_Lopez-1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/20240703TDF1076-A.S.O._Charly_Lopez-1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/20240703TDF1076-A.S.O._Charly_Lopez-1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/20240703TDF1076-A.S.O._Charly_Lopez-1-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Charly Lopez</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>I can’t help but think Ineos missed a trick by not being involved in Mark Cavendish’s Tour record bid. What Cav achieved at Astana would have brought prestige and purpose to a British team that has lost any hope of winning the Tour while <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tadej-pogacar\" target=\"_blank\">Tadej Pogačar</a> and Jonas Vingegaard are around. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Snapping up Primož Roglič would have offered a lifeline: a proven all-round force as opposed to an ageing Thomas or a future prospect like Rodríguez.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not just the riders and ambition that are disappearing: manager Rod Ellingworth has left again, <em>directeur sportif</em> Steve Cummings appears to be frozen out, and Dave Brailsford has aligned himself to Manchester United, a football team whose own fall from grace is even more staggering. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://store.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"343\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/clickable-subs-promo9-970x343.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/clickable-subs-promo9-970x343.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/clickable-subs-promo9-300x106.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/clickable-subs-promo9-768x271.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/clickable-subs-promo9-1536x543.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/clickable-subs-promo9-2048x724.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/clickable-subs-promo9-750x265.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/clickable-subs-promo9-1140x403.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>So, how to stop the rot? Get Brailsford back, for starters. He has an aura and a winning mentality. Even when he’s just visiting, Sir Dave gets the best out of the riders. Jim Ratcliffe may want him at Manchester United but that’s like trying to knit a jumper with a knife when that knife would be far better carving a chicken.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Pogačar peerless at UAE Team Emirates, perhaps Ineos could exploit the frustrations of teammates Juan Ayuso or João Almeida? More realistically, young Frenchman Kévin Vauquelin is out of contract soon and could be an interesting project. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/240629_Cyclist_TDF_0540-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"tom pidcock ineos grenadiers\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/240629_Cyclist_TDF_0540-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/240629_Cyclist_TDF_0540-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/240629_Cyclist_TDF_0540-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/240629_Cyclist_TDF_0540-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/240629_Cyclist_TDF_0540-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/240629_Cyclist_TDF_0540-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/240629_Cyclist_TDF_0540-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/240629_Cyclist_TDF_0540-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/240629_Cyclist_TDF_0540-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/240629_Cyclist_TDF_0540-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Patrik Lundin/Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Then there’s Belgian World and double Olympic Champion Remco Evenepoel, who could leave Soudal-QuickStep soon. Wouldn’t he offer far better value for money than Pidcock’s €4m? And should Evenepoel join Red Bull instead, then Roglič may reappear on the market. Even at 34, the Slovenian is a winner who could deliver while overseeing a much-needed transition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First up, though, is sorting out Pidcock’s role and helping him get his mojo back. Sit him down and tell him he won’t ever win the Tour. He is far more valuable as a livewire stage hunter and one-day specialist. To get the best out of him, Pidcock needs to be let loose. Once the hierarchy is clear, the atmosphere will return.
