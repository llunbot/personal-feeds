Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/24/ios-18-4-beta-pulled-for-iphone-12-and-more/\">ended up pulling</a> the iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4 updates for these devices, preventing them from being updated to avoid bricking them.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe error has presumably been fixed, because the second betas of iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4 are available for affected devices. These devices were impacted:\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n \t<li>All ‌iPhone‌ 12 models</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> 8 (WiFi and Cellular)</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> 4th Gen (Wi-Fi and Cellular)</li>\r<br />\n \t<li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> ‌iPad Air‌ models</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\nThis issue affected the watchOS 11.4 update for the Apple Watch Series 6 too, so Apple also pulled the watchOS 11.4 update for the Series 6. The second beta of watchOS 11.4 addresses the issue too.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe second iOS 18.4 beta also comes after the release of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/\">iPhone 16e</a>, so new ‌iPhone 16e‌ owners can upgrade to Apple's beta software. The initial iOS 18.4 beta could not be downloaded on the ‌iPhone 16e‌.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/03/ios-18-4-beta-iphone-12-iphone-16e/\">Latest iOS 18.4 Beta Available for iPhone 12 and iPhone 16e</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/latest-ios-18-4-beta-available-for-iphone-12-and-iphone-16e.2451215/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b15c273e53a742504d075d4101fcddc3cfc345ccd57ea3096fab46c022a067c1","category":"Apple"}
