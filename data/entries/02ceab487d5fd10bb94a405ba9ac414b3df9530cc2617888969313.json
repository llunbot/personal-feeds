This is a negative headwind to both LITE and COHR which we view as likely.</blockquote>Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo last month said Sony would replace Lumentum and WIN Semiconductors as the exclusive supplier of LiDAR Scanner components for the iPhone 15 Pro models. Kuo <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/24/kuo-iphone-15-pro-improved-lidar-scanner/\">said Sony's solution is more power efficient</a> and could result in the LiDAR Scanner offering improved performance at the same level of power consumption as now, or equal performance with less of an impact on battery life.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIntroduced on iPhone 12 Pro models in 2020, the LiDAR Scanner can measure light distance and capture depth information, and the hardware is expected to remain exclusive to iPhone 15 Pro models. An improved LiDAR Scanner could be beneficial to augmented reality apps, Night mode photos, and camera autofocus.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOther rumored iPhone 15 Pro features include an A17 Bionic chip, a USB-C port, a titanium frame with solid-state buttons, thinner bezels around the display, and more.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/barclays/\">Barclays</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lidar-scanner/\">LiDAR Scanner</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/08/iphone-15-pro-new-lidar-scanner-rumor/\">iPhone 15 Pro Models Again Rumored to Feature Improved LiDAR Scanner</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-pro-models-again-rumored-to-feature-improved-lidar-scanner.2383100/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"02ceab487d5fd10bb94a405ba9ac414b3df9530cc2617888969313","category":"Apple"}
