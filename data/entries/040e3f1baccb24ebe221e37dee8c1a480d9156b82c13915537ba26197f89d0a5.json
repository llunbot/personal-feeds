Sadly, though, that article marks Matthew’s last appearance on BikeRadar, as he has now moved on to pastures new.</p>\n<p>His technical insight, sharp opinions and good humour will doubtless be missed by many, myself included. All the best for the future, Matthew.</p>\n<p>Unusually, Shimano also launched its new <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/shimano-ultegra-di2-r8100/\">Ultegra R8100</a> groupset at the same time, though we’ve not been able to get our hands on a test groupset yet.</p>\n<p>I’m sorry to report, however, that mechanical Dura-Ace and Ultegra are dead. They’re no more, they’ve ceased to be, they’ve expired and gone to meet their maker, etc.</p>\n<p>If you’re in the market for a new bike equipped with one of Shimano’s latest groupsets, we’ve rounded up <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/bikes-with-shimano-dura-ace-r9200-and-ultegra-r8100/\">13 bikes with Shimano 12-speed</a>. Plenty more bikes will be coming soon, we’ve no doubt, but if you really can’t wait there are lots of good options already.</p>\n<p>Away from the big road component news, Merida finally announced the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2022-merida-scultura-v-team/\">Scultura V Team</a>, the new lightweight, all-round road bike <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/merida-scultura-5/\">we’d already spotted</a> being raced in the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/2021-worldtour-bikes/\">WorldTour</a>.</p>\n<p>Strava also revealed its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/strava-beacon-relaunch/\">Beacon feature</a> – which shares your live location with up to three nominated friends or family members while recording an activity in the app – is now freely available to all users, regardless of whether you have a premium subscription or not.</p>\n<p>If that’s all old news to you, though, let’s take a look at some of the latest new tech and kit to land at BikeRadar HQ this week.</p>\n\n<h2>HJC Ibex 2.0 helmet</h2>\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><p></p><div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/09/20210902_SB_5DMKII_MG_8025-bbfed24.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The Ibex 2.0 is HJC’s flagship performance road helmet.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/09/20210902_SB_5DMKII_MG_8024-2cfad81.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The Ibex 2.0 combines good ventilation with an aerodynamically efficient shape.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/09/20210902_SB_5DMKII_MG_8027-dcf0f61.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The Ibex 2.0 was developed in HJC’s wind tunnel.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\nThe Ibex 2.0 is HJC’s flagship performance road helmet, designed with low weight, ventilation and aerodynamics in mind.\n<p>Seen on the heads of Israel Start-Up Nation pros like <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/tags/chris-froome/\">Chris Froome</a>, it has a more open design compared to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/helmets/road-cycling-helmets/hjc-furion-2-0-helmet-review/\">Furion 2.0</a> aero road helmet, but still promises to be aerodynamically efficient thanks to its shape. It also tips the scales at a very respectable 220g for a size medium.</p>\n<p>Though HJC doesn’t provide any specific figures to back up those claims, it does say the Ibex 2.0 was developed in its own “wind tunnel laboratory”, using learnings from its helmets for MotoGP riders.</p>\n<p></p><div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img

good looking design, ports that can accommodate sunglasses and feels very comfortable on my head.\n<p>Notably, the Ibex 2.0 uses HJC’s SELFIT fit system which eschews adjusting dials and instead uses spring tension to automatically adjust the fit on your head.</p>\n<p>It feels a bit odd at first (most likely because I’ve been over-tightening my helmets in the past), but it provides an impressively secure and comfortable fit, and the Ibex 2.0 has quickly become one of my go-to helmets for road riding.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Science in

that deliver 40g of carbs per serving.\n<p>According to Science in Sport, the crucial factor is that Beat Fuel uses a 1:0.8 ratio of maltodextrin and fructose (two types of carbohydrate).
