It will work like a DSLR camera's shutter button, with the ability to press it lightly to focus on a subject and press harder to capture a picture. Swiping across the button will switch between photo and video camera modes, as well as zoom in and out. </li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>AirPods</h3>\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n\t<li>Apple is preparing to announce the ability for AirPods to work as a hearing aid replacement, as well as a device for conducting hearing tests. The company has experienced delays with developing the new functionality and it may not be available until a later date.</li>\r<br />\n\t<li>Gurman added that Apple apparently discovered a bug on the upcoming, fourth-generation AirPods that resulted in draining battery life. The issue was software-related and fixed prior to factories shipping the new devices.</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>Apple Watch</h3>\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n\t<li>Apple's \"It's Glowtime\" event will be the first time that Apple updates all three Apple Watch lines simultaneously.</li>\r<br />\n\t<li>The Apple Watch Ultra 3 will only offer minor improvements that focus on internal upgrades rather than exterior changes.</li>\r<br />\n\t<li>The Apple Watch Series 10 will feature the first design update for the device since the Series 7, offering larger display size options and a \"noticeably thinner\" casing.</li>\r<br />\n\t<li>While the Apple Watch is not expected to get \"major\" Apple Intelligence capabilities, any AI technology debuting on the new devices will likely be tied specifically to a \"future health coach service.\"</li>\r<br />\n\t<li>Despite plans to bring hypertension detection to the new Apple Watches this year, Gurman now believes that the feature has been delayed.</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman added that new Mac and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> models are likely to appear at a follow-up event, no earlier than October, rather than at the September event.
