We loved the series so much that Ars staffers actually wrote <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/05/severance-is-a-show-about-connection-plus-melon-parties-cults-and-baby-goats/\">a group review</a> so that everyone could weigh in with their thoughts on the first season, pronouncing it \"one of the best shows on TV.\" Needless to say, we have been eagerly awaiting the second season next month. Prime Video just released the official trailer at CCXP24 in São Paulo, Brazil and it does not disappoint.</p>\n<p><strong>(Spoilers for first season below.)</strong></p>\n<p>In the world of <em>Severance</em>, people can completely disconnect their work and personal lives. Thanks to a new procedure developed by Lumon Industries, workers can bifurcate themselves into \"innies\" (work selves) and \"outies\" (personal selves)—with no sharing of memories between them. This appeals to people like Mark (Adam Scott), who lost his wife in a car crash and has struggled to work through the grief. Why not forget all that pain for eight hours a day?</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2024/12/innie-rebellion-is-brewing-in-trippy-severance-s2-trailer/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2024/12/innie-rebellion-is-brewing-in-trippy-severance-s2-trailer/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"81c89cebe1de035a27cdc1f017b7ed08f02b70f79b859be8a651aeda8d722034","category":"Tech"}
