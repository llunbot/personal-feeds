There are also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/27/ios-18-3-macos-sequoia-15-3-security-updates/\">a number of security fixes</a>, so be sure to update your devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Finally Explains How to Install New Firmware on Your AirPods</h2>\r<br />\nWhile Apple occasionally releases firmware updates for AirPods, the company has never been publicly explicit about how to ensure your earphones get the new firmware installed, until now.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/airpods-4-blue.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nIn an updated support document, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/27/airpods-firmware-update-instructions/\">Apple has added more specific step-by-step instructions about updating</a>. While the steps were generally known, Apple has removed ambiguity from the process by noting that the AirPods case should be plugged in and users should wait at least 30 minutes for the firmware to update.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>When Will Apple Release the iOS 18.4 Beta?</h2>\r<br />\nWith iOS 18.3 out the door, attention will soon turn to iOS 18.4, which is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/24/ios-18-4-beta-coming-soon/\">expected to be a more substantial upgrade</a>, particularly when it comes to Apple Intelligence.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/Generic-iOS-18.4-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nWhile the initial beta of an iOS update frequently arrives within just a few days after the public release of the previous version, the gaps can sometimes be as long as several weeks. We haven't yet seen the first beta of iOS 18.4, and given the substantial Apple Intelligence updates coming in the update, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/29/ios-18-4-beta-timing/\">it's possible we may have to wait a bit longer than usual</a> for Apple to begin pushing it out for testing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Save 7GB Storage Per Device by Disabling Apple Intelligence</h2>\r<br />\nApple this week released iOS 18.3, iPadOS 18.3, and macOS Sequoia 15.3, software updates that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/21/macos-sequoia-15-3-apple-intelligence-opt-out/\">enable Apple Intelligence on supported devices by default</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/apple-intelligence-black.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1400\" height=\"788\" />\r<br />\nWhether you own an iPhone, iPad, Mac – or indeed all three – regardless of what you think about Apple Intelligence, there's one reason why you may want to disable Apple's AI features at the earliest opportunity: To reclaim storage.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/save-up-to-21gb-storage-disable-apple-intelligence/\">Check out our how-to for full details</a> on how to turn off Apple Intelligence and what you'll miss out on by doing so.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Still 'Exploring' New AirPods With Tiny Cameras</h2>\r<br />\nApple has been rumored to be trying to embed tiny cameras in future AirPods models, and the company is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/26/apple-exploring-airpods-with-tiny-cameras/\">still \"exploring\" the idea</a>, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2019/10/airpods-pro-purple.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1500\" height=\"844\" />\r<br />\nThe function of these potential cameras isn't entirely known, though analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has said these would be infrared cameras that could enhance the spatial audio experience and could potentially support \"in-air gesture control.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn other product rumor news, Gurman says Apple remains on track to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/26/homepod-hub-with-7-inch-screen-rumor/\">launch its smart home hub with 7-inch display at some point in 2025</a>, calling it \"Apple's most significant release of the year.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>iPhone 17 Air Design, Specs, and More: All the Rumors So Far</h2>\r<br />\nThis year, Apple is expected to discontinue the iPhone \"Plus\" device in its iPhone 17 lineup to make way for an iPhone \"Air,\" so-called because of its thin profile.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/iPhone-17-Air-Size-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThere have been numerous rumors about what to expect from this all-new device, so <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/29/iphone-17-air-specs-design-everything-we-know/\">we've put together a compilation of every rumor and leak</a> we have registered from reputable sources thus far about Apple's new entry in its flagship smartphone lineup.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>MacRumors Newsletter</h3>\r<br />\nEach week, we publish an email newsletter like this highlighting the top Apple stories, making it a great way to get a bite-sized recap of the week hitting all of the major topics we've covered and tying together related stories for a big-picture view.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSo if you want to have <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/macrumors/jan-30-2025\">top stories</a> like the above recap delivered to your email inbox each week, <b><a href=\"http://eepurl.com/OHdUX\">subscribe to our newsletter</a></b>!<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/top-stories/\">Top Stories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/01/top-stories-ios-18-3-released/\">Top Stories: iOS 18.3 Released, AirPods News, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/top-stories-ios-18-3-released-airpods-news-and-more.2448548/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"MacRumors Staff","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f0b52332595718437304c4ce096b6a29f7a3ab1cdeaa8fbf64534a5e80208b7a","category":"Apple"}
