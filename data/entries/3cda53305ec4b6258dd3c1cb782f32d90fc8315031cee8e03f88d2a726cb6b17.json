At some point during the first three months of 2021, the country installed its 100,000th EV charger. That's according to the US Department of Energy's Alternative Fueling Station Locator, <a href=\"https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_locations.html#/find/nearest?fuel=ELEC\">an extremely helpful resource</a> that tracks \"ethanol (E85), biodiesel, compressed natural gas, electric vehicle (EV) charging, hydrogen, liquefied natural gas, and propane stations.\"</p>\n<p>That milestone <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/03/biden-pushes-ev-chargers-as-six-utilities-plan-a-unified-network/\">coincided nicely with a call from President Joe Biden</a> to build out more EV charging infrastructure. In March of this year, the Biden administration set a goal of reaching 500,000 publicly accessible EV chargers by the year 2030. (This preceded an August announcement from the White House that set <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/08/biden-reveals-lackluster-new-ev-policy-no-plans-to-phase-out-gasoline/\">a lukewarm target</a> of half of all new cars and trucks being zero-emissions, also by 2030.)<br />\n</p><div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-12.27.11-PM.png\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-12.27.11-PM-980x765.png\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-02-at-12.27.11-PM.png\"></a> (credit: US Department of Energy)</p></div>\n<p>If you're considering adopting an EV, then you can use <a href=\"https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/electricity_locations.html#/find/nearest?fuel=ELEC&amp;ev_levels=all&amp;country=US\">this helpful online tool</a> at the Department of Energy to see where all the chargers are.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1809610#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1809610&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
