Vollering herself was a little underwhelmed by the course in the days before the race, but having found a love for gravel during the pandemic, she was keen to support the event.</p><p>After four of nine laps, Vollering and Mackaij rode away from the group and quickly found a gap, but when Lorena Wiebes counter-attacked, her DSM teammate Mackaij stopped pulling. Despite having no help, Vollering maintained their slender advantage until Wiebes finally cracked in the closing kilometres.</p><p>“I attacked from a group of four and Floortje joined me,” Vollering explained. “Then we heard that Lorena Wiebes had counter-attacked, so Floortje stopped working. Only I really didn’t want Lorena catching on, so I kept riding. Luckily I won the sprint.”</p><p>Earlier in the day, Tijmen Eising (VolkerWessels) won the men’s title ahead of teammates Coen Vermelfoort and Daan van Sintmaartensdijk.</p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CORVOS_00033730-001-1340x861.jpg\"><figcaption>Tijmen Eising took the men’s national gravel title ahead of two VolkerWessels teammates.</figcaption></figure></div></div>","author":"Kit Nicholson","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"71ec25963b229019e9f9aa3fb046abe4c6ab4c48011a6ac38952cb2e390dfc61","category":"Cycling"}
