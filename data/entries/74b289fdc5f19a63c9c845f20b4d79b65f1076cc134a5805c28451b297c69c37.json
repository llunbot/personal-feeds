The announcement didn't specify whether the live-action production would be a TV series or a movie, nor did it specify when it would come out or on which platforms.</p>\n<p>It does, however, state that it will be a \"brand-new story set in the world of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>,\" and that it is \"at an early development stage\"—so early, in fact, that the team is looking for a screenwriter. The fact that it will be a new story makes it seem unlikely that we'll see Keanu Reeves reprise his role as Johnny Silverhand.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1974195#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1974195&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"74b289fdc5f19a63c9c845f20b4d79b65f1076cc134a5805c28451b297c69c37","category":"Tech"}
