That Microshift has targeted its latest effort at the booming gravel sector is telling, too.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a closer look at what the launch of Microshift Sword means and how it could, in theory, shake up the budget and mid-range bike markets.</p>\n<h2>How did we get to this point?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Ridley Helium Disc SRAM Rival eTap AXS road bike\" title=\"Ridley Helium Disc SRAM Rival eTap AXS - 01\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> You don’t get as much bang for your buck anymore.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>It will come as no surprise that <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/long-reads/pandemic-brexit-bike-prices/\">bike prices have risen considerably</a> since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, despite some brands, distributors and retailers carrying large quantities of excess – and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/long-reads/2023-bike-prices/\">now discounted</a> – stock.</p>\n<p>In turn, groupset options from Shimano and SRAM have also become more expensive, not always plentiful in stock, or both.</p>\n<p>As a result, it has become harder for bike manufacturers to spec value-focused Shimano and SRAM groupsets on some bikes, while still hitting a certain price point. Sub-£1,000 bikes are increasingly being specced with alternative groupsets (or, at least, alternatives to individual groupset components).</p>\n<p>For example, the Vitus Substance 2 gravel bike retails for £750 and comes equipped with Microshift R8 8-speed components.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Specialized Allez Sport in Dove Grey sits on a country lane in front of a bright green verge.\" title=\"Specialized Allez Sport\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> I never thought I’d see the day when you’d have to shell out £1,100 for an entry-level Allez.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Robyn Furtado / BikeRadar</i></span></div>\n<p>In terms of the relationship between bike prices and component choice, let’s take the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2023-specialized-allez-e5/\">new Specialized Allez</a> (a road bike, admittedly) as an example. Once an entry-level bike staple, the cheapest model equipped with Shimano Claris now retails for £1,100. Fewer than 10 years ago, the equivalent model, with rim brakes, rather than the latest disc-brake upgrade, cost £600.</p>\n<p>Claris is the entry point into Shimano’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/road-bike-groupsets-everything-you-need-to-know/\">road groupset</a> line-up – and it remains an affordable option, despite its presence here on an £1,100 bike – but, as an 8-speed drivetrain, it’s looking a little long in the tooth for enthusiast riders.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Trek Domane AL 2 road bike is equipped with Shimano Claris gears\" title=\"Trek Domane AL 2 - 07\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Shimano’s Claris isn’t gravel-specific.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Dave Caudery / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>On the gravel side of things, Shimano’s GRX RX-400 groupset is its entry-point to the range. This is a 10-speed groupset with an £850 RRP, and therefore represents a significantly higher starting point than Claris for prospective gravel riders.</p>\n<p>As for SRAM, despite the brand hinting at an all-electronic future after the consecutive launches of Red, Force and Rival AXS, it recently introduced its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2023-sram-apex-groupset/\">Apex 12-speed groupset</a> with a 12-speed mechanical option (as well as an electronic variant).</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"SRAM Apex Eagle mechanical rear derailleur and cassette with mullet gearing on a Rose Backroad gravel bike\" title=\"SRAM Apex Eagle mechanical rear derailleur and cassette with mullet gearing on a Rose Backroad gravel bike\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> SRAM’s Apex Eagle is its new entry-level mechanical gravel groupset, but it’s pricier than Sword.</span></figcaption><span> <i>SRAM</i></span></div>\n<p>However, with a full Apex mechanical groupset coming in at £1,035/$971 (recommended retail price; ‘real-world’ groupset prices tend to be cheaper), SRAM expects this to be specced on bikes at around the $2,000 mark (approximately £1,500).</p>\n<p>It’s the latest tech, but not small change for a bike with a fourth-tier groupset. Apex is also the most affordable road/gravel groupset that SRAM offers.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Campagnolo Centaur groupset\" title=\"Campagnolo Centaur groupset\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The ditching of Centaur means Campagnolo is only found on high-end offerings now.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>What about Campagnolo? Well, the Italian brand has all but abandoned the lower end of the market as it quietly discontinued <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/campagnolo-centaur-groupset-review/\">Centaur</a> – its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/shimano-105-r7000-r7020-groupset-review/\">Shimano 105 R7000</a> equivalent – when it launched the new halo <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/campagnolo-super-record-wireless/\">Super Record Wireless</a> groupset.</p>\n<p>This means that out of the Big Three, only Shimano makes a truly affordable option in the form of its 8-speed Claris groupset, although a question mark remains over its future.</p>\n<h2>Enter Shimano Cues…</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Shimano's made it no secret Cues will be coming to the road.\" title=\"Shimano Cues lifestyle images 11\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Shimano’s made it no secret Cues will be coming to the road.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Shimano </i></span></div>\n<p>Back in February, Shimano announced its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/shimano-cues/\">Cues ecosystem</a>, with new 9-,10 and 11-speed <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/drivetrains-explained-all-of-the-parts-that-make-your-bike-go/\">drivetrain</a> components that replace all of Shimano’s lower-tier mountain bike families – Altus, Acera and Alivio.</p>\n<p>On launch, Shimano made it no secret that it looks set to relaunch its equivalent-tier road bike groupsets much in the same way, covering Claris, Sora and Tiagra.</p>\n<p>Will this give Shimano’s line-up a cross-compatible shake-up that provides affordability and parts availability in equal measure?</p>\n<p>Although it remains to be seen if Shimano will be able to maintain a competitive price point, as things stand, it’s all beginning to tip in Microshift’s favour. This is notable for what was previously an underdog brand.</p>\n<h2>Budget gravel tech</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Microshift Sword shifters on a gravel handlebar\" title=\"Microshift Sword shifters on a gravel handlebar\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Sword shifters are designed to pair well with flared handlebars and feature texturing on the hoods for increased grip.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Microshift</i></span></div>\n<p>To recap on Microshift Sword’s tech, it’s 10-speed, with 1x and 2x variants. It has maximum cassette sprocket sizes of 48t and 38t respectively, and has a rear derailleur with a clutch, to aid chain retention.</p>\n<p>Where it may falter, against some of the competition, is in Microshift’s preference for cable-actuated disc brakes, rather than <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/road-disc-brakes-everything-you-need-to-know/\">hydraulic disc brakes</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/1x-drivetrains/\">1x drivetrains</a> continue to grow in popularity for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/what-is-gravel-riding/\">gravel riding</a>, due to the potential for improved chain retention with a narrow-wide chainring and a clutch rear derailleur, alongside gravel-specific gearing and simpler shifting.</p>\n<p>That Sword hits all of these features, but with a keen eye on price, demonstrates an adept understanding of what it is consumers want.</p>\n<p>It’ll likely be a popular option for road or all-road riders, as well as commuters, happy with the gearing spread offered by the gravel-targeted components.</p>\n<h2>So where does Microshift Sword fit in?</h2>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Microshift Sword rear derailleur on Cannondale Topstone\" title=\"Microshift Sword rear derailleur on Cannondale Topstone\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> You even get a clutched rear derailleur on Sword.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Microshift</i></span></div>\n<p>On paper, Sword gives aspiring or budget-conscious gravel riders – and bike brand product managers keeping a close eye on the numbers – a more competitive starting point for the money, compared to Shimano GRX-RX400 and SRAM Apex.</p>\n<p>It’s telling that Microshift has aimed its latest groupset on the gravel market. The segment is booming and Microshift, as the challenger brand, wants a slice of the action. Microshift is presenting Sword as a budget-focused option ready to fill the gap.</p>\n<p>In fact, speaking to BikeRadar, Juffer confirmed the brand is specifically taking on Shimano with the release of Sword because he believes “gravel is an area where Shimano is not releasing mid-tier products”.</p>\n<p>“If you want to produce a gravel bike for less than $2,000, you have to use Tiagra or Sora,” says Juffer.</p>\n<p>“These groups are traditional compact doubles, don’t have low enough gears for wider bike tyres, don’t have a clutch [on the rear derailleur] and the hoods aren’t designed for flared handlebars. They’re great road groups but don’t really fit a gravel platform that well.”</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Shimano GRX crankset\" title=\"Shimano GRX crankset\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Microshift has openly said it is trying to exploit a hole in the market.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>As such, Microshift believes, Juffer says, “there is room for a cable-actuated gravel group to slot under GRX” and the brand wants to “put as much quality and innovation into it as possible”.</p>\n<p>Although Juffer didn’t comment on SRAM’s offerings, it’d be fair to say SRAM has looked to exploit the rising popularity of gravel, in part, with the repositioning of Apex as a 1x-only gravel groupset.</p>\n<p>However, as I’ve already covered, it’s now effectively a mid-range groupset, despite its entry-level positioning in the SRAM line-up.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, we’re expecting to see a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/shimano-grx-r820/\">12-speed update to Shimano GRX</a>, but there’s no news on whether Shimano will continue to offer cheaper 10- or 11-speed options for GRX. <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/campagnolo-ekar-groupset-review/\">Campagnolo Ekar</a>, while offering 13 speeds, is undoubtedly a premium affair.</p>\n<h2>History repeats itself</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Shimano Deore M6100 mountain bike groupset\" title=\"Shimano Deore M6100 mountain bike groupset\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> While we rate Shimano’s Deore M6100 groupset, it’s hardly affordable.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Microshift looks well-placed to grab a slice of the gravel market then – and we’ve already witnessed a similar tale on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-best-mountain-bikes-under-500/\">entry-level mountain bikes</a>.</p>\n<p>Shimano and SRAM continue to dominate but supply issues have now resulted in Microshift finding a place with Advent X: a 10-speed MTB groupset described as “a top-performing drivetrain at a bargain price” by BikeRadar’s senior technical editor, Alex Evans, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-mountain/microshift-advent-x-drivetrain-review/\">in our review</a>.</p>\n<p>Again, Microshift has exploited a gap in the market. Shimano doesn’t offer a clutch-equipped 1x <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/mountain-bike-groupsets-everything-you-need-to-know/\">MTB groupset</a> until its mid-range Deore M6100 groupset. Though a good option that we’ve <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/shimano-deore-m6100-groupset-review/\">scored highly in our review</a>, it still sits several tiers above the more agricultural Altus, Acera and Alivio options that will now be superseded by Cues.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"TRP EVO12 complete cable drivetrain with crankset, cassette, chainring, chain, rear derailleur and gear shifter\" title=\"TRP EVO12 Drivetrain First Look\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> TRP is also looking to make a dent in the mountain bike groupset market.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Alex Law</i></span></div>\n<p>SRAM is more competitive here with its SX and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-mountain/sram-nx-eagle-review/\">NX Eagle</a> 12-speed 1x drivetrains. These groups are commonly found on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bikes-under-1000-2/\">mountain bikes for less than £1,000</a>, however parts for them haven’t always been plentiful in supply and Microshift Advent X undercuts them still.</p>\n<p>There are bikes made by Cannondale, Kona and Jamis that see the Advent X groupset specced for just below the £700 mark and even Specialized specs the 9-speed version of the groupset on its Sirrus X 3.0 hybrid bike.</p>\n<p>At the other end of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/mountain-bike-groupsets-everything-you-need-to-know/\">MTB groupset</a> market, we’ve now also got <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/first-look-the-evo12-is-trps-first-complete-drivetrain/\">TRP’s EVO12</a>, as a 12-speed drivetrain for riders who want premium mechanical shifting. With the electronification of high-end groupsets, TRP, like Microshift, is looking to fill a gap as some riders are demanding.</p>\n<h2>Which brands will be speccing Microshift Sword on their bikes?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Microshift Sword crankset on Cannondale Topstone\" title=\"Microshift Sword crankset on Cannondale Topstone\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> We expect Microshift Sword to make a stab at the market.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Microshift</i></span></div>\n<p>With Microshift only just lifting the lid on Sword, it’s early days in terms of the groupset’s adoption. However, we contacted some big-name brands to see if they will be speccing Microshift Sword on any of their bikes.</p>\n<p>While Giant, Trek and Merida confirmed they won’t be, Canyon said Sword “isn’t something we have any plans of including just yet, but that’s not to say it won’t ever happen”.</p>\n<p>Decathlon, on the other hand, has confirmed it will be speccing Sword on its bikes from 2024. Decathlon produces some of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/cheap-gravel-bike/\">best budget gravel bikes</a>, and has a history of using Microshift components, so it’s little surprise to see the European mega-retailer place an early order on Sword.</p>\n<p>While it remains to be seen if Sword will be widely specced across entry-level gravel bikes, we’d expect others to follow suit. Microshift seems to be carving a niche for itself and offering real competition at the entry-level market.</p>\n<p>And that can only be a good thing for riders.</p>","author":"Oscar Huckle","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"8fcb2721194247ad68c43d26f3b46c47e705142dafdf9d7d39f95c367c1ed972","category":"Cycling"}
