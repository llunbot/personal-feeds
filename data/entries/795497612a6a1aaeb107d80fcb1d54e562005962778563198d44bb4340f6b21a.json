Introducing buckling spring switches over a capacitive printed circuit board (PCB) in the early 80s, they’re considered the grandfather of mechanical switches. Despite their prestige, Model F keyboards were no more by the following decade and, due to outdated technologies, have become very rare and can be tough to use with a modern computer. Targeting retro keyboard fans who don't want to deal with long searches, repairs, or mods, Model F Labs re-creates IBM's Model F keyboards with modern OS support, and it recently introduced the iconic buckling spring switches in a classic full-sized keyboard, as well as some unique form factors.</p>\n<h2>Buckling springs</h2>\n<p>With the tactile buckling of the internal spring and the click of the flipper against the capacitive PCB, the keys in IBM's Model F keyboards inspired today's mechanical switches. Popular in banks, they replaced IBM's beam spring keyboards with a lower-cost design that was also less bulky. Early Model F keyboards had keycaps that were the same size, and keycaps were also removable for customization.</p>\n<p>By 1985, IBM was making <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/11/why-i-use-a-20-year-old-ibm-model-m-keyboard/\">Model M keyboards</a>, also popular among keyboard collectors today, with keys featuring a buckling spring over the membrane and lower manufacturing costs.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1929037#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1929037&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"795497612a6a1aaeb107d80fcb1d54e562005962778563198d44bb4340f6b21a","category":"Tech"}
