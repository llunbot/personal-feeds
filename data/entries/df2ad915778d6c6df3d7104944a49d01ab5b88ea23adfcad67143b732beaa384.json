The update should be widely released in September, but it will take time for accessory makers to add support for this pairing process to their apps.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/21/ios-18-airpods-like-pairing-for-more-accessories/\">iOS 18 Expands Convenient AirPods-Like Pairing to More Bluetooth and Wi-Fi Accessories</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-expands-convenient-airpods-like-pairing-to-more-bluetooth-and-wi-fi-accessories.2429744/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"df2ad915778d6c6df3d7104944a49d01ab5b88ea23adfcad67143b732beaa384","category":"Apple"}
