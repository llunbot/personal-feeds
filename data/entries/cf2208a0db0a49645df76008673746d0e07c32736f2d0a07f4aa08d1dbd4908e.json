Since then, Pirelli has massively expanded its bike tyre range, selling the P Zero Race performance road tyre range and treaded Cinturato tyres for gravel riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has now refreshed the Cinturato, with the new Cinturato Evo TLR aimed at <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-winter-road-bike-tyres-stay-puncture-free\">all-weather endurance</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-all-road-bikes\">all-road</a> use. There’s a new SmartEvo AS compound introduced, which Pirelli says is its best all-season rubber. It includes in excess of 50% recycled and bio-based materials, while the natural rubber incorporated into the compound comes from <a href=\"https://fsc.org/en/label\" target=\"_blank\">FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) certified</a> sources.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+1\"><img width=\"970\"

grip, Pirelli claims that the new compound helps to lower vibration and enhance ride comfort. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cinturato Evo TLR, as its name suggests, is <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-fit-tubeless-tyres\">tubeless-ready</a>, and Pirelli says that the multi-layer Techwall+ Road reinforcement in its 60TPI casing ensures good puncture protection without compromising the tyre’s flexibility.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related

Cinturato Evo TLR in five nominal widths: 28mm, 30mm, 32mm, 35mm and 40mm. Rather than just leaving the rider to figure out how wide the tyre will actually sit on different width rims, it provides its own width and outside wheel/tyre diameter measurements. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So while on a 19mm internal width rim the 28mm tyre will measure 28mm, Pirelli says that on a 21mm rim it measures 29mm and on a 23mm rim 30mm, all with 686mm outside diameter – useful measurements to make sure that the tyre will work with your wheels and your frame’s tyre clearance. The claimed weight for the 28mm tyre is 350g.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The equivalent figures for the 40mm tyre are 39mm on a 21mm internal width rim, 40mm on a 23mm wide rim and 41mm on a 25mm rim, with a 490g weight. The 710mm outside diameter would fall foul of the UCI’s 700mm maximum diameter regulation, although the 35mm tyre would come in at 698mm, according to Pirelli.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as all-black, the 28mm, 30mm and 32mm tyres can be purchased with tan sidewalls, called Classic, and with white sidewalls, named Retro. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 40mm width mirrors that of the recently launched P Zero Race TLR 40mm tyre, which <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/pirelli-p-zero-race-tlr-40mm-road-tyre-review\">we recently reviewed</a>. It’s the new frontier in ever-wider road bike tyres and offers enhanced all-road capabilities as well. Pirelli suggests there’s wider to come too.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/pirelli-cinturato-evo-tlr-tyres\">New Pirelli Cinturato Evo TLR tyre’s rubber includes over 50% recycled and bio-based materials</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Pnorman","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"cf2208a0db0a49645df76008673746d0e07c32736f2d0a07f4aa08d1dbd4908e","category":"Cycling"}
