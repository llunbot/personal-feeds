After nine stages, Jonas Vingegaard (Jumbo-Visma) has launched his defence of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/history-of-the-tour-de-france-jerseys\" target=\"_blank\"><em>maillot jaune</em></a> and is leading the general classification standings by 17 seconds over Tadej Pogaƒçar (UAE Team Emirates) on the first rest day. Despite being a two-time winner at his fourth Tour, Pogaƒçar somehow still qualifies for the youth classification and is wearing the white jersey. ¬†</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Neilson Powless (EF Education-EasyPost) has a firm grasp on the polka dots of the King of the Mountains classification and Jasper Philipsen (Alpecin-Deceuninck) leads the sprinters‚Äô points classification and its new darker green jersey, which needs to be reverted immediately alongside the now-gold combativity numbers. They‚Äôre red and should stay red.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><p><em>Results powered by <a href=\"https://firstcycling.com/race.php?r=17&amp;y=2023&amp;s=9\" target=\"_blank\">FirstCycling.com</a></em></p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Let‚Äôs get into our first rest day recap of the Tour de France.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/mark-cavendish-interview-2\">‚ÄòI‚Äôm a different person‚Äô: Mark Cavendish profile</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/combination-jersey\">Does the combination jersey at the Tour de France have a place in modern cycling?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/how-to-watch-and-live-stream-the-tour-de-france\">How to watch and live stream the Tour de France 2023</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\">Men‚Äôs Tour de France 2023: Stage-by-stage preview and everything you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>1.

The Dane gained time over his main rival on Stage 5 from Pau to Laruns, which was won by Jai Hindley (Bora-Hansgrohe) but the distance between Vingegaard and Pogaƒçar was the bigger talking point. Vingegaard finished 38 seconds down on Hindley but Pogaƒçar was a further minute behind. Was this already the end of his GC battle?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course not. This is cycling and anything can happen. The next day Jumbo-Visma swarmed a lonely Pogaƒçar over the summit of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/classic-tour-de-france-climbs-col-du-tourmalet\" target=\"_blank\">Col du Tourmalet</a>, working hard for their queen bee. The Slovenian was shaking the wrist he had broken at Li√®ge-Bastogne-Li√®ge in April while Wout van Aert kept the pace high. As the roads wound up towards the finish on the Category 1 Cauterets-Cambasque climb, Van Aert pulled off almost to a standstill, getting a much-needed push from some fans to keep him upright and truly putting the super in superdomestique. It was down to the two; <em>mano a mano</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside a flare-flaling fan dripping in polka dots, with less than 3km remaining Pogaƒçar attacked. Vingegaard tried to respond but was forced to take things at his own pace. He couldn‚Äôt close the gap and Pogaƒçar turned the tables with a huge stage victory, bowing as he crossed the finish line. He had clawed back 24 seconds on Vingegaard, who could at least find some consolation in now wearing the <em>maillot jaune</em>. A battle reignited. A fight for the yellow jersey on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Stage 9, the final day before the rest day, Pogaƒçar again distanced Vingegaard on the punishing Puy de D√¥me in the shadows of Poulidor and Anquetil. Ahead, Michael Woods (Israel-Premier Tech) made history, winning his first Tour stage but breaking Movistar‚Äôs Matteo Jorgenson‚Äôs heart in the process. As if his bee sting a few hours prior wasn‚Äôt painful enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vingegaard leads the general classification by 17 seconds from Pogaƒçar.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2.

This would be his final Tour, a race that has brought so much success for the Manx Missile. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years, it is not unfair to say Cavendish has presented a stony demeanour peppered with a ‚Äòwin at all costs‚Äô mentality. However, the last few seasons of his career have been different. A more mellow, embracing Cavendish has spent his final Tour de France beaming, high-fiving fans and shooting basketballs, joking before mountain stages that viewers wouldn‚Äôt see him feature in until the end of the day. Former leadout man Mark Renshaw recently joined his Astana Qazaqstan team to aid his leadout train, albeit from the sidelines. Pieces of the puzzle began to fall together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Stage 5 into Bordeaux, it looked as if the dream would come true. Cavendish kicked, surging ahead of his adversaries. Was he about to take the record outright? Mark Cavendish, on the cusp of stage win number 35, with the finish line beckoning and that familiar sight of nothing but space in front of him, was scuppered by gear issues and, not able to maintain his acceleration, a storming Jasper Philipsen swooped past to win his third stage of this year‚Äôs Tour de France.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the finish, Cavendish said, ‚ÄòThe gears jumped from the 11 to the 12, I had to sit down. The cadence just whacks up. Then it goes back to the 11th. I tried to stand up. I needed to sit down. There was nothing you could do except kind of hope.‚Äô</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just a few days later, on Stage 8 from Libourne to Limoges, a ripple effect swept its way through the peloton. A common occurrence in cycling, nothing out of the ordinary. On a quiet part of a quiet stage. But then cameras cut to Cavendish on the ground. Since the pace hadn‚Äôt been high when the incident happened, surely he‚Äôd get a new bike from the mechanic and be on his way? Optimism drained the longer images remained the same. After a few minuites of doubt, Cavendish was in the back of an ambulance, collarbone broken, forced to abandon. Questions immediately followed on whether this would <em>actually </em>be his final Tour de France given the nature in which it ended. Astana Qazaqstan team manager Alexandre Vinokourov told <a href=\"https://www.lequipe.fr/Cyclisme-sur-route/Actualites/Astana-veut-voir-mark-cavendish-sur-le-tour-de-france-2024/1407396\" target=\"_blank\">L‚ÄôEquipe</a> that he is prepared to offer him an extension. Now we wait.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3.

Anquetil, the defending champion, led the general classification by 56 seconds from Poulidor with two stages remaining. Attack after attack ensued. While Federico Bahamontes and Julio Jimenez were ahead and fought for the stage win, Anquetil and Poulidor only had eyes for one another. Poulidor, so often second to his rival, eked out a gap. Anquetil finished 42 seconds down but won the Tour, it was Poulidor‚Äôs first of three second places.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fast forward to 2023 and Matteo Jorgenson was out in front, the peloton over 15 minutes behind and content to let the breakaway battle for victory. Michael Woods was in a group two minutes behind Jorgenson at the bottom of the climb but he was the man to beat and began picking off the riders in front with ease. Jorgenson looked to be pedalling through treacle in comparison, exhaustion evident in his demeanour. Woods caught and passed the American to win his first Tour de France stage before eyes turned to the GC group. In the final kilometre, Pogaƒçar put the hammer down and dropped Vingegaard on the savage 14% gradient to snatch back eight seconds.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What‚Äôs next?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Stage 10 is a hilly affair that looks ripe for a breakaway (Fred Wright), and the climbs keep coming in the second week, including the Grand Colombier on Stage 13 (unlucky for some?) and the brutal Stage 14, this year‚Äôs <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/etape-du-tour-tips\" target=\"_blank\">√âtape du Tour</a>, which packs in three Category 1 ascents before the <em>Hors Cat√©gorie</em> Col de Joux Plane.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Stage 1 winner: Adam Yates (UAE Team Emirates)</li><li>Stage 2 winner: Victor Lafay (Cofidis)</li><li>Stage 3 winner: Jasper Philipsen (Alpecin-Deceuninck)</li><li>Stage 4 winner: Jasper Philipsen (Alpecin-Deceuninck)</li><li>Stage 5 winner: Jai Hindley (Bora-Hansgrohe)</li><li>Stage 6 winner: Tadej Pogaƒçar (UAE Team Emirates)</li><li>Stage 7 winner: Jasper Philipsen (Alpecin-Deceuninck)</li><li>Stage 8 winner: Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek)</li><li>Stage 9 winner: Michael Woods (Israel-Premier Tech)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Maillot jaune/general classification: Jonas Vingegaard (Jumbo-Visma)</li><li>Maillot blanc/young rider classification: Tadej Pogaƒçar (UAE Team Emirates)</li><li>Maillot √† pois rouges/mountains classification: Neilson Powless (EF Education-EasyPost)</li><li>Maillot vert/points classification: Jasper Philipsen (Alpecin-Deceuninck)</li></ul>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/tour-de-france-2023-week-1\">Tour de France Rest Day Recap: Jonas Vingegaard in yellow as Tadej Pogaƒçar makes gains, Mark Cavendish crashes out of final Tour, Puy de D√¥me returns after 35 years</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Robyn Davidson &#124; Editorial Assistant","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"7b5159e4f9539fe35408e0a9f1f63320cb112e1c8b321dc65b7488bc3eda3239","category":"Cycling"}
