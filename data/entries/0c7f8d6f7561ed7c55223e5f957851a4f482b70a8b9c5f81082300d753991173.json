Now, a new <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-no-longer-in-talks-to-join-openai-investment-round-e3be3e66\">report</a> from The Wall Street Journal claims that Apple has abandoned those plans.</p>\n<p>The article simply says Apple \"fell out of the talks to join the round.\" The round is expected to close in a week or so and may raise as much as $6.5 billion for the growing Silicon Valley company. Had Apple gone through with the move, it would have been a rare event—though not completely unprecedented—for Apple to invest in another company that size.</p>\n<p>OpenAI is still expected to raise the funds it seeks from other sources. The report claims Microsoft is expected to invest around $1 billion in this round. Microsoft has already invested substantial sums in OpenAI, whose GPT models power Microsoft AI tools like Copilot and Bing chat.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053378#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053378&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0c7f8d6f7561ed7c55223e5f957851a4f482b70a8b9c5f81082300d753991173","category":"Tech"}
