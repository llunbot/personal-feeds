His Android TV app Downloader, which combines a web browser with a file manager, was <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/05/google-bans-downloader-app-after-tv-firms-complain-it-can-load-a-pirate-website/\">suspended by Google Play in May</a> after several Israeli TV companies complained that the app could be used to load a pirate website.</p>\n<p>Google <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/06/google-un-bans-downloader-app-but-developer-still-mad-about-broken-dmca/\">reversed that suspension</a> after three weeks. But Downloader has been suspended by Google Play again, and this time the reason is even harder to understand. Based on a vague DMCA notice, it appears that Downloader was suspended simply because it can load <a href=\"https://www.warnerbros.com/\">the Warner Bros. website</a>.</p>\n<p>Downloader is similar to standard web browsers in that it lets users access both legal and illegally shared content. The app can be used for general web surfing and can download files from a website when a user inputs the desired URL. According to Saba, the app itself contains no infringing content, nor does it direct users to infringing content.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1986644#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1986644&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"00ca3fdbdb0af198d38a058b8f0cfc87258bdbbe42e2ec4ea7f9613698a9f97a","category":"Tech"}
