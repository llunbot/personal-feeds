It's one that can tackle the Nürburgring as well as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-emission_zone\">Low Emission Zone</a>, though it's probably more at home at the track; this is no city car like the Cygnet, nor the much-needed plug-in version of the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/01/aston-martins-new-suv-is-actually-extremely-good-the-2021-dbx-review/\">DBX SUV</a> (due in 2024). Instead, the boffins from Warwickshire have brought forth a mid-engined supercar with a V8 and two electric motors, a carbon-fiber chassis, more than 1,300 lbs of downforce, and a total power output of 937 hp. Oh, and it's also James Bond's new car.</p>\n<p>At this point, you can be forgiven for having a bit of <em>deja vu</em>, but much has happened <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/03/aston-martins-next-hypercar-will-be-a-hybrid-and-heres-its-new-v6/\">since we last visited Valhalla</a>. Then, the mid-engined plug-in supercar was to be powered in part by a twin-turbo 3.0 L V6. This was being designed in-house by Aston Martin, its first in-house engine design since 1968.</p>\n<p>But later that year, Aston Martin got a new boss, Tobias Moers, who wasn't impressed with the V6's level of development—or lack thereof. Instead, Moers looked to a newly updated technology sharing agreement between Aston Martin and his old employer, Mercedes-AMG, which <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/03/real-f1-to-road-car-tech-the-mercedes-amg-performance-hybrid/\">just happened to have a new performance hybrid system</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1780489#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1780489&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
