The Platforms State of the Union will follow at 1:00 p.m.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/wwdc-2025-arch.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nApple will also be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/20/wwdc-2025-labs-and-community-events/\">hosting a variety of group and one-on-one labs</a> during the week of primarily virtual events, while the company is promoting related community events that will be taking place around WWDC.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Smart Glasses: Everything We Know So Far</h2>\r<br />\nAt its I/O conference this week, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/20/google-android-xr-smart-glasses/\">Google showed off a set of lightweight smart glasses</a> with deep Gemini integration that will rival the Meta Ray-Ban glasses and Apple's rumored future smart glasses, so we thought it would be worth <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/21/apple-smart-glasses-everything-we-know-so-far/\">taking a look at the state of the rumors on Apple's project</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/05/Apple-Glass.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" />\r<br />\nApple's initial smart glasses reportedly won't offer a full augmented reality experience, but they will offer AI capabilities, microphones, and cameras to support capturing photos and video and features similar to visual intelligence on Apple's latest iPhone models that can look up information on the world around you. Apple's first glasses <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/22/apple-smart-glasses-launching-in-2026/\">could arrive by the end of 2026</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Report: Apple's Next-Gen Version of Siri Is 'On Par' With ChatGPT</h2>\r<br />\nAmid a delayed launch for Apple Intelligence-powered Siri enhancements, Apple is looking even further ahead at what it can do to make Siri more competitive with ChatGPT and other chatbots. According to a report, Apple's \"LLM Siri\" is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/19/next-gen-siri-is-on-par-with-chatgpt/\">already considered \"on par\" with ChatGPT internally</a>, but it's going to take a few years to fully swap out the existing \"hybrid\" architecture of Siri with this new \"monolithic model.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Apple-Intelligence-General-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nMeanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/19/siri-to-take-a-backseat-at-wwdc/\">Siri will reportedly take a backseat at WWDC</a> next month as Apple focuses on other Apple Intelligence advances. And in general, Apple is said to be planning to be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/18/apple-to-cut-down-on-early-announcements/\">more cautious going forward about announcing new features that aren't ready to ship</a>, seeking to avoid a repeat of the Siri situation.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>macOS 16: Everything We Know So Far</h2>\r<br />\nApple will be taking the wraps off of macOS 16 and other updates in just a few weeks at WWDC, so we've <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/20/macos-16-everything-we-know-so-far/\">taken a look at what we're expecting to see with the next major update for the Mac</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/macOS-16-visionOS-Inspired-Feature-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nSome design changes seem likely amid rumors that Apple is seeking to create a more consistent interface across its product lines, with some of the inspiration reportedly coming from visionOS. We're also expecting Google Gemini integration as an alternative to ChatGPT, a number of accessibility improvements, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>OpenAI Buys Jony Ive's AI Startup to 'Completely Reimagine What It Means to Use a Computer'</h2>\r<br />\nFormer Apple design chief Jony Ive and several other Apple design team alumni are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/21/openai-buys-jony-ive-ai-startup/\">teaming up with OpenAI in an attempt to build an all-new family of AI-driven devices</a> to revolutionize the way we interact with technology.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/jony-ive-sam-altman.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nOpenAI has acquired Ive's startup by the name of io for $6.5 billion, and they're aiming to create an unobtrusive <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/22/jony-ive-openai-product-third-core-device/\">\"third core device\"</a> that people would likely use alongside a phone and a laptop, and it <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/22/ming-chi-kuo-on-openai-device-design/\">may look something like a neck-worn iPod shuffle</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Fortnite Returns to U.S. App Store</h2>\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/20/fortnite-returns-to-u-s-app-store/\">Popular game Fortnite is once again available in the U.S. App Store</a>, as Apple has finally approved Epic Games' app submission. This is the first time that Fortnite has been on the iOS ‌App Store‌ since 2020, and it <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/21/fortnite-app-store-top-charts/\">quickly went to the top of the App Store charts</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/08/fortnite_apple_featured.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2140\" height=\"1204\" />\r<br />\nApple initially <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/16/apple-fortnite-ios-not-blocked-worldwide/\">did not plan to allow Fortnite back in the ‌App Store‌</a>, but the judge overseeing the ongoing legal battle between the two companies this week suggested that Apple and ‌Epic Games‌ work things out or face more time in court. The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/19/apple-fortnite-us-app-store-dispute/\">judge threatened</a> to require the Apple official that oversees app decisions to appear in person in court, which apparently was enough to spur Apple to allow the game back on the ‌App Store‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>MacRumors Newsletter</h3>\r<br />\nEach week, we publish an email newsletter like this highlighting the top Apple stories, making it a great way to get a bite-sized recap of the week hitting all of the major topics we've covered and tying together related stories for a big-picture view.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSo if you want to have <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/macrumors/may-22-2025\">top stories</a> like the above recap delivered to your email inbox each week, <b><a href=\"http://eepurl.com/OHdUX\">subscribe to our newsletter</a></b>!<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/top-stories/\">Top Stories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/24/top-stories-iphone-17-air-details/\">Top Stories: iPhone 17 Air Details, Apple's Smart Glasses, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/top-stories-iphone-17-air-details-apples-smart-glasses-and-more.2457640/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"MacRumors Staff","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9dd1769de0fc9121ed4989cdb4bf09e0864f616832f2fc47fb371e980fae5eca","category":"Apple"}
