The spacecraft is scheduled to launch on an Ariane 5 rocket at 8:15 am ET (12:15 UTC) from Kourou, French Guiana. It will be broadcast live on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fy-5xNs8FMI\">ESA Web TV</a>.</p>\n<p>The European Space Agency performed high-profile science missions before, including the audacious landing of the Rosetta spacecraft on a comet in 2014 that garnered worldwide attention. Europe also built the Huygens lander that flew aboard NASA's Cassini spacecraft to Saturn and then landed on the moon Titan.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1931278#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1931278&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a7f711c7ebae3e9ffeb298b73a8cfab5614ee2a457b99f8d47798da47a83b1f5","category":"Tech"}
