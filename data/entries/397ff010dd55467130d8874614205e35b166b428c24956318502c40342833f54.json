Apple routinely stops signing older iOS releases over time in order to prevent users from downgrading to an outdated software version.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 16.4 will likely be unsigned later this month, so iPhone users who wish to downgrade to that version have limited time remaining to do so.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>Today apple unsigned:<br /><br />iOS 16.3.1<br />iPadOS 16.3.1 <br />tvOS 16.3.2<br />audioOS 16.3.2</p>â€” Aaron (@aaronp613) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1644522934793281536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 8, 2023</a></blockquote> </div><div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-16/\">iOS 16</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-16/\">iPadOS 16</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-16.238\">iOS 16</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/07/apple-stops-signing-ios-16-3-1/\">Apple Stops Signing iOS 16.3.1 to Prevent Downgrading</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-stops-signing-ios-16-3-1-to-prevent-downgrading.2386226/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"397ff010dd55467130d8874614205e35b166b428c24956318502c40342833f54","category":"Apple"}
