To date, nearly 200 million Americans are fully vaccinated, which is roughly 60 percent of the population, and 44 million are fully vaccinated and boosted.</p>\n<p>\"This is important progress,\" Zients said in a press briefing Friday. \"Vaccines clearly remain our most important tool… If you were fully vaccinated before June, it's time for you to go get your booster. If you're unvaccinated, go get your first shot today. And if your kids are five years or older and not yet vaccinated, get them the protection of the vaccine as well.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1818045#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1818045&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f838cf8dc171293f17521f087239077c0cab1833cd194d24a5155ae8185c969d","category":"Tech"}
