This stand shows the small and large size options, plus their many colors.

The wheels were on a Rocky Mountain Slayer display bike, set up with beefy parts for bike park shredding. If you’re wondering why they’re not on an eMTB, it’s because some riders may choose to run the eMTB wheels on unassisted bikes simply due to their increased strength. The wheelset was officially announced on July 16<sup>th</sup>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Race Face wanted to ensure the Turbine eMTB wheels were strong, but not at the sacrifice of ride quality so they’ve maintained a degree of compliance. The wheels feature front and rear-specific aluminum rims, steel axles, and thicker spokes than Race Face’s Turbine wheelsets. Despite achieving a weight of 2145g per set, Race Face says the Turbine eMTB wheels can handle huge impacts before suffering unrideable levels of damage.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>NOBL prototype dirt jumper rims:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/NOBL-carbon-dj-wheels-on-bike.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/NOBL-carbon-dj-wheels-on-bike.jpg\" alt=\"NOBL carbon prototype rims on dirt jumper\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/NOBL-carbon-dj-wheels-on-bike.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/NOBL-carbon-dj-wheels-on-bike-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/NOBL-carbon-dj-wheels-on-bike-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/NOBL-carbon-dj-wheels-on-bike-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/NOBL-carbon-dj-wheels-on-bike-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/NOBL-carbon-dj-wheels-on-bike-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At <a href=\"https://noblwheels.com/\">NOBL</a>’s booth, I spotted this dirt jumper bike with some deep-dish carbon rims parked ‘prototype’, so I had to ask some questions! Upon request from some of their team riders, NOBL crafted some 26” carbon rims for dirt jumping. At this point, they have no plans to produce the wheels, but I’m told the team riders are pretty happy with them. One of NOBL’s employees mentioned the lightweight rims make it a bit easier to spin 720s!</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/crankworx-whistler-booth-finds-prototypes-and-new-products/\">Crankworx Whistler – Booth Finds, Prototypes and New Products</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Steve Fisher","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"9ad6b8daecd5b1de58cd09366c08068172befffb86978bf455b72041d8d59811","category":"Cycling"}
