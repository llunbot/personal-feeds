But following widespread reporting of the change, Microsoft has either backtracked or clarified its language to remove the note about Control Panel being deprecated in favor of the Settings app. Here's what the original post said, as also <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20240822093623/https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/system-configuration-tools-in-windows-f8a49657-b038-43b8-82d3-28bea0c5666b\">preserved by the Internet Wayback Machine</a> (emphasis ours):</p>\n<p>\"The Control Panel is a feature that's been part of Windows for a long time. It provides a centralized location to view and manipulate system settings and controls,\" the support page explains. \"Through a series of applets, you can adjust various options ranging from system time and date to hardware settings, network configurations, and more. <strong>The Control Panel is in the process of being deprecated in favor of the Settings app, which offers a more modern and streamlined experience.</strong>\"</p>\n\n<p>The current version of the page has changed that last sentence considerably. It now says that \"<strong>many of the settings in Control Panel are in the process of being migrated to the Settings app, which offers a more modern and streamlined experience</strong>.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045029#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045029&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"763061c9e392260faeb83a239e542497885bdcf9156b419b63d628f533e5a611","category":"Tech"}
