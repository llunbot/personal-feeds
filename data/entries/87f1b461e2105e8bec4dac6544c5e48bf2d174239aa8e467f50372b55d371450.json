Normally, a Ford Econoline E-250 van would not be the sort of thing to warrant even a cocked eyebrow. But this particular gray van is not your average Econoline—it's a fully kitted-out surveillance wagon. However, it's not <a href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/802909/why-do-i-see-fbi-surveillance-van-in-my-wi-fi-list/\">one of those vans that sometimes shows up in a list of SSIDs</a>. Its time in government service was spent surveilling stuff for NASA.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://chicagomotors.com/330199/2006-Ford-Econoline\">For sale in Chicago</a>, the 2006 Econoline E-250 has remarkably few miles on the odometer—just 1,863. The $26,795 asking price is a lot higher than price guides suggest for an example of that vintage, but those price guides don't consider the retractable cameras, radios, audio and video recorders, and monitors that take up much of this van's interior.</p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/035b733447b3dab97b5e4d9c78ebe4ac29269931.jpg\" /><p>(credit: Chicago Motors)</p></div>\n<p>Per a manufacturer's plate, the van was converted by Innovative Surveillance Technology in Florida on behalf of NASA's Protective Services division. <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/centers/wstf/about_us/protective_services/index.html\">NASA's website</a> explains that among its duties, Protective Services enforces \"state and federal laws and administrative regulations, providing emergency medical care, fire and rescue services, and providing an appropriate incident response to any situation.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1964294#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1964294&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
