When he first became head of Roscosmos in 2022, Borisov said Russia would leave the station partnership \"after\" 2024, which was interpreted as shortly thereafter. Later, Russia committed to working with NASA to keep the orbital outpost flying only through 2028. The US space agency has expressed a consistent desire to keep flying the station until 2030, after which point it hopes that private space station operators can provide one or more replacement facilities.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/12/russian-space-chief-says-country-will-fly-on-space-station-until-2030/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/12/russian-space-chief-says-country-will-fly-on-space-station-until-2030/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"97349e6f605c1f7702534f4070d0ee8c19ec94e0601241fe87086781b4b6eb8a","category":"Tech"}
