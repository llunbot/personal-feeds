Like how architectural “styles” are merely products of the building’s environment – from storm shutters, adobe construction, hurricane stars, and low-lying, overhanging rooflines in desert architecture – bikes evolve over time to reflect the terrain they are ridden on.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1023\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/jobst-brandt-portola-tom-ritchey.jpeg?fit=1200,1023&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/jobst-brandt-portola-tom-ritchey.jpeg?w=1536&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/jobst-brandt-portola-tom-ritchey.jpeg?resize=1200,799&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/jobst-brandt-portola-tom-ritchey.jpeg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w\" /></p>\n<p><em>Jobst, Tom and crew, Portola, Photo: Ray Hosler, via <a href=\"https://ritcheylogic.com/blog/tom-ritchey-a-tribute-to-jobst\" target=\"_blank\">Ritchey Logic</a></em></p>\n<p>As gravel went from weirdos underbiking on ‘cross bikes or legends like Jobst Brandt tackling rough terrain on 28 mm tires to road racing 2.0, people might be left confused and asking, “What is gravel?”</p>\n<p>I bring this up because I feel like it’s not discussed enough in bike media. In doing so, I’m hinting at a two-part issue. Modern gravel bikes, as accepted by the masses, are just road bikes with fatter tires, and modern gravel bikes made by large corporations in the bike industry are, by and large, gravel racing bikes in terms of fit, particularly stack height.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, I would argue that a majority of people riding gravel bikes are probably not racing.

Gravel is subjective. It’s a vernacular. What defines gravel is based on what your local gravel looks like. In some places, hardpack dirt roads with rolling hills are gravel. As such, a gravel road bike fits the bill. In other locales, gravel can include steep and long rough and rocky climbs with techy descents. In those places, I think a gravel bike ought to be defined differently.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/TownTowersGravelMiguel-23.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/TownTowersGravelMiguel-23.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/TownTowersGravelMiguel-23.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/TownTowersGravelMiguel-23.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/06/TownTowersGravelMiguel-23.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><em>New Mexico “gravel”</em></p>\n<p>Think of the famous gravel in the Flint Hills or the Driftless Region as those locales define gravel versus what we have here in the Southern Rockies: sustained, steep climbing through very rocky terrain. I think bikes with taller stack numbers are what gravel bikes <em>ought to be, </em>and these bikes differ drastically from <em>gravel racing bikes</em>.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/Cotic-Escapade-853-Gravel-Bike-Review-12.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/Cotic-Escapade-853-Gravel-Bike-Review-12.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/Cotic-Escapade-853-Gravel-Bike-Review-12.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/Cotic-Escapade-853-Gravel-Bike-Review-12.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/Cotic-Escapade-853-Gravel-Bike-Review-12.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/Cotic-Escapade-853-Gravel-Bike-Review-12.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/Cotic-Escapade-853-Gravel-Bike-Review-12.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/Cotic-Escapade-853-Gravel-Bike-Review-12.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-54.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-54.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-54.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-54.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-54.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/09/Tumbleweed-Stargazer-Touring-Bike-Review-21.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/09/Tumbleweed-Stargazer-Touring-Bike-Review-21.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/09/Tumbleweed-Stargazer-Touring-Bike-Review-21.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/09/Tumbleweed-Stargazer-Touring-Bike-Review-21.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/09/Tumbleweed-Stargazer-Touring-Bike-Review-21.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/09/Tumbleweed-Stargazer-Touring-Bike-Review-21.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/09/Tumbleweed-Stargazer-Touring-Bike-Review-21.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/09/Tumbleweed-Stargazer-Touring-Bike-Review-21.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><em>Cotic Escapade (gravel road), left, Ouroboros (adventure gravel?) middle, Tumbleweed Stargazer (drop-bar mountain bike) right.</em></p>\n<h3>Taxonomy: What is the Ouroboros?</h3>\n<p>In the same ways I <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/hudski-doggler-review/\" target=\"_blank\">jokingly picked on the Hudski Doggler</a> for being a mashup of a mountain bike and a gravel bike, the Ouroboros is the drop-bar version of that evolutionary meddling. The Doggler is the flat-bar mutation, and the Ouroboros is the drop-bar deviation.</p>\n<p>A gravel road bike and a mountain bike had a love child, and the dominant and recessive genes played a game of back alley craps to determine what this offspring would look like. The rear end of the bike is non-boost, the crank chain line is road, the tire size is limited to 50 mm, which is a gravel tire size, but the stack is high, you run a short stem, and it has a compact triangle with a sloping top tube like a mountain bike. The build kit I reviewed comes specced with a <em>cute widdle suspension fowk</em>.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-56.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-56.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-56.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-56.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-56.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Yet, it is not a drop-bar mountain bike because it is not a modern mountain bike. For a bike to be a modern mountain bike, I believe it needs to meet two criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>148 mm boost rear hub spacing</li>\n<li>&gt; 2.2″ tire clearance</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Keep in mind, this only applies to modern bikes, as in bikes currently offered new today. The simplest breakdown is: if a bike has 148 mm MTB boost spacing and a MTB chain line/crankset, it’s a mountain bike. If it has 142 mm road/gravel spacing and a road chain line/crankset, it’s a road/gravel bike at its core.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1896\" height=\"1264\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Bruce_Gordon_Kona_Ouroboros.jpg?fit=1200,1264&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Bruce_Gordon_Kona_Ouroboros.jpg?w=1896&amp;quality=75 1896w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Bruce_Gordon_Kona_Ouroboros.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Bruce_Gordon_Kona_Ouroboros.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Bruce_Gordon_Kona_Ouroboros.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><em>My 2012 Bruce Gordon Monster Cross overlaid on top of the 2024 Kona Ouroboros reveals they are close relatives on the bicycle taxonomy family tree.</em></p>\n<p>Following this logic, the Ouroborus, to me, is a gravel bike, even though it exhibits some biomimicry of a drop-bar mountain bike. If it had rack mounts, it’d be a gravel touring bike (like the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2022-bombtrack-beyond-2-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Bombtrack Beyond</a>), and if it had boost spacing and MTB tires, it’d be a drop-bar 29er mountain bike (Like the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/tumbleweed-stargazer-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Tumbleweed Stargazer</a>).

Flat-bar mountain bikes began to get posted here in higher frequency: rigid, hardtail, and full suspension. As a byproduct of my home terrain, I fell in love with riding and bike camping on drop-bar mountain bikes.</p>\n<p>It’s because the terrain here varies, and on almost every ride, I’ll hit singletrack, so a bike with a wide gear range and big, fat tires is favored for one reason or another. This is why I’ve lauded the Tumbleweed Stargazer and <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/singular-gryphon-titanium-touring-bike-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Singular Gryphon</a>.

Yet, through the comparatively slim seat stays and shaped top tube, it actually flexes quite nicely under pedaling load.

I found that the Ouroborus likes to be ridden on the hoods most of the time like a gravel bike, and drop-bar mountain bikes like the Tumbleweed Stargazer are designed to be ridden in the drops. The Stargazer is also very comfortable in the drops on singletrack, the Ouroboros to me is not, I have to ride on the hoods. The two bikes have very similar geometry but the Stargazer has 2 cm more stack, which adds up in terms of comfort while descending.

I think there’s a lot of potential in the platform for Kona in the future as it could be the ultralight kin to the Sutra LTD and a Salsa Cutthroat competitor. As it sits now, it’s more in line with a gravel adventure bike than a proper drop-bar MTB, which bugs me.</p>\n<p>A big caveat ahead:</p>\n<p><strong>If you have no interest in the Ouroborus being a drop-bar MTB, you can skip this section.

For a modern bike, which the Ouroboos is, 142 mm spacing is for gravel and road wheels. If it is to compete with others in the space like the Salsa Cutthroat or Esker Lorax, give it mountain spacing and yes, bigger tires with a mountain bike crank and chainline. The 50 mm tires just don’t cut it for proper drop-bar mountain bike terrain, either. You can always put smaller tires on if you just want to ride gravel roads.</p>\n<p>This brings me to the main issue I have with the Ouroboros; both it and the Sutra LTD need to be boost-spaced bikes to be legit drop-bar mountain bikes. Kona is a mountain bike brand, so why not use mountain bike spacing on the Sutra LTD and Ouroboros?</p>\n<p>Not to mention, MTB wheels are stronger by nature of the hub shell flange spacing, so why not embrace that? Why put the wheels from a gravel racing bike on an all-terrain machine like this?</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1334\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-19.jpg?fit=1200,2000&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-19.jpg?w=1334&amp;quality=75 1334w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-19.jpg?resize=1200,1799&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-19.jpg?resize=768,1151&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-19.jpg?resize=1025,1536&amp;quality=75 1025w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-24.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-24.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-24.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-24.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-24.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Second</strong><span><strong>,</strong> the fork. Ditch the <em>widdle</em> Rudy (1300 g) and go with an 80 mm travel RockShox Recon Gold (1805 g) or the feather light 1276 g Fox 32 Step Cast; those forks rule! Why limit the chainstay tire clearance because the fork in the Supreme build spec only fits a 50 mm tire? The Recon clears a 2.8″ tire! I felt like the marketing of the Ouroboros is misleading on Kona’s site as it states: “run a 29 x 2.5 front tire with the carbon rigid fork…” but the frame does not clear a 2.5″.

It <em>could</em> be a bike for touring or camping with some engineering. Right now, with no rack mounts and by speccing the AXS dropper, running a saddle pack is out of the question since the AXS battery interferes with bikepacking saddle packs.</p>\n<p>Clamping a rack to the seat stays as some rack system use would theoretically work. Still, Kona’s engineers said they couldn’t approve of that method because the ultralight thin seat stays on this very lightweight bike. The only option that Kona approved in an email is a Tailfin-style rack that mounts to the UDH axle and attaches to the seat collar. The brand says they ISO test that junction:</p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote><p><em>“This area is much stronger, there’s an ISO vertical fatigue test that pushes down on the saddle, loading the ST.”</em></p></blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p>This third point always bugs me. I can see why Kona calls this a “multi-day bikepacking” bike because bikepacking bags do not require racks at all; they simply strap to your handlebars, frame, or saddle rails. By that logic, any bike can be a bike for “multi-day bikepacking.” However, even a bikepacking saddle pack won’t work on the Supreme spec due to the AXS dropper battery interference. Granted, the other two specs of the Ouroboros will work with a bikepacking saddle pack since the CR build has a cable dropper and the CR/DL has a rigid post, but the Supreme spec I reviewed won’t.</p>\n<p>Without hammering too hard on the parts spec on the Supreme build kit, I will note that the <a href=\"https://www.salsacycles.com/bikes/2022-cutthroat-c-x01-eagle-axs\" target=\"_blank\">Salsa Cutthroat AXS build</a> is specced with a cable-actuated dropper for this very reason. Or you could abandon the dropper all together and all its advantages for a bike like this and run a rigid post, I suppose.</p>\n<p>This is also coming from someone who would rather take a dedicated touring bike on a multi-day bike camping trip and use racks. It has no bearing whatsoever on my classification of the Ouroborus as an adventure gravel bike.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-7.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-7.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-7.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-7.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-7.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Fourth</strong>, there needs to be a larger size. The 58 cm feels a tad short on me, as a 6’2″, 190 lb human with long legs, so I can’t imagine someone being taller and trying to fit on the 58 cm.</p>\n<p>–</p>\n<p>With these points, I feel like the Ouroboros will solve its identity crisis and evolve to its true potential. Or perhaps that’s a whole new model for Kona? They could call it the <strong>TOURoboros</strong>…</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-49.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-49.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-49.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-49.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-49.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>TL;DR and the Take-Away</h3>\n<p>Look, the Ouroboros is a weird and unique bike; hopefully, this review matches its idiosyncrasies. On the one hand, it’s what I truly believe most people ought to be riding for “gravel,” but on the other, it’s not willing to fully commit to being a true drop-bar mountain bike while exhibiting a bit of biomimicry.</p>\n<p>Most crucially, it lacks the proper touring accoutrements like rack mounts to be considered a multi-day tourer.</p>\n<p>Identity crisis and use case aside, the ride quality is top-notch on a lightweight package that all but disappears on the climbs and commands the descents. With an increase in traction due to the Rudy suspension fork and a piloting position that instills confidence, it’s easy to see what the crew at Kona intended with the Ouroboros. Plus, it’s a really fun bike to rally down a fire road and jump over water bars on!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-10.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-10.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-10.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-10.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-10.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><em>I’d love to see Kona’s <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/wicknasty/\" target=\"_blank\">Barry Wicks</a> rally this bike in a gravel race!</em></p>\n<p>The question is, do you agree with this assessment? Is this the bike for your gravel terrain? If so, the Ouroboros might be the perfect bike for you. If you desire something more robust with rack mounts made for the long haul, there are countless other specimens on the market.</p>\n<p>I’ll give it to Kona, though; the Ouroboros is a fuckin’ cool and unique bike that impressed me. It left me unsure of how to approach this review. I went back and forth on it for months! Pushing paradigms ain’t easy, nor is writing about them, but it happens with big, bold moves like this that evolve the conversation and gravel zeitgeist.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-54.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-54.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-54.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-54.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/Kona-Ouroboros-Supreme-Review-54.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Pros</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Lightweight</li>\n<li>Proper stack</li>\n<li>31.6 mm dropper compatible</li>\n<li>Off-road tuned geometry</li>\n<li>Plenty of front triangle bottle or bag bosses</li>\n<li>Great parts spec</li>\n<li>40 mm suspension</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cons</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Tire size limited by suspension fork (50 mm)</li>\n<li>Supreme spec’s AXS dropper interferes with bikepacking saddle packs</li>\n<li>Head tube gusset in size 58 cm is obtuse</li>\n<li>Could use a larger size than 58 cm</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Highly Subjective Cons</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Needs an 80 mm suspension fork</li>\n<li>Non-boost spacing</li>\n<li>Road chain line (this is not a road bike!)</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Check out more at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=b826eaf3-114d-442c-83fc-42ed06e86479&amp;website_id=6ec3743b-a948-4c16-9d12-4b79ac107f25&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.konaworld.com%2Fpages%2Fkona-ouroboros\" target=\"_blank\">Kona</a>!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/kona-ouroborus-supreme-review/\">Kona Ouroborus Supreme Review: Next-Gen Gravel</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"70eb9f5e5fc40e83425f89eda213ff197d5149a98c742966942f8eb6a4395266","category":"Cycling"}
