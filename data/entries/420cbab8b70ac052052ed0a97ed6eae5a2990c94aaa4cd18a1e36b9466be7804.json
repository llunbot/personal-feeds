On a Mac or MacBook, the keyboard shortcuts for this are different to other devices, so if you are coming from Windows you might be confused.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll explain the simple steps you need to take to cut, copy and paste on a Mac. Our tips will help you cut and paste on a MacBook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll also cover how to copy and paste using the keyboard on a Mac and copy and paste using a Mac mouse or a trackpad, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673393/how-to-copy-and-paste-on-mac.html#toc-3\">how to paste without formatting</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673393/how-to-copy-and-paste-on-mac.html#toc-5\">how to copy multiple items on Mac</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673393/how-to-copy-and-paste-on-mac.html#toc-6\">how to copy and paste between Macs and iPhones</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main difference between Windows and Macs is the key you need to press – on a Mac this is the Command key. It has a ⌘ symbol on it and it is located next to the space bar. Read:  <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676495/where-is-the-command-key.html\">Where is the Command key?</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may also require the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/option-key-mac-3462401//\">Option key</a>, which on some Mac keyboards is marked as the Alt key.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>At a glance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These are the basic keyboard combinations you need:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Copy: Command + C</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cut: Command + X</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Paste: Command + V</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to copy on a Mac or MacBook</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to copy something on a Mac? Here’s what to do:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Highlight the text/object you want to copy: If it’s a word double-click on it, if it’s a sentence or a paragraph click at the beginning and drag your cursor to the end of the section, or click at the top of a section, press shift, and then click at the bottom of the section.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Copy the selection by pressing Command + C, or Cut with Command + X. Both save the selected text/object to the pasteboard, but Copy leaves it in place while Cut removes it.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3688537/copy_mac_thumb.png\" alt=\"Copy Mac\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to paste on a Mac or MacBook</h2>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>As above, you need to first select the text or object you want to copy or cut. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Then press Command + C to copy, or Command + X to cut.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Put the cursor where you want to place the text/object, and paste by pressing Command + V.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that the target can be in a different document or even an entirely different application. Or even on a different device, for that matter – we’ll explain how you can copy and paste from your Mac to your iPhone or vice versa below.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3688537/paste_mac_thumb.png\" alt=\"Paste Mac\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to paste without formatting</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We find that there is nothing more frustrating than copying and pasting from one document to another, or from one application to another, only to find that it also copies over the formatting (such as the font and text size). This is annoying if you have different formatting in the document you are working on and it makes things look mismatched. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To avoid this, you can use a command that makes sure the pasted text follows the formatting of the paragraph or document it’s joining, rather than the one it just left behind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In that case, you need to follow these steps:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Select the text or object you want to copy or cut by pressing Command + C to copy, or Command + X to cut.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Put the cursor where you want to place the text/object, and Paste by pressing Command + Option/Alt + Shift + V.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3688537/copy_without_formatting_mac_thumb.png\" alt=\"Copy no formatting Mac\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s quite a key combo, but if you can manage it you will get text pasted in the format of your destination document or application.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This keyboard shortcut works in Apple Pages, but it can vary between apps, so if Command + Option/Alt + Shift + V doesn’t work try Command + Shift + V.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are using Microsoft Word you need to click on Paste in the menu and choose Keep Text Only. You can set this as the default paste if you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cut and paste with your mouse</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Most people use the Command shortcuts listed above, but there are alternatives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could just use your mouse:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Select the text you want to copy (either by double-clicking on a word, or clicking and dragging to select more).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Right-click on the selection.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Select Cut or Copy.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Right-click where you want to paste the text and choose Paste.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Unsure how to right-click? Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671652/how-to-right-click-on-a-mac.html\">How to right-click on a Mac</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cut and paste via the menus </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, you can use the menus (app dependent):</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Select the text you want to copy.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>In the menu choose Edit.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Select Cut or Copy.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Right-click where you want to paste the text and choose Paste from the menu.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>In Pages there is an option to paste and match style which could be helpful if you want to lose any formatting. Other apps are likely to have a similar option.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to copy multiple items on Mac</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are coming to Mac from Windows you may be wondering if you can copy multiple items to your Clipboard on your Mac so that you can choose what you want to paste.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the Mac doesn’t offer this feature (although we’d love to see it!)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On a PC you can copy up to 24 items from Office documents to the Office Clipboard and paste them into a document, choosing what you want to paste from the task pane. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some clipboard managers available for Mac including: </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jérémy Marchand’s <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/clipboard-center/id599614786&amp;xcust=1-1-673393-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Clipboard Center</a> ($6.99), Apprywhere’s <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/copy-em-clipboard-manager/id876540291&amp;xcust=1-1-673393-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Copy’em Paste</a> ($14.99), FIPLAB’s <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://fiplab.com/apps/copyclip-for-mac&amp;xcust=1-1-673393-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">CopyClip</a> ($7.99/£7.59), maxbor’s <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.maxbor.net/portfolio/copyless/&amp;xcust=1-1-673393-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">CopyLess</a> ($5), Plum Amazing’s <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://plumamazing.com/product/copypaste&amp;xcust=1-1-673393-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">CopyPaste</a> ($30/£23.70) and Stairways Software’s $36 macro utility <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/&amp;xcust=1-1-673393-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Keyboard Maestro</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clipboard histories are available in <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://manytricks.com/butler/&amp;xcust=1-1-673393-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Butler</a> ($20), <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/&amp;xcust=1-1-673393-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">LaunchBar</a> ($35), and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://qsapp.com/&amp;xcust=1-1-673393-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Quicksilver</a> (with the optional, free Clipboard Plugin).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We think that <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.alfredapp.com&amp;xcust=1-1-673393-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Alfred</a> is a good option.
