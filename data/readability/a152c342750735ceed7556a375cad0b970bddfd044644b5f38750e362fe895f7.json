{"title":"Raleigh Stride Cargo e-Bike Coming to the UK with Room to Spare","link":"https://bikerumor.com/2021/07/28/raleigh-stride-cargo-e-bike/","date":1627479026000,"content":"<div id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"><div><p>The new Raleigh Stride <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021/02/03/yuba-powers-up-kombi-e5-compact-cargo-bike-for-entry-level-hauling-by-bike/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cargo e-bike</a> looks something like my dad’s favorite wheelbarrow from back in the day. Durable, light, a little boxy, with a utilitarian colorway — black and yellow. The legacy cargo bike maker couches the Stride as “the new family wagon.”</p><p>Raleigh hasn’t issued a release date for the Stride cargo e-bike, but here’s what we do know.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.raleigh.co.uk/gb/en/campaigns/electric-cargo-bike-2021/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stride cargo e-bike</a> is available in two models — the Stride 2 bike and the Stride 3 trike. The difference between the two lies not only in their wheel count, but their carrying capacity. Raleigh uses a “one size fits all” steel frame build in both styles.</p><p>The front cargo box features a bright-yellow, scaffold-like aluminum frame and a black, hardened EEP-foam container. The cargo boxes themselves have massive spatial capacity – Raleigh claims up to 900 liters of storage per Stride 3 (the equivalent of nine large-capacity backpacks). And the bike’s architecture boasts an average load-bearing capacity of 90 kg (80 kg for Stride 2 models, 100 kg for Stride 3s).</p><p>Raleigh fits the new Stride cargo e-bike with a Bosch Performance Line motor and a 500WH battery. Riders can expect a 30-40 mile range on a full charge, though that average is variable subject to load, terrain, and degree of pedaling.</p><figure id=\"attachment_266715\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-266715\"><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/27162232/raleigh-electric-cargo-bike-stride-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/27162232/raleigh-electric-cargo-bike-stride-2.jpg\" alt=\"Raleigh stride cargo e-bike\" width=\"900\" height=\"600\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/27162232/raleigh-electric-cargo-bike-stride-2.jpg 900w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/27162232/raleigh-electric-cargo-bike-stride-2-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/27162232/raleigh-electric-cargo-bike-stride-2-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/27162232/raleigh-electric-cargo-bike-stride-2-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/27162232/raleigh-electric-cargo-bike-stride-2-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/27162232/raleigh-electric-cargo-bike-stride-2-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/27162232/raleigh-electric-cargo-bike-stride-2-630x420.jpg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb26 src ng ngcb26 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/27162232/raleigh-electric-cargo-bike-stride-2.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/27162232/raleigh-electric-cargo-bike-stride-2.jpg 900w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/27162232/raleigh-electric-cargo-bike-stride-2-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/27162232/raleigh-electric-cargo-bike-stride-2-800x533.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/27162232/raleigh-electric-cargo-bike-stride-2-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/27162232/raleigh-electric-cargo-bike-stride-2-768x512.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/27162232/raleigh-electric-cargo-bike-stride-2-696x464.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/27162232/raleigh-electric-cargo-bike-stride-2-630x420.jpg 630w\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-266715\">Photo/Raleigh</figcaption></figure><p>The powertrain is more than just pedal-assistive, it’s ready to help riders lug a full 90-kg load uphill on a low-carb day. The <a href=\"https://www.enviolo.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Enviolo</a> hub/shifter will aid in jerk-free acceleration.</p><p>Full-length mudguards outline the tires and hefty disc brakes churn away the dirt. Integrated LED lights in front and back provide riders with a little security.</p><p>Raleigh is slating a comprehensive line of Stride cargo accessories, too. Among them: baby and toddler seats, bench cushions, a bike cover, a container box cover, Maxi-Cosi car seat brackets, and a rainfly.</p><h2>Stride Business Cargo</h2><p>The 130-year-old cyclery already offers the Stride in a business-adept design, which it dubs “<a href=\"https://www.raleigh.co.uk/gb/en/offers/e-cargo-bikes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Business Cargo</a>“. Raleigh complements the b2b class with a clean white and black color palette.</p><p>Rather than the wheelbarrow-like open-cargo design of the domestic Stride, the 350-liter Stride 2 and 900-liter 3 Business Cargo editions appear as sophisticated, riding lawnmower doppelgangers.
