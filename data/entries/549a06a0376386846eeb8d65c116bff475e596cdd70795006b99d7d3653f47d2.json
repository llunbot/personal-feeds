The misleading videos are part of a wave of war disinformation that has <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/10/israel-hamas-war-has-x-and-its-users-swimming-in-sea-of-disinformation/\">run rampant across social media</a>Â and highlights just how realistic the heavily modded game can appear at a glance.</p>\n<p>Examples of this trend are not hard to come by. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Sentletse/status/1710892630349848873\">A 22-second clip on X</a> garnered over 10.4 million views as footage of \"Israeli helicopters getting smashed.\" But the clip was originally <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/PD08P-XcRhI\">posted as a YouTube short on October 3</a>, where it was correctly labeled as <em>Arma</em> footage.
