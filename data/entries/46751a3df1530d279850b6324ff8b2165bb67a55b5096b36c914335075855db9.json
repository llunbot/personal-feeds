Like the original Qi, it’s designed to achieve compatibility between products from a wide range of manufacturers, so consumers can buy accessories from one company in full confidence they will work with phones from another… provided both support the standard, of course. Qi2 chargers will even work in the future with both iPhones and Android phones, giving it the advantage over MagSafe accessories (which are limited to Apple products) as the perfect option for mixed-platform households and workplaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Crucially, Qi2 is a much faster charging standard than its predecessor: you can power up your phones at a rate of 15W, compared to 7.5W for the original Qi, slashing the time spent tethered to a power source. In the past this speed was attainable only with proprietary charging standards designed to work with products from just one company, such as MagSafe itself. But Qi2 combines the speed of MagSafe with the versatility of Qi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also gains MagSafe’s signature magnetic capabilities. The Magnetic Power Profile (or MPP) helps to keep the charging pad perfectly aligned, ensuring greater energy-efficiency and safeguarding the device’s long-term battery health.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What to look for in a Qi2 charger</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Consumers are understandably excited about Qi2, and in the coming months you can expect to see a lot of Qi2-certified accessories hitting the market. It’s essential that you make the right choice. Prioritize the following factors:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Certification: Ensure the charger you’re considering is fully certified to meet the Qi2 standard. You deserve the peace of mind of knowing it will work reliably with compatible devices.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Versatility: Don’t just think about a charger for your bedside table. Have you considered how useful a car charger would be? Do you need something that will be useful when you’re on the go? Would you benefit from a multi-device charger that can power up your Apple Watch and AirPods at the same time as your iPhone?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Design and specs: Check you’re getting top-drawer charging speeds, of course, but also consider the strength of the magnetic connection, and (if you’re looking for a car charger) the security of the mounting.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Value for money: Qi2 chargers are likely to be far cheaper than MagSafe ones in any case, but make sure you’re not paying over the odds.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Reputable maker: Finally, we recommend that you choose a company with a proven track record of excellence. Look for positive customer reviews, favorable media coverage, and a history in the industry.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>ESR’s new range of Qi2 accessories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With these criteria in mind, we think you should give strong consideration to the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/731C338C-FB87-45FC-AD9D-421C0EDDE49F?ingress=0&amp;visitId=0c634e01-cb0f-4c25-8a3d-90251b8774f3&amp;tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">brand-new range of Qi2</a> fast chargers which ESR is unveiling at this year’s <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.esrgear.com/ces-2024/&amp;xcust=1-1-2194601-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">CES tech conference</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Boasting full certification for the Qi2 standard – so you’ll be compatible, at top charging speeds, with a huge range of devices – ESR’s range includes the first Qi2 car charger (which will be available later in January on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CM3DCWQY?maas=maas_adg_B54B51EFEC71D1799A1CB02C8F126189_afap_abs&amp;ref_=aa_maas&amp;tag=maas&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> as well as on <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=24915&amp;awinaffid=959485&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.esrgear.com%2Fproducts%2Fqi2-magnetic-wireless-car-charger-halolock%2F&amp;clickref=1-1-2194601-1-0-0\" target=\"_blank\">ESR’s official store</a>) and a charger that works with Apple Watch and AirPods as well as iPhone.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Qi2 Magnetic Wireless Car Charger: Boasting 15W fast charging, customizable viewing angles, a 1,600g magnetic connection and secure mounting options for both air vent and dashboard, this is a bargain at just $29.99.
