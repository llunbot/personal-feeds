{"title":"Brydge's MAX+ Keyboard for 11-Inch iPad Pro Now Available","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/12/brydge-max-keyboard-11-ipad-pro/","date":1636747512000,"content":"Earlier this year, we <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/04/brydge-keyboard-hands-on/\">took a look at Brydge's top-of-the-line MAX+ keyboard and trackpad combo</a> for the 12.9-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, a fairly close competitor to Apple's pricier Magic Keyboard.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/brydge-max-plus-ipad-pro-11.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nA version of the <a href=\"https://www.pntra.com/t/TUJGRkhJR0JGS0lMSkxCRkpFRktK?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brydge.com%2Fproducts%2Fbrydge-max-plus-for-ipad-pro%3Fvariant%3D39674056966249\">MAX+ for the 11-inch iPad Pro (all generations) and fourth-generation iPad Air</a> is now available, offering the same experience as its larger sibling but for Apple's smaller tablets. The 11-inch version of the MAX+ is priced at $199.99, which is $100 less than Apple's Magic Keyboard, and it comes in Space Gray, Silver, and White options.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe MAX+ snaps onto the magnetic back of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> or ‌iPad Pro‌, but connects over Bluetooth rather than through the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/smart-connector/\">Smart Connector</a> used by Apple's Magic Keyboard. This also means the MAX+ can't draw power from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> and must be charged separately about every three months, according to Brydge.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOtherwise, you'll get a similar experience to the Magic Keyboard, with backlit keys that feel good under the fingers and a solid amount of travel, as well as a large multi-touch trackpad. The keyboard also includes a row of shortcut keys to give you quick access media controls, brightness, and more.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Brydge MAX+ for the <a href=\"https://www.pntra.com/t/TUJGRkhJR0JGS0lMSkxCRkpFRktK?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brydge.com%2Fproducts%2Fbrydge-max-plus-for-ipad-pro%3Fvariant%3D39674056966249\">11-inch iPad Pro and 10.9-inch iPad Air</a> is available now for $199.99, while the <a href=\"https://www.gopjn.com/t/TUJGRkhJR0JGS0lMSkxCRkpFRktK?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brydge.com%2Fproducts%2Fbrydge-max-plus-for-ipad-pro%3Fvariant%3D39379780075625\">larger version for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro</a> is priced at $249.99.
