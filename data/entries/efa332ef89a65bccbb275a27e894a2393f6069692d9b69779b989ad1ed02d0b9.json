They did, however, eliminate the 128 GB $1099 iPhone Max model. There’s a 128 GB iPhone 15 Pro for $999, but the entry model Max has 256 GB of storage and costs $1199. That’s $100 higher than last year’s 128 GB 14 Pro Max, but the same price as last year’s 256 GB 14 Pro Max. Turns out, inflation adjusted, this year’s prices are <em>lower</em>, not higher.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/13/inflation-adjusted-iphone-pricing\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"efa332ef89a65bccbb275a27e894a2393f6069692d9b69779b989ad1ed02d0b9","category":"Tech"}
