Today: A conversation with psychologists Daniel Simons and Christopher Chabris on the key habits of thinking and reasoning that may serve us well most of the time, but can make us vulnerable to being fooled.</em></p>\n    \n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>It's one of the <a href=\"http://www.theinvisiblegorilla.com/gorilla_experiment.html\">most famous experiments</a> in psychology. Back in 1999, Daniel Simons and Christopher Chabris conducted an experiment on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inattentional_blindness\">inattentional blindness</a>. They asked test subjects to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJG698U2Mvo\">watch a short video</a> in which six people—half in white T-shirts, half in black ones—passed basketballs around. The subjects were asked to count the number of passes made by the people in white shirts. Halfway through the video, a person in a gorilla suit walked into the midst of the players and thumped their chest at the camera before strolling off-screen. What surprised the researchers was that fully half the test subjects were so busy counting the number of basketball passes that they never saw the gorilla.</p>\n<p>The experiment became a viral sensation—helped by the amusing paper title, \"<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10694957/\">Gorillas in Our Midst</a>\"—and snagged Simons and Chabris the 2004 Ig Nobel Psychology Prize. It also became the basis of their bestselling 2010 book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/0307459667/?tag=arstech20-20\"><em>The Invisible Gorilla: How Our Intuitions Deceive Us</em></a>. Thirteen years later, the two psychologists are back with their latest book, published last July, called <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1541602234/?tag=arstech20-20\"><em>Nobody's Fool: Why We Get Taken In and What We Can Do About It</em></a>.  Simons and Chabris have penned an entertaining examination of key habits of thinking that usually serve us well but also make us vulnerable to cons and scams. They also offer some practical tools based on cognitive science to help us spot deceptions before being taken in.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1993161#p3\">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1993161&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e195c1507df13a4e5fbb18771c19e671e3c4fc3fce5768006258002965405c0e","category":"Tech"}
