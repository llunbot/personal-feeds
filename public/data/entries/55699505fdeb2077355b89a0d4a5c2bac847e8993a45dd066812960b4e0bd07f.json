width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Sweet Protection Redeemer 2Vi MIPS\" title=\"Sweet Protection Redeemer 2Vi Søren Wærenskjold (credit Wordup Projects)_002\" />                                            <p>Sweet Protection has announced the Redeemer 2Vi MIPS time trial helmet, which is designed to integrate with the rider’s upper body and shoulders for a reduction in aerodynamic drag.</p>\n<p>After <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/uno-x-new-sweet-protection-time-trial-helmet/\">teasing it at the Volta ao Algarve</a>, and during today’s team time trial in <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/how-to-watch-paris-nice/\">Paris-Nice</a>, the Redeemer 2Vi MIPS has been officially revealed, along with details of its design process.</p>\n<p>According to the Norwegian brand, the Redeemer 2Vi MIPS was designed in conjunction with the Uno-X Pro Cycling Team (which it sponsors) and Kyle Forster, an aerodynamics expert who has previously worked at the Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One Team.</p>\n<p>As noted when the helmet was first spotted, the Redeemer 2Vi MIPS appears to take inspiration from the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/helmets/road-cycling-helmets/poc-tempor-aero-helmet-in-brief-review/\">POC Tempor</a> – a time trial helmet which, though currently in vogue, was <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/poc-tempor-time-trial-helmet-debuts-at-olympics/\">released over a decade ago</a>.</p>\n<p>It’s not just a Tempor imitation, though, because Sweet Protection has added some unique features to the Redeemer 2Vi MIPS, which are claimed to reduce drag even further.</p>\n<p>After grabbing headlines at last year’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/events/tour-de-france/\">Tour de France</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/team-ineos-visors/\">oversized and funkily shaped time trial helmets</a> appear to be cementing their place at the pointy end of the sport.</p>\n<h2>Back to the future</h2>\n<p>The concept of shaping a helmet to integrate with the rider’s upper body isn’t a new idea.</p>\n<p>Aside from the POC Tempor, <a href=\"https://www.moma.org/collection/works/3646\" target=\"_blank\">speed skiing helmets</a> have taken this idea to greater extremes for many years, after all.</p>\n<p>It’s still somewhat rare to see in cycling though, where teardrop-shaped time trial helmets (in various shapes and sizes) have dominated in recent years.</p>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Redeemer 2Vi MIPS uses outwashing shoulder edges to manage airflow around the rider’s shoulders.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Sweet Protection</i></span></div>\n<p>As suspected, the Redeemer 2Vi MIPS is designed to integrate with the rider’s upper body.</p>\n<p>The Redeemer 2Vi MIPS is designed to reduce the overall aerodynamic drag of the rider by more effectively managing the airflow over their torso.</p>\n<p>Forster says the width of the ‘outwashing’ edges have been optimised to account for the differing widths of rider’s shoulders.</p>\n<p>Sweet Protection has produced two sizes of the helmet, which vary in size in this area, one for smaller riders with narrower shoulders, and a larger one for bigger riders with broader shoulders (such as BikeRadar’s senior technical editor, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/author/ashleyquinlan/\">Ashley Quinlan</a>).</p>\n<p>As expected (given it has already been used in the WorldTour), the helmet is UCI approved, meaning the larger size fits within the dimensions specified by the recent <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/tech/2023-uci-rule-changes/\">update to the UCI’s technical regulations</a>.</p>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Redeemer 2Vi will be available in two sizes to suit riders of varying shoulder widths (and head sizes).</span></figcaption><span> <i>Sweet Protection</i></span></div>\n<p>Forster says the central hole on the forehead is a ‘Laminar Flow Bypass Duct’, which is claimed to direct airflow through two internal channels within the helmet.</p>\n<p>Instead of cooling the rider, though (as happens with most helmets), Sweet Protection says this airflow is accelerated through the helmet towards exit slots at the rear edge.</p>\n<p>This then flows over the rider’s shoulders, supposedly reducing the rider’s overall drag.</p>\n<p>Forster says this feature also helps reduce the local air pressure at the front of the helmet, which also reduces aerodynamic drag.</p>\n<div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img

</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>According to Casper von Folsach, performance coach at Uno-X Pro Cycling Team, quoting watt savings at certain speeds is “cumbersome” because of the variations in testing protocols and scenarios among manufacturers and facilities.</p>\n<p>Having been involved with the benchmarking process versus competitors’ helmets, though, Casper says “without a doubt this is the helmet I would prefer our team to be riding”.</p>\n<h2>Design echoes</h2>\n<p>Sweet Protection says Søren Wærenskjold, the 2022 U23 individual time trial World Champion (who rides for Uno-X), was 3D-scanned and used as a model for the new helmet in CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics – essentially a virtual wind tunnel).</p>\n<p>Wind tunnel tests were then performed with Wærenskjold and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/joss-lowden-argon-18-electron-pro/\">Joss Lowden</a>, the former Women’s UCI Hour Record holder and current Uno-X team rider, at the Silverstone

Erik Larsson.</p>\n<p>The result of this design process (which focused on a single rider and their specific riding position) was a helmet that is reportedly more sensitive to a rider’s head position compared to more traditional designs.</p>\n<p>Our tester noted it was <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/helmets/road-cycling-helmets/poc-tempor-aero-helmet-in-brief-review/\">crucial to use

(the two have very different body shapes and riding positions), showing it isn’t optimised for only one rider and position.\n<p>He also said the Redeemer 2Vi MIPS has been optimised to retain its performance with varying equipment and is “tolerant to various rider positions” and head angles.</p>\n<h2>Sweet Protection’s Redeemer 2Vi MIPS specification and availability</h2>\n<p>The Redeemer 2Vi MIPS uses a multi-layer design that is said to give a “low stack height”, in order to reduce the helmet’s frontal area for better aerodynamic efficiency.</p>\n<p>Sweet Protection’s Redeemer 2Vi MIPS will be available to buy in “autumn 2023”, in (Darth Vader) black or (Storm Trooper) white.
