{"title":"The Touch Bar is finally dead","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2120980/13-inch-macbook-pro-touch-bar-discontinued.html","date":1698715956000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple announced its new MacBook Pro lineup during the “Scary Fast” Mac event with <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2120691/m3-m3-pro-and-m3-max-specs-features-cpu-gpu.html\">M3</a> versions of the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro and a luscious Space Black color, but there’s one model it left out: the 13-inch MacBook Pro. And if try to go to buy one at Apple.com, you won’t find it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s right, the last laptop with a Touch Bar is gone. Apple hasn’t officially announced that the 13-inch Pro is retired, but it certainly seems like it is. Not only is it gone from the store, but the specs have been moved from “Current laptops” to “More laptops” on the <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-2120980-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/mac/compare/\">Compare Mac models</a> page. (The little MacBook Pro icon up in the navigation bar still shows a model without a notch, but we assume that’s an oversight.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Filling its position in the lineup is the 14-inch MacBook Pro, which now starts at $1,599 (versus $1,999 for the M2 Pro model) but has an M3 chip instead of an M3 Pro chip. That’s quite a bit higher than the $1,299 price that the 13-inch model sold for, but you’re getting a lot more for the extra $300—twice the storage, an HDR ProMotion display, HDMI, SDXC slot, and a newer design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, you’ll need to spend at least $1,999 to get the sleek new Space Black color, as it’s only for the M3 Pro and M3 Max models. The 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro still comes in Space Gray and Silver. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you still want a 13-inch Pro with a Touch Bar, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3C57XLR/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">you can snag one for $1,049 ($250 off) at Amazon</a> before stock sells out. You can also get a refurbished model in the <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-2120980-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished/mac/macbook-pro\">Apple Certified Refurbished store</a>.</p>\n\nMacBook</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"5d7938bf8cb4755c5bb456569d277412bcfeacbdded1f5fd41e7b9a3dbdfc64f","category":"Apple"}
