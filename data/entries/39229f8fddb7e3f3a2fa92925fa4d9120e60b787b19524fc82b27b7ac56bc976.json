Nick Smolinske at Rogue Panda is constantly innovating, iterating, and looking for ways to improve their products. Unsatisfied with the V1, Nick began to work on the V2 of the Ripsey.</p>\n<p>I got to drop by Rogue Panda HQ last fall for a preview of the new Ripsey and all the trial and error that went into the latest iteration.</p>\n<h3>Quick Hits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Volume: 8 L</li>\n<li>Minimum Tire Clearance: 3″ at half capacity, 4″ at full capacity</li>\n<li>Weight: 16oz with dry bag</li>\n<li>Load Capacity: The Ripsey harness will take more, but RP recommends sticking to 6 lbs/3kg for the sake of your saddle.</li>\n<li>Optional HDPE skid plate for those that expect to skid often</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Rogue_Panda_Ripsey_V2_Review-7.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Rogue_Panda_Ripsey_V2_Review-7.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Rogue_Panda_Ripsey_V2_Review-7.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Rogue_Panda_Ripsey_V2_Review-7.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Rogue_Panda_Ripsey_V2_Review-13.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Rogue_Panda_Ripsey_V2_Review-13.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Rogue_Panda_Ripsey_V2_Review-13.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Rogue_Panda_Ripsey_V2_Review-13.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Rogue_Panda_Ripsey_V2_Review-10.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Rogue_Panda_Ripsey_V2_Review-10.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Rogue_Panda_Ripsey_V2_Review-10.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Rogue_Panda_Ripsey_V2_Review-10.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Whats New</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Redesigned aluminum collar with no need for Valais or Drop Block adaptors</li>\n<li>Native 31.6 sizing with shims available for all droppers, as well as common rigid seat posts\n<ul>\n<li>Included shims: 27.2 rigid and 25/26mm dropper stanchions (most 31.6 dropper posts)</li>\n<li>Additional shims for 34.9 dropper, 27.2 dropper, and 30.9 rigid are $5.00</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Patent Pending saddle clamp with ABS “half pipe” adjustable shims\n<ul>\n<li>available in two widths to fit almost any saddle</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rogue Panda has designed their own stanchion/seatpost clamp without the need for other companies’ shims. The new clamp is aluminum, featuring two bolts to secure the collar to whatever seat post you need. This is a huge upgrade from the previous version which relied on a Wolf Tooth Valias and velcro to attach the bag to a seatpost.</p>\n<p>This new seatpost clamp also necessitated a redesign of the harness to interface with the new clamp. The hinge is now more robust and fastened by a steel bolt rather than a piece of nylon webbing.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Rogue_Panda_Ripsey_V2_Review-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Rogue_Panda_Ripsey_V2_Review-2.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Rogue_Panda_Ripsey_V2_Review-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Rogue_Panda_Ripsey_V2_Review-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>RP has also totally redesigned the saddle clamp. Gone are the two pieces of flat aluminum and now we have a slick saddle clamp with sliding “half pipe” ABS shims. These shims rotate and slide, allowing a large range of adjustability for clamping to the saddle rails.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Rogue_Panda_Ripsey_V2_Review-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Rogue_Panda_Ripsey_V2_Review-6.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Rogue_Panda_Ripsey_V2_Review-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Rogue_Panda_Ripsey_V2_Review-6.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>What Stays the Same</h3>\n<p>The silhouette of the bag remains largely unchanged, as well as its capacity and tire clearance. The Ripsey still cinches closed with Austere Manufacturing straps as these have proved themselves over the past few years. The stuff sack remains at 8 liters in capacity and is still fully seam-sealed.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Rogue_Panda_Ripsey_V2_Review-8.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Rogue_Panda_Ripsey_V2_Review-8.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Rogue_Panda_Ripsey_V2_Review-8.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Rogue_Panda_Ripsey_V2_Review-8.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Rogue_Panda_Ripsey_V2_Review-9.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Rogue_Panda_Ripsey_V2_Review-9.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Rogue_Panda_Ripsey_V2_Review-9.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Rogue_Panda_Ripsey_V2_Review-9.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Rogue_Panda_Ripsey_V2_Review-11.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Rogue_Panda_Ripsey_V2_Review-11.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Rogue_Panda_Ripsey_V2_Review-11.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Rogue_Panda_Ripsey_V2_Review-11.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Manufacturing</h3>\n<p>Making a bag with so many different materials and parts undoubtedly requires an equally diverse supply chain.

The shims easily move into place to securely clamp to the saddle rails. I had to be careful not to overtighten and squish the ABS shims, which I almost did on my first install. At the time I didn’t have the torque spec, which I now know is 4 Nm. The new stanchion clamp was likewise a total pleasure to install, with a simple two-bolt face plate. The two contact points of the bag have been totally reinvisioned and improved upon from the previous version.</p>\n<p>The 8-liter stuff sack remains largely unchanged, except for the new Ultra 400 fabric that was not available with the previous generation. I still find the nose of the stuff sack hard to properly fill out, despite my best attempts. Nonetheless, it handily carried my sleeping bag and a few sleeping layers. While the straps are much stronger, RP recommends limiting the load to 6 lbs for the Ripsey. Your dropper post will thank you for staying below that number.</p>\n<p>With everything clamped, tightened, packed, squished, and cinched, I was ready to head down the trail. I met my friend Drew at the tail end of his Fool’s Loop trip to ride about 70 miles of the Black Canyon Trail. I figured this was a perfect test route for the new Ripsey and, surprise, the bag performed flawlessly.</p>\n<p>I never had to tighten, adjust, or fiddle with the bag after leaving the parking lot. On day two, I raised the stanchion clamp to get a bit more drop out of my seatpost, but purely for preference. I used as much dropper travel as I could and rubbed the harness multiple times, which is exactly why it is there. If you have ever heard the sound of tire rubber on Cordura, then you will know how it makes your skin crawl. The barely noticeable sound of the tire on the harness was sweet bliss to my ears.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Rogue_Panda_Ripsey_V2_Review-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Rogue_Panda_Ripsey_V2_Review-1.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Rogue_Panda_Ripsey_V2_Review-1.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Rogue_Panda_Ripsey_V2_Review-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Rogue_Panda_Ripsey_V2_Review-4.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Rogue_Panda_Ripsey_V2_Review-4.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Rogue_Panda_Ripsey_V2_Review-4.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/2025_Rogue_Panda_Ripsey_V2_Review-4.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>\n<p>Rogue Panda once again shows why they are an industry leader in innovation. Between their Blue Ridge Handlebar Harness, The V2 Ripsey Seat Pack, and not to mention their custom framebags, Rogue Panda is at the top of their game. I found it difficult to find a fault with the new Ripsey, but if there is one, Rogue Panda will find a solution and best themselves once again. The Ripsey remains the best in class for seat packs on the market today.</p>\n<p>The Ripsey is still king of the hill as far as I’m concerned with seat packs. Whether you are a smaller person looking to maximize clearance without being concerned about rubbing a hole in your bag, or a tall person looking to use all the dropper post travel you can, the Ripsey V2 is THE choice bikepacking seat bag.</p>\n<h3>Pros</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Industry-leading tire clearance</li>\n<li>New skid plate, seatpost clamp, and saddle clamp all improve on the previous generation</li>\n<li>Austere Mfg straps still work amazingly</li>\n<li>Best option (again) for no sway dropper post seat bag</li>\n<li>Skid plate is great for those who regularly rub their tires on seat bags.</li>\n<li>Nearly entirely MUSA</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cons</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>ABS shims on saddle clamp can get squished with too much pressure</li>\n<li>Nose of the stuff sack still hard to properly pack</li>\n<li>Lots of parts can introduce fail points for a bag</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/rogue-panda-ripsey-v2-review/\">Rogue Panda Ripsey Seat Bag V2: Just Keeps Getting Better</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"spencer harding","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"39229f8fddb7e3f3a2fa92925fa4d9120e60b787b19524fc82b27b7ac56bc976","category":"Cycling"}
