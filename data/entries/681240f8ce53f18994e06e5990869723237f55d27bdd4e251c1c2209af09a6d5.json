Take, for instance, one of the exhibitors at the MADE Bike Show, <a href=\"https://www.rodbikes.com/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">R&amp;E</a> Bicycles. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was admiring the R&amp;E Bicycles 6-Pack micro bike that their Master Mechanic, Alder Threlkeld was talking to me about. Then, assuming because I’d never heard of them that they were a new-ish bike company, I asked “How long has R&amp;E been around”… Alder proudly responded, “Since 1973”. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Wow”, I responded. I felt schooled… and ya know, it happens way more than I care to admit. But, as I mentioned, I learn something new every single day. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anywho, 50 years is a long time for an independent bike company to be around. They must be doing something right and must have a niche market’s attention. They <em>are</em> doing something right, and they do have a niche market’s trust.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Quick R&amp;E Bicycle History</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/RE-Bicycles-6-Pack-touring-bike-1973-.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"506\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/RE-Bicycles-6-Pack-touring-bike-1973--800x506.jpeg\" alt=\"R&amp;E Bicycles 6-Pack touring bike 1973\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/RE-Bicycles-6-Pack-touring-bike-1973--800x506.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/RE-Bicycles-6-Pack-touring-bike-1973--297x188.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/RE-Bicycles-6-Pack-touring-bike-1973--120x76.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/RE-Bicycles-6-Pack-touring-bike-1973--768x486.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/RE-Bicycles-6-Pack-touring-bike-1973-.jpeg 1138w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo C.

Angel and Glenn started building bicycles and tandems using their own names and quickly became a well-respected shop in the Seattle area. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1990, Angel sold the company to an entity that wasn’t from the bike industry and eventually drove R&amp;E Bicycles to bankruptcy by 1993. In ’93, Angel had actually financed the deal with the new owners and was able to buy back R&amp;E Bicycles with the help of Dan Towle. Dan and a small team worked hard from then until 1999 rebuilding the company. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the end of the 90s, R&amp;E Bicycles had a full line of US-made production bicycles to add to their extensive custom line-up…just in time for the dot-com explosion. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the last few decades, with hard work and perseverance through some dark times, Dan and the team at R&amp;E Bicycle Company remain a Seattle cycling institution.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The R&amp;E 6-Pack Micro Bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/RE-Bicycles-6-Pack-hero.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1276\" height=\"704\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/RE-Bicycles-6-Pack-hero-e1694027117475.jpeg\" alt=\"R&amp;E Bicycles 6-Pack hero\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/RE-Bicycles-6-Pack-hero-e1694027117475.jpeg 1276w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/RE-Bicycles-6-Pack-hero-e1694027117475-297x164.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/RE-Bicycles-6-Pack-hero-e1694027117475-800x441.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/RE-Bicycles-6-Pack-hero-e1694027117475-120x66.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/RE-Bicycles-6-Pack-hero-e1694027117475-768x424.jpeg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo c.

This is not a folding bike, but is a bike that, by the use of S&amp;S couplings, allows for the bike to be fully dismantled and packed into very small spaces… like a suitcase that is only 20″ x 20″ in size. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/RE-Bicycles-6-Pack-eccentric-bb.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\"
