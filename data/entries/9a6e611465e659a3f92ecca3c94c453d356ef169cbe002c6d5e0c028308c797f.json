With Home Key integration in the Wallet app, an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> or an Apple Watch can be used to unlock the door with just a tap.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/yale-home-key-lock.jpg\" alt width=\"1510\" height=\"848\" />\r<br />\nThe Assure Lock 2 Plus is a keyless entry lock, which means it does not have a backup key option. Aside from Home Key, it can be accessed with ‌HomeKit‌ commands or entry codes. The entry codes can be used to provide guests with access, and there is an optional Wi-Fi module for remote access to the lock.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYale today also debuted the <a href=\"https://shopyalehome.com/pages/yale-assure-lock-2-touch\">Assure Lock 2 Touch</a>, a $199 smart lock that has a fingerprint sensor and ‌HomeKit‌ integration, but no support for Home Key. Yale does not offer a lock that provides both Home Key support and a fingerprint sensor, so those interested in a Yale lock will need to choose.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://shopyalehome.com/pages/yale-assure-lock-2-plus\">Yale Assure Lock 2 Plus with Home Key</a> is priced at $210 for Bluetooth connectivity, or $290 for Wi-Fi support. The Wi-Fi models require a 2.4GHz network.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://shopyalehome.com/pages/yale-assure-lock-2-touch\">Yale Assure Lock 2 Touch</a> is priced at $199 for the Bluetooth version, with both keyed and key-free models available. A version with Wi-Fi connectivity is priced at $280.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/\">HomeKit</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/yale/\">Yale</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-keys/\">Home Keys</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/yale-home-key-lock/\">Yale Launches Apple Home Key-Enabled Assure Lock 2 Plus</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/yale-launches-apple-home-key-enabled-assure-lock-2-plus.2405167/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9a6e611465e659a3f92ecca3c94c453d356ef169cbe002c6d5e0c028308c797f","category":"Apple"}
