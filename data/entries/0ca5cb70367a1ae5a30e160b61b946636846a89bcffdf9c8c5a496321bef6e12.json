Today's rundown is headlined by the lowest price we've tracked for Sony's WH-1000XM4 headphones, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3DZJPdE\" target=\"_blank\">which have fallen to $248</a> at various retailers this week. That matches <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/best-amazon-prime-day-deals-2021-headphones-earbuds-sony-jabra/\" target=\"_blank\">the deal we highlighted</a> during Amazon's Prime Day event and marks a roughly $80 drop from the noise-canceling pair's usual online going rate over the past few months.</p>\n<p>We've <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/09/home-office-setup-ideas/4/#h4\" target=\"_blank\">recommended the XM4s</a> on several occasions in the past, and they remain an excellent blend of high comfort, useful features, and top-tier noise-canceling strength. Battery life is decent, if not amazing. And while there are definitely better-sounding pairs, Sony's out-of-the-box sound serves up some powerful bass for those who prefer that type of experience (it's possible to customize the sound into something more neutral through Sony's handy smartphone app). USB-C charging, an effective \"ambient sound\" mode, and a \"speak to chat\" feature that automatically pauses your music when you need to speak all add to the package. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/08/bose-quietcomfort-45-announced-price-release-date-features/\" target=\"_blank\">Bose's new QuietComfort 45</a> may be lighter on the head, and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/12/apples-new-airpods-max-over-ear-headphones-cost-549/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple's $550 AirPods Max</a> may have them both beat in terms of pure sound quality and noise-canceling power, but at this price specifically, the XM4 present a strong value.</p>\n<p>Our roundup also has some appealing prices on several new 4K TVs from Sony, TCL, Vizio, and Samsung; the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2XGur6o\" target=\"_blank\">lowest price we've seen</a> for the 512GB version of a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/staff/2020/08/grab-a-256gb-samsung-microsd-card-for-29-today/\" target=\"_blank\">recommended Samsung microSD</a> card; a number of deals on SSDs, both internal and portable; a $20 price drop on <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/05/finding-the-best-wireless-mouse-for-your-desktop-for-both-work-and-gaming/\" target=\"_blank\">Logitech's excellent MX Master 3 wireless mouse</a>; a big <a href=\"https://fave.co/3m7xVs1\" target=\"_blank\">gaming chair sale</a> that includes <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/chairs-technica-we-review-two-new-models-from-anda-seat/\" target=\"_blank\">models we've tested</a> and recommended from AndaSeat, and much more.
