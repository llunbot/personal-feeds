Gold accents for the headband hinges and the Beats \"b\" button provide additional contrast.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Black &amp; Gold Beats Studio Pro come with the same traditional black nylon case as the original four launch colors for the headphones, and they come with gray USB-C and 3.5mm cables for charging and connectivity.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://howl.me/cnixvquwBqJ\">new Black &amp; Gold color option for the Beats Studio Pro</a> retails for the usual Studio Pro price of $349.99, although Best Buy is currently running a <a href=\"https://howl.me/cnixvqJN4cc\">significant sale on most Beats headphones and earphones</a> that knocks $100 off to bring the price to $249.99.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<small><em>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Best Buy.
