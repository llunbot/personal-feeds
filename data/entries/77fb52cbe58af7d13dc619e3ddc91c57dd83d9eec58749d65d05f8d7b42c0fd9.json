And that’s maybe the wildest part of the story of how a relative newcomer to the mountain bike scene turned out 2 World Championship-winning XC bikes in the span of less than a year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now, after teasing us last spring and summer, the Pinarello Dogma XC mountain bikes are ready for consumers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you can pick up either the travel-adjustable full-suspension or the wildly asymmetric hardtail, each in two different carbon layups and requisite performance-focused build kits…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Btw, happy #panshotfriday!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2024 Pinarello Dogma XC full-suspension &amp; hardtail MTB</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Pinarello are back in the MTB scene with the official rollout of two all-new XC race bikes. Sure, It’s true that we all know the iconic Italian bike maker for road bikes, but they’ve also had a mountain bike line off and on in recent decades. But these Dogma XC bikes are nothing like the casual Pinarello mountain bikes of years past. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two all-new off-road race bikes developed closely with Tom Pidcock and Pauline Ferrand-Prévot. Two all-new bikes that have each already been ridden to World Championship titles. All less that 10 months after the whole Pinarello Dogma XC mountain bike development project began.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>All-new full-suspension Dogma XC</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/SR-Suntour-TACT-automatic-electronic-XC-MTB-racing-suspension_Pinarello-Dogma-XC-bike-of-Tom-Pidcock.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/SR-Suntour-TACT-automatic-electronic-XC-MTB-racing-suspension_Pinarello-Dogma-XC-bike-of-Tom-Pidcock-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"SR Suntour TACT automatic electronic XC MTB racing suspension, Pinarello Dogma XC\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/SR-Suntour-TACT-automatic-electronic-XC-MTB-racing-suspension_Pinarello-Dogma-XC-bike-of-Tom-Pidcock-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/SR-Suntour-TACT-automatic-electronic-XC-MTB-racing-suspension_Pinarello-Dogma-XC-bike-of-Tom-Pidcock-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/SR-Suntour-TACT-automatic-electronic-XC-MTB-racing-suspension_Pinarello-Dogma-XC-bike-of-Tom-Pidcock-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/SR-Suntour-TACT-automatic-electronic-XC-MTB-racing-suspension_Pinarello-Dogma-XC-bike-of-Tom-Pidcock-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/SR-Suntour-TACT-automatic-electronic-XC-MTB-racing-suspension_Pinarello-Dogma-XC-bike-of-Tom-Pidcock-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/SR-Suntour-TACT-automatic-electronic-XC-MTB-racing-suspension_Pinarello-Dogma-XC-bike-of-Tom-Pidcock-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/SR-Suntour-TACT-automatic-electronic-XC-MTB-racing-suspension_Pinarello-Dogma-XC-bike-of-Tom-Pidcock.jpg 2000w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The first one we laid eyes on was Pidcock’s full-suspension bike.

The INEOS team has a development partnership with SR Suntour, so that’s what the team is racing. But that suspension isn’t ready yet for consumers, so you can get excellent new FOX suspension in the meantime. They also race on Shimano. But since there isn’t yet a new XTR Di2 group, Pinarello figured they would spec these commercial bikes with the latest SRAM AXS T-Type Transmissions. Thankfully (<em>in my personal opinion and the minds of Pinarello</em>), the bikes get spec’d with the best-performing Shimano brakes instead.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2024 Pinarello Dogma XC &amp; XC

It also follows Pinarello’s concept of asymmetric design to handle the asymmetric forces exerted on a bike comparing driveside vs. braking forces. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-Pinarello-Dogma-XC-90mm-full-suspension-cross-country-mountain-bike_Hirth-joint-detail.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"950\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-Pinarello-Dogma-XC-90mm-full-suspension-cross-country-mountain-bike_Hirth-joint-detail.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Pinarello Dogma XC full-suspension cross-country mountain bike, hirth joint detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-Pinarello-Dogma-XC-90mm-full-suspension-cross-country-mountain-bike_Hirth-joint-detail.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-Pinarello-Dogma-XC-90mm-full-suspension-cross-country-mountain-bike_Hirth-joint-detail-297x235.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-Pinarello-Dogma-XC-90mm-full-suspension-cross-country-mountain-bike_Hirth-joint-detail-120x95.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-Pinarello-Dogma-XC-90mm-full-suspension-cross-country-mountain-bike_Hirth-joint-detail-768x608.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Less obvious, but the rear end of the Dogma XC is composed of 2 completely separate triangles. Not chainstay or seatstay bridges to connect them. But… hidden inside the oversized main pivot, the sides are joined with a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirth_joint\">Hirth</a> joint. An oversized aluminum half axle is molded into both halves of the rear triangle, and a toothed interface connects them back in the middle to stiffen the two sides into one. The result is stiffness like you had a chainstay bridge, but with the ability to have ultra-short 427.5mm chainstays with 2.4″ tire clearance, and no mud shelf!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Integrated cockpits</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Pinarello-Dogma-XC-full-suspension-cross-country-mountain-bike_MOST-integrated-cockpit.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Pinarello-Dogma-XC-full-suspension-cross-country-mountain-bike_MOST-integrated-cockpit-1536x1024.jpg\" alt=\" Pinarello Dogma XC full-suspension cross-country mountain bike, integrared cockpit\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Pinarello-Dogma-XC-full-suspension-cross-country-mountain-bike_MOST-integrated-cockpit-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Pinarello-Dogma-XC-full-suspension-cross-country-mountain-bike_MOST-integrated-cockpit-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Pinarello-Dogma-XC-full-suspension-cross-country-mountain-bike_MOST-integrated-cockpit-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Pinarello-Dogma-XC-full-suspension-cross-country-mountain-bike_MOST-integrated-cockpit-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Pinarello-Dogma-XC-full-suspension-cross-country-mountain-bike_MOST-integrated-cockpit-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Pinarello-Dogma-XC-full-suspension-cross-country-mountain-bike_MOST-integrated-cockpit-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Pinarello-Dogma-XC-full-suspension-cross-country-mountain-bike_MOST-integrated-cockpit.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Pinarello also gives both bikes a new one-piece integrated carbon MOST XC MTB cockpits to save weight and boost steering stiffness. With fully internal cable routing through the headset and an internal 60° steering stop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a massive handlebar to look at. And we’ll leave it up to the comments section to debate internal cable routing on a mountain bike. But a pleasant surprise at least to me, Pinarello did a solid job of making it stiff in the right directions, without it rattling your teeth (or wrists) when riding choppy trails!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Full-suspension specs &amp; pricing</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-Pinarello-Dogma-XC-full-suspension-cross-country-mountain-bike_Pidcock-rainbow-gold-replica.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"922\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-Pinarello-Dogma-XC-full-suspension-cross-country-mountain-bike_Pidcock-rainbow-gold-replica-1536x922.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Pinarello Dogma XC full-suspension cross-country mountain bike, Pidcock replica\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-Pinarello-Dogma-XC-full-suspension-cross-country-mountain-bike_Pidcock-rainbow-gold-replica-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-Pinarello-Dogma-XC-full-suspension-cross-country-mountain-bike_Pidcock-rainbow-gold-replica-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-Pinarello-Dogma-XC-full-suspension-cross-country-mountain-bike_Pidcock-rainbow-gold-replica-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-Pinarello-Dogma-XC-full-suspension-cross-country-mountain-bike_Pidcock-rainbow-gold-replica-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-Pinarello-Dogma-XC-full-suspension-cross-country-mountain-bike_Pidcock-rainbow-gold-replica.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Pinarello makes the Dogma XC from their top-tier, lightest and stiffest Toray M40 J carbon fiber, available in 4 sizes (S-XL).

But it takes the asymmetry design concept to new extremes. With dramatically different chainstay and seatstay layouts for the hardtail. Pinarello say this asymmetry addresses the forces in a frame in a more balanced way, leading to better energy transfer, improved traction, and increased speed.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-Pinarello-Dogma-XC-Hard-Tail-hardtail-cross-country-mountain-bike_geometry.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-Pinarello-Dogma-XC-Hard-Tail-hardtail-cross-country-mountain-bike_geometry.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Pinarello Dogma XC Hard Tail cross-country hardtail mountain bike, geometry\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-Pinarello-Dogma-XC-Hard-Tail-hardtail-cross-country-mountain-bike_geometry.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-Pinarello-Dogma-XC-Hard-Tail-hardtail-cross-country-mountain-bike_geometry-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-Pinarello-Dogma-XC-Hard-Tail-hardtail-cross-country-mountain-bike_geometry-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-Pinarello-Dogma-XC-Hard-Tail-hardtail-cross-country-mountain-bike_geometry-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-Pinarello-Dogma-XC-Hard-Tail-hardtail-cross-country-mountain-bike_geometry-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-Pinarello-Dogma-XC-Hard-Tail-hardtail-cross-country-mountain-bike_geometry-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the fully, it gets an integrated cockpit. And also comes in four stock sizes (S-XL). What it does not include is a dropper post. All of the bikes are dropper compatible, but the lightweight dropper that Pinarello wanted to spec on the bike wasn’t available in production quantities. (<em>We think that was this world’s lightest <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/vertical-helium-dropper-seat-post-worlds-lightest/\" target=\"_blank\">Vertical Helium</a> dropper.</em>) So they gave the hardtails a rigid dropper, and left it up to the buyer to swap one in if they want.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Hardtail specs &amp; pricing</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-Pinarello-Dogma-XC-Hard-Tail-cross-country-hardtail-mountain-bike_Ferrand-Prevot-rainbow-replica.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"922\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-Pinarello-Dogma-XC-Hard-Tail-cross-country-hardtail-mountain-bike_Ferrand-Prevot-rainbow-replica-1536x922.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Pinarello Dogma XC Hard Tail cross-country hardtail mountain bike, Ferrand-Prevot replica\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-Pinarello-Dogma-XC-Hard-Tail-cross-country-hardtail-mountain-bike_Ferrand-Prevot-rainbow-replica-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-Pinarello-Dogma-XC-Hard-Tail-cross-country-hardtail-mountain-bike_Ferrand-Prevot-rainbow-replica-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-Pinarello-Dogma-XC-Hard-Tail-cross-country-hardtail-mountain-bike_Ferrand-Prevot-rainbow-replica-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-Pinarello-Dogma-XC-Hard-Tail-cross-country-hardtail-mountain-bike_Ferrand-Prevot-rainbow-replica-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-Pinarello-Dogma-XC-Hard-Tail-cross-country-hardtail-mountain-bike_Ferrand-Prevot-rainbow-replica.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, the Pinarello Dogma XC Hard Tail is made from top-tier, lighter and stiffer Toray M40 J carbon fiber. And designed for a 100mm travel fork.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The top-tier Dogma XC Hard Tail is available in Ferrand-Prévot’s rainbow replica paint (a bit less gold) or carbon black/red, for $11,200 / 11,000€ complete. Again eye-watering, you get almost an identical spec. SRAM XX SL AXS, XTR brakes, DT XRC 1200 wheels, and FOX factory suspension with the new 32 SC fork.

Tom Pidcock and Pauline Ferrand-Prévot. Well, that was until I joined Pinarello’s development team and INEOS MTB Coach Kurt Bogaerts for the first test rides on the new bikes in Italy. Together with about ten other journalists. I got in a couple of fast rides over varied terrain on the top-spec full-suspension Pinarello Dogma XC. In its stock short 90/100mm travel setting. And I have to say… the bike pleasantly surprised me, at how a new XC bike from a road bike brand can feel so quick when you put the power down, yet still feel plush in such short travel without ever bottoming out. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>More riding and development details in a full first rides review soon!</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://pinarello.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pinarello.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2024-pinarello-dogma-xc-drops-2-carbon-specs-for-full-suspension-hard-tail-mtbs/\">2024 Pinarello Dogma XC Drops 2 Carbon Specs for Full-Suspension &amp; Hard Tail MTBs</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"77fb52cbe58af7d13dc619e3ddc91c57dd83d9eec58749d65d05f8d7b42c0fd9","category":"Cycling"}
