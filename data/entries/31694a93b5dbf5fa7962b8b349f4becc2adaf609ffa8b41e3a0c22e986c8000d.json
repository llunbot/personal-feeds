According to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-19/sonos-woes-spark-apple-deal-talk-mail-with-ai-coming-in-macos-15-4-iphone-se\">Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman’s latest Power On newsletter</a> (subscription required), the Mail app will feature new sorting features in an upcoming major update to macOS Sequoia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the Sequoia 15.4 update, the Mail app will have the sorting features introduced with the Mail app in <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2499054/ios-ipados-18-2-features-apple-intelligence-siri-genmoji-security-release.html\">iOS 18.2</a> in December. On the iPhone, when you open an Inbox, four icons appear at the top representing the sorting methods: Primary, Transactions, Updates, and Promotions. If you swipe from the right end of the icons to the left, you can activate an option for All Mail to be listed. In Mail on the Mac, these options will appear at the top of the Inbox message listing.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ios-18-mail.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iOS 18.2 Mail AI sorting\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ios-18-mail.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ios-18-mail.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ios-18-mail.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ios-18-mail.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ios-18-mail.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ios-18-mail.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ios-18-mail.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ios-18-mail.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>The sorting introduced with iOS 18.2 will come to the Mac in macOS Sequoia 15.4.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have Apple Intelligence enabled on your Mac, you’ll also see a new Priority Notifications section at the top of your Inbox to show any important messages you may have missed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new sorting might come as a shock to users at first, mostly because Apple sets the default to Primary, which Apple <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/use-categories-iphfe4a36baf/ios\">defines</a> as emails with “personal messages and time-sensitive information.” If you’re wondering where all your emails went, you can press the All Mail option to see every message in your Inbox. Once you get acclimated to the categories, you’ll find that the sorting is quite helpful, especially if you have a ton of messages. If you don’t like the new way of doing things, you’re able to turn it off in the Mail settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The current version of Sequoia is 15.2, with the 15.3 beta 3 available now, including the ability to create <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2545829/ios-18-2-how-to-create-your-own-custom-emoji-with-genmoji.html\">Genmoji</a> on the Mac. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2265062/macos-15-release-name-compatibility-features.html\">Learn more about macOS Sequoia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2574188/where-is-apple-intelligence-on-my-mac.html\">Apple Intelligence</a>.
