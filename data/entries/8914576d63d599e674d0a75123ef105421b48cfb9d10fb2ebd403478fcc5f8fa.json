The new version of Rock Paper Pencil has a NanoCling Screen Protector that attaches to an ‌iPad‌ using static cling rather than a magnetic edge like the prior version.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAstropad says that NanoCling is stronger than magnets, and it provides a thinner bezel and a flatter surface on the ‌iPad‌. The NanoCling Screen Protector is 40 percent thinner than the magnetic version, so there are no gaps or ridges to contend with. The screen protector continues to be easily removable and reusable so you can take it off when you're not writing, and it is not adhesive so it leaves no residue.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Pencil tip has also been redesigned to withstand heavy daily use. It has a wear-resistant copper alloy core and palladium coating, and it is able to hold up to more pressure. The Pencil tip has been slimmed down too, so it's equivalent to a standard 0.7mm ballpoint pen. The Rock Paper Pencil ships with two of the pencil tips and a protective storage sleeve for the screen protector.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRock Paper Pencil can be <a href=\"https://shop.astropad.com/collections/shop-astropad/products/rock-paper-pencil?sca_ref=5507981.N2my3G8kPZ\">purchased from the Astropad website</a> for $40.
