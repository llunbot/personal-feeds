This is why we recommend always trying shorts on before buying, if possible.</p>\n<p>While sizing varies from brand to brand, it’s great to see more brands stocking a large size range.</p>\n<p>The best women’s mountain bike shorts often look lower in the front when laid flat and rise higher in the back. This is because they are designed not to cut into your waist when you’re riding, but are high enough at the back to provide coverage from dirt and trail debris while not riding down.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Endura Women’s Singletrack Lite Shorts for mountain bikers\" title=\"Endura Singletrack Lite shorts 2\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Adjustable waistbands can help provide comfortable and versatile fits.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Look out for shorts with an adjustable and stretchy waistband, which are great for providing a comfortable and versatile fit.</p>\n<p>Next up is the leg length. If you ride predominantly with knee pads, you may want to look out for baggier shorts with a longer inseam that reach down to the top of your knees.</p>\n<p>If, however, you rarely wear knee pads and want a shorter and lighter pair of shorts, a more fitted cross-country-oriented option may be the one for you. Some brands, such as Endura, produce shorts in two different lengths to suit different riders.</p>\n<h3>Materials</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Fox Flexair Women’s Shorts for mountain bikers\" title=\"Fox Flexair shorts 1\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Shorts such as the Fox Flexair use elastane for stretch.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The materials from which the shorts are made will dictate their durability, water repellency and stretch.</p>\n<p>Mountain bike shorts are most commonly made from a mix of polyester and elastane. If you value a good four-way stretch, look for options with at least 10 per cent of the latter.</p>\n<p>A DWR (durable water repellent) coating helps the shorts to bead efficiently and, while it doesn’t make them entirely waterproof, is a great compromise of weight and water repellency for all but the most rainy rides.</p>\n<p>Look out for PFC-free (fluorocarbon compound-free) options, such as the Patagonia Dirt Roamer shorts.</p>\n<p>We have a dedicated list of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-waterproof-mtb-shorts/\">best waterproof mountain bike shorts</a> if you’re interested in something that will help keep you dry.</p>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Endura Women’s Singletrack Lite Shorts for mountain bikers\" title=\"Endura Singletrack Lite shorts 3\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Strategically placed perforations in the legs aid airflow.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Alongside an adjustable fastening mechanism, a well-designed pocket layout increases the usability of your mountain bike shorts.</p>\n<p>While the number and size of the pockets is down to personal preference, we recommend at least one small zipped pocket for storing valuables such as keys, lift passes or cash.</p>\n<p>Strategically placed perforations in the legs aid airflow and are especially useful in summer when you want to maintain coverage but not overheat.</p>\n<h3>Lined shorts vs shells</h3>\n<p>Some shorts come with an integrated liner short and padded chamois. These are often attached to the outer shorts but can be cut out or otherwise removed if required.</p>\n<p>Chamois shorts are a very personal thing, and just because you like a brand’s outer shorts, it unfortunately doesn’t mean you’ll gel with its liners.</p>\n<p>Therefore, we wouldn’t recommend shorts with integrated liners unless you’re sure the chamois suits you.</p>","author":"Finlay Anderson","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"a61e16a73ce659f7535859d915a8de5293b6e554b03841d9753136cccd6627af","category":"Cycling"}
