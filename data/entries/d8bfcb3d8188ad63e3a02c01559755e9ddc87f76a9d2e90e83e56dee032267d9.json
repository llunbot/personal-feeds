OMM says it was an extremely tough choice, but they want to reach out and thank everyone who applied.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team is sponsored by Silca and the Robert Axle Project. Although OMM says that the goal of this experiment is not about chasing podiums, they’re “definitely not going to be scared of them.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With bikepacking races celebrating solo efforts, independence, and solitude, OMM wants to see the results of preparing and growing together. Which in turn could strengthen people’s ability to “go it alone” when the big departure arrives. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>OMM expects the Experimental Bikepacking Team to represent the “<em>heart of camaraderie and adventure, engaging in races, supporting fellow riders, and celebrating the journey. We want to push what we can do on a bike and through our collaborative spirit beyond the podium</em>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the year, OMM will be sharing what the team is up to, and what they are learning from one another. OMM is excited to see how many follow along as they explore this concept. So, without further ado…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Let’s Meet the Team! </h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Hanna Simon</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Hanna-Simon-urt-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Hanna-Simon-urt-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Hanna Simon urt\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Hanna-Simon-urt-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Hanna-Simon-urt-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Hanna-Simon-urt-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Hanna-Simon-urt-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos / Old Man Mountain)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Hannah is a queer, femme, ultra-endurance cyclist who began her long-distance riding in 2018. She completed the Texas 4000 that year, a short, little jaunt from Austin, TX to Anchorage, AK. After that experience, she fell absolutely in love with traveling absurd distances by bike. The obsession lured her into working</em> with bikes, first as a mechanic and then as <em>General Manager at Cycleeast in Austin TX.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>She’s now a part-time production assistant, making bike frames, at Chumba USA.

His hobby turned into a passion in 2021, following a snowboarding accident in November 2020 that left him with a broken clavicle and a mound of self-doubt. To rehabilitate and remove any fear of becoming sedentary, Eric committed to his first race: a triathlon (don’t judge too much). This is when he traded a vintage Peugeot for a steel gravel bike from his LBS, Race Ready Repair</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Eric-House-peeking-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Eric-House-peeking-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Eric House peeking\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Eric-House-peeking-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Eric-House-peeking-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Eric-House-peeking-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Eric-House-peeking-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>In addition to getting my body moving again, the bike world introduced him to a broader community of folks that have enriched his life beyond what he could have imagined. He began working as a ride leader and vibe creator with The Gravel Collective, a non-profit bike group with the goal of inclusion and generating passion through bikes. These group rides showed the strength and value of community building</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Loving Long Distance</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>His first ultra in east Texas solidified his love for long-distance, unsupported bikepack racing and reinvigorated his love for exploration via bike. In 2022 he began racing short track XC through the Texas Mountain Bike Racing Association in addition to racing ultras. Though he loved long-distance riding, XC is where he developed excitement for competition. There were several successes and failures during the year that helped boost skills and confidence while keeping him humble and focused. The true bike “Glow Up” happened in 2023 when he turned to single speed. This is when passion turns into purpose. The shift to single speed provided the simple, raw body-bike connection, and that childlike joy from his BMX days growing up</em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Eric-House-train-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"855\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Eric-House-train-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Eric House train\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Eric-House-train-jpeg.webp 855w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Eric-House-train-200x300.webp 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Eric-House-train-80x120.webp 80w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Eric-House-train-768x1150.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Eric-House-hoodie-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"960\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Eric-House-hoodie-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Eric House hoodie\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Eric-House-hoodie-jpeg.webp 960w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Eric-House-hoodie-225x300.webp 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Eric-House-hoodie-90x120.webp 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Eric-House-hoodie-768x1024.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>2024 has been a year of movement.
