However, fears surrounding generative AI include ethical concerns like deepfakes, the potential impact on jobs, issues around information reliability, and challenges in ensuring privacy and effective regulation. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is said to be spending <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/apple-conversational-ai-spending/\">millions of dollars a day</a> on AI research as training large language models requires a lot of hardware. Apple is on track to spend <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/23/apple-ai-server-spending-2024/\">more than $4 billion</a> on AI servers in 2024, according to one report.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is said to be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-gpt/\">developing its own generative AI model</a> called \"Ajax\". Designed to rival the likes of OpenAI's GPT-3 and GPT-4, Ajax operates on 200 billion parameters, suggesting a high level of complexity and capability in language understanding and generation. Internally known as \"Apple GPT,\" Ajax aims to unify machine learning development across Apple, suggesting a broader strategy to integrate AI more deeply into Apple's ecosystem.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAspects of the model could be incorporated into iOS 18, such as an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/ios-18-siri-improvements/\">enhanced version of Siri</a> with ChatGPT-like generative AI functionality.
