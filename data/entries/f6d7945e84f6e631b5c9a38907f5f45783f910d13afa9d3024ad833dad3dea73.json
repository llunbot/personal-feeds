You might have heard of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mottram is the former corporate branding specialist and lifelong cycling fan who set up Rapha in 2004 at a time when the sport had yet to experience the explosion of interest in Britain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could say, he made cycling cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode Mottram delves into his decision to step down as CEO in early 2022, and what it has been like slowly letting go of the reins, this may or may not be where his new love of gardening comes in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also shares his views on the current state of the cycling industry and what needs to be done to progress forward. He is unsurprisingly positive about it all, his relentless passion for the sport is unwavering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, as a bonus Emma and James share their New Years resolutions. What are yours?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our chat begins at 4:30.</p>\n\n\n\n<div> </div>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Listen to Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 95 now on Acast</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Check out <a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/618e52740da782001471efbe/episodes\" target=\"_blank\">all episodes</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Also available wherever you get your podcasts</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you know Cyclist is also a stunning monthly magazine?
