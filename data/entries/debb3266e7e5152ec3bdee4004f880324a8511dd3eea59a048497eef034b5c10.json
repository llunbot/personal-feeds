In the first instance, US Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/05/judge-wont-force-reddit-to-identify-anonymous-users-who-discussed-piracy/\">ruled</a> in the US District Court for the Northern District of California that the First Amendment right to anonymous speech meant Reddit didn’t have to disclose the names, email addresses, and other account registration information for nine Reddit users. Film companies, including Bodyguard Productions and Millennium Media, had <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/02/reddit-should-have-to-identify-users-who-discussed-piracy-film-studios-tell-court/\">subpoenaed Reddit</a> in relation to a copyright infringement <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.njd.480117/gov.uscourts.njd.480117.1.0.pdf\">lawsuit</a> against Astound Broadband-owned RCN about subscribers allegedly pirating 34 movie titles, including <em>Hellboy </em>(2019)<em>, Rambo V: Last Blood, </em>and <em>Tesla.</em></p>\n<p>In the second instance, the same companies sued Astound Broadband-owned ISP Grande, again for alleged copyright infringement occurring over the ISP’s network. The studios subpoenaed Reddit for user account information, including \"IP address registration and logs from 1/1/2016 to present, name, email address, and other account registration information” for six Reddit users, per a July 2023 <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.414273/gov.uscourts.cand.414273.15.0.pdf\">court filing</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995738#p3\">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995738&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"debb3266e7e5152ec3bdee4004f880324a8511dd3eea59a048497eef034b5c10","category":"Tech"}
