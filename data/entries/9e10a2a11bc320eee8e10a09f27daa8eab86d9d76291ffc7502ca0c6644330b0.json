The design acts like a closed cell foam so it won’t absorb sealant, but it will expand when you puncture your tire, allowing it to fill the space and keep you riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also supports the tire and acts like a micro suspension, enhancing ride quality and control, too. Aimed at the XC to Downcountry to Trail crowds, it’s an absolute game changer. Here’s how it works…</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vittoria-air-liner-light-xc-tire-insert-03.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vittoria-air-liner-light-xc-tire-insert-03-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"vittoria air liner lightweight tire insert for xc downcountry and trail bikes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vittoria-air-liner-light-xc-tire-insert-03-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vittoria-air-liner-light-xc-tire-insert-03-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vittoria-air-liner-light-xc-tire-insert-03-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vittoria-air-liner-light-xc-tire-insert-03-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vittoria-air-liner-light-xc-tire-insert-03-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vittoria-air-liner-light-xc-tire-insert-03.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The material is technically an <em>open</em>-cell foam, but it acts like a <em>closed</em>-cell foam where it matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it doesn’t immediately absorb air like a true “open” cell foam would. The barrier and construction prevent immediate pressure equalization with the tire’s air pressure. Meaning, it acts like a “closed” cell foam in that it compresses when you inflate your tire, but… give it about 8-12 hours and it <em>will</em> equalize, expanding back to its original shape and filling up about half of your tire’s volume.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This doesn’t really change the tire pressure that you inflate it to, but they recommend setting up your tires and dialing in your tire pressure the day before an important ride. Day-of top-ups are fine, assuming your tire didn’t leak all its air out overnight.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vittoria-air-liner-light-xc-tire-insert-02.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vittoria-air-liner-light-xc-tire-insert-02-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"vittoria air liner lightweight tire insert for xc downcountry and trail bikes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vittoria-air-liner-light-xc-tire-insert-02-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vittoria-air-liner-light-xc-tire-insert-02-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vittoria-air-liner-light-xc-tire-insert-02-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vittoria-air-liner-light-xc-tire-insert-02-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vittoria-air-liner-light-xc-tire-insert-02-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vittoria-air-liner-light-xc-tire-insert-02.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The real magic happens if you puncture the tire. Because it behaves like a closed cell foam, when your tire loses pressure, the air trapped inside the insert expands to fill that space. The insert’s volume grows by up to 20% to fill the tire, essentially giving you run-flat capabilities!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, it goes from this:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Vittoria-AIR-LINER-Light-inflated.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Vittoria-AIR-LINER-Light-inflated-800x540.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Vittoria-AIR-LINER-Light-inflated-800x540.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Vittoria-AIR-LINER-Light-inflated-297x200.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Vittoria-AIR-LINER-Light-inflated-120x81.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Vittoria-AIR-LINER-Light-inflated-768x518.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Vittoria-AIR-LINER-Light-inflated-1536x1037.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Vittoria-AIR-LINER-Light-inflated.jpg 1800w\" /></a><figcaption>The Air-Liner Light inside a normally inflated mountain bike tire.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To this:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Vittoria-AIR-LINER-Light-punctured.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Vittoria-AIR-LINER-Light-punctured-800x540.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Vittoria-AIR-LINER-Light-punctured-800x540.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Vittoria-AIR-LINER-Light-punctured-297x200.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Vittoria-AIR-LINER-Light-punctured-120x81.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Vittoria-AIR-LINER-Light-punctured-768x518.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Vittoria-AIR-LINER-Light-punctured-1536x1037.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Vittoria-AIR-LINER-Light-punctured.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>The Air-Liner Light insert expanded when the tire loses its air pressure from a puncture.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re riding remotely or in the middle of a race, the Air-Liner Light could be the thing that gets you back home or across the finish line without having to stop for a repair.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They say BMC rider Juri Zalotti finished the last four laps of the 2022 XC short track at Let Gets, France, on a flat rear tire with this, and said the grip was actually better.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Vittoria-AIR-LINER-Light-cornering.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"539\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Vittoria-AIR-LINER-Light-cornering-800x539.jpg\" alt=\"cutaway tire view of vittoria air-liner light tire insert during cornering\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Vittoria-AIR-LINER-Light-cornering-800x539.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Vittoria-AIR-LINER-Light-cornering-297x200.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Vittoria-AIR-LINER-Light-cornering-120x81.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Vittoria-AIR-LINER-Light-cornering-768x517.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Vittoria-AIR-LINER-Light-cornering.jpg 1296w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The insert also does the other things a mountain bike tire insert should do.

Vittoria recommends latex- and ammonia-free sealants (and would prefer if you use their sealant). It’s not the end of the world if you don’t use those, but they may slightly shorten the insert’s lifespan.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Each insert runs $59.99 (per wheel) and fits rims with a 25-30mm internal channel. It’s recommended for tires ranging from 2.1″ to 2.5″ wide. Each insert comes with a 40mm Vittoria Green Multiway Tubeless valve stem that has ports at the base to allow air to get past the insert. Not so much to get past it when <em>in</em>-flating, but so air can get to it when <em>de</em>-flating. And, unfortunately, the valve stems are green, not the black ones shown here.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>First Impressions of the Vittoria Air-Liner Light</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vittoria-air-liner-light-xc-tire-insert-05.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vittoria-air-liner-light-xc-tire-insert-05-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"mountain biker riding with vittoria air-liner light tire inserts\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vittoria-air-liner-light-xc-tire-insert-05-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vittoria-air-liner-light-xc-tire-insert-05-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vittoria-air-liner-light-xc-tire-insert-05-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vittoria-air-liner-light-xc-tire-insert-05-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vittoria-air-liner-light-xc-tire-insert-05-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vittoria-air-liner-light-xc-tire-insert-05-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vittoria-air-liner-light-xc-tire-insert-05.jpg 1800w\" /></a><figcaption>Action photos by Mirrormedia.art.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I rode these last fall at the Bike Connection Agency camp in Italy and they’re amazing. As in, A-MAZ-ING.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They put me on a Cannondale hardtail with 100mm Lefty fork with  Agaro 29×2.35″ tires inflated to 17psi front and 17.5psi rear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m 6’2″ and 195lbs dressed to ride. So I NEVER run tires with that little air pressure. On a hardtail, I’d probably be up around 23-25, depending on the conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But at just 17-17.5psi, the bike rode incredibly well, with no squirm, no impacts, and no squishiness. And it wasn’t for a lack of trying:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vittoria-air-liner-light-xc-tire-insert-06.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vittoria-air-liner-light-xc-tire-insert-06-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"closeup of wheels on mountain biker riding with vittoria air-liner light tire inserts\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vittoria-air-liner-light-xc-tire-insert-06-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vittoria-air-liner-light-xc-tire-insert-06-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vittoria-air-liner-light-xc-tire-insert-06-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vittoria-air-liner-light-xc-tire-insert-06-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vittoria-air-liner-light-xc-tire-insert-06-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vittoria-air-liner-light-xc-tire-insert-06-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vittoria-air-liner-light-xc-tire-insert-06.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I went hunting for all the rocks and roots. The pointier and more abrupt and repetitive the better. Nothing could phase me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vittoria says it’s not just the protection and support that benefit the rider. They say inflating your tires with “only” air provides a very linear compression. Their original Air Liner (for more aggressive riding) is much firmer material that “ramps” up more quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Air-Liner Light has a more progressive compression, so it’s like a bit of suspension before your real suspension kicks in. Or, if you’re still on a hardtail, the lower tire pressure it allows combines with the progressive compression to provide something like a small amount of suspension.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vittoria-air-liner-light-xc-tire-insert-08.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vittoria-air-liner-light-xc-tire-insert-08-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"closeup of wheels on mountain biker riding with vittoria air-liner light tire inserts\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vittoria-air-liner-light-xc-tire-insert-08-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vittoria-air-liner-light-xc-tire-insert-08-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vittoria-air-liner-light-xc-tire-insert-08-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vittoria-air-liner-light-xc-tire-insert-08-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vittoria-air-liner-light-xc-tire-insert-08-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vittoria-air-liner-light-xc-tire-insert-08-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/vittoria-air-liner-light-xc-tire-insert-08.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The other benefit is increased sidewall support, which keeps the tires’ shape intact during hard cornering despite the lower pressures. Combine that with improved impact protection for your rims and a reduced chance of pinch flats and it’s the perfect performance-boosting insurance for XC racers and aggressive trail riders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve just installed these on my own bike and am testing them for the long term, but my first impressions are so good that I’d recommend trying them right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.vittoria.com/us/en/tire-inserts/mtb/air-liner-light-xc-trail\" target=\"_blank\">Vittoria.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/vittoria-air-liner-light-is-a-50g-self-inflating-xc-tire-insert/\">Vittoria Air Liner Light is a 50g, self-inflating XC tire insert</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"9e10a2a11bc320eee8e10a09f27daa8eab86d9d76291ffc7502ca0c6644330b0","category":"Cycling"}
