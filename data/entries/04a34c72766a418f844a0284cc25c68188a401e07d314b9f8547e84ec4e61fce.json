In China and export-friendly countries, the Mate XT adds $1,000 and yet another hinge.

You could say it collapses, really, across two hinges, from a full 10.2-inch diagonal rectangle (about a half-inch short of a standard iPad) down to a traditional 6.4-inch rectangle phone slab. There's also an in-between single-fold configuration at 7.9 inches.
