Meta is already taking steps to scale back that massive asking price, though; as of Sunday, the headset <a href=\"https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/price-drop-news/\">is now available for $1,000</a> in the US and Canada (a similar price drop will take place March 15 in other Quest Pro countries).</p>\n<p>The price drop puts the Quest Pro in line with other high-end headsets, including the untethered $1,100 HTC Vive XR Elite and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/05/one-week-with-the-valve-index-a-vr-game-changer-with-a-few-question-marks/\">the $1,000 Valve Index</a> (which requires tethering to a gaming PC). That said, for practically the same money, you can get <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/02/psvr2-review-plenty-of-improvements-but-is-it-too-little-too-late/\">a $550 PSVR2</a> <em>and</em> the $500 PlayStation 5 to tether it to. And the Quest Pro is still 150 percent more expensive than the cheapest Quest 2, which supports almost all the same software and delivers a sufficient VR experience for most users.</p>\n<p>Speaking of the Quest 2, Meta has also announced a 14 percent price drop for the 256GB version of that headset, from $500 to $430. That price drop brings that expanded-storage option almost all the way back to the $400 that Meta was charging for it <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/07/meta-quest-2-vr-headset-price-jumps-100-to-399-gets-zero-new-features/\">before last year's unprecedented price increase</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1921939#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1921939&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b959da3e1615c9b4589a48c46d5e3bd345c7887d8d1ab099a01e66e220773f96","category":"Tech"}
