{"title":"The Apple Studio Display is finally down to the price it always should have been","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2321779/the-apple-studio-display-is-finally-down-to-the-price-it-always-should-have-been.html","date":1714665018000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>The Studio Display is more than a pretty monitor—it’s also loaded with high-end features you won’t find anywhere else, including a FaceTime camera, spatial audio, and three built-in USB-C ports. All that comes at a price, but today it’s cheaper than it’s ever been: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Studio-Display-Standard-Tilt-Adjustable/dp/B09V3GZD32/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Amazon is selling the 27-inch Apple Studio Display for $1,300</a>, a savings of $299 and the best price we’ve ever seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Studio Display is a fantastic monitor with a 5K Retina display sporting 600 nits of brightness, True Tone, and a P3 wide color gamut. Inside its thin bezels, you’ll find a built-in 12MP ultra-wide camera with Center Stage support, as well as a six-speaker sound system with Spatial Audio, and three USB-C ports with 96W of power delivery for fast-charging a MacBook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/622664/apple-studio-display-review.html\">4-star review</a>, we liked the Studio Display as “an affordable alternative to the Pro Display XDR,” but didn’t love its high price. This deal fixes that and at this price, it gets our full recommendation—especially if you want to <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BSHGHGXR/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">pair it with a Mac mini, which is also on sale for $499</a> ($100 off). So go grab one before the price shoots back up.</p>\n\nMac</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"1c5233e0bd73efeff4ce3f859ea3b113dacd58d905765b0a4563a0b1e423ac23","category":"Apple"}
