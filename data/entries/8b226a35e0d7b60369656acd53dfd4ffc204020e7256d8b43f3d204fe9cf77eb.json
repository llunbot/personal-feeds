If you have $450 to burn that is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple Music has announced that it has partnered with nice lifestyle bookmaker Assouline to turn its <a href=\"https://100best.music.apple.com/us\">list of the 100 Best Albums</a> into an ornate coffee table book. Though at a price tag nearly as high as a new iPad mini, you probably want to make sure a cup of coffee never gets anywhere near it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Assouline’s description, “Every book comes in a custom-designed translucent acrylic slipcase etched with the Apple Music logo, while the linen hardcover is debossed with the same logo to perfectly line up behind the etching. The back of the case is engraved with the edition number, and inside the book there is a hand-numbered ex libris to further highlight the limited nature of this release. The edges of the book’s pages are gilded with a sparkling gold that mirrors the title on the spine.”</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/apple-music-100-best-book.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"apple music book of the 100 best albums opened to bad bunny's un verano sin ti\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/apple-music-100-best-book.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1946w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/apple-music-100-best-book.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/apple-music-100-best-book.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/apple-music-100-best-book.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/apple-music-100-best-book.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/apple-music-100-best-book.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/apple-music-100-best-book.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Bad Bunny’s album, Un Verano Sin Ti, is ranked 76 on Apple’s list.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Assouline/Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside all that is Apple Music’s controversial list of the top 100 albums, which was released earlier this year.
