Algeria’s Azzedine Lagab, one of the athletes who had passed through the feed zone shortly before Arndt, has addressed what happened in a number of posts on social media.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>Well, There is no camel <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f42a.png\" /> race in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/olympics?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#olympics</a> that’s why I came to cycling.
