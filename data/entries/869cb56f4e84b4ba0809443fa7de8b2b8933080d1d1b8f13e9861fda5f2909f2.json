Its original founders were among the very first to realize that lithium-ion laptop cells were just about good enough to power a car, assuming you put enough of them in a pack, and with critical funding from current CEO Elon Musk, the company was able to kick-start an electric vehicle revolution. But those headlines of late have been painting a picture of a company in chaos. Sales are down, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/tesla-profits-drop-55-as-elon-musk-dodges-cheap-car-questions/\">the cars are barely profitable</a>, and now the CEO is <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/tesla-to-lay-off-everyone-working-on-superchargers-new-vehicles/\">culling vast swaths of the company</a>. Just what is going on?</p>\n<h2>Tesla had some good times</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/08/elon-musk-tweets-he-has-funding-to-take-tesla-private/\">Always erratic</a>, Musk's leadership has nevertheless seen the company sell electric cars in <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/01/tesla-sold-1-8-million-electric-vehicles-in-2023/\">volume</a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/01/tesla-reports-its-first-annual-profit/\">profitably</a>. What's more, Musk has at times been able to inspire faith in and devotion to his company's products in a way that makes the late Steve Jobs look like a neophyte—after the Model 3 <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/04/teslas-model-3-is-herethese-are-the-details-youve-been-waiting-for/\">debuted in 2016</a>, 450,000 people gave $1,000 deposits to Tesla for a product that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/03/tesla-model-3-reservations-begin-march-31-how-to-be-near-the-top-of-the-list/\">wouldn't go into production for at least 18 months</a>.</p>\n<p>Of course, that example also illustrates a long-running concern with the company and Musk's investment-attracting pitches: overhyping and underdelivering. By 2018, <a href=\"https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1117043_study-shows-23-percent-cancelations-on-tesla-model-3-deposits\">more than one in five</a> reservation holders wanted a refund after cheaper models were <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/10/elon-musk-says-tesla-is-in-model-3-production-hell/\">delayed</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/02/tesla-announces-35000-model-3-is-closing-its-stores-to-pay-for-it/\">delayed</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021522#p3\">Read 35 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021522&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
