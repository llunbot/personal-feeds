The top of the light cuts off at a sharp line, giving you maximum brightness at the farthest point from the bike. This helps you clearly see what’s coming up, so you can ride faster without being surprised because you didn’t see that pothole or road kill until the last second.</p><p>As the light gets closer to your bike, it becomes more diffused and dimmer to prevent being distracted by stuff that’s too close to react to anyway. This also means it won’t overly illuminate your front tire, which can also be distracting.</p><p><a

But it does get slightly less aerodynamic with that installed.</p><p>The backside is covered with a rubber flap that protects the USB-C charging port from rain and spray. It’ll accept a 2A charger for quick charging, or plug it into a battery pack or dynamo while riding for longer run times. Depending on which of the five modes you choose, output ranges from 140 lumens to 540 lumens, with run times from 1.3 to 6.8 hours.</p><p>Retail price will be $275 when it starts shipping in December 2021, preorders are open now.</p><h3>Lightskin micro headlamp &amp; integrated handlebar/seatpost lights</h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/04090752/Lightskin-U2-mini-bicycle-headlight.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/04090752/Lightskin-U2-mini-bicycle-headlight.jpg\" alt=\"lightskin smallest dynamo powered bicycle headlights\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1050\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/04090752/Lightskin-U2-mini-bicycle-headlight.jpg 1400w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/04090752/Lightskin-U2-mini-bicycle-headlight-297x223.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/04090752/Lightskin-U2-mini-bicycle-headlight-800x600.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/04090752/Lightskin-U2-mini-bicycle-headlight-120x90.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/04090752/Lightskin-U2-mini-bicycle-headlight-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/04090752/Lightskin-U2-mini-bicycle-headlight.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/04090752/Lightskin-U2-mini-bicycle-headlight.jpg 1400w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/04090752/Lightskin-U2-mini-bicycle-headlight-297x223.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/04090752/Lightskin-U2-mini-bicycle-headlight-800x600.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/04090752/Lightskin-U2-mini-bicycle-headlight-120x90.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/04090752/Lightskin-U2-mini-bicycle-headlight-768x576.jpg 768w\"></a></p><p>Lightskin also makes the U2 mini light, which they say is one of the smallest, lightest headlights you can put on your bike. At just 25g, it’s too light to be bothered by bumps and vibrations, so it’s more likely to remain aimed where you set it.</p><p>Two options are available, one dynamo powered, and one that needs to be plugged into an external source (like an e-bike’s battery or power system). They can be mounted from the top or bottom, too, giving you more options for placement. MSRP ranges from $99 to $119, available in December 2021.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/04090718/Lightskin-H2-bicycle-handlebar-with-integrated-headlights.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/04090718/Lightskin-H2-bicycle-handlebar-with-integrated-headlights.jpg\" alt=\"lightskin bicycle handlebar with integrated tail lights\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1050\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/04090718/Lightskin-H2-bicycle-handlebar-with-integrated-headlights.jpg 1400w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/04090718/Lightskin-H2-bicycle-handlebar-with-integrated-headlights-297x223.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/04090718/Lightskin-H2-bicycle-handlebar-with-integrated-headlights-800x600.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/04090718/Lightskin-H2-bicycle-handlebar-with-integrated-headlights-120x90.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/04090718/Lightskin-H2-bicycle-handlebar-with-integrated-headlights-768x576.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/04090718/Lightskin-H2-bicycle-handlebar-with-integrated-headlights.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/04090718/Lightskin-H2-bicycle-handlebar-with-integrated-headlights.jpg 1400w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/04090718/Lightskin-H2-bicycle-handlebar-with-integrated-headlights-297x223.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/04090718/Lightskin-H2-bicycle-handlebar-with-integrated-headlights-800x600.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/04090718/Lightskin-H2-bicycle-handlebar-with-integrated-headlights-120x90.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/04090718/Lightskin-H2-bicycle-handlebar-with-integrated-headlights-768x576.jpg 768w\"></a></p><p>The H2 handlebar series comes in black and silver with flat, riser, and city shapes.
