[credit:\n                        YouTube/Marvel Studios                        ]\n                  </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul><p>I'll admit that I wasn't exactly excited about Marvel's upcoming <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawkeye_(2021_TV_series)\"><em>Hawkeye</em></a> spinoff series on Disney+. It seemed like an odd choice, given the character's relatively minor role in the various <em>Avengers</em> films. But the studio released the official trailer this morning, and I might just change my mind. <em>Hawkeye</em> looks like a fun, comedy-action holiday romp and will debut on the streaming platform just in time for the Thanksgiving/Christmas season.</p>\n<p>Per the official premise:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Former Avenger Clint Barton has a seemingly simple mission: get back to his family for Christmas. Possible? Maybe with the help of Kate Bishop, a 22-year-old archer with dreams of becoming a<span> s</span>uper hero. The two are forced to work together when a presence from Barton’s past threatens to derail far more than the festive spirit.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Obviously, Jeremy Renner is back as Clint Barton/Hawkeye, as are the actors who played his three children, Cooper (Ben Sakamoto), Lila (Ava Russo), and Nathaniel (Cade Woodward). And thanks to that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/07/black-widow-review-scarjos-sendoff-is-mcus-best-standalone-film-yet/\"><em>Black Widow</em></a> end-credits scene where Yelena (Florence Pugh) meets Valentina (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) at Natasha's grave, we know that she's been manipulated into blaming Clint for her foster sister's death and may well be seeking revenge. Pugh's inclusion in the cast list pretty much confirms that.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1794019#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1794019&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"82aa1557079444c06481dc3b902477bee7f3a0bbcd1609421d5d2bfc99bd04ad","category":"Tech"}
