{"title":"Airport — A Typeface Revival","link":"https://airport.revolvertype.com/","date":1732041686000,"content":"\n<p>Lukas Schneider:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>On 13 November 1961, the Oceanic building at London Airport opened\nto handle long-haul flight departure. In 1979, German publisher\nRavensburger brought out a game designed to help children learn to\ncount. Around Christmas 2023, I stumbled across a copy of that\nvintage game. The type on the box caught my eye, and that’s where\nthis story began.</p>\n\n<p>The letterforms resembled those of Helvetica. As the corners were\nsoft, I initially thought it might be its Rounded version.\nHowever, the typeface featured a much larger x-height, the\ncapitals were less wide, and the glyphs also had white bits in\nsome places, yielding a highlight effect. I had never seen this\ndesign before. My first suspicion was that it might be a Letraset\nface, as this would have fitted in well with the release date of\nthe game. Unfortunately, I couldn’t find a match in a catalog by\nthis manufacturer of rub-down type, so I contacted Florian\nHardwig, who had often helped me with type research in the past.\nFlorian was able to identify the mystery typeface. He found it in\na catalog published in 1985 by Layout-Setzerei Stulle, a\ntypesetting service in Stuttgart, Germany. Named Airport\nSpotlight, it’s a derivative of Airport, a typeface that Matthew\nCarter had designed in the early 1960s for signs at London\nAirport.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What a gift that Matthew Carter is still with us today. How’s this tidbit hit you, regarding the speed at which the world worked just decades ago:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In many regards, the adaptations made to Akzidenz echo the\nconsiderations made in the design of Helvetica. In an interview\nfor Computer Arts, Carter comments: “[I]f you look at it today,\nyou’d think was a rip-off of Helvetica. But we’d never seen\nHelvetica in 1961 in London, although it had been produced in\nSwitzerland near Basle at the Haas foundry in 1957. Even if we had\nseen it, and wanted to have it typeset in London, we’d have had to\nget on a plane and fly to Basle and have it typeset there, because\nthe British typesetting trade was so conservative that typefaces\nlike that were simply unobtainable.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://typo.social/@typographica/113510646485127309\">Via Typographica</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/11/19/airport-typeface\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"08868813d2b834f3de9ba9c6f3cd1abb87c818f328af680dfebc7180ce07b09a","category":"Tech"}
