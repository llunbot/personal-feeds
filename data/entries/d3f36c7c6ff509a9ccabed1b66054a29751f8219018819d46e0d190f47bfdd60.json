Part of that's because its publisher, Xbox Game Studios, hasn't put much fanfare behind it; it wasn't even mentioned in Microsoft's not-E3 extravaganza last week.</p>\n<p>But perhaps both we and Microsoft should be putting more of a spotlight on it, given that it now has a release date: September 24, 2024. The game will be released on Steam and Xbox Game Pass for PC simultaneously.</p>\n<p>The date was announced during an Official Xbox Podcast interview (and accompanying <a href=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/12/ara-history-untold-release-date-multiplayer-details/\">blog post</a>) with Marc Meyer, president of Oxide Games, the studio developing <em>Ara</em>. The podcast covered more than just the release date, though, with Meyer offering up some new gameplay detailsâ€”particularly about how multiplayer will work.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031511#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031511&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d3f36c7c6ff509a9ccabed1b66054a29751f8219018819d46e0d190f47bfdd60","category":"Tech"}
