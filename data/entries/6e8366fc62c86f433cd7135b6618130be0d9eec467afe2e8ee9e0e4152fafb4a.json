That just got one step closer, however, with the first preview of the support now available to testers in the Beta Channel version of Windows 11, which means interested users need to opt into the Windows Insider program to gain access.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs it's a preview release, Microsoft has limited the number of Android apps that can be run on Windows 11, and has partnered with Amazon to make around 50 apps on the Amazon Appstore available to download and install. ‌Apple Music‌ isn't available on Amazon's Appstore, but it is possible to run the app using the app's APK and the Windows Subsystem for Android.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe process is a little <a href=\"https://mspoweruser.com/how-to-sideload-any-android-app-apk-on-windows-11/\">convoluted</a> for casual users, but for anyone who is not a fan of iTunes and doesn't like running ‌Apple Music‌ through a browser, it should provide a nice alternative.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/windows-11/\">Windows 11</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/21/apple-music-android-app-windows-11/\">Apple Music Android App Can Now Be Used in Windows 11</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-music-android-app-can-now-be-used-in-windows-11.2318402/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=_l_Ql0jbGNs:sqlNyFrWY6c:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=_l_Ql0jbGNs:sqlNyFrWY6c:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/_l_Ql0jbGNs\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6e8366fc62c86f433cd7135b6618130be0d9eec467afe2e8ee9e0e4152fafb4a","category":"Apple"}
