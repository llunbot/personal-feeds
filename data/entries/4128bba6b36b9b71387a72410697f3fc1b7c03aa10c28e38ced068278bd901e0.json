Conversation turns to this year’s Tour, from Cav’s history-making 35th stage win to the imperial form of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/tadej-pogacar-podcast\" target=\"_blank\">Tadej Pogačar</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All that plus Primož Roglič the unsung hero, Alberto Contador, the man who flew too close to the clenbuterol, and Ned’s new touring one-man stage show, <em>Ned’s Marginal Mystery Tour </em>– all about his love affair with an unearthed newsreel from the 1923 Tour de France.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chat with Ned begins at 8min 34sec.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The Road Book 2011</em> is out now, with essays from Chris Froome, Emma Pooley, Cadel Evans, Ned Boulting and many more.
