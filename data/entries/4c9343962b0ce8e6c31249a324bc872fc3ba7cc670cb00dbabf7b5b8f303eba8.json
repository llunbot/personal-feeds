The report noted that these in-ear temperature sensors could work in tandem with a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/01/multiple-new-apple-watch-health-features/\">temperature sensor in the Apple Watch Series 8</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe health-focused ‌AirPods‌ reportedly also use motion sensors to monitor a wearer's posture and alert them when they are slouching in an effort to improve posture.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple released its \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/06/airpods-pro-conversation-boost/\">Conversation Boost</a>\" feature for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a> last week, which <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/enable-conversation-boost-airpods-pro/\">boosts the volume and clarity</a> of people directly in front of the wearer. It is not clear if the new hearing aid functions being explored by Apple are an extension of Conversation Boost or a wholly different hearing aid-specific feature. ‌AirPods‌ already feature, microphones, an amplifier, and a processor, providing the bedrock for hearing aid functionality.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n‌AirPods‌ may not be suitable as hearing aids for some sufferers of hearing loss since they do not have an all-day battery life, but the report noted that an expansion of FDA regulations for a new class of hearing aids, targeting mild to moderate hearing moss, that is expected next year could pave the way for Apple to explicitly market ‌AirPods‌ as hearing aids.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n‌AirPods‌ have been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/17/airpods-health-tracking-features/\">rumored to feature health-monitoring</a> functions for some time, even with Apple executives <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/16/apple-executive-hints-airpods-health-data/\">hinting at the possibility</a>. While previous reports have only <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/10/apple-watch-series-8-thermometer/\">speculated on the health features</a> that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/12/apple-research-airpods-respiratory-rate/\">could theoretically come to AirPods</a>, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>'s report is the first clarification of the specific features Apple is reportedly exploring.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIndividuals said to be familiar with Apple's plans told the <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> that the ‌AirPods‌ with health features are not expected to launch in 2022, and may never be released.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/the-wall-street-journal/\">The Wall Street Journal</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/13/future-airpods-temperature-posture-hearing-aid/\">Future AirPods Could Monitor Body Temperature and Posture, and Work as a Hearing Aid</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/future-airpods-could-monitor-body-temperature-and-posture-and-work-as-a-hearing-aid.2316724/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=O_otBJx4vTQ:ilMU6j8fAIA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=O_otBJx4vTQ:ilMU6j8fAIA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/O_otBJx4vTQ\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4c9343962b0ce8e6c31249a324bc872fc3ba7cc670cb00dbabf7b5b8f303eba8","category":"Apple"}
