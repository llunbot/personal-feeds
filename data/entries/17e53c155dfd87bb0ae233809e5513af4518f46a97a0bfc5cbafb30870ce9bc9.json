On Twitter, the Denver FBI office (via <em><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/10/fbi-says-you-shouldnt-use-public-phone-charging-stations.html\">CNBC</a></em>) said that public charging stations in hotels, airports, and shopping centers can be a malware attack vector.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/lightning-connector-feature-blue.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nBad actors have learned to use public USB ports to \"introduce malware and monitoring software onto devices,\" the FBI said. When out in public, users should bring their own charger and USB cord, using an electrical outlet for charging purposes instead of a public USB port.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's iPhones and Macs have a USB security feature that prevents the Lightning port from being used for data transfer purposes when it has been more than an hour since the device was unlocked, but this does not prevent malware installation if you are actively using your device and connect to a public port.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>Avoid using free charging stations in airports, hotels or shopping centers. Bad actors have figured out ways to use public USB ports to introduce malware and monitoring software onto devices.

The FBI also warns against using public Wi-Fi for sensitive transactions, opening suspicious documents, using the same password for all accounts, and clicking unsolicited links in text messages and emails.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fbi/\">FBI</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/10/fbi-malware-public-usb-port-warning/\">FBI Warns Against Using Public USB Ports Due to Malware Risk</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/fbi-warns-against-using-public-usb-ports-due-to-malware-risk.2386472/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"17e53c155dfd87bb0ae233809e5513af4518f46a97a0bfc5cbafb30870ce9bc9","category":"Apple"}
