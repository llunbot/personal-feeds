But taking the Purple Haze look to the next level, they already debuted full-on purple anodized brakes back in 2000. Now they are back with a limited Purple Hayes edition of their top-tier four-piston Dominion A4 brakes</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Limited-edition-Purple-Hayes-Dominion-A4-retro-MTB-ano-mountain-bike-disc-brakes_set.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Limited-edition-Purple-Hayes-Dominion-A4-retro-MTB-ano-mountain-bike-disc-brakes_set-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"Limited edition Purple Hayes Dominion A4 retro MTB ano mountain bike disc brake set, lever &amp; caliper\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Limited-edition-Purple-Hayes-Dominion-A4-retro-MTB-ano-mountain-bike-disc-brakes_set-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Limited-edition-Purple-Hayes-Dominion-A4-retro-MTB-ano-mountain-bike-disc-brakes_set-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Limited-edition-Purple-Hayes-Dominion-A4-retro-MTB-ano-mountain-bike-disc-brakes_set-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Limited-edition-Purple-Hayes-Dominion-A4-retro-MTB-ano-mountain-bike-disc-brakes_set-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Limited-edition-Purple-Hayes-Dominion-A4-retro-MTB-ano-mountain-bike-disc-brakes_set-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Limited-edition-Purple-Hayes-Dominion-A4-retro-MTB-ano-mountain-bike-disc-brakes_set.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Technically, the Purple Hayes are exactly the same as standard <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-dominion-a4-feels-like-completely-new-chapter-in-hayes-disc-brakes/\" target=\"_blank\">Dominion A4 brakes</a> that we reviewed a few years back – a brakeset that we said heralded a return for Hayes to the top of trail performance. Zach dubbed them “<em>one of the best trail/enduro brakes on the market – regardless of brand.</em>”  So that’s a good thing.

No word yet exactly how limited, but Hayes does say they expect them to sell out pretty quickly. They only come with a full-length 180cm hose, so buy two sets and chop one down for your front wheel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://hayesbicycle.com/\" target=\"_blank\">HayesBicycle.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/a-purple-haze-hayes-brings-back-purple-ano-for-limited-edition-dominion-a4-disc-brakes/\">A Purple Haze: Hayes Brings Back Purple Ano for Limited Edition Dominion A4 Disc Brakes</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"e630e8852972b01c9493374b98b10e29d72334925a2764fa1b7a649d7c2c7fb1","category":"Cycling"}
