{"title":"Allison Johnson Reviews the Samsung Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus: ‘Incredibly Iterative’","link":"https://www.theverge.com/reviews/610404/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review-screen-battery-camera","date":1739391013000,"content":"\n<p>Allison Johnson, writing at The Verge:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Samsung’s Galaxy S-series is in its software era. Maybe the whole\nsmartphone industry is, too, save for a few phones with hinges\n(Samsung’s included). But overall, we have exited the\nhardware-driven innovation cycle and are firmly in the midst of a\nsoftware-based one. If you want proof, the Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus\nare a good place to start. [...]</p>\n\n<p>This was all true of the S24 and S24 Plus and the S23 and S23\nPlus. I couldn’t give you a good reason why the S25 stands out\ncompared to Samsung’s last three generations of S-series phones. I\ndon’t think Samsung can, either, because its entire sales pitch\nfor the S25 revolves around software and AI capabilities — much\nof which will almost certainly be <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/22/24348631/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on-price-camera-specs#:~:text=Samsung%20smartphone%20product%20manager%20Blake%20Gaiser%20told%20me%20Samsung%20will%20bring%20its%20new%20AI%20features%20to%20older%20devices%20where%20possible.\">ported to previous S-series\nphones</a> in short order.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When an innovative device form factor settles into maturity, the shift from groundbreaking new hardware dropping every few years to iterative evolution stands out. The heady, go-go years of iPhone-derived touchscreen smartphones (including iPhones themselves) weren’t that long ago. Iterative evolution is, let’s face it, more boring. Or at least it’s not exciting. But it’s inevitable.</p>\n\n<p>The laptops that established the form factor were <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerBook_100_series\">the PowerBook 100 series</a>, which Apple shipped at the end of 1991. (Before the PowerBooks, laptops generally lacked built-in pointing devices, and <a href=\"https://medium.com/geekculture/the-luggable-laptop-how-does-it-look-today-part-ii-toshiba-t3200-from-1989-6d15ce56eadd\">were more like briefcases</a>. Apple’s own <a href=\"https://everymac.com/systems/apple/powerbook/specs/mac_portable.html\">1989 Macintosh Portable was more like a suitcase</a>.) Steve Jobs pulled <a href=\"https://everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook-air/specs/macbook-air-core-2-duo-1.6-13-specs.html\">the original MacBook Air</a> out of its manilla envelope in January 2008. Everything since then, for laptops, has been iterative.</p>\n\n<p>The stretch from PowerBook 100 series to MacBook Air was about 15 years, give or take. The “smartphones are boring now” complaints really started to hit a few years ago — about 15 years after the 2007 original iPhone. Somewhere in the second decade is when year-over-year changes start to become more and more iterative. But compound interest generates tremendous wealth over time. People wrongly think Apple’s success is forged mostly by spectacular groundbreaking products, but the true key to their success is nonstop iterative improvement. That, as I wrote in 2010, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2010/05/this_is_how_apple_rolls\">is how Apple actually rolls</a>. You wouldn’t want to use a 2010 MacBook Pro today. There will be small generational leaps and innovations to come (including, perhaps, an “iPhone Air” this year — and future leaps like 2020’s debut of Apple Silicon), but the wheels of technological progress are mostly done wowing us with one-, two-, and maybe even three-year improvements to phones. But trading in a phone older than that should continue to pack a significant amount of <em>wow</em>. So it goes.</p>\n\n<p>Johnson:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Maybe this says more about what passes for a “small” phone in\n2025, but the Galaxy S25 is secretly the best small Android phone\nyou can buy in the US. That’s probably not intentional — more\nlike a victory in a war of attrition. Google’s phones since the\nPixel 5 only come in big and bigger, and niche small phone options\nlike the Asus Zenfone have dropped out of the race. By merely\ncontinuing to exist with a 6.2-inch screen, the smaller S-series\nmodel has become the default option if you don’t want a huge\nAndroid phone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://store.google.com/us/magazine/compare_pixel?hl=en-US\">Google’s Pixel 9 and 9 Pro</a> have 6.3-inch displays, not too much bigger than the S25, but the trend is clear. All phones are getting bigger. Everyone knows the  5.4-inch iPhone 12 and 13 <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2020/11/the_iphone_12_mini_and_iphone_12_pro_max\">Minis</a> weren’t hits, sales-wise, but the people who preferred them absolutely loved them. I’ll bet some of you are reading this, nodding your heads, with your aging 12/13 Minis still in your pockets, dreading the day you upgrade — knowing that the longer you wait, the ever-larger the “smallest” new iPhone will be. Maybe this year’s much-rumored thin-is-in “iPhone Air” will take some of the sting out of that.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/12/johnson-samsung-galaxy-s25\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"83a01ee3d9555008a6de58fdbede382c58e235ec3accd0d69a8b2117b04ed97a","category":"Tech"}
