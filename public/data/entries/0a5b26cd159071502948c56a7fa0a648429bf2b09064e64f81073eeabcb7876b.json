EF Education-EasyPost rider Andrey Amador <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tweetsprivat/status/1605638529614114816\" target=\"_blank\">was spotted riding a Cannondale</a> that looked slightly updated, at least from a distance, in late December 2022. EF riders have been riding what looked to be the new EVO from the start of their training camp this January. It’s even seen a win under Magus Cort at the Volta ao Algarve.</p>\n<p>Now Cannondale has lifted what felt like the most translucent curtain they could find to unveil the fourth generation of the Cannondale SuperSix EVO. Most folks would probably see the outgoing EVO and the new one side by side and think it was a real-life case of the <a href=\"https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/spider-man-pointing-at-spider-man\" target=\"_blank\">Spiderman meme</a>. While we don’t have our hands on the bike quite yet, here is everything we know about Cannondale’s latest race-ready road bike.</p>\n<figure>\n<p></p><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/CY23-Cannondale_SuperSix-EVO_Grubers-1-1340x710.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"Cannondale SuperSix EVO LAB71 bike ridden by EF Education First-EasyPost\" width=\"1340\" height=\"710\" /><figcaption>Cannondale’s pro riders have been on the new SuperSix EVO since late last year. (Photo: Cannondale)</figcaption></figure></figure>\n<h2>SuperSix EVO Details</h2>\n<p>For years, a majority of Cannondale bikes came with their own in-house cranks called Hollowgram Si. Si stood for “System Integration,” and rather than ditching them for other options, Cannondale fans loved just how light, stiff, and versatile they were. This fourth-generation SuperSix EVO no longer uses those cranks, but the System Integration ethos continues today to indicate a holistic approach toward aero efficiency, user-friendliness, and cutting the fat where necessary.</p>\n<p>Aero was a significant area of focus for the new EVO. The frame and fork have been revised, but Cannondale also designed its seatpost, bars, and even wheels in conjunction with the frame. For Cannondale – and a number of other options like the <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2022/07/enve-reveals-its-first-production-road-bike-the-melee/\">ENVE Melee</a> and <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2020/07/2021-bmc-teammachine-slr01-fourth-generation-review/\">BMC Teammachine SLR</a> – creating a bike as an optimized package is the next step in improving aero efficiency. As a result, Cannondale touts the latest EVO can save a full 12 watts of power at 45 km/h (28 mph) over the previous bike. Their wind tunnel testing also claims that the SuperSix EVO is faster than the likes of the <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2020/07/the-new-specialized-tarmac-sl7-review-the-venge-is-dead/\">Specialized Tarmac SL7</a> and <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2020/06/2021-trek-emonda-review/\">Trek Emonda SLR</a>. Heady stuff.</p>\n<figure>\n<p></p><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/CY23_Cannondale-S6_Presentation_Cannondale-_AeroSlides-3-1340x754.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"Cannondale SuperSix EVo aerodynamics vs SystemSix\" width=\"1340\" height=\"754\" /><figcaption>Cannondale has made some serious claims about how aero the new SuperSix EVO is against not only the previous EVO but the <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2018/07/cannondale-systemsix-first-ride-review-2019/\">SystemSix</a> as well. (Photo: Cannondale)</figcaption></figure></figure>\n<figure>\n<p></p><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/CY23_Cannondale-S6_Presentation_Cannondale-_AeroSlides-4-1340x754.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"Cannondale SuperSix EVO bike aerodynamic test results vs Specialized and Trek\" width=\"1340\" height=\"754\" /><figcaption>Cannondale claims the SuperSix EVO is more aerodynamic than the Specialized Tarmac and Trek Emonda. To me, these graphs show that the one-piece handlebar is doing a lot of heavy lifting, at least aerodynamically. (Photo: Cannondale)</figcaption></figure></figure>\n<p>You can see these aero tweaks across the frameset, small as they may be. The SuperSix EVO maintains the fully internal cable routing of the previous EVO, but it ditches the opening at the front of the headtube to route the cables through the headset, between the headset bearing and the fork’s steerer tube. Cannondale claims that doing so allows for a narrower – and thus more aerodynamic – headtube area. The seat tube and seatpost are deeper now to further aid aero efficiency. The bike now uses fully-enclosed front and rear dropouts that are admirably clean, and according to Cannondale, more aerodynamic. There are even aero bottle cages that are said to smooth airflow around the bike with a water bottle in place.</p>\n<figure>\n<p></p><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/C23_Cannondale_SuperSix_EVO_Tech-2-1340x894.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"Cannondale SuperSix EVO bike with Delta steerer and cable routing. \" width=\"1340\" height=\"894\" /><figcaption>Cannondale has moved its internal cable routing from in front of the headset to through the top headset bearing. This looks cleaner and is said to be more aero, but it is certainly a hindrance when swapping an integrated handlebar like this one.

(Photo: Cannondale)</figcaption></figure><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Top SuperSix EVO models receive the new SystemBar R-One, a one-piece carbon handlebar and stem that further complements the bike’s drag reduction. The bar itself is a partnership with Italian motorsports company MOMODesign, best known for wheels, seats, and steering wheels. While Cannondale says their engineers focused on drag reduction, MOMO focused on ergonomic refinement and style. The result is a striking integrated bar design, regardless of where you stand on this type of integration.</p>\n<p>Those who want to dither with their handlebar setups or adjust the angle of their bars can use the C1 Conceal stem, which allows for use with your favorite drop bar that uses a 31.8 mm clamp.</p>\n<p>Alongside that mantra of “System Integration” is the introduction of new wheels. The Cannondale HollowGram R-50 comes in two flavors: HollowGram R-SL 50 at 1520 g, and HollowGram R-S 50 at 1620 grams. These hooked rims share the same profile: 50 mm depth, 21 mm internal width, and 32 mm external width. Both wheelsets receive DT Swiss hub internals, a plus in our books as they can be maintained without special tools and can be easily adapted to different freehub or frame spacing setups.</p>\n<p>The SuperSix EVO bring along a number of user-friendly updates. Threaded bottom bracket fans rejoice: the EVO now sports a standard BSA 68 mm bottom bracket, finally making the same changes that the <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2022/08/cannondale-synapse-carbon-2-rle-review-field-test-2022/\">Cannondale Synapse</a> and <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2022/04/cannondale-announces-a-welcome-overhaul-to-the-topstone-carbon-gravel-bike/\">Topstone</a> received. Below that is an easy-access Di2 battery port that allows for wiring to be neatly routed to the derailleurs. Riders who want to take advantage of the SmartSense system first introduced on the Synapse – with its on-board lights and rear-facing radar – can do so.</p>\n<figure>\n<p></p><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/C23_Cannondale_SuperSix_EVO_Tech-8-1340x894.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"Cannondale SuperSix EVO bottom bracket area and Di2 battery port\" width=\"1340\" height=\"894\" /><figcaption>Cannondale was the brand to develop the press-fit BB30 bottom brackets, so it is noteworthy that they’re using a threaded bottom bracket for the new EVO.

Also shown are their new ReGrip Aero cages and Gripper Aero bottles, which are said to actually aid in aero efficiency.

EVO Hi-MOD frames weigh in at about 815g, while standard carbon models are said to weigh about 915g. All EVO models tout a tire clearance for 30mm tires with over 6mm clearance on either side.</p>\n<h2>SuperSix EVO, Courtesy of LAB71</h2>\n<p>We’ve mentioned LAB71 a few times here. In short, LAB71 is what Cannondale calls their new no-holds-barred sub-brand. Think of it as a skunkworks akin to BMW M or Mercedes-AMG in the automotive world, where engineers are encouraged to build the best version of a platform that they can. More than just outright speed and efficiency, LAB71 is supposed to give their bikes a more premium feel, with improved finishes and special touches that befit a premier bike.</p>\n<p>LAB71’s first entry is the SuperSix EVO LAB71, which receives the best Cannondale has to offer. There are four finishes available with the LAB71 bikes, including that EF-livery version that’s been plastered about in spy shots. Riders who want the complete build will have to love a ruby red clearcoat and a whole bunch of satin black.</p>\n<p>Of course, that premium feel and performance comes with a premium price tag. While Cannondale touts the LAB71 SuperSix EVO weighs just 6.8kg, it is priced at an astronomical US $15,000 / €14,999. Call it an aspirational bike with aspirational pricing.</p>\n<figure>\n<p></p><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/C23_Cannondale_SuperSix_EVO_LAB71_Beauty-14-1340x1005.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"Cannnondale SuperSix EVO LAB71 complete bike cockpit details\" width=\"1340\" height=\"1005\" /><figcaption>A look at the cockpit of the LAB71 SuperSix EVO, handlebars proudly sporting the MOMODesign logo.

They’ll be happy to know that there are minimal changes. Just about every size is unchanged, meaning the nimble, responsive, but stable handling of the previous bike should remain.</p>\n<figure>\n<p></p><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/CY23_SuperSixEVO_geo-1340x1451.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"Cannondale SuperSix EVO bike geometry\" width=\"1340\" height=\"1451\" /><figcaption>SuperSix EVO geometry doesn’t change much, but taller riders will have one fewer size option. (Photo: Cannondale)</figcaption></figure></figure>\n<p>There are two fork rake options between larger and smaller sizes to maintain racey trail figures between 58 and 60mm. Doing so allows riders of every height to have similar handling experiences, and the smallest size should smaller riders avoid toe overlap issues</p>\n<p>Geometry is shared across the SuperSix EVO regardless of frame material choice.</p>\n<p>Folks who rode either a 60 or 62cm EVO previously will need to pour one out, however, as the new EVO consolidates them into a 61cm option. Reach and stack numbers strike a fine balance between the two sizes. If you needed a 62cm model before, the 61cm frame with an extra spacer under the stem should fit you about the same.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The Cannondale SuperSix EVO road bike competes in a loaded field. Choosing a Cannondale over the fray usually required accepting or embracing its quirks. This latest generation road bike seems every bit as refined as the competition without the caveats that could frustrate riders at times, but where does that place the bike amongst devoted EVO fans?</p>\n<p>Stay tuned for that. We’ll have a full SuperSix EVO bike review soon enough to put the bike through its paces.
