And today you can save a bundle on an old one: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/2022-Apple-iPad-10-9-inch-Wi-Fi/dp/B09V3H386P/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Amazon is slashing prices of the M1 iPad Air to $449 (64GB) and $599 (256GB) in all colors</a>, a savings of $150 and the best price we’ve ever seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPad Air is a fantastic tablet, with a 10.9-inch Liquid Retina display, a super-powerful M1 chip, a 12MP front camera with Center Stage, Apple Pencil 2 support, USB-C, and Touch ID. The new model brings a few upgrades along with the newer chip, most notably a landscape front camera and Wi-Fi 6E, but otherwise, the two tablets are identical. They even have the same size screen despite Apple saying the new model has an 11-inch screen versus the M1 model’s 10.9-inch display.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you’ve had your eye on the 11-inch M2 iPad Air, save yourself $150 and grab a 10.9-inch M1 before they’re gone forever. And with the savings you can buy yourself an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2327969/forget-the-apple-pencil-pro-the-apple-pencil-2-is-down-to-79-right-now.html\">Apple Pencil 2 for $79 ($50 off)</a> and still have some money for AppleCare+.</p>\n\niPad</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"0c016fb78014d03b2bcfb8f3ea53ab513f2ce4a52df18416290046468ae4ef85","category":"Apple"}
