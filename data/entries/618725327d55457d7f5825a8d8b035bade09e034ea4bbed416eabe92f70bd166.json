I’d be having me a good ol’ used rim-brake <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/giant-tcr-advanced-pro-2-disc-long-term-review/\">Giant TCR</a>, which I’d upgrade with a Shimano Dura-Ace R9050 Di2 groupset.</p>\n<p>I rode a similarly specced bike on the cobbles of Roubaix and it was one of the best-handling machines I’ve ever ridden.</p>\n<p>I want a bike that I wouldn’t mind throwing into a sketchy corner during local road races, but this would, of course, be treated to a new paintjob first.</p>\n<p>I’d go with Azure Blue over chrome to make it really pop in the light, though I’d ask for clear lacquer over bare carbon on the graphics to keep things subtle.</p>\n<p>It would have a set of handmade carbon wheels that I’d get my mate Rob to build up on a set of Tune hubs – in chrome, naturally. The tyres would be something simple, such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/continental-gp5000-as-tr/\">Continental GP5000</a>, but I’d be fancy and put some TPU <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-inner-tubes/\">inner tubes</a> in there.</p>\n<p>I’d put one of the best power meters on it too – something such as a Power2Max NG. I’d finish things off with a Ritchey Neo Classic bar, white bar tape and a white saddle.</p>\n<h2>Tom Marvin: an oh-so-niche Starling Sturn V2 DH bike with a Classified hub</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> We got our hands on a prototype version of the Sturn back in 2018.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Though I never ride downhill, if I were to adopt the dirtbag, van-life, <em>seasonaire</em> ‘thing’ again, I would build a very niche Starling Sturn V2 DH bike.</p>\n<p>The Sturn is a beautifully crafted steel downhill bike. Thanks to its singlespeed, high-pivot, chainring-on-the-wrong-side drivetrain build, it’s reminiscent of Brooklyn Machine Works’ long-travel downhill bikes of the early 2000s.</p>\n<p>The chainring runs a Jack Drive system.</p>\n<p>This sees the chain run up the chainstay to a sprocket mounted around the main, high pivot.</p>\n<p>This main pivot-mounted sprocket is driven by a sprocket on the other side of the pivot, which, in turn, is driven by a chainring mounted to the left-hand (non-driveside) crank.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/what-is-a-high-pivot-mountain-bike/\">high-pivot</a> design – with its one-to-one, constant chain length drivetrain – gives a rearward axle path with zero chain growth (and thus no pedal kickback). This would help smooth the deep braking bumps that plague bikepark downhill runs by the second week of the season.</p>\n<p>The system also means there is no <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/a-complete-guide-to-rear-derailleurs/\">rear derailleur</a> to prang off rocks and roots, and the rear wheel is – theoretically – lighter. This reduces un-sprung weight, improving suspension sensitivity.</p>\n<p>On the face of it, I reckon a singlespeed would be fine – ultimately, if everything is lift-assisted, then you only need to put a few pedal strokes in before gravity does its job.</p>\n<p>But, given this is a money-no-object build, I’m going to make mine a ‘dinglespeed’ – yep, a 2-speed bike.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A downhill bike with a Classified hub? Impossible, probably. Have I won the lottery? Yes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tom Marvin / OurMedia</i></span></div>\n<p>I’d fit the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/classified-powershift-boost-hub/\">new Classified MTB rear hub</a> to the bike, and because I’ve an unlimited budget, get a machining house to build a singlespeed sprocket for the 2-speed, electronically activated hub (which requires a bespoke cassette, usually).</p>\n<p>Finally, finishing the build would be a plush coil-shock fork, some broad alloy downhill hoops (I wouldn’t want to appear too opulent during my season with carbon hoops), a range of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/maxxis-mountain-bike-tyres-guide/\">Maxxis tyres</a> and a pair of powerful stoppers from Formula (because I like how they look).</p>\n\n<h2>Tom Law: an uber-light trail bike from Asco</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Oh man – I want this bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Asco</i></span></div>\n<p>Contrary to my general preference for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-downcountry-mountain-bikes/\">downcountry bikes</a>, if I were lucky enough to win a fortune (and I hadn’t blown it all on resto-mod cars) I’d have to go for a mega light <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-trail-bikes/\">trail bike</a>.</p>\n<p>Since joining BikeRadar, I’ve been venturing into some gnarlier terrain than I’m used to, so something a little longer-travel than my beloved <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/transition-spur-x01-review/\">Transition Spur</a> would fit the bill nicely.</p>\n<p>Last Bikes’ stunning Asco would be top of my list.</p>\n<p>The bike features a similar suspension layout to the Spur, with a flex-stay rear end. The travel is bumped up to 130mm with a 140mm fork.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Last Bikes Asco is seriously light.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Last Bikes</i></span></div>\n<p>It’s also extremely light, with the lighter frame of the two options coming in at a scant 1.79kg without shock.</p>\n<p>It also sticks with unfussy cable routing and a threaded bottom bracket – praise be for BSA and regular internal routing!</p>\n<p>I’d deck it out with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/rockshox-flight-attendant/\">RockShox Flight Attendant</a> suspension, a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-mountain/sram-xx-t-type-eagle-transmission-powermeter-axs-review/\">SRAM XX SL T-Type Transmission</a>, a 200mm-drop Reverb AXS post (I’ve won the lottery, so I can have the seemingly impossible), Trickstuff Piccola HD brakes, Berd Hawk30 wheels with their rope spokes, and a lovely Chromag cockpit.</p>\n<p>Because I can have what I want, I’d have Maxxis make me its new <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/maxxis-forekaster-tyre/\">Forekaster tyre</a> in a MaxxGrip compound for the front to go with a MaxxTerra out back. Phew.</p>\n<h2>Ashley Quinlan: a prosaic (but flashy) BMC Teammachine SLR 01</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A turquoise BMC Teammachine SLR 01 revs my engine.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Even if I won the lottery, I’d probably still be quite shrewd with my money… apart from the chalet in the Alps I’d buy for BikeRadar’s exclusive use as a bike testing hub (and my holidays, of course).</p>\n<p>So, my lottery bike would still be one I could buy off the shelf.</p>\n<p>This would most likely be a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/bmc-teammachine-slr-01-two-review/\">BMC Teammachine SLR 01</a> – this is the same dream bike I spoke about on the BikeRadar Podcast.</p>\n\n<p>I’d buy a turquoise frame kit and add the components I’d want – ENVE SES 4.5 wheels with 28c <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/continental-grand-prix-5000-s-tr-review/\">Continental GP5000 S TR</a> tubeless tyres, and a Shimano Dura-Ace R9200 Di2 groupset, please.</p>\n<p>I’d probably swap out the crankset for a power meter model – although I’d have to engage BikeRadar’s power meter tester-in-chief <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/author/bromleysimon/\">Simon von Bromley</a> to work out which one I should have (or, indeed, BikeRadar’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-power-meters/\">best power meter buyer’s guide</a>).</p>\n<p>To a lottery winner, ceramic bearings might seem a given, but I’d probably avoid them. After all, they’re arguably harder to replace through a bike shop when needed, no matter how much money I have.</p>\n<p>I’ll want to be riding this thing, after all!</p>\n<h2>Jack Luke: the tandem of my dreams</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Cecil is perfect, but could be perfect-er.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Owning a tandem (and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/riding-a-tandem-is-dumb-and-you-should-try-it/\">telling everyone about it</a>) is a core part of my dull as dishwater personality, so my pick should come as no surprise.</p>\n<p>Following <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/bikeradar-builds-jacks-refurbished-touring-tandem-cecil/\">a significant refurbishment in 2020</a>, my (our?) current tandem is pretty much perfect, but I’m sure I could make room for another in my groovy modernist house bought with my lottery winnings.</p>\n<p>I would order a bespoke steel tandem designed for fully loaded off-road adventures.</p>\n<p>It would have clearance for 45mm gravel tyres, which would be fitted to a pair of stout 40-spoke alloy rims. These would be 4x laced to a SON dynamo hub up front and something easily serviceable out back – maybe a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/hope-pro-5-hub-range/\">Hope Pro 5</a>.</p>\n<p>A pair of square-taper Middleburn cranks spinning on SKF bottom brackets would drive a Shimano Di2 drivetrain. Shimano hasn’t updated its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/electronic-groupsets/\">electronic mountain bike drivetrains</a> in some time, so I’d settle for XTR M9050 in a 2x setup until something new comes along.</p>\n<p>We’d have a sensible touring-friendly cockpit each and a full complement of Ortlieb panniers would sit on custom racks.</p>\n<p>The whole lump would be painted a resplendent shade of sparkly poo brown, and you wouldn’t see Laura or me for at least six months as we trundled towards the horizon on a pastry-fuelled jolly.</p>\n<h2>Oscar Huckle: a modified, Campagnolo-equipped Routt 45</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This with wider tyre clearance is about as good as it gets.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matthew Loveridge / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>My dream bike is a Moots Routt 45 titanium gravel bike with a couple of choice modifications.</p>\n<p>I’ve always lusted over a Moots – the brand’s attention to detail is second-to-none and I love the 3D-printed dropouts.</p>\n<p>The frame would be in the ‘Stanley’ finish.</p>\n<p>This sees the multi-coloured down tube and top tube logos paired with a gradient finish on the driveside chainstay inspired by the Overlook hotel carpet pattern in Stanley Kubrick’s blood-drenched horror masterpiece, <em>The Shining</em>.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This is Moots’ coolest finish.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Moots</i></span></div>\n<p>The Routt 45 can accept up to 50mm <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-tyres/\">gravel bike tyres</a>, but I’d like tyre clearance boosted slightly so I could confidently run a 50mm tyre in sloppy weather.</p>\n<p>The bike would have a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/brand/campagnolo/\">Campagnolo groupset</a>, probably Ekar because I prefer <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/1x-drivetrains/\">1x drivetrains</a> for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/what-is-gravel-riding/\">gravel riding</a>.</p>\n<p>Since I’ve won the lottery, I’d spec custom Ekar shifters that feature the brand’s UltraShift mechanism.</p>\n<p>This enables you to down-shift up to five gears at once – a deeply satisfying sensation that Campagnolo didn’t port over to Ekar because the brand thinks you might accidentally downshift through more gears than intended when riding on gravel. Nonsense, I say.</p>\n<p>I’d spec a Chris King wheelset with a matching headset and bottom bracket. I’d opt for Moots’ own lust-worthy titanium finishing kit and a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/saddles/specialized-s-works-power-with-mirror-saddle-review/\">Specialized S-Works Power Mirror</a> saddle.</p>\n<h2>Luke Marshall: a Transition Relay PNW Carbon XO1 AXS</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Relay really tickles my pickle.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Transition</i></span></div>\n<p>I can think of more than a few bikes I’d like to ride, but this is the one I would go into a shop and buy today – a Transition Relay PNW Carbon XO1 AXS.</p>\n<p>This 170mm-travel lightweight <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-electric-mountain-bikes/\">electric mountain bike</a> uses a Fazua Ride60 motor and 430Wh battery, and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/what-is-faster-mullet-bike-29er/\">mixed-size wheels</a>.</p>\n<p>E-MTBs are great but, for me, full-power versions don’t deliver the same downhill performance or feel as a traditional enduro bike.</p>\n<p>So, a long-travel, lightweight <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/what-is-an-electric-bike/\">electric bike</a> seems like the best of both worlds – I’ll happily sacrifice a little uphill speed for more downhill thrills.</p>\n<p>I’ve ridden one lightweight ebike before and was thoroughly impressed. It took the sting out of climbing but didn’t hinder the fun on the trails, especially on steep, wild tracks. I’ve no doubt this Transition would be a riot to ride.</p>\n<p>Its removable battery is a bonus. With all my money, I can buy another to swap out the first battery when it’s flat, so I won’t suffer from range anxiety. Ride one battery in the morning and the second in the afternoon.</p>\n<p>The spec on this bike needs no upgrades, although I would swap out the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/coil-vs-air/\">coil shock for an air shock</a> because I prefer the feel. I can imagine smooth rides up and hammering it back down repeatedly. Brilliant.</p>\n<h2>Warren Rossiter: a Cannondale Topstone (that doesn’t exist yet)</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Imagine this, but even rowdier and fancier.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Cannondale</i></span></div>\n<p>This should be the easiest question to answer, but the minute I started even considering it, it stumped me. I’m fortunate enough to have many bikes I consider to be the best of the best for my needs. I catalogued some of my favourites as part of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/inside-warrens-garage/\">a sneak-peek into my garage</a>.</p>\n<p>Since that feature was published, I’ve purchased a Cannondale SuperSix EVO, an S-Works Tarmac and a GT Grade Carbon. I also have a couple of others in the pipeline.</p>\n<p>With both a custom Parlee Z-Zero and a custom Lynskey titanium in my garage too, alongside an all-time great Giant TCR, I’m pretty much covered for pure <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bikes/\">road bikes</a>.</p>\n<p>I am covered for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bikes/\">gravel bikes</a> too, with the aforementioned GT, a Cannondale Slate and the Kinesis ATR, but I do hanker for another gravel bike. The only problem is, I’m not sure it exists yet…</p>\n<p>I’ve spent a lot of time recently riding <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/bike-of-the-week/giant-revolt-x/\">Giant’s brilliant Revolt X</a>. My test bike was equipped with a SRAM Red XPLR groupset, along with Zipp 101s and RockShox gravel kit.</p>\n<p>What I’d really love to get together, though, is a light, capable frameset such as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/cannondale-lab71-topstone-frameset/\">Cannondale’s Topstone – perhaps in Lab71 trim</a>, since we’re talking lottery money – fitted with SRAM’s new T-Type drivetrain.</p>\n<p>This would necessitate commissioning Cannondale for a whole new rear end, but hey – I’ve won the lottery, haven’t I?</p>\n<p>I’d then build it up with multiple sets of 101s, each equipped with the best tyres for all conditions, SRAM red shifters, an XPLR dropper post and a short-travel suspension fork.</p>\n<p>Exactly which fork is to be determined – we’re currently testing out seven gravel suspension forks, so I’ll have the best of that bunch (keep your eyes peeled for this test soon).</p>\n<p>Bar-wise, I’d probably be going for an Easton Carbon AX and I’d perch myself atop a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/specialized-pro-power-with-mirror-saddle/\">Specialized 3D-printed Power saddle</a>.</p>\n<p>And while I’m at it, I’ll have a custom paintjob too.</p>\n<p>That’s not too much to ask, is it?</p>","author":"Jack Luke","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"618725327d55457d7f5825a8d8b035bade09e034ea4bbed416eabe92f70bd166","category":"Cycling"}
