{"title":"Rocket Report: Rocket Lab’s news blitz; Starship mishap blamed on vibrations","link":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/rocket-report-starship-will-soon-fly-again-gilmour-has-a-launch-date/","date":1740744023000,"content":"<p>Welcome to Edition 7.33 of the Rocket Report! Phew, what a week for Rocket Lab! The company released a bevy of announcements in conjunction with its quarterly earnings report Thursday. Rocket Lab is spending a lot of money to develop the medium-lift Neutron rocket, and as we'll discuss below, a rocket landing platform and a new satellite design. For now, the company is sticking by its public statements that the Neutron rocket will launch this year<span>—the official line is it will debut in the second half of 2025</span><span>—but this schedule assumes near-perfect execution on the program. \"We’ve always been clear that we run aggressive schedules,\" said Peter Beck, Rocket Lab's founder and CEO. The official schedule doesn't quite allow me to invoke a strict interpretation of Berger's Law, which states that if a rocket's debut is predicted to happen in the fourth quarter of a year, and that quarter is six or more months away, the launch will be delayed. However, the spirit of the law seems valid here. This time last year, Rocket Lab targeted a first launch by the end of 2024, an aggressive target that has come and gone.</span></p>\n<p>As always, we <a href=\"https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/\">welcome reader submissions</a>.

Gilmour Space Technologies' launch window announcement marks a major development for the company, which has been working toward a test launch for a decade. Gilmour previously hoped to launch its test rocket, Eris, in May 2024, but had to wait for the Australian government to issue a launch license and airspace approvals for the flight to go forward. Those are now in hand, clearing the last regulatory hurdle before liftoff.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/rocket-report-starship-will-soon-fly-again-gilmour-has-a-launch-date/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/rocket-report-starship-will-soon-fly-again-gilmour-has-a-launch-date/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6aedcac1a05f2d28482c8fce22a30727b80973e501f3eefc0b29283e8294cb8d","category":"Tech"}
