\n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Matching mitts for your kit\" title=\"spprtful-spring-summer-2017-kit-40-1492681930428-nuskewr7jixn-2052304\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Mitts can make riding more comfortable in the summer months.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Wearing gloves when cycling adds comfort but also protection in the event of a crash.</p>\n<p>Vibration through the bars can cause <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/hand-and-wrist-pain-cycling/\">hand pain</a> on long rides, leading to numbness and the dreaded ‘white finger’.</p>\n<p>The best cycling gloves will feature padding around the contact points of your palm and fingers to isolate your hands from the bar.</p>\n<p>Many riders also wear gloves to improve their grip in the summer months, where sweaty hands can lead to slippy bars.</p>\n<p>Gloves also reduce injuries to your hands if you fall off, with the sacrificial fabric taking the brunt of any impact instead of your skin.</p>\n<h3>Cycling gloves sizing</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"DHB Aeron mitts with Elastic Interface pad\" title=\"DHB Aeron mitts with Elastic Interface pad\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> There’s no hiding from the cliché, they should fit like a glove.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Cycling gloves should be slim-fitting, giving you enough dexterity without feeling you’re cutting off circulation to your fingers.</p>\n<p>As with many cycling clothing items, glove size and fit is very personal, with everyone’s hands being slightly different even if they are the same size.</p>\n<p>It is best to try cycling gloves before you buy them to see whether they suit your hand shape and size.</p>\n<p>Aero gloves will usually be tighter-fitting than regular gloves, but they tend to have in-built stretch around the wrist and knuckles.</p>\n<h3>Cycling gloves material</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n

Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Cycling gloves are made from at least two panels, with the back of the hand featuring Lycra and mesh while the palm employs a more durable material such as microfibre or synthetic suede.</p>\n<p>Mesh panels on the back of cycling gloves allow heat to escape, helping to regulate temperature.</p>\n<p>Some of the best gloves for cycling feature an absorbent wipe on the thumb area. This enables you to sop up sweat from your face.</p>\n<h3>Cycling gloves padding</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"The palm of Craft's latest Puncheur mitts\" title=\"dscf0209-1490276387030-d4rljwqdf4tx-1000-100-83eb3d0\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The palm of Craft’s latest Puncheur mitts</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oliver Woodman/Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Not all cycling gloves feature padding, with some of the lighter-weight designs focusing on fit and breathability.</p>\n<p>Cycling mitts with padding will usually have silicone or foam to isolate your hands from the handlebar.</p>\n<p>Not all riders have the same pressure points when gripping a bar, so it’s worth trying the gloves on to see if the padding is beneficial or just adding bulk.</p>\n<h3>How to wash cycling gloves</h3>\n<p>Washing cycling kit the right way can <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/how-to-make-your-cycling-kit-last-longer/\">make it last longer</a>, and cycling gloves are no exception.</p>\n<p>Not all cycling gloves are machine washable due to the padding and textiles used in their construction, which can become damaged with too much heat.</p>\n<p>The manufacturer label will usually feature washing instructions, but washing your gloves with cool water and a light detergent will usually be enough to get most of the grub off. Just remember to avoid the tumble dryer.</p>\n<h3>Long-fingered gloves vs fingerless gloves</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"What to wear mountain biking gloves\" title=\"What to wear mountain biking gloves\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Mountain bikers tend to wear full-finger gloves for extra protection.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd</i></span></div>\n<p>Apart from the obvious distinction that fingerless mitts enable your digits to breathe, they are usually lighter-weight than long-fingered gloves and are favoured for warmer weather.</p>\n<p>Long-fingered cycling gloves offer more protection from the elements in the colder months and the pavement, should you find yourself sliding across it.</p>","author":"Nick Clark","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"c5639a474ec7b60fe3af7ea518f09dd098a490ee2eab7f26d3ffc673f9608249","category":"Cycling"}
