is made with a graphene plus silica compound that’s designed to provide grip, comfort and durability in wet and dry conditions. It’s been tweaked from the compound used in the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/vittoria-corsa-pro-speed-tyre\" target=\"_blank\">Corsa Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/vittoria-corsa-next-review\" target=\"_blank\">Corsa N.ext</a> tyres. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It sits on a nylon casing, with bead-to-bead puncture protection, an additional sidewall layer and Vittoria’s Bead Shield, which provides additional protection for the aramid bead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tread has a minimalist pattern, which Vittoria says provides low rolling resistance for additional speed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vittoria reckons the new tyre provides competition for the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/continental-gp5000-as-tr-tyre-review\" target=\"_blank\">Continental Grand Prix 5000 AS TR</a> and Pirelli Cinturato Velo, but at a lower price. It sits alongside the brand’s Rubino Pro tyre as a more robust alternative at the same price as that tyre and undercuts its Corsa N.ext tyre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The RideArmor tyre is <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-fit-tubeless-tyres\" target=\"_blank\">tubeless-ready </a>and Vittoria says that widths over 28mm are compatible with wheels with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/hookless-rims\" target=\"_blank\">hookless beads</a> as well as hooked. It can also be run with tubes.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-tyre-1-970x645.jpeg\" alt=\"Vittoria RideArmor tyre\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-tyre-1-970x646.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-tyre-1-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-tyre-1-768x511.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-tyre-1-1536x1021.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-tyre-1-2048x1362.jpeg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-tyre-1-750x499.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-tyre-1-1140x758.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-tyre-1-465x310.jpeg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-tyre-1-620x413.jpeg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Vittoria-RideArmor-tyre-1-350x233.jpeg 350w\" /><figcaption>Vittoria </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new RideArmor tyre is available for 700c wheels in seven widths from 26mm to 38mm in 2mm increments, so that you have a wide choice of widths to suit your bike and your tastes. Vittoria says that this makes it suitable for <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/commuting\" target=\"_blank\">commuting </a>and city bikes, as well as <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-the-best-gravel-bike-tyres\" target=\"_blank\">gravel bikes</a>, and not just for road bike use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The RideArmor tyre comes with copper sidewalls (that’s a colour tone down from tan), which Vittoria says gives the tyre a modern appearance. It claims weights between 355g and 475g, with all widths priced at €59.95.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While other sizes are available immediately, the 34mm and 36mm tyres are slated for sale from Q2 2024.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/vittoria-ridearmor-tyres\">New Vittoria RideArmor is its toughest tyre ever</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"pnorman","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"1e5854b3ba8dae571a50735cb51530db5bc2a80a76cf0f875e56f987e309a5a4","category":"Cycling"}
