According to the DOJ, Apple has made it harder for consumers to switch between smartphone platforms, blocked the development of cloud-based streaming apps, made the cross-platform messaging experience worse, limited the functionality of third-party smartwatches paired to the iPhone, prevented third-party apps from offering tap-to-pay functionality, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSome of Apple's policy changes this year have already negated some of these claims. In January, the company started <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/29/apple-allows-cloud-gaming-apps-on-app-store/\">allowing cloud-based game streaming apps on the App Store</a> worldwide. And in August, it <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/14/apple-opening-up-iphones-nfc-chip-to-developers/\">opened up the iPhone's NFC chip</a> used by Apple Pay to third-party developers in the U.S. and select other countries.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn a New Jersey federal court <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.njd.544402/gov.uscourts.njd.544402.203.0.pdf\">on Wednesday</a>, lawyers representing Apple argued that the lawsuit should be dismissed, claiming that the DOJ has failed to plausibly allege that the company has monopoly power in the smartphone market and that consumers were harmed. Judge Julien Neals said that he hopes to make a ruling by January.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"We believe this lawsuit is wrong on the facts and the law, and we will vigorously defend against it,\" said Apple, when the lawsuit was filed earlier this year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis was a routine motion for a lawsuit, and it is likely that the case will proceed to trial, although some of the claims could potentially be amended or dismissed. In all likelihood, the U.S. v. Apple trial will drag on for years to come.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRead our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-vs-doj/\">U.S. v.
