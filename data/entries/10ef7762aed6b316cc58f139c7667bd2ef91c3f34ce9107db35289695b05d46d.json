Android, meanwhile, is set by default to allow only apps available in Google Play. Sideloading—or the installation of apps from other markets—must be manually allowed, something Google warns against.</p>\n<h2>When native apps aren’t</h2>\n<p>Phishing campaigns making the rounds over the past nine months are using previously unseen ways to workaround these protections. The objective is to trick targets into installing a malicious app that masquerades as an official one from the targets’ bank. Once installed, the malicious app steals account credentials and sends them to the attacker in real time over Telegram.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044637#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044637&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"10ef7762aed6b316cc58f139c7667bd2ef91c3f34ce9107db35289695b05d46d","category":"Tech"}
