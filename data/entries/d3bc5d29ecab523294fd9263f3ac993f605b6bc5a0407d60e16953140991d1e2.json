This 2-pack of smart trackers for $34.99 (reg. $69) works with Apple Find My to help you <a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/ethos-smart-tracker-works-with-apple-find-my-with-holder-2-pack-black?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ethos-smart-tracker-works-with-apple-find-my-with-holder-2-pack-black&amp;utm_term=scsf-613744&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000003CB61IAG&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\">locate your essentials in seconds</a> — whether they’re hiding in the couch cushions or left behind at the coffee shop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike other trackers that require extra accessories, these come with key rings included. Clip them onto your keys, wallet, backpack, or even your pet’s collar, and you’re good to go.

The customizable alerts will nudge you if you’re about to head out the door without your essentials. And with a long-lasting CR2032 battery, you won’t be replacing it every other week. They’re even splash-resistant with an IP23-waterproof rating, so a little rain won’t slow them down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stay organized, stress-free, and always one step ahead of your forgetful side — and you won’t have to buy separate key rings like you would with an AirTag. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/ethos-smart-tracker-works-with-apple-find-my-with-holder-2-pack-black?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=ethos-smart-tracker-works-with-apple-find-my-with-holder-2-pack-black&amp;utm_term=scsf-613744&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000003CB61IAG&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\">$34.99 for two, this set of smart trackers</a> offers an affordable alternative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/ethos-smart-tracker-works-with-apple-find-my-with-holder-2-pack-black?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral-cta&amp;utm_campaign=ethos-smart-tracker-works-with-apple-find-my-with-holder-2-pack-black&amp;utm_term=scsf-613744&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000003CB61IAG&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\"> </a></p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://cdnp1.stackassets.com/0f93078be04f1acffc0ce05ddc8d121912359194/store/64840b956b4928de47eeaf95f47cf7df61495d41b8ce68648b21b4f8f50b/product_344984_product_shots1.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Smart Tracker Includes Key Ring – Works with Apple Find My App (2-Pack/Black) – $34.99</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/ethos-smart-tracker-works-with-apple-find-my-with-holder-2-pack-black?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral-cta&amp;utm_campaign=ethos-smart-tracker-works-with-apple-find-my-with-holder-2-pack-black&amp;utm_term=scsf-613744&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000003CB61IAG&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\">See Deal</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.stacksocial.com\" target=\"_blank\">StackSocial</a> prices subject to change.</em></p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"d3bc5d29ecab523294fd9263f3ac993f605b6bc5a0407d60e16953140991d1e2","category":"Apple"}
