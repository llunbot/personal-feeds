Until then, Young said suppliers will be focused on OLED displays for tablets, such as the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn the same report, Young explained that the first OLED Mac is expected to be a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a> with a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/30/13-4-inch-oled-macbook-air-rumor/\">slightly smaller, 13.4-inch display</a>. Simultaneously, it was reported that Samsung Display has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/30/oled-macbook-air-now-in-development/\">started development of OLED displays</a> that will be used for this future ‌MacBook Air‌ model.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition to the 2026 time frame, the information suggests that despite Apple's wish to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/06/apple-microled-struggle-led-to-reliance-on-samsung/\">get away from Samsung displays</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/13/lg-building-line-for-microled-apple-watch/\">switch to its own custom MicroLED technology</a>, Samsung Display will have an omnipresent role in supplying OLED panels for Apple's next-generation devices – contributing to the 11.1-inch ‌iPad Pro‌, 13.4-inch ‌MacBook Air‌, and 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro 14 &amp; 16\" </a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/\">Samsung</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled/\">OLED</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">14\" &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/04/macbook-pro-not-getting-oled-until-2026/\">14- and 16-Inch MacBook Pros Reportedly Not Getting OLED Displays Until 2026</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/14-and-16-inch-macbook-pros-reportedly-not-getting-oled-displays-until-2026.2385862/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"445684776503ea12a56b981ea48805f283a34a269d3cb17733f748287f386256","category":"Apple"}
