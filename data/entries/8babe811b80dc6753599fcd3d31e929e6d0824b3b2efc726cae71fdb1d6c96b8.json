However, recent developments suggest a strategic shift away from the Japanese supplier due to concerns about reliability and Apple's need to integrate new technologies into its camera system.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf the 2026 production roadmap goes to plan, Apple could be using Samsung-made image sensors in the camera system that features on its iPhone 18 series.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/\">Samsung</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/24/2026-iphone-48mp-camera-sensor-samsung/\">Kuo: 2026 iPhone to Use New Advanced Camera Sensor From Samsung</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-2026-iphone-to-use-new-advanced-camera-sensor-from-samsung.2432111/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8babe811b80dc6753599fcd3d31e929e6d0824b3b2efc726cae71fdb1d6c96b8","category":"Apple"}
