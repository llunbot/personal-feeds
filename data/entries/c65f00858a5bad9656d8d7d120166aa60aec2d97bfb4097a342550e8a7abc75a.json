PC monitors that are taller than they are wide have enjoyed a resurgence this year, as they provide more vertical space for taking in long documents, articles, spreadsheets, and social media and news feeds. But this 420×1920 monitor takes the tall-screen thing to new heights.</p>\n<p>As spotted by <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/super-tall-vertical-monitor-is-perfect-for-doomscrollin-1848116439\" target=\"_blank\">Gizmodo</a> today, the screen comes from <a href=\"https://www-nojima-co-jp.translate.goog/elsonic/?_x_tr_sl=ja&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en&amp;_x_tr_pto=nui,sc\" target=\"_blank\">Elsonic</a>, a sub-brand of Japanese company Nojima, which started off with LED bulbs but now makes TVs and other tech products. The EK-MD088 proposes a new category for PC monitors: ultra-tall. Sure, ultra-wide monitors have won spots in the homes of productivity hounds who need to be surrounded by all their tabs and gamers who want to get lost in their virtual world. But an ultra-tall monitor lets you give in to that insatiable need to scroll. The <a href=\"https://online.nojima.co.jp/commodity/1/0479960021309/\" target=\"_blank\">product page</a> specifically highlights web browsing, Twitter, and browser games as use cases. </p><div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/listing-4.jpg\" /><p>Handy for keeping a constant watch on your news feed.

It charges via USB-C but can't output video through the port. The monitor relies on mini HDMI for its video signal. That gives it a little versatility in the sense that it can connect to things lacking USB-C, like a Raspberry Pi and older systems. But with more PCs starting to ditch HDMI, and the monitor already having a USB-C port right there, it feels like a missed opportunity.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1815590#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1815590&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c65f00858a5bad9656d8d7d120166aa60aec2d97bfb4097a342550e8a7abc75a","category":"Tech"}
