Discord has shut down the discussion servers associated with two prominent Yuzu forks—<a href=\"https://suyu.dev/\">Suyu</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/sudachi-emu/sudachi\">Sudachi</a>—while GitHub has removed a <a href=\"https://github.com/github/dmca/commit/f4c2c915c058e01d70d7671668b4c12a4b0e45b5\">couple</a> of <a href=\"https://github.com/github/dmca/commit/ccb374868b46ad19371d9f96cccdd6c8fc689cba\">projects</a> related to the decryption of Switch software for use with emulators or hacked consoles.</p>\n<p>The takedowns are the latest aftershocks from <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/how-strong-is-nintendos-legal-case-against-switch-emulator-yuzu/\">Nintendo's federal lawsuit against Switch emulator Yuzu</a>, which <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/03/switch-emulator-makers-agree-to-pay-2-4-million-to-settle-nintendo-lawsuit/\">led to a $2.4 million settlement</a> weeks later. Yuzu voluntarily shut down its GitHub page and Discord server as part of that settlement, though archived discussions from Discord are still accessible.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.rid.56980/gov.uscourts.rid.56980.10.1.pdf\">That settlement</a> includes a section prohibiting the makers of Yuzu from \"acting in active concert and participation\" with third parties in the distribution or promotion of Yuzu or any clones that make use of its code. But there's no evidence that anyone enjoined by that settlement is actively working with Suyu or Sudachi on their projects.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016897#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2016897&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c3b873b07ee58c6445ef51bdfa0e89157b23138a8d3ff0eecf4a0c6572a48fae","category":"Tech"}
