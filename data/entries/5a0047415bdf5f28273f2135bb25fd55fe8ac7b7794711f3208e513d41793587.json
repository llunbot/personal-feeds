It accounts for a volume of sales inversely proportional to the number of mechanics with its logo tattooed somewhere about their body and its products inspire unusual levels of devotion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Campagnolo has always been always been a high-end manufacturer and while it has dabbled at the budget end of things, it has long since ceded the entry-level and mid-market to its rivals. Its groupsets have a reputation for durability, aesthetics, and premium pricing and the brand largely concentrates on racing products plus its Ekar gravel range. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With such a focussed range, many technologies appear across multiple groupsets in the firm’s lineup. Campagnolo currently produces a single electronic groupset, the much-lusted after Super Record Wireless 12-speed. Below this sit the 12-speed mechanical options of Record, and Chorus, plus the Centaur 11-speed groupset. Ekar, a 13-speed mechanical gravel groupset with a single front chainring, stands alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can find a breakdown of each groupset’s key features and how it compares to its rivals below.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s the difference?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/02224148/campagnolo_press_day_4-96-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"campagnolo_press_day_4-96\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Campagnolo’s more expensive groupsets have greater numbers of gears, lower weights, and the option of electronic shifting. That said, shared technology means key areas like braking power are often standardised across several tiers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Campagnolo is known for its use of materials like titanium and carbon fibre, and the look and feel of the groupsets change as you spend more. Always a firm to go its own way, it’s worth noting that while Campagnolo will work on any bike and with most wheels, you will probably need to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-is-a-freehub\" target=\"_blank\">swap the freehub</a> on your rear wheel to accommodate the brand’s <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-cassette\" target=\"_blank\">uniquely shaped cassettes</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below you’ll find a quick explanation of each of the Campagnolo major groupsets, along with a list of its key features and variants.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Every Campagnolo road groupset compared</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Campagnolo Super Record Wireless 12-speed</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"613\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Campag_super_record_wireless-970x613.jpg\" alt=\"Campagnolo Super Record Wireless\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Campag_super_record_wireless-970x613.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Campag_super_record_wireless-300x189.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Campag_super_record_wireless-768x485.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Campag_super_record_wireless-1536x970.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Campag_super_record_wireless-750x474.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Campag_super_record_wireless-1140x720.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Campag_super_record_wireless.jpg 1900w\" /><figcaption>Campagnolo</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>At a glance:</strong> Outrageously light, very expensive, and with its integrated batteries clunkier-looking than Shimano. Still the choice for well-heeled Campagnolo fans</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>RRP:</strong> £4,500<br /><strong>Cassette:</strong> 12-speed<br /><strong>Largest sprocket:</strong> 29t<br /><strong>Shifting:</strong> Electronic only<br /><strong>Brakes:</strong> Hydraulic disc<br /><strong>Overall Weight:</strong> 2,520g claimed</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first firm to launch a 12-speed groupset in 2018, Campagnolo’s latest <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/campagnolo-super-record-wireless-groupset\">Super Record groupset</a> has gone wireless electronic. It’s eye-wateringly expensive with a retail price of over £4,000, although we should note that’s not a huge amount more than the latest <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/shimano-dura-ace-r9200-and-ultegra-r8100-shimano-finally-goes-12-speed\" target=\"_blank\">Shimano Dura-Ace R9200 groupset</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The headline news for the new groupset is that Campagnolo has abandoned its long-used thumb shifter in exchange for two finger-operated shift levers placed above and below each other behind the brake lever. It reckons that half its users loved the thumb shifter, half hated it. Now there’s no argument.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aimed very much at going fast, Super Record Wireless still offers some concessions to those yet to win themselves a pro contract. The new groupset has a 10 tooth smallest sprocket in the cassette and heads out to 29 teeth. Paired with <span>50/34, 48/32 and 45/29 </span> chainrings, that gives the option of gear ratios down to 1:1 if you want to be able to spin up the hills.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Campag_super_record_wireless-11-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Campagnolo Super Record Wireless\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Campag_super_record_wireless-11-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Campag_super_record_wireless-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Campag_super_record_wireless-11-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Campag_super_record_wireless-11-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Campag_super_record_wireless-11-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Campag_super_record_wireless-11-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Campag_super_record_wireless-11-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Campag_super_record_wireless-11-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Campag_super_record_wireless-11-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/Campag_super_record_wireless-11.jpg 2027w\" /><figcaption>Campagnolo</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<div> </div>\n\n\n\n<p>While SRAM’s wireless AXS groupsets let you swap batteries if you find that your rear derailleur has given up mid-ride, that’s not an option as Super Record Wireless has different shaped batteries front and rear. As well as off-bike charging, there is charging<em> in situ</em> though, with a magnetic coupler to the charger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest iteration of Super Record has gone disc brake only, further breaking with the traditionalists who see an Italian rim brake groupset as the only option on an Italian bike frame.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Campagnolo Super Record 12-speed</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/02224154/campagnolo_super_record_disc.jpeg\" alt=\"Campagnolo groupset components\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/02224154/campagnolo_super_record_disc.jpeg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/02224154/campagnolo_super_record_disc-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/02224154/campagnolo_super_record_disc-465x310.jpeg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/02224154/campagnolo_super_record_disc-350x233.jpeg 350w\" /><figcaption>Campagnolo</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>At a glance:</strong> A stunning mechanical groupset you can buy if you can stomach the price</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>RRP:</strong> £2,857<br /><strong>Cassette:</strong> 12-speed<br /><strong>Largest sprocket:</strong> 34t<br /><strong>Shifting:</strong> Mechanical<br /><strong>Brakes:</strong> Hydraulic disc or conventional caliper<br /><strong>Overall Weight:</strong> 2,050g approx (disc version)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the moment, you can still buy the Super Record mechanical groupset, Campagnolo’s top-end mechanical option. It’s lighter than Super Record Wireless and can accommodate cassettes with sprockets as large as 34t, although starting with 11, not 10 teeth. This means ordinary riders can take on slopes normally reserved for the most sadistic stages of La Vuelta.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mechanical Super Record also accommodates <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/disc-brakes-vs-rim-brakes-everything-you-need-to-know\" target=\"_blank\">disc or rim brake options</a>, with the timeless look of the main components nicely complementing either version. While you might have to rely on your digits rather than a pair of servo motors to do the shifting, Super Record offers crisp, satisfying shifting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, the multi-shift functionality allows you to drop down the cassette three cogs or up five via a single push of the corresponding lever – this is more than on any other mechanical groupset. Equally lovely is the operation of the crankset. It’s made of hollow carbon fibre bonded to a titanium axle and it’s ridiculously light. The crank runs on Cult ceramic bearings and its design epitomises the firm’s approach to small details.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/campagnolo-super-record-12-speed-groupset-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our Campagnolo Super Record review here</a></strong></li><li><strong>Shop Campagnolo Super Record mechanical at <a href=\"https://www.chainreactioncycles.com/p/campagnolo-super-record-2x12-speed-road-groupset\" target=\"_blank\">Chain Reaction Cycles</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Campagnolo Record 12-speed</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/09/02135925/campagnolo-record-groupset-970x455.jpg\" alt=\"campagnolo-record-groupset\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><strong>At a glance:</strong></strong> A marginally more affordable version of the world’s best 12-speed mechanical groupset</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>RRP:</strong> £2,000<br /><strong>Cassette:</strong> 12-speed<br /><strong>Largest sprocket:</strong> 34t<br /><strong>Shifting:</strong> Mechanical<br /><strong>Brakes:</strong> Hydraulic disc or conventional caliper<br /><strong>Overall Weight:</strong> 2,450g approx (disc version)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The regular (but still very premium) Record groupset shares many components and does an almost remarkably similar job to the posher Super Record group. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, while features like the chain, cassettes, and brakes are identical, other components have been tweaked to bring their prices a little closer to earth. In doing so a few bits of titanium become steel, such as the axle on the carbon crankset and the bolts on the derailleur.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/02224209/campagnolo_record_12-speed_-970x455.jpeg\" alt=\"campagnolo_record_12-speed_\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Touches like the bottom bracket’s ceramic bearings are also jettisoned. Still, we’re talking about less than 200 grams added across the entire groupset. The gearing ratios offered are still the same while stopping power is identical.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Record offers the same multi-shift ability as Super Record, while the shape of the hoods is subtly different and the levers themselves lose some weight-saving cutouts. On the plus side, you do get the firm’s Vari-Cushion technology which aims to provide comfort and support even in poor weather.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Shop Campagnolo Record mechanical at <a href=\"https://www.chainreactioncycles.com/p/campagnolo-record-2x12-speed-road-groupset\" target=\"_blank\">Chain Reaction Cycles</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Campagnolo Chorus 12-speed</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/09/02135927/campagnolo_chorus_groupset-970x455.jpg\" alt=\"campagnolo_chorus_groupset\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><strong>At a glance</strong>:</strong> An attractive and good value mechanical alternative to Shimano with outstanding durability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>RRP:</strong> £1,699<br /><strong>Cassette:</strong> 12-speed<br /><strong>Largest sprocket:</strong> 34t<br /><strong>Shifting:</strong> Mechanical<br /><strong>Brakes:</strong> Hydraulic disc or conventional caliper<br /><strong>Overall Weight:</strong> 2,580g approx</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is Chorus the Campagnolo groupset for the rest of us? Previously pitched as a competitor to Shimano’s Ultegra range, the decision to make that groupset electronic-only leaves Chorus without an obvious rival. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, as Shimano is heading towards offering mechanical shifting as an entry to mid-level only product, we can see a lot more bikes switching to this groupset. For one thing, you get twelve sprockets at the back. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/02224211/campagnolo_chorus_12-speed_-970x455.jpeg\" alt=\"campagnolo_chorus_12-speed_\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You also get a healthy serving of carbon fibre goodness across the groupset with the crank arms and rear derailleur body making use of it, while other parts are aluminium or steel. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taken as a whole, Chorus is no heavyweight. With an eye on both the gravel and sportive market, it also offers a wide range of ways to spread out its 2×12-speed gearing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These include a sub-compact 48/32 crankset, along with the ability to accommodate a 34t largest cassette sprocket that should mean you never have to resort to walking up a climb. Most of the components are explicitly made for the groupset but the brakes and rotors again carry over from Campagnolo’s higher tiers.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/campagnolo-chorus-12-speed-groupset\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full Campagnolo Chorus review here</a></strong></li><li><strong>Shop Campagnolo Chorus at <a href=\"https://www.wiggle.com/p/campagnolo-chorus-12-speed-groupset\" target=\"_blank\">Wiggle</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Campagnolo Centaur 11-speed</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/02224214/campagnolo-centaur_11-speed-970x648.jpeg\" alt=\"campagnolo-centaur_11-speed\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><strong>At a glance:</strong></strong> Lack of disc-brake options make this competent groupset of relatively niche interest</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>RRP:</strong> £650<br /><strong>Cassette:</strong> 11-speed<br /><strong>Largest sprocket:</strong> 32t<br /><strong>Shifting:</strong> Mechanical<br /><strong>Brakes:</strong> Rim brake only only<br /><strong>Overall Weight:</strong> 2,470g Approx</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Campagnolo’s last hurrah for 11-speed doesn’t now feature on the brand’s website, although it can still be found for sale at retailers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Denuded of carbon fibre and forced to debase itself by looking for work among more proletarian bicycles, Centaur is Campagnolo’s entry-level groupset. It’s available only with rim brakes so you won’t see it on many new bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, as an aftermarket product, it still has much to recommend it. For one, you get a not inconsiderable 11 sprockets on the back and it borrows aesthetically from its much more costly siblings. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/02224216/campagnolocentaur01-970x647.jpeg\" alt=\"campagnolocentaur01\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is most notable in the construction of the Ultra-Torque axle system crankset and the shape and operation of the shift and brake levers. Despite its much-reduced price, you still get a lot of the distinct Campagnolo feel. From the ergonomics and function of the shifters to the reassuring way each gear change registers, it’s all pure Campagnolo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the lack of disc brakes will make it a non-starter for many riders, while the fact you can only fit a 32t largest sprocket means it’s not the most beginner-friendly option out there either.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Shop Campagnolo Centaur at <a href=\"https://www.chainreactioncycles.com/p/campagnolo-centaur-11-speed-groupset\" target=\"_blank\">Chain Reaction Cycles</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Campagnolo Ekar 13-speed</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/02221524/1x_groupsets_ekar-970x965.jpg\" alt=\"1x_groupsets_ekar\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><strong>At a glance:</strong></strong> A fantastic wide-ratio 13-speed mechanical gravel groupset that suggests the shape of things to come</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>RRP:</strong> £1,449<br /><strong>Cassette:</strong> 13-speed<br /><strong>Largest sprocket:</strong> 44t<br /><strong>Shifting:</strong> Mechanical<br /><strong>Brakes:</strong> Hydraulic disc</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So tied up with road racing culture, the forward-thinking Ekar gravel groupset took many by surprise. This 13-speed single-chainring mechanical system has a vast range of clever features. Billed as the world’s lightest gravel groupset, perhaps the biggest headline is its thirteen sequential gears which are linked up to a single chainring. However, it’s not just the number of gears on offer but the range that sets Ekar apart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its ‘gravel race’ cassette option goes from a tiny nine teeth up to a vast 42t, and there are 9-36t and 10-44t options too. Ekar offers a similar range to a typical twin-chainring setup and small jumps between the first few cogs mean shifts made when pedalling at high-speed won’t unsettle riders. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Related: <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-gravel-gearing-how-to-get-lower-gears\" target=\"_blank\">Gravel bike gearing: Everything you need to know</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/09/02224218/ribble_gravel_sl_ekar_1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"ribble_gravel_sl_ekar_1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To accommodate this colossal range, Campagnolo has created a new <a href=\"https://auth.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/10894/campagnolo-n3w-compatible-wheels\" target=\"_blank\">N3W freehub standard</a>. Now, while most people won’t rejoice at the introduction of another standard, this one does at least accomplish something worthwhile, plus it’s retrofittable to some existing wheels. Other parts are also pretty special, like the rear derailleur with a clutch function to retain the chain and the incredibly light but tough carbon crankset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With just one side doing the shifting, the Ekar’s Ergopower lever uses the same downshift (for easier gears) paddle ergonomics as Campagnolo’s road levers and can shift through up to three sprockets at a time. However, the unique thumb lever is stepped to allow you to upshift easily from both the hoods and the drops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ekar’s disc brake calipers are similar feeling to those on other Campagnolo groups but ever so slightly more powerful. Of course, some brands will tell you electric is the future for gravel. However, we’re not so sure, and this groupset is part of the reason why.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Read our <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/campagnolo-ekar-groupset-review\" target=\"_blank\">Campagnolo Ekar review</a></strong></li><li><strong>Shop Campagnolo Ekar at <a href=\"https://www.merlincycles.com/campagnolo-ekar-gravel-groupset-13-speed-1-263852.html\" target=\"_blank\">Merlin Cycles</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>How does each Campagnolo groupset compare with its immediate neighbour?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Not sure whether to damage your bank balance or go conservative when choosing your next groupset? To help you decide, we’ve listed the main differences between each groupset and its nearest neighbour in the Campagnolo hierarchy. Here’s how they match up.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Campagnolo Super Record Wireless vs. Super Record</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want wireless electronic shifting and the flexibility that goes with it, you’ve only got one choice from Campagnolo. You’re also getting the wider gear spread from smaller cassettes and chainrings that goes with this. If you don’t like using your thumbs when riding, this is the one for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If, on the other hand, you’re a traditionalist, who thinks that a shifter without a thumb lever is sacrilege, Super Record mechanical is for you. Ditto if you like rim brakes. At least you’re saving some weight and a bit of cash. About £1,600.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Campagnolo Super Record mechanical vs. Record</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As we shift down from the mechanical Super Record to the similarly mechanical Record groupset, not a lot changes. Visually and mechanically very similar, a few bits of titanium and carbon fibre are replaced. This sees components like the axle on the crankset switched to steel, while some carbon parts in the derailleur become aluminium.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the cumulative effect is to add less than 200 grams to the groupset’s overall weight. Considering that Super Record is about £800 more expensive, that’s a lot of quids per gram. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You also lose out on the Cult ceramic bearings found in the more expensive groupset’s bottom bracket, a change you’ll <em>never</em> notice in actual riding. The shape of the levers changes slightly too, although with Record using Campagnolo’s Vari-Cushion technology, this might not be a downgrade, depending on your tastes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Campagnolo Record vs. Chorus</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Price fluctuations seem to have brought Chorus closer to Record in terms of cost. Still, even if the jump up another level is now smaller, there’s a lot to recommend the more recently released Chorus groupset. For one thing, you get the same 12 speeds. It also shares the same excellent disc brakes as the rest of Campagnolo’s higher tiers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chorus is certainly more of an everyman groupset than any of the Record ranges, and you also get additional gearing options like the useful sub-compact 48/32 crankset. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The operation of the groupset is still very much the same, and you still get flashy carbon cranks. Of course, there are some trade-offs, but overall weight is less than two hundred grams more than its posher sibling. All this makes Chorus arguably the best value Campagnolo groupset.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Campagnolo Chorus vs. Centaur</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of the prominent Campagnolo designs trickle their way down the brand’s cheapest groupset. This means you’ll get a two-piece Ultra-Torque crankset and the familiar shifter design. However, more flashy features are absent and of course Centaur is 11-speed while Chorus is 12-speed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Centaur also lacks a disc brake option which will make it a non-viable option for many riders. If rim brakes are what you want, however, it remains an appealing alternative to more mainstream options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Looking for more groupset gossip?
