Here are Apple's past WWDC announcement dates:\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n \t<li>2023 - Wednesday, March 29</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>2022 - Tuesday, April 5</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>2021 - Tuesday, March 30</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>2020 - Friday, March 13</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>2019 - Thursday, March 14</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>2018 - Tuesday, March 13</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>2017 - Thursday, February 16</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>2016 - Monday, April 18</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>2015 - Tuesday, April 14</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>2014 - Thursday, April 3</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\nGiven these dates, we could see a WWDC announcement from Apple anytime from Tuesday, March 26 to Friday, March 29, though Apple might also hold the announcement until the next week, unveiling dates on Tuesday, April 2.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>WWDC Date Possibilities</h2>\r<br />\nFor the last several years, Apple held WWDC during the first week of June, and that's also the most likely target date this year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nJune 3 to June 7 would make the most sense based on past WWDC events, though June 10 to June 14 is also possible. Past WWDC dates:\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n \t<li>2023 - June 5 to June 9</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>2022 - June 6 to June 10</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>2021 - June 7 to June 11</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>2020 - June 22 to June 26</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>2019 - June 3 to June 7</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>2018 - June 4 to June 8</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>2017 - June 5 to June 9</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>2016 - June 12 to June 17</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>2015 - June 8 to June 12</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>2014 - June 2 to June 6</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\n<h2>WWDC Software Announcements</h2>\r<br />\nApple will unveil <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, iPadOS 18, macOS 15, watchOS 11, tvOS 18, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a> Software 18, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/\">visionOS</a> 2 at WWDC this year, and the updates will be provided to developers directly after the keynote event.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBetas will be limited to developers for the first month or so, but if Apple follows tradition, the software will be made available through public betas in July 2024.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌iOS 18‌ is the only update that we've heard much about, and Apple is said to be focusing heavily on artificial intelligence this year. There will be new AI additions across the OS, and <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> believes it could be one of the biggest updates we've seen to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> in years.
