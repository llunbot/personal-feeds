{"title":"iOS 17.2 Beta 2 Enables Capturing Spatial Video on iPhones 15 Pro","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/ios-17-2-spatial-video-recording/","date":1699559293000,"content":"\n<p>Juli Clover, MacRumors:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The second beta of iOS 17.2 adds a new feature that allows an iPhone 15 Pro or ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max to record Spatial Video that can be viewed in the Photos app on Apple’s forthcoming Apple Vision Pro headset.</p>\n\n<p>Spatial Video recording can be enabled by going to the Settings app, tapping into the Camera section, selecting Formats, and toggling on “Spatial Video for ‌Apple Vision Pro‌.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s off by default, but I think will be <em>on</em> by default in the future, if you have a Vision headset associated with your iCloud account. When enabled, you get an extra button in the viewfinder area of the Camera app when you’re in Video mode, similar to the Macro toggle or the toggle for Action mode. Very simple. Spatial videos captured on an iPhone are always and only 1080p / 30fps. And when you view them on a normal screen — i.e. any device other than a Vision headset — they just look like regular 1080p videos.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/11/09/ios-17-2-beta-2-spatial-video\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"4cb8e96773b095e86e749e9241e508f9423081bf6616658b515f6dc7d8deccb9","category":"Tech"}
