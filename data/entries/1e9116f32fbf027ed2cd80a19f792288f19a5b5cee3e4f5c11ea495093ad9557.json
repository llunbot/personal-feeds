The Ultra Wide camera's upgrade to a 48-megapixel sensor should allow it to capture more light, resulting in enhanced photos when shooting in 0.5× mode, especially in low-light environments.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a> Pro, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a> models already have a 48-megapixel Main camera that uses \"pixel binning\" to merge data from four pixels on the sensor into one \"super pixel\" for improved low-light capture. With the ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ models, this technology is expected to expand to the Ultra Wide lens, which is currently a 12-megapixel lens.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis also means that ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ models should be able to shoot <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/iphone-14-pro-take-48-megapixel-proraw-photos/\">48-megapixel ProRAW photos</a> in Ultra Wide mode. These photos retain more detail in the image file for more editing flexibility, and can be printed at large sizes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Weibo rumor corroborates a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/15/iphone-16-pro-wifi-7-48mp-ultra-wide-rumors/\">forecast</a> from Haitong International Securities analyst Jeff Pu, which said that the ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ will feature a 48-megapixel Ultra Wide camera and support for Wi-Fi 7. In 2025, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> 17 Pro is expected to complete the rear camera array's transition to 48-megapixel sensors, bringing the technology <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/15/iphone-17-pro-max-48mp-telephoto-lens-rumor/\">to the Telephoto lens</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nInstant Digital has a mixed track record in terms of revealing accurate information about Apple's plans.
