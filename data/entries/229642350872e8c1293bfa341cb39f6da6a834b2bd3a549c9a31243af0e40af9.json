There is a little too much darkness in this world and not enough light, a little too much pseudoscience and not enough science. We'll let other publications offer you a daily horoscope. At Ars Technica, we're going to take a different route, finding inspiration from very real images of a universe that is filled with stars and wonder.</em></p>\n    \n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Good morning. It's November 17, and today's photo takes us into the Cassiopeia constellation, where we find the Heart Nebula 7,500 light-years away.</p>\n<p>This is a fairly bright nebula, discovered nearly 240 years ago by astronomer William Herschel. Because of its brilliant colors, the Heart Nebula is an attractive target for amateur astronomers.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984625#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984625&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"229642350872e8c1293bfa341cb39f6da6a834b2bd3a549c9a31243af0e40af9","category":"Tech"}
