The numbers of gears, or ‘speeds’ on the cassette, they offer overlaps and differs. Shimano GRX has options for 10-speed, 11-speed and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/shimano-grx-r820/\">12-speed setups</a>, SRAM XPLR uses a 12-speed cassette, while Campagnolo Ekar pushes on further to 13 sprockets.</p>\n<p>Besides gearing, these gravel bike groupsets have been designed to contend with the increased braking demands of gravel riding. Shimano’s GRX brakes take Servo Wave tech from the company’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/mountain-bike-groupsets-everything-you-need-to-know/\">mountain bike groupsets</a> to increase braking power and modulation for steeper, more technical descents.</p>\n<p>As with road and MTB drivetrains, you can choose between mechanical or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/electronic-groupsets/\">electronic groupsets</a> with Shimano and SRAM options.

SRAM and Shimano both offer single-ring options, while Campagnolo Ekar is single-ring only.</span></p>\n<p><span>With a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/1x-drivetrains/\">1x groupset</a> (pronounced ‘one-by’, as a single-chainring setup is known), you save a little weight by dispensing with the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/front-derailleur/\">front derailleur</a>, plus there’s less to go wrong and less chance of mud build-up. They are also designed to keep the chain in place and running smoothly when you’re riding over bumpy ground.</span></p>\n<p><span>On the minus side, there are sometimes fewer gear options covering roughly the same gear range, so jumps between gears are larger.</span></p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"SRAM Force 43/30t cranks\" title=\"SRAM Force eTAP wide AXS crankset\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> SRAM Force eTap AXS WIDE gearing is designed for gravel riding.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>Gravel riders who spend a fair amount of time on the road, or covering ground quickly, might find the extra top-end range of a double crankset useful. </span></p>\n<p><span>Plus, the additional weight of a larger cassette often negates the weight savings from losing the front derailleur.</span></p>\n<p><span>That said, once you take account of overlaps in ratios between the large and small chainrings in a two-ring setup, and unusable combinations at the high and low ends of the cassette, the number of unique gears isn’t that different.</span></p>\n<p><span>Campagnolo has also sought to address this by moving to 13 speeds with Ekar, allowing for a wide-ranging cassette with smaller gaps between sprockets.</span></p>\n<p><span>A single-ring setup means you can access all gears sequentially too, rather than needing to swap chainrings to access your higher or lower ranges; no more <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/cross-chaining/\">cross-chaining</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span>Because the chain doesn’t have to jump between rings, single-ring cranksets have deeper teeth on the chainring to help keep the chain in place. Single chainrings usually have alternating wide and narrow teeth to match the different widths of the chain links, again to improve chain retention over uneven surfaces.</span></p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Ribble CGR Ti Enthusiast road bike\" title=\"Ribble CGR Ti Enthusiast - 19\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> If you’re likely to ride your gravel bike on the road as much as you are off-road, you might appreciate a 2x drivetrain.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>Ultimately, deciding between a single-ring and a double-ring setup depends on the riding you’re planning, and your preferred groupset brand.</span></p>\n<p><span>If you’re wanting to ride mainly fast on the road and on smoother terrain, a double-ring crankset could give you a few more high-end ratios and smaller jumps between gears. </span></p>\n<p><span>If you’re looking to tackle harder terrain, you may appreciate the chain retention benefits and simplicity of a single ring.</span></p>\n\n<h3>Mullet gearing</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"SRAM mullet 1x drivetrain on the Niner RLT 9 RDO gravel bike\" title=\"SRAM mullet 1x drivetrain on the Niner RLT 9 RDO gravel bike\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> SRAM enables you to mix and match its road and mountain bike components, meaning you can use a super-wide cassette on your gravel bike, as pictured here.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Josh Patterson</i></span></div>\n<p>SRAM allows you to mix and match its road and mountain bike components, meaning you can use a super-wide cassette on your gravel bike, as pictured here. <span>Want even lower gears?

Both MTB derailleurs can handle an 11-42t cassette in double-chainring configuration, or 11-46t with a single chainring.</span></p>\n<p><span>It’s an option also promoted by SRAM with its AXS 12-speed wireless electronic components.

The recessed cleats and lugged soles of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bike-shoes/\">gravel bike shoes</a> make walking with the bike a lot easier than three-bolt <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-cycling-shoes/\">cycling shoes</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/shimano-spd-vs-spd-sl/\">SPD pedals</a> often have minimalist skeleton designs. This helps with mud shedding, but results in a small contact area between your pedals and your shoes. Depending on how stiff your shoes are, this can sometimes be felt through the sole and may reduce pedalling efficiency.</p>\n<p>So, a pedal with a platform can also be a good option because it adds to the contact area between the pedal and the foot.

Hookless rims have been popular in mountain biking for some time, and are gaining prominence on the road and in the gravel scene too.</span></p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Zipp 101 wheelset for gravel bikes\" title=\"Zipp 101 wheelset - 01\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Gravel-specific wheels are typically available in 650b and 700c sizes and have a wide internal rim width well suited to plump tyres.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>Alongside 700c wheels, they offer compatibility to fit <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/what-is-650b/\">650b</a> wheelsets. The smaller wheel size – equivalent to 27.5in </span><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-wheels/\"><span>mountain bike wheels</span></a><span> – enables you to fit even wider tyres in your frame, with greater volume.</span></p>\n<p><span>That can add comfort to the ride, as well as increasing grip on off-road terrain and enabling you to run even lower tyre pressures. With a large tyre, the rolling circumference of a 650b wheel is similar to a 700c with a narrow tyre, so gearing and handling should end up similar.</span></p>\n<p><span>Rather like the single/double crankset choice above, the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/650b-vs-700c-for-gravel/\">700c vs 650b wheels</a> debate for gravel depends on your objectives and what you want from your bike.</span></p>\n<p><span>Historically, for a faster ride on the road, and on light gravel, 700c wheels with narrower tyres of around 40mm or less would have been the go-to option, with 650b wheels and wider tyres preferred for more difficult, off-road terrain thanks to the ability to run plumper rubber.</span></p>\n<p>However, many of the latest gravel bikes offer increasingly generous clearance, even with 700c wheels, so switching to the smaller 650b wheel size may not be necessary if you do want to size up when it comes to tyres.</p>\n<h2>Tyre choice</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Lauf Seigla gravel bike being ridden along track by Liam Cahill.\" title=\"BR 140 Lauf Gravel Tyre Test Joe Norledge 02.00_05_11_15.Still009\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The right tyre choice for your bike will depend significantly on the terrain and conditions you typically encounter.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Joe Norledge / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Once you’ve decided on 700c or 650b wheels, it’s time to think about tyre choice.</p>\n<p><span>Fitting the </span><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-tyres/\"><span>best gravel tyres</span></a><span> for the riding you’re doing is another key decision for your gravel bike setup.</span></p>\n<p><span>In fact, changing the tyres on a gravel bike from the stock build can unleash the true potential of your machine, either significantly improving its ability off-road or adding a turn of road speed.</span></p>\n<p><span>With gravel bikes used across such a wide range of terrain, it’s one area where you can easily change how your bike performs. We’d recommend <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/tubeless/\">tubeless tyres</a> for gravel riding.</span></p>\n<h3>Gravel tyre width</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Vittoria Terreno Dry tyres on Ridley Kanzo Adventure Rival XPLR - 05\" title=\"Ridley Kanzo Adventure Rival XPLR - 05\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> More gravel tyres now nudge the 50mm-width mark.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russel Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>Having selected your wheels, tyre choice will largely be determined by tread pattern and width. </span></p>\n<p><span>If off-road grip and stability are important, look for wider tyres with a more aggressive tread pattern; if you’re more likely to be riding on the road or dry, hardpack gravel, a narrower, slicker tyre will likely be more suitable.</span></p>\n<p><span>Typical widths for 700c gravel tyres are 35mm, 40mm, 42mm and 45mm. But really <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/tech/wide-gravel-tyres/\">wide gravel tyres</a> are increasingly popular and bike brands are broadening frame clearances to fit them. For example,</span><span> our 2023 Gravel <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/bike-of-the-year/\">Bike of the Year</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/gravel-bikes/giant-revolt-x-advanced-pro-1-review/\">Giant Revolt X Advanced Pro 1</a>, has room for 53c tyres. </span></p>\n<p><span>How wide you go will depend largely on the terrain you ride and your frameset’s clearance. If you live somewhere with a wet climate, it’s a good idea to leave some room for mud too. Fitting <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bike-mudguards/\">gravel bike mudguards</a> will also crimp clearance. </span></p>\n\n<h3>Gravel tyre tread pattern</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Orbea Terra M21e Team 1X gravel bike\" title=\"Orbea Terra M21e Team 1X - 18\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Gravel riding can take in a wide range of surfaces within the same route.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>How muddy it is will also influence your tyre choice. In dry conditions and on finer gravel surfaces, you can usually get away with a file tread such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/tyres/gravel-bike-tyres/panaracer-gravelking-sk-tlc-tyre-review/\">Panaracer GravelKing SK</a> or a semi-slick design, with a smooth centre, such as the </span><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/tyres/gravel-bike-tyres/wtb-byway-sg2-tyre-review/\"><span>WTB Byway</span></a><span>.</span></p>\n<p><span>The low-profile tread makes for fast rolling on tarmac, while there’s still enough grip from the side lugs to keep you upright and moving on looser surfaces.</span></p>\n<p><span>If it’s wet or muddy, you’ll need something with more grip from a knobbly tread pattern. Schwalbe’s G-One range goes from the small knobs of the G-One Speed through to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/schwalbe-g-one-ultrabite-gravel-tyre/\">G-One Ultrabite</a>, while Continental offers the Terra Speed and Terra Trail for varying conditions.</span></p>\n<p><span>There’s a whole range of gravel tyres from many manufacturers, designed for different terrain.</span></p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Teravail Rutland Light &amp; Supple 700 x 42 gravel tyre\" title=\"Teravail Rutland 4\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Opt for a widely spaced tread in winter sludge.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Katherine Moore / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>In wet or muddy conditions, large widely spaced knobs, as seen on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/cyclocross-tyres/\">cyclocross tyres</a>, can improve grip and also help to shed mud. A tighter-packed tread won’t work as well in wet conditions, but will usually roll faster on tarmac or more hard-packed gravel surfaces.</span></p>\n<p><span>If you’re running 650b tyres, again there’s a range of gravel options, with different tread patterns available.</span></p>\n<p><span>650b gravel tyres are typically (but not always) focused on high-volume options, so you’re more likely to find tyres with more aggressive tread patterns and in large sizes. These tend to start out at 40mm and head up to 50mm wide or more.</span></p>\n<p><span>27.5in </span><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-tyres/\"><span>mountain bike tyres</span></a><span> are also an option and may offer a deeper tread for more grip. Confusingly, </span><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/whats-the-fastest-tyre-size-for-mountain-biking/\"><span>MTB tyre size</span></a><span> is often designated in inches rather than millimetres. You’ll want to check you’ve got clearance in your frame for some of the wider options.</span></p>\n<h2>Tyre pressure</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Topeak SmartGauge D2X tyre pressure gauge\" title=\"Topeak SmartGauge D2X tyre pressure gauge\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tyre pressure is particularly important on a gravel bike. Luckily, with a wide range of tyres – including tubeless options – there’s plenty of room for experimentation.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Katherine Moore / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>Along with tread pattern and width, tyre pressure is a big determinant of how your gravel bike will handle.</span></p>\n<p><span>The large air volume of wider tyres means you can drop your pressure, giving you better traction, potentially lower rolling resistance and a more comfortable ride.</span></p>\n<p><span>Giving a rough starting point for tyre pressure is a tricky business because it’s so dependent on riding style, rider weight and terrain. However, as a guide, we would recommend around 40psi for a 40mm-wide 700c tyre, though you can usually drop below this. </span></p>\n<p><span>With a wide 650b tyre – something in the 45mm+ range – 35psi is a good starting point. Check out an online tyre pressure calculator like </span><a href=\"https://axs.sram.com/guides/tire/pressure\" target=\"_blank\"><span>this one from SRAM</span></a><span> for a more precise guide, which takes many more factors into account.</span></p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Basso Palta Disc Ekar gravel bike\" title=\"Basso Palta Disc Ekar - 10\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The right tyre pressure for your gravel bike will depend on a number of factors, including tyre width, rider weight and terrain.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>It’s worth experimenting with tyre pressure to see what works for your tyre choice and where you ride. Too high and you’ll get bounced around and lose grip, while too low a pressure may result in sloppy handling and extra pedalling effort, as the tyre squirms on the rim.</span></p>\n<p><span>Tyre pressure that’s too low may also result in you bottoming out on the rim, if you’re riding on uneven surfaces. If you’re using </span><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-inner-tubes/\"><span>inner tubes</span></a><span> that might result in a pinch flat, but with a tubeless tyre it’s less of a problem – though it’s still possible to pinch flat a tyre. </span></p>\n<p><span>Experiment, take notes and think about investing in a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-tyre-pressure-gauges/\">digital tyre pressure gauge</a>. This will make future fiddling far easier, more accurate and, critically, repeatable.</span></p>\n<p>Tyre inserts are another option to up your protection and there are a few designed specifically for gravel riding, such as the Vittoria Air Liner Gravel. They enable you to run lower tyre pressures with less risk of bottoming out, tyre squirm or burping, where the tyre becomes disconnected from the rim and loses air.</p>\n<h2>Finishing kit</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Katherine Moore riding the Cotic Cascade gravel bike\" title=\"Katherine Moore riding the Cotic Cascade gravel bike\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Flared handlebars can offer more control off-road.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Richard Baybutt</i></span></div>\n<p><span>Some bikes come with flared <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/gravel-bike-handlebars/\">gravel handlebars</a>, which are wider in the drops than at the tops. That means you’ve got a bit more control when descending off-road, thanks to the wider position. </span></p>\n<p><span>You also get a little more real estate between the levers for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bikepacking-bags/\">bikepacking bags</a> on the front. Some flared bars cause the brake levers to sit at an angle, though; the ergonomics can feel a bit awkward with a very wide flare.</span></p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Giant Contact stem on the Giant Revolt Advanced Pro 0 gravel bike\" title=\"Giant Revolt Advanced Pro 0 - 11\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Some gravel bikes are following mountain bikes with a move towards shorter stems.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>Another gravel bike development borrowed from mountain bikes is the trend towards running a shorter <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-stems/\">stem</a>. </span></p>\n<p><span>Whereas a road bike might have a 100mm stem or longer, on a gravel bike this might drop to 70 or 80mm. That again helps with steering on awkward trails, as well as reducing the effective reach to the bars.</span></p>\n<p><span>You’ll want a comfortable saddle too. The way <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/how-to-choose-the-best-saddle/\">to choose the best saddle for you</a> is entirely personal, though you should be mindful that what works for you on your road bike or mountain bike might not also work on a gravel bike, due to the altered body positioning.</span></p>\n<h2>Gravel bike dropper seatposts</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Ergon SR Pro Men saddle sitting on a RockShox Reverb AXS XPLR dropper post on the Rå Valravn S gravel bike\" title=\"Rå Valravn S long-term - Dropper post\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Dropper posts are an option for gravel bikes if you take in more extreme off-road riding.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>A growing number of bikes are specced with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-dropper-posts/\">gravel dropper posts</a>, albeit the number is still limited.</p>\n<p>Some frames, however, will have ports to enable you to route the cable for an aftermarket dropper post internally, if you choose to upgrade.</p>\n<p>A dropper post enables you to lower your saddle quickly, enabling you to shift your weight over the bike more effectively without having the saddle in the way on tricky descents.</p>\n<p>However, it will add weight and complexity to your build, so is best saved for gravel bikes intended for use on properly technical terrain.
