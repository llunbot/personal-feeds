Foolishly, when he tells me the distance, I scoff, ‘Where’s the rest of it?’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Erman’s response is to guide my gaze towards the total elevation of the ride. It’s an improbably large number on his screen, and at first my brain fails to comprehend it. How can you get that much elevation into such a short distance? But once I realise that it isn’t a mistake, I feel a strange tension grip my insides.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-03-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Babadag\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-03-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-03-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-03-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-03-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-03-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-03-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-03.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Scorched tarmac makes for even more treacherous conditions beneath the wheels.</figcaption><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>To calm myself, I indicate to Erman that I’m sure it will all be fine with him leading the way, and he responds that has no intention of doing the ride himself. Instead, he has delegated responsibility for accompanying me to a local guide, Tarek, who looks too tall to be much of a climber, and is as aerodynamic as a shed, yet defies the laws of physics when the gradients bite.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I soon find out, Tarek climbs like a goat and descends like a bird of prey. What he can do on the flat I have no idea, because there’s barely a metre of it on the whole route. In order to cram more than 3,500 vertical metres into 84 horizontal kilometres, we have to be heading uphill as soon as we’ve clipped in.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-04-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Babadag\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-04-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-04-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-04-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-04-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-04-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-04-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-04.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Finally we hit some open road on the long, fast descent towards Fethiye.</figcaption><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>From our start point in the beach town of Kargi, we launch straight onto the first climb of the day, Süleyman Demirel. On paper it looks benign enough at just 1,000m and 9.4% average gradient, but somehow it packs in three separate mini-descents, which means that when the road rises, it really rises. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final bit sees the gradient tip up to 30%, and I struggle to keep my front wheel on the road and my bike in motion. My bike computer bleeps to communicate its doubts that I actually am.</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up, after a short downhill run, is a more ‘normal’ climb called Çenger, which carries us away from the coast and deep into the hills. This one measures 14km at an average 7% gradient, with just shy of 1,000m of vertical ascent. It’s a slog and, to add to the fun, the road is gritty and poorly surfaced, but I try to supress my inner whinger and ask myself, ‘What would Maurice Garin do?’ (<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-history-1904-henri-cornet\" target=\"_blank\">History suggests</a> that the winner of the first two Tours de France might have thumbed a lift.)</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-05-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Babadag\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-05-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-05-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-05-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-05-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-05-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-05-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-05.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>The ancient Lycian Tomb of Amyntas, set into the Fethiye hillside.</figcaption><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Despite the grind, I’m enjoying the sense of discovering a climb that few cyclists will know about and fewer still will have done. There’s no motorised traffic, let alone other bike riders, and the route feels practically prehistoric – at least until we turn a corner to find a field of solar panels filling the space between high-lying rock forms. It’s not expansive, but enough to boil a few thousand kettles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An hour and a half since we said goodbye to the sea, the elevation ticks past 1,000m. The gradient is all over the place and I’m changing gear with more frequency than an Instagram influencer. After several false summits, we finally tip over the peak and begin the long descent back towards the coast.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-06-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Babadag\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-06-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-06-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-06-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-06-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-06-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-06-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-06-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-06.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Negotiating the narrow lanes through İncirköy.</figcaption><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>I try to hold Tarek’s wheel on the way down, but my nerve on these unreliable surfaces fails me and soon I’m watching him disappear into the distance. We pass through İncirköy, weaving around the town’s impressive collection of feral cats, and then join a long road with nary a winding turn, which takes us down to the coastal town of Fethiye and a well-earned lunch overlooking the sea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Mediterranean is calm, but the storm is coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The stage from hell</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-07-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Babadag\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-07-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-07-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-07-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-07-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-07-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-07-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-07-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-07.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Cycle lanes make navigating the port town of Fethiye straighforward.</figcaption><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Most years, the Presidential Tour of Turkey is a gift for the sprinters. The week-long race usually links together a succession of flat stages so the big men can battle it out in the final few hundred metres, day after day. But not this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, the first couple of stages were the usual fare, both won by Alpecin-Deceuninck’s Jasper Philipsen, but Stage 3 was something altogether different. Starting in Fethiye, the stage was a mere 104km long, but it would prove to be among the most brutal days that many in the pro peloton had ever experienced. Its finish was at the top of Babadağ after a climb of 18km at 10.3% average gradient, with spikes of 20% and a summit at almost 2,000m.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-09-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Babadag\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-09-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-09-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-09-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-09-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-09-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-09-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-09-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-09.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Babadağ begins to bite, and even Tarek in front feels the grind.</figcaption><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Once on the climb, a group of four crept away from the main pack. This included two riders from Astana, Alexey Lutsenko and Harold Tejada, and two from Bora-Hansgrohe, Florian Lipowitz and Ben Zwiehoff. It would be wrong to suggest they raced up Babadağ; rather they clung on for as long as possible, until one by one they cracked. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lipowitz went first, with 5km to go, followed by Tejada at 1.8km. German rider Zwiehoff clung on bravely, but couldn’t hold Lutsenko’s wheel in the final 500m and the Kazakh rider crawled to victory on a stage that would see vast time differences appear throughout the peloton.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To put it in perspective, Zwiehoff’s effort earned him the Strava KoM on the official Babadağ climb (Lutsenko obviously doesn’t upload his data), with a time of 53min 25sec for the 13.78km segment. That’s an average speed of just 15.5kmh. Compare that to the average speeds of the Ventoux KoM (20.5kmh), the Alpe d’Huez KoM (20kmh) and even the Angliru KoM (18.4kmh), and you get an idea of how tough Babadağ is.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-10-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Babadag\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-10-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-10-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-10-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-10-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-10-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-10-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-10-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-10.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>A moment of relative early ease towards the top of the Çenger climb, 14km at an average of 7% on rough roads.</figcaption><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Another way to measure it is using the ASO method for assessing climbs, by multiplying the distance of the climb by the average gradient squared. A score above 600 makes the climb <em>hors categorie</em>, with the likes of Alpe d’Huez scoring 890, Ventoux 1,233 and the Stelvio 1,392. Babadağ comes in at 1,920.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Into the jaws of the beast</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The main road that leads out of Fethiye is teeming with tourist traffic and takes us past the striking Tomb of Amyntas, a rock-hewn burial chamber with huge columns that dates back to the 4th century BC.

Fortunately, higher up the surface changes to a form of paving whereby interlocking bricks are held in place by concrete sidewalls. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apparently, this allows for a certain amount of movement, preventing the surface from cracking as it heats and cools in Turkey’s high mountain air. Also, it seems they simply couldn’t lay tarmac – the road is so steep that it would just slide down the hill before it had a chance to dry and harden.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can feel the gaps between the bricks beneath my tyres, but at least the road surface is now uniform. Minibuses rumble past us on their way to the summit, and when I look out across the vast space towards the sea, I realise who their passengers must be. From around the mountain’s edge a paraglider floats into view, then another and another. They pitch left, then right, zigzagging on the thermals as they make their way silently down towards the shore.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-13-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Babadag\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-13-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-13-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-13-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-13-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-13-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-13-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-13-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-13.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>The road is steeper than it looks through Babadağ’s pine-lined lower slopes, where the sightlines are longer than you’d like.</figcaption><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>At the steepest, most exposed stretch of ascent, I stop noticing the view. Now the only sight is the top of my stem as I focus purely on turning the pedals. If I want to get to the top, I need to stay in motion. It’s a slow, painful progression, but I’m actually beginning to enjoy myself. The rhythm I’m tapping out wouldn’t be a floor-filler, but you could at least shuffle your feet to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With what I estimate to be only about a third of the climb remaining, I round the next bend to see Tarek up ahead. I had imagined him to already be relaxing with a coffee at the top. It seems that despite being built like a statue, his back is suffering under the toll of the climb. We decide to continue, but at an even gentler pace than previously, and with an agreement to abandon if Tarek’s back decides we’ve gone far enough.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-14-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Babadag\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-14-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-14-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-14-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-14-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-14-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-14-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-14-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-14.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Babadağ’s partial cast brick surface makes for an unusual but consistent surface.</figcaption><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>As it turns out, Nature makes the decision for us.

Anywhere.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the Presidential Tour of Turkey visited, the Babadağ Strava segment had only 162 completed attempts, and while he held the KoM, Mannion knew what it would mean to send a pro peloton onto its slopes. ‘I thought if you took a bike race up it, it would be one of the hardest climbs in the world.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How we did it</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-08-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Babadag\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-08-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-08-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-08-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-08-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-08-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-08-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-08-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/big-ride-babadag-08.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>The natural harbour overlooking the calm Turquoise Coast.</figcaption><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h3>Travel</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The nearest airport in Turkey is Dalaman on the southwest coast, which is served direct by a number of airlines from airports around the UK. From Dalaman it’s around a 45-minute drive to Kargi, where the ride starts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Accommodation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Cyclist</em> stayed at the Hilton Dalaman, 20 minutes’ drive from the airport. It’s an enormous, all-inclusive resort hotel right on the beach, and has no fewer than ten outdoor swimming pools, nine restaurants and bars, and 18 treatment rooms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intimate it ain’t, but it’s very comfortable and you won’t get bored. Expect to pay upwards of £250 a night. See <a href=\"https://www.hilton.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\">hilton.com</a> for details.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Thanks </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to my ride partner Tarek for guiding us so expertly on the route. Also, thanks to <em>Cyclist Turkey</em>’s editor, Erman Öner, for driving the support van and for putting up with our endless questions.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/babadag-turkey-cycling\">The giant killer: Turkey Big Ride</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"2f4a8df4b3c3a08fc7f7e7e2da4053729f60515f78b2a4d806ab0eec7e5d5a55","category":"Cycling"}
