But how do all those launches affect residents living along the Central Coast? People might marvel at the spectacular visual display, but as launch activity at the base has ramped up, so have <a href=\"https://www.edhat.com/news/central-coast-residents-address-concerns-over-spacex-sonic-booms/#:~:text=During%20the%20meetings%2C%20community%20members,on%20air%20and%20water%20quality.\">the noise complaints</a>, particularly about the sonic booms produced by Falcon 9 launches, which can reach as far south as Ventura County. The booms rattle windows, frighten pets, and have raised concerns about threats to the structural integrity of private homes.</p>\n<p>There have been rockets launching from Vandenberg for decades, so why are the Falcon 9 launches of such concern? \"Because of the Starlink satellites, the orbital mechanics for where they're trying to place these in orbit is bringing [the trajectories] closer to the coast,\" said Brigham Young University's <a href=\"https://physics.byu.edu/department/directory/gee\">Kent Gee</a>, who described his research into sonic boom effects on neighboring communities in <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1084385\">a press briefing</a> at <a href=\"https://acousticalsociety.org/new-orleans-2025/\">a meeting</a> of the Acoustical Society of America in New Orleans. And the launches are occurring much more frequently, from two to three launches per year in the 1980s to between five and seven launches each month today. There were 46 Falcon 9 launches out of the Vandenberg base in 2024 alone, per Gee.</p>\n<p>Gee joined a project called ECOBOOM (Environmental and Community Observation of Sonic Booms) to study the factors that can impact just how jarring those sonic booms might be, conducted jointly by BYU and California State University, Bakersfield, with cooperation from the Space Force. \"Space Force is interested in this because they feel a sense of stewardship,\" said Gee. \"These rockets from SpaceX and other providers are launched from the base for a variety of missions and they want to understand the effects both on and off base, trying to understand how they can complete the mission while minimizing [negative] impacts.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/falcon-9-sonic-booms-can-feel-more-like-seismic-waves/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/falcon-9-sonic-booms-can-feel-more-like-seismic-waves/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9503931bdcbbd01c113d3197e45b1ff210b6dee3c7d08d21e566723b2f59b6b6","category":"Tech"}
