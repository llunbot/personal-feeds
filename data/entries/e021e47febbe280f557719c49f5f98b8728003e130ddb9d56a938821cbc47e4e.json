More recently they also claimed that the upcoming iPhone 15 Pro models will use a new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/29/iphone-15-pro-low-energy-microprocessor/\">ultra-low energy chip</a> allowing the new volume, power, and \"Action\" solid-state buttons to remain functional when the handset is powered off or out of battery, and that iOS 17 will include a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/31/iphone-15-pro-solid-state-button-sensitivity/\">new sensitivity setting for said buttons</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis source is said to have a \"man inside\" Apple's development team who occasionally reveals hardware details about upcoming iPhone models if the physical features require software development to complement them. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf their latest claim is accurate, it would not be the first time that Apple has maintained the same list of compatible devices between major iOS releases. For example, iOS 15 is compatible with all devices that can run iOS 14, although some iOS 15 features are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/20/ios-15-features-not-on-iphone-x-or-older/\">not available on older iPhones</a>. In contrast, iOS 16 dropped support for some older devices, including the iPhone SE, the iPhone 6s, the ‌iPhone‌ 6s Plus, the iPod touch, and the ‌iPhone‌ 7 and ‌iPhone‌ 7 Plus.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is also worth noting that yesterday's rumor was not the first time it has been suggested that iOS 17 could drop support for the iPhone X and iPhone 8/8 Plus. The argument does make logical sense because these models are now five years old – an elapsed timeframe previously used by Apple to drop software support for some earlier devices. They are also the only iPhones powered by the A11 chip, which is vulnerable to a <a href=\"https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Checkm8_Exploit\">bootrom jailbreaking exploit</a> that Apple is unable to patch. However, whether Tuesday's rumor was the result of pure extrapolation along these lines remains unknown.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUnless the latest rumor by our anonymous forum tipster is corroborated by another source within the next two months, we will simply have to wait until June 5 to learn if it is true, as this is the date that Apple is expected to announce iOS 17 at WWDC.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/05/ios-17-to-support-iphone-x-8-plus-claims-leaker/\">iOS 17 Will Support iPhone X and iPhone 8/8 Plus, Counterclaims Reputable Leaker</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-will-support-iphone-x-and-iphone-8-8-plus-counterclaims-reputable-leaker.2385946/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e021e47febbe280f557719c49f5f98b8728003e130ddb9d56a938821cbc47e4e","category":"Apple"}
