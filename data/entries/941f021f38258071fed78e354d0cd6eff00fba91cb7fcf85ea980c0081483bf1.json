Starting January 29, Prime Video movies \nand TV shows will include limited advertisements. This will allow \nus to continue investing in compelling content and keep \nincreasing that investment over a long period of time. We aim to \nhave meaningfully fewer ads than linear TV and other streaming TV \nproviders. No action is required from you, and there is no change \nto the current price of your Prime membership. We will also offer \na new ad-free option for an additional $2.99 per month that you \ncan sign up for <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/f.html?C=3GZAQQLXKOKMF&amp;K=Y24IQO9KPJ3&amp;M=urn:rtn:msg:2023122619450090aecb9292544fbfb9f753feefc0p0na&amp;R=2Z5CC8QD3K1CQ&amp;T=C&amp;U=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fprimevideoadfree%3Fref_%3Dpe_70187950_790552310&amp;H=KQEORPYWG4N7GI3RHI8TX6XQUOSA&amp;ref_=pe_70187950_790552310&amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;ascsubtag=___vg__p_23779636__t_w__d_D\">here</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Prime is a very compelling value. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>“Meaningfully fewer ads” than Netflix, Apple TV+, or Max is not possible, because they have no ads. This is a rinky-dink move that solidifies Prime Video’s status as a second-rate streaming service. Maybe if they hadn’t blown $250 million on <em>Citadel</em> and nearly $500 million on <em>Rings of Power</em> — both of which shows were absolutely terrible — they wouldn’t be in this position.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/12/26/amazon-prime-video-fucking-ads\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"941f021f38258071fed78e354d0cd6eff00fba91cb7fcf85ea980c0081483bf1","category":"Tech"}
