For the Hour Record attempt, she opted to use an Argon 18 Electron Pro.</p>\n<p>Lowden’s bike was kitted out with FFWD Disc-T SL wheels fitted with 23mm Vittoria Pista Speed 2.0 tyres.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Lowden rode an Argon 18 Electron Pro frameset.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matt Alexander</i></span></div>\n<p>Behind much of the bike’s spec is Lowden’s partner Dan Bigham, co-creator of Wattshop, which manufactures parts and components that take an uncompromising approach to saving watts.

The complete handlebar package with aerobars would set you back an impressive £8,500.\n<p>Elsewhere on the bike, there is an SRM crankset fitted with a Pyramid Cycle Design chainring, which from the creases on its surface appears to be made from carbon fibre. While Pyramid Cycle Design normally make custom alloy chainrings, many riders are now opting for low-friction carbon fibre rings, as Lowden seems to have done.</p>\n<p>Lowden ran paired the 64 tooth chainring with a 15 tooth cog at the rear. This is a truly massive gear but helped Lowden keep a lower cadence than would be desired for other <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/track-cycling-explained/\" target=\"_blank\">track cycling events</a> as this is said to help keep your heart rate lower.</p>\n<p>Lowden ran an Izumi KAI chain, which during coverage of the attempt, was said to be one of the fastest chains Wattshop has tested.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Lowden bettered Bussi’s record by over 300m.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matt Alexander/PA Wire</i></span></div>\n<p>The record attempt also doubled as an opportunity for sponsor Le Col to show off its Le Col x McLaren Project Aero Skinsuit. This has dimpled fabric across the shoulder blades and tripping fabric on leading edges. It is said to have been independently tested and approved by McLaren.</p>\n<p>Lowden also wore a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/helmets/road-cycling-helmets/poc-tempor-aero-helmet-in-brief-review/\">POC Tempor</a> aero helmet, which is probably most recognisable from the Denmark track team, who have been wearing it for a number of years.</p>\n<p>Lowden has said she unofficially broke Bussi’s record in training earlier this year covering 48.160km in Aguascalientes, Mexico, where other Hour Records have been set, including Victor Campenaerts’ in 2019.</p>\n<h2>Joss Lowden’s Argon 18 Electron Pro for the Women’s Hour Record</h2>\n<ul><li><strong>Bike Frame:</strong> Argon 18 Electron Pro</li>\n<li><strong>Wheels &amp; Tyres:</strong> FFWD Disc-T SL, Vittoria Pista Speed 2.0 23c</li>\n<li><strong>Pedals:</strong> Speedplay Aero</li>\n<li><strong>Chainset:</strong> SRM and Pyramid Cycle Design</li>\n<li><strong>Gearing:</strong> 64×15</li>\n<li><strong>Bars &amp; Finishing Kit:</strong> Wattshop Pentaxia Olympic with Wattshop Anemoi extensions</li>\n<li><strong>Kit:</strong> Custom Made Le Col x McLaren Project Aero Skinsuit</li>\n<li><strong>Helmet:</strong> POC Tempor</li>\n</ul>","author":"Stan Portus","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"92c47368108bf5dc2d414944eb14fb8a4aef5025d4126d26b6a8a2ee9c771d49","category":"Cycling"}
