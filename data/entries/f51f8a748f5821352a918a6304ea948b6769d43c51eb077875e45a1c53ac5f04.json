Consumers, meanwhile, have faced wait times on their iPhone 13 orders of two, three, or even four weeks since the phones' September launch.</p>\n<p>Apple initially told vendors it would make up that 10 million units again in early 2022, once supply improved. But according to the Bloomberg report, Apple has noticed weakening demand, and the company no longer intends to hit that 90 million target in that time frame.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1817500#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1817500&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f51f8a748f5821352a918a6304ea948b6769d43c51eb077875e45a1c53ac5f04","category":"Tech"}
