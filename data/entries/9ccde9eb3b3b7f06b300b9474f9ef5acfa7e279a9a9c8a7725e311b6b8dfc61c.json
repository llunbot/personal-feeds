{"title":"‘A Tour de Force of International Crisis Management for the Biden White House’","link":"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/call-it-what-it-is","date":1713114626000,"content":"\n<p>Josh Marshall, writing at Talking Points Memo:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Together, Israel, the U.S. and various allied Arab states took down 99% or more of all those devices. Iran launched a massive aerial bombardment and virtually none of it got through. And now the U.S. has managed to get Israel not to launch an immediate and inevitably escalatory retaliation.</p>\n\n<p>It goes without saying that no administration works on its own. It comes to the game with the world’s most powerful military and major power status. It’s operating with Arab allies who have been gravitating toward a <em>de facto</em> anti-Iran alliance with Israel for years. And yet, anyone who knows anything about foreign or defense policy knows that most of it is all the endless number of things that can go wrong and the one or two ways they can go right. Navigating the last week to this point today is a <em>tour de force</em> of international crisis management for the Biden White House.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See also: <a href=\"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/edblog/follow-up-3\">Marshall’s previous post</a>, regarding Iran’s intentions for yesterday’s attack. I’m with him. My first thought was that Iran’s attack was performative, a stunt. But the more we learn the more it looks like Iran really tried to hit Israel hard — and, thankfully, were stopped.</p>\n\n<p>I went to bed last night with a dreadful feeling I’d wake up to find the U.S. and Israel enmeshed in a regional war. Knock on wood, that hasn’t happened, and might not. And I think that’s entirely thanks to the Biden administration’s diplomacy, and Biden himself.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/14/biden-admin-tour-de-force\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"9ccde9eb3b3b7f06b300b9474f9ef5acfa7e279a9a9c8a7725e311b6b8dfc61c","category":"Tech"}
