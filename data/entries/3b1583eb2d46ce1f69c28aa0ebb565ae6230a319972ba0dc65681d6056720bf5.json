The new proposal aims to convince Indonesian authorities to lift their ban on iPhone 16 sales.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/iPhone-16-Apple-Store.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nAccording to <em><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-19/apple-said-to-offer-100-million-to-undo-indonesia-iphone-16-ban\">Bloomberg</a></em>, the increased investment would be spread over two years. However, Indonesia's Ministry of Industry is reportedly now pushing Apple to direct more of the investment toward smartphone research and development within the country.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIndonesia <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/05/indonesia-iphone-ban-apple-10m-investment/\">blocked iPhone 16 sales</a> in October after determining that Apple had not met the country's 40% domestic content requirement for smartphones. The government also claims Apple has invested only 1.5 trillion rupiah ($95 million) through developer academies, falling short of a promised 1.7 trillion rupiah commitment.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ministry has yet to make a final decision on Apple's enhanced proposal. Recent attempts by Apple executives to meet with industry minister Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita in Jakarta are said to have been unsuccessful, with the executives meeting a director-general instead.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIndonesia represents a significant market for Apple, with the country's population of 280 million operating some 354 million active mobile phones.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/indonesia/\">Indonesia</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/19/apple-ups-invest-offer-indonesia-iphone-16-ban/\">Apple Offers $100 Million Investment to End Indonesia's iPhone 16 Ban</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-offers-100-million-investment-to-end-indonesias-iphone-16-ban.2443407/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3b1583eb2d46ce1f69c28aa0ebb565ae6230a319972ba0dc65681d6056720bf5","category":"Apple"}
