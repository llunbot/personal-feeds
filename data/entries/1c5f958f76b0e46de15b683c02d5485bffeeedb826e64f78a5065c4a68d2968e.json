Following the recent announcement of a new line of 1″ threaded headsets from Rene Herse, Wilde Bicycle Co. today launches another 1″ threaded option manufactured by Cane Creek. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cane Creek 110 ZN 1″ Threaded Headset</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/110headsetblackfull-Large.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/110headsetblackfull-Large.jpeg\" alt=\"Wilde Bicycle Co x Cane Creek 1 inch threaded headset black\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/110headsetblackfull-Large.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/110headsetblackfull-Large-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/110headsetblackfull-Large-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/110headsetblackfull-Large-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/110headsetblackfull-Large-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/110headsetblackfull-Large-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/110headsettallstacksilver-Large.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/110headsettallstacksilver-Large.jpeg\" alt=\"Wilde Bicycle Co x Cane Creek 1 inch threaded headset\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/110headsettallstacksilver-Large.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/110headsettallstacksilver-Large-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/110headsettallstacksilver-Large-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/110headsettallstacksilver-Large-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/110headsettallstacksilver-Large-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/110headsettallstacksilver-Large-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Calling it a Wilde exclusive, the new Cane Creek 110 ZN headset uses their top of the line 110 cups, with ZN40 sealed cartridge bearings. Offered in black or silver, the headset will sell for $120. Wilde is preselling them now, with the product expected to ship in late October. There’s no guarantee that these will be made in more than one batch, so if you want one, you probably should <a href=\"https://www.wildebikes.com/collections/frontpage/products/cane-creek-110-zn-1-threaded-headset\" target=\"_blank\">pre-order one</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/110headsetblackpieces-Large.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/110headsetblackpieces-Large.jpeg\" alt=\"Wilde Bicycle Co x Cane Creek 1 inch threaded headset\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/110headsetblackpieces-Large.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/110headsetblackpieces-Large-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/110headsetblackpieces-Large-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/110headsetblackpieces-Large-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/110headsetblackpieces-Large-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/110headsetblackpieces-Large-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Specs</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Fork type: 1″ English threaded</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stack height: 41mm</li>\n\n\n\n<li>S.H.I.S.

Suddenly, we have three different premium options including the Rene Herse Rinko and Low-Stack headsets. Rene Herse takes that a step further though by creating two new premium headset models with needle bearings instead of the standard cartridge bearings. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both are premium 1″ threaded headsets utilizing durable needle bearings with circlip retainers to keep the bearings in place when you remove the fork. An interesting detail is that the Rene Herse headsets are <em>not</em> anodized, meaning they conduct electricity. That’s apparently a key detail when using your frame/fork as the return path for your generator lighting system. I learned something new today. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those that need a lower stack height, the appropriately named Low-Stack version is offered for $189. Otherwise, the Rinko is sold for $209. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Rene-Herse-low-stack-threaded-headset2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Rene-Herse-low-stack-threaded-headset2.jpg\" alt=\"Rene Herse low stack threaded headset\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Rene-Herse-low-stack-threaded-headset2.jpg 1000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Rene-Herse-low-stack-threaded-headset2-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Rene-Herse-low-stack-threaded-headset2-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Rene-Herse-low-stack-threaded-headset2-768x768.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Rene-Herse-low-stack-threaded-headset1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Rene-Herse-low-stack-threaded-headset1.jpg\" alt=\"Rene Herse low stack threaded headset\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Rene-Herse-low-stack-threaded-headset1.jpg 1000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Rene-Herse-low-stack-threaded-headset1-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Rene-Herse-low-stack-threaded-headset1-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Rene-Herse-low-stack-threaded-headset1-768x768.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Low-Stack Specs</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Weight: 96 g</li>\n\n\n\n<li>For 1″ steerer tubes</li>\n\n\n\n<li>British threading</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stack height: 14.3 mm (lower) + 23.7 mm (upper) = 38.0 mm (total)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Needle bearings</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Upper and lower bearings oriented in parallel to reduce stack height</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use 32 mm headset wrenches to tighten</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Not anodized (conducts electricity)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Made in Taiwan</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Rene-Herse-Rinko-1-inch-threaded-headset1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Rene-Herse-Rinko-1-inch-threaded-headset1.jpg\" alt=\"Rene Herse Rinko 1 inch threaded headset\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Rene-Herse-Rinko-1-inch-threaded-headset1.jpg 1000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Rene-Herse-Rinko-1-inch-threaded-headset1-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Rene-Herse-Rinko-1-inch-threaded-headset1-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Rene-Herse-Rinko-1-inch-threaded-headset1-768x768.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Rene-Herse-Rinko-1-inch-threaded-headset2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Rene-Herse-Rinko-1-inch-threaded-headset2.jpg\" alt=\"Rene Herse Rinko 1 inch threaded headset\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Rene-Herse-Rinko-1-inch-threaded-headset2.jpg 1000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Rene-Herse-Rinko-1-inch-threaded-headset2-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Rene-Herse-Rinko-1-inch-threaded-headset2-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Rene-Herse-Rinko-1-inch-threaded-headset2-768x768.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Rinko Specs</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Weight: 119 g</li>\n\n\n\n<li>For 1″ steerer tubes</li>\n\n\n\n<li>British threading</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stack height: 16.9 mm (lower) + 29.8 mm (upper) = 46.7 mm (total)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Needle bearings</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Circlip retainers keep the bearings in place when the fork is removed from the frame.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use 32 mm headset wrenches to tighten</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Not anodized (conducts electricity)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Made in Taiwan</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Both are available now from <a href=\"https://www.renehersecycles.com/product-category/components/headsets/\" target=\"_blank\">Renehersecycles.com</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/return-of-the-1-threaded-headset-wilde-x-cane-creek-rene-herse-launch-premium-models/\">Return of the 1″ Threaded Headset: Wilde x Cane Creek, Rene Herse Launch Premium Models</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"1c5f958f76b0e46de15b683c02d5485bffeeedb826e64f78a5065c4a68d2968e","category":"Cycling"}
