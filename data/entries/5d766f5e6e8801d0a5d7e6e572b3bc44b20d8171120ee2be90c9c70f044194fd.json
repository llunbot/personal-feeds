It’s hard to describe what it felt like, but anxiety took over, and my thoughts spiralled. I couldn’t focus. I felt like I was letting everyone down. For the first time, I couldn’t just power through it alone. That’s when I opened up to my teammate. Even though I couldn’t fully explain what I was feeling, just saying “I’m not okay” helped ease the weight I was carrying. Mischa [Bredewold] didn’t try to fix it or brush it off; she simply stayed with me, reminding me that it’s okay to feel overwhelmed and that I wasn’t alone.<br /><br />‘That day, I realised how important it is to talk about what we’re going through. Anxiety can make you feel stuck and isolated but sharing your feelings – even when it’s hard – can be the first step toward relief.<br /><br />‘I also want to share something personal that many women might relate to: later that day, I got my period. Hormones can amplify emotions, and with the pressure I was already feeling, it was a lot to handle. It’s a reminder that our bodies and minds are deeply connected, and sometimes, things are just beyond our control. Looking back, I realise this was one of my biggest wins – not just because I finished third, but because I overcame one of the hardest moments I’ve faced. For me, this might have been my most meaningful personal victory in the entire Tour de France Femmes.<br /><br />‘To anyone struggling with anxiety or pressure: if you can, talk to someone you trust. Even a small conversation can make a difference. Be kind to yourself. It’s okay to feel overwhelmed, and you don’t need to have it all figured out. Remember, it’s not about fixing everything at once – it’s about taking small steps forward, at your own pace.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She followed this with another post that said, ‘For me, this was a reminder that conversations about mental health, anxiety, and emotions are still far from where they need to be. For too many, these topics remain hard to discuss or feel unsafe to share. To anyone who’s struggling: please know that your feelings matter, and it’s okay to speak up. You’re not alone.

With a 29-second advantage and the one stage remaining a flat 170km trip around AlUla, he’s likely to bag his first stage race win of his pro career.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tnt-sports-subscription-cycling\">What TNT Sport’s £30.99 per month subscription means for UK cycling fans</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/eurosport-tnt-sports-premium\">Live cycling moves to TNT Sports premium subscription</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/pro-cycling-news-tour-down-under\">Pro Log: Narváez wins Tour Down Under;

On Stage 2 in Tanunda, he led out Welsford for another sprint victory, but in the process he prevented Picnic-PostNL’s Tobias Lund Andresen from coming through, and hampered Phil Bauhaus too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Van Poppel was relegated to 118th place, received a fine of 500 Swiss francs and was docked points in both the points and KOM classifications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To make matters worse, teammate Laurence Pithie was on the receiving end of a relegation on Stage 4 after another deviation. That pushed him from fourth place on the day to last in the group down in 72nd. He was also fined 500 Swiss francs and docked points in the points and KOM classifications.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Juan Pedro López (Lidl-Trek)</h3>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><p>Lidl-Trek has received notice from the Tour Down Under race jury that Juan Pedro López has been removed from the race ahead of the final stage due to irregular feeding on Stage 5. <br /><br />Lidl-Trek accepts and respects the jury’s decision on this matter.</p>— Lidl-Trek (@LidlTrek) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LidlTrek/status/1883286234296148164?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">January 25, 2025</a></blockquote> </div>\n\n\n\n<p>After an obvious ‘sticky bottle’ from a Shimano neutral service motorbike was caught on camera, Lidl-Trek’s Juan Pedro López was disqualified from the Tour Down Under.

Discovery / BT Sport</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s bad news for cycling fans in the UK. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/eurosport-tnt-sports-premium\" target=\"_blank\">Eurosport is closing</a> and all its coverage is moving to TNT Sports from 28th February, bringing with it an increase in a monthly subscription from £6.99 to £30.99 since cycling will now only be available in a premium package that also includes football, rugby, cricket and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This news, alongside the fact that ITV will no longer be broadcasting the Tour de France after 2025, has understandably brought backlash, with many fans cancelling subscriptions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>British cyclist and former Giro d’Italia winner Tao Geoghegan Hart took to social media to express his thoughts on the change. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘For those in need of some context, the cost of watching racing has gone from £87 a year to £370. As of yet, I’ve seen little comment from pro cycling itself, especially from the many GB [Great Britain] riders whose profiles, families &amp; fans it impacts so greatly,’ he said.<br /><br />‘Let’s be clear, the sport going behind such a large paywall is a huge problem. Professional sports are all competing for the same audience. Cycling is completely reliant on this audience, it is how teams justify themselves to sponsors spending millions a year. Only a few teams can realistically promise a sponsor to win the Tour, but all teams can demonstrate good ROI when capturing so many eyes, hearts and minds. It’s not only wins that can be of value. It’s the journey and the heartache too.<br /><br />‘I find it hard to believe many fans will be able to justify this increase in costs to follow our races and those of our female colleagues. This is a huge shame. Cycling provides such great entertainment and inspiration to so many. GB fans are living a real high point of the sport. There are so many GB professionals, with Tom Pidcock winning his first race for his new team this afternoon a great example of that.<br /><br />‘To be clear on something that many don’t understand, teams receive zero remuneration from TV rights. What do I want to say? For amateur riders, cycling has become a very expensive sport or passion. Now as a GB fan, following the upper echelons of the sport has also suddenly and massively increased in cost. I think it is now very relevant to realise where this money is going and where it is not. And perhaps to question the monopoly held over the sports UK coverage.<br /><br />‘I welcome all opinions on this and am curious to hear how many people have cancelled their subscriptions. This season I’ll try to champion more accessible media. I’ll remain incredibly grateful to our sponsors. I’ll also be very interested to hear from you all which platforms myself and Lidl-Trek should consider collaborating with. We want and need to remain available to all of the huge GB audience that has been built up over the last 15 years of astronomic success.’</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/january-winners-losers\">Pro cycling winners and losers in January</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Robyn Davidson &#124; Editorial Assistant","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"5d766f5e6e8801d0a5d7e6e572b3bc44b20d8171120ee2be90c9c70f044194fd","category":"Cycling"}
