The current Apple Watch Series 9 has a 1.7-inch display, while the Apple Watch Ultra has a display size of 1.93-inches, so this would be the biggest screen on an Apple Watch so far.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThat said, its dimensions are said to measure roughly 46 x 39.7 x 11.6mm, which would make it bigger overall than the Series 9 but smaller than the Ultra. Otherwise, the renders suggest a design similar to the Series 9, with a Digital Crown and Side button, and a square display.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said a significantly overhauled \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/13/gurman-apple-watch-x-redesign-planned/\">Apple Watch X</a>\" would launch in either 2024 or 2025, to mark the tenth anniversary of the device. The original Apple Watch was announced in September 2014 and released in April 2015. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman said the \"Apple Watch X\" would be equipped with a thinner case. The <em>Bloomberg</em> reporter also said it would potentially have a magnetic band attachment system, although there's no evidence of that in the renders. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/17/kuo-apple-watch-series-10-larger-screen-thinner/\">claimed</a> that Apple Watch Series 10 will be thinner and come in larger screen sizes than previous models. Kuo said the screen size options on the next-generation Apple Watch will increase from 41mm to 45mm, and from 45mm to 49mm, while being encased in a thinner design. For reference, the Apple Watch Ultra has a 49mm case.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's unclear at this point whether the CAD renders are accurate, but either way Apple typically launches new Apple Watch models around September alongside its latest iPhone lineup. Apple is said to be planning to incorporate blood pressure monitoring this year, with the watch able to detect hypertension. Sleep apnea detection is also said to be coming to the 2024 Apple Watch model.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 9</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/91mobiles-com/\">91Mobiles</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-x/\">Apple Watch X</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Caution)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/26/alleged-first-look-at-apple-watch-x-series-10/\">Alleged First Look at Apple Watch X / Series 10 With 2-Inch Display</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/alleged-first-look-at-apple-watch-x-series-10-with-2-inch-display.2430143/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e9758c5c9a9afbf41c6515f5934d7e96fb15e3b640e30a724478583812a73193","category":"Apple"}
