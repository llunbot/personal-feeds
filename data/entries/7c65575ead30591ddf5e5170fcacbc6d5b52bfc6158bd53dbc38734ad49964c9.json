{"title":"Things Support for Markdown","link":"https://culturedcode.com/things/blog/2021/08/remarkable-notes/","date":1633722464000,"content":"\n<p>Cultured Code’s renowned to-do app Things added support for Markdown back in August. It’s <em>really</em> well done. You might think that as the creator of Markdown, that I’m in favor of seeing it in use everywhere. That is wrong. In fact, in recent years I think Markdown is in use in far too many places where something truly WYSIWYG is called for.</p>\n\n<p>Things does Markdown right. It doesn’t hide the Markdown formatting characters, it just styles them. Effectively, the notes field for tasks in Things is still just plain text. It’s just styled nicely if you write that plain text in Markdown. That’s the right way to do Markdown. Don’t hide the formatting characters; just style/color them.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/10/08/things-markdown\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"7c65575ead30591ddf5e5170fcacbc6d5b52bfc6158bd53dbc38734ad49964c9","category":"Tech"}
