Blevins took the win with a successful attack on the final lap of the final World Cup of the season. Vlad Dascalu (Trek-Pirelli) was unable to follow the attack, finishing second, while Ondrej Cink (Kross Orlen) came in third. Mathias Flueckiger (Thomus RN Swiss Bike) retained his standing, clinching the World Cup overall. </p><p>“This meant absolutely everything,” said Blevins after crossing the finish line. “I mean, I’d be lying if I said I expected anything close to this or even really dreamed of it. It just shows, there is so much magic in sport regardless of what it is and this is everything to me. To do it with my family, all the USA fans, and obviously, in the USA. I’m over the moon.”</p><blockquote></blockquote><p>In the women’s race it was the recently crowned World Champion Evie Richards (Trek Factory) of Great Britain who took a dominant win in the season final. Australia’s Rebecca McConnell (Primaflora Mondraker XSauce) finished second, with Anne Tauber (CST PostNL Bafang) in third.</p><p>Despite not starting in Snowshoe, France’s Loana Lecomte (Massi) took out the overall World Cup title as a result of a truly dominant performance earlier in the season.  </p></div></div>","author":"Dave Rome","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"586eb3b222f146d16e9a03c142a211806cc0653a3ae0a94a2f94d1256085e22f","category":"Cycling"}
