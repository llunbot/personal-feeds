His email made reference to a new requirement that FBI personnel obtain prior approval from an FBI supervisor or attorney before making queries about US people.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023247#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023247&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b4b265108a2faa3d0eab72a72c862b19008861e064cdeda6c8cdcce856981201","category":"Tech"}
