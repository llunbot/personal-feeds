The attacker then uses the false identity to induce an employee of the cellular carrier to move the phone number off the current Subscriber Identity Module card, a small chip that connects a device to a specific carrier account. Then, the attacker has the number transferred to a new SIM card, usually under the pretense that the fraudulent account holder has just obtained a new device.</p>\n<h2>Not the SEC announcement you think it is</h2>\n<p>The number at issue in the SIM swap, an <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/media/1373721/dl?inline\">indictment</a> unsealed on Thursday said, was used to provide two-factor authentication for the SEC X account, which authorized commission personnel to post official communications. One of the people connected to the conspiracy then used the 2FA code to compromise the X account to tweet false information that caused the price of a single bitcoin to increase by $1,000.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/10/how-alleged-sim-swap-and-hacked-x-account-drove-up-price-of-bitcoin-by-1k/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/10/how-alleged-sim-swap-and-hacked-x-account-drove-up-price-of-bitcoin-by-1k/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6bd9e6b0e98a184ed43bf1530e9211e57d6826ddab46cc3f5ceb934b4bab52d8","category":"Tech"}
