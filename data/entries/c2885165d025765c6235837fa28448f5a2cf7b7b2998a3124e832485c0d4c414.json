While it’s still possible to spend thousands on a smart trainer, new entrants to the market and a flood of post-pandemic stock have also forced prices down in many cases.</p>\n<p>You can choose between wheel-on options, where your rear tyre provides the connection to the trainer or direct drive models, where you remove your rear wheel and attach your bike to a cassette on the trainer. Wheel-on trainers are in general more affordable, but direct-drive models provide a better experience and avoid wear on your bike’s tyres.</p>\n<p>Here, we’ve rounded up the best cheap turbo trainers and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-smart-trainer/\">smart trainer</a> deals to help keep you riding this winter.</p>\n<section>\n    <div>\n        \n<h3>Where to buy a turbo trainer online in the UK and US</h3>\n<p>Here are some good places to shop for a turbo trainer if our selection below isn’t quite what you’re looking for.</p>\n<h4>UK retailers</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wiggle.com/c/cycle/indoor-cycling/turbo-trainers\" target=\"_blank\">Wiggle</a>/<a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?id=489797&amp;clickref=bikeradar-0&amp;awinmid=2698&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.chainreactioncycles.com%2Fc%2Faccessories%2Findoor-cycling%2Fturbo-trainers\" target=\"_blank\">Chain Reaction Cycles</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.merlincycles.com/cycling-turbo-trainers-75428/\" target=\"_blank\">Merlin Cycles</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.evanscycles.com/offers/turbo-deal_c\" target=\"_blank\">Evans Cycles</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.halfords.com/cycling/turbo-trainers/\" target=\"_blank\">Halfords</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>US retailers</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.competitivecyclist.com/trainers-rollers\" target=\"_blank\">Competitive Cyclist</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.jensonusa.com/Indoor-Trainers\" target=\"_blank\">Jenson USA</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mikesbikes.com/collections/bike-trainers\" target=\"_blank\">Mike’s Bikes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wiggle.com/c/cycle/indoor-cycling/turbo-trainers\" target=\"_blank\">Wiggle</a>/<a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?id=489797&amp;clickref=bikeradar-0&amp;awinmid=2698&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.chainreactioncycles.com%2Fc%2Faccessories%2Findoor-cycling%2Fturbo-trainers\" target=\"_blank\">Chain Reaction Cycles</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section>\n\n<h2>Pinnacle HC Turbo Home Trainer</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pinnacle HC Turbo Home Trainer\" title=\"Pinnacle HC Turbo Home Trainer\" />\n\n</div>\n    <div>\n    <span>\n                    <i>Simon von Bromley / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n<p>A UK-only option, the Pinnacle HC trainer comes from Evans Cycles’ own brand. It’s compatible with eight to 12-speed drivetrains and you can buy an XDR freehub body if you run a SRAM drivetrain. It’s not without its issues but will simulate a 20 per cent gradient and provide 2,500 watts resistance, so it’s up there with top trainers from the big brands while undercutting their prices.</p>\n<p>It started off at £700, then dropped to £500, but right now it’s priced down by 70 percent at £210, so it’s one of the lowest-priced options available, particularly for a direct drive model.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/indoor-trainers/pinnacle-hc-turbo-home-smart-trainer-review/\">Read our Pinnacle HC Home Trainer review</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.evanscycles.com/brand/pinnacle/hc-turbo-home-trainer-712633#colcode=71263303\" target=\"_blank\">Buy the Pinnacle HC Home Trainer from Evans Cycles for £210</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Tacx Flow Smart</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Tacx Flow Smart\" title=\"Tacx Flow Smart\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Tacx Flow Smart is a good entry-level option.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The Tacx Flow Smart is one of the lowest-priced smart trainers available, and comes from an established name, with Tacx having made trainers for years and now owned by Garmin.</p>\n<p>We found it very easy to set up, with minimal assembly and the Tacx Flow folds away to a compact size for storage.
