How the space agency responds will set a precedent, and that may be important in a world where there is ever more activity in orbit, with space debris and vehicles increasingly making uncontrolled reentries through Earth's atmosphere.</p>\n<p>Alejandro Otero, owner of the Naples, Florida, home struck by the debris, was not home when part of a battery pack from the International Space Station crashed through his home on March 8. His son Daniel, 19, was home but escaped injury. NASA has confirmed the 1.6-pound object, made of the metal alloy Inconel, was part of a battery pack jettisoned from the space station in 2021.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032777#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032777&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3e1ba05fec6537a7593178caf78a10e3552637c346ddb97c4a1582cb2ac78732","category":"Tech"}
