For context, that year the Slovenian won the UAE Tour, Strade Bianche, Tirreno-Adriatico, the Tour of Slovenia, GP Montréal and Il Lombardia, and came second at the Tour de France, although that came on the ‘Prototipo’ V4Rs prototype. While riding this V3Rs it was all wins (and a rather impressive fourth in his Tour of Flanders debut).</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"728\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/Colnago_Uae_28-728x970.jpg\" alt=\"time-trial bike side profile\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/Colnago_Uae_28-728x970.jpg 728w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/Colnago_Uae_28-225x300.jpg 225w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/Colnago_Uae_28-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/Colnago_Uae_28-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/Colnago_Uae_28-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/Colnago_Uae_28-750x1000.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/Colnago_Uae_28-1140x1520.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/Colnago_Uae_28-scaled.jpg 1920w\" /><figcaption>Bike-Room</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Speaking of prototypes, the stunning TT1 time-trial bike began its own racing life as a prototype, and was tailored specifically for Pogačar.
