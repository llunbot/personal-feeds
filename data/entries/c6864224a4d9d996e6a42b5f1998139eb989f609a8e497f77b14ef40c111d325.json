The sale included user manuals and Apple software on two cassette tapes.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple co-founder Steve Wozniak is believed to have built 200 of the Apple-1 computers and sold 175 of them, making it a rare collector's item. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe computer was originally offered as a bare circuit board to be sold as a kit and completed by electronics hobbyists. However, Steve Jobs later sold 50 fully assembled units of the computer to California-based The Byte Shop, and the koa wood case was added by the pioneering early computer retailer, but only six cases were finished.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/apple-1-john-moran-auctioneers1.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n\"This is kind of the holy grail for vintage electronics and computer tech collectors,\" Apple-1 expert Corey Cohen told the <em>Los Angeles Times</em> ahead of Tuesday's auction. \"That really makes it exciting for a lot of people.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAnother fully functional Apple-1 computer <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/03/13/apple-1-auction-2020/\">sold for $458,711</a> last year.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Update:</strong> The article was updated to reflect the auctioneers' official recorded auction price of $500,000, rather than the earlier reported price of $400,000.
