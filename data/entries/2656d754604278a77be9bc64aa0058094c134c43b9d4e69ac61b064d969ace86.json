Today, Honda unveiled a pair of concepts in Las Vegas that it says preview a new range of electric vehicles. Called the Honda 0 series, the first of these new EVs is due to go on sale here in the US in 2026.</p>\n<p>That car will be based on the Saloon, a sedan-ish car that looks like it just teleported in from Neo Tokyo. Some of the Saloon's details might get watered down by the inevitable compromises of road legality regulations, but fans of the sedan should take comfort in its name—\"saloon\" is what they call one of those in Britain.</p>\n  <ul>\n          <li>\n        <div>\n          <div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/c@SALOON-980x511.jpg\" /></div>\n          <p>\n            Just the other day, someone was lamenting the lack of cool-looking concepts.

But that appears to have been taken as something of a challenge by the automaker.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1994633#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1994633&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
