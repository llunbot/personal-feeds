No service. No StarLink. Just a comfy old Land Cruiser camper van and all the accoutrements we rely on when going off the grid. The nights were cold, dropping into the teens, but the days were warm. Short sleeves. Shorts. Sunblock. It’s a weird time in the Southwest right now with an El Niño weather cycle throwing everything off.

The year of the incident was 1983 and he had been riding a mountain bike for a few years. Living in SLO, he was just far south enough to be away from the Marin crowd but was still in Victor Vicente’s home terrain. The fledgling mountain bike (as the activity, and design) had just started to catch on in California, and the laws surrounding where and how an MTB could be ridden were already established.</p>\n<p>Groups like the Sierra Club painted mountain bikers as unruly, renegade, off-trail riding, drug-using hooligans who mowed over hikers and ruined not only trails but the serenity these elites enjoyed when they drove to a trailhead to walk a few miles and then drive back home. It didn’t matter that the bicycle was inherently a superior “green” transportation device and that these riders were riding from their front door to these same trails.</p>\n<p>The idea that anyone could be in the outdoors enjoying nature on a bicycle pushed against everything these pseudo-environmentalist fascists were telling their members. If you weren’t rich, white, and affluent, nature wasn’t for you. I’m not making this stuff up. As such, rangers and land managers were on edge, and the mountain bike was public land enemy number one.</p>\n<p><em>Anyway, let me step off my cynical soapbox…</em></p>\n<p>As an arborist, Beau had rappelled up sequoia trees before to study these ancient old ones. It was during these scientific analyses that his love of the sequoia trees grew, leading Beau to the realization that he could combine his passions together to create an <em>epic photo</em>. He asked one friend to help belay and another friend to get the shot. The idea was an egg of opportunity, and it hatched on September 21st, 1983, in Kings Canyon National Park.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-5.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-5.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-5.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-5.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-5.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-5.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-5.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-5.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>The shot was perfect, but as they removed the rigging from the giant sequoia, a ranger caught them, writing Beau a citation. He was given a court date he had to attend within the National Park. He arrived the morning of his appearance, and the ranger at the gate exclaimed, “Oh, that’s you! We heard all about you!” implying that the park rangers that had fined him had spoken about the ordeal with other rangers–which was not allowed if Beau was to be given a fair trial.</p>\n<p>At the courthouse, Beau argued that the gossip had violated his due process and that Count 2 references a charge of Beau’s supposed “tire tracks closely resembling the tread of a bicycle tire” was circumstantial at best. The judge agreed but wouldn’t let Beau off without a slap on the wrist. He agreed to expungement due to the ranger gossip and the circumstantial claim of his bicycle tires being on the trail. Beau went on probation with the National Parks Department for six months, and the charges were then dropped.</p>\n<p>Yet, the courts weren’t aware that there was a photo of Beau rappelling seventy feet up off the ground!</p>\n<p><em><strong>Now, this should be obvious, yet I have to say this: don’t go rappelling up a giant sequoia with your bikes, please!</strong></em></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-27.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-27.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-27.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-27.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-27.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-27.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-27.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-27.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>About the Annapurna</h3>\n<p>Beau bought this Annapurna from Tom Ritchey in the late 1980s and rode the piss out of it for years.

Tom called this “faux lug” construction. These frames represent the crème de la crème of 1980s Ritchey mountain bikes.</em></p>\n<p>Once Andy finished the work, he laid down a sweet red-to-silver paint fade and put original Ritchey decals back on the bike. Beau brought the frame into his local shop for a brand new Deore XT M739 groupset in 1999. At the time, he was blown away at the excessive gearing, stating that “five was fine!” The shop convinced him that Deore XT 9-speed was the best bang for his buck. Beau conceded and let the shop upgrade the bike. He’s been riding it hard ever since. We talked about the ride quality of these old frames and how Beau bought his frame a few sizes too small, so it’d offer better maneuverability down the chunky stuff.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-15.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-15.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-15.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-15.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-15.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-15.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-15.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-15.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>The 1990s brought about compact geometries with bikes for this very reason. More seat post and stem meant the frame was smaller, stiffer, stronger, and easier to maneuver on rocky singletrack. Even though these bikes are completely rigid with no suspension–Beau didn’t even have a Hite Rite!–they flex and move beneath you, thereby softening the ride. And, you learn to navigate the path of least resistance while holding on for dear life!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-33.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-33.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-33.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-33.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-33.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-33.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-33.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-33.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-24.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-24.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-24.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-24.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-24.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-24.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-24.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-24.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-14.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-14.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-14.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-14.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-14.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-14.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-14.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/11/Campground-Ritchey-Annapurna-and-One-Wild-Ride-14.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><em>I love how worn down his Oury grips are!</em></p>\n<p>Conversations happen like this from time to time while we’re out car camping and unwinding from a life of bikes 24/7 and it never ceases to amaze me how a universal language like the love of framebuilders and vintage mountain bikes can bring two strangers together for hours.
