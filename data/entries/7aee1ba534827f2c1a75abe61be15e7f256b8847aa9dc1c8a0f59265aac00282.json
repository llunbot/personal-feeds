While the most advanced <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/07/a-jargon-free-explanation-of-how-ai-large-language-models-work/7/\">AI language models</a> so far seem mostly like disembodied voices echoing from an anonymous data center, they might not remain that way for long. Some companies like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/07/googles-rt-2-ai-model-brings-us-one-step-closer-to-wall-e/\">Google</a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/03/huge-funding-round-makes-figure-big-techs-favorite-humanoid-robot-company/\">Figure</a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/02/robots-let-chatgpt-touch-the-real-world-thanks-to-microsoft/\">Microsoft</a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/12/teslas-latest-humanoid-robot-optimus-gen-2-can-handle-eggs-without-cracking-them/\">Tesla</a>, <a href=\"https://bostondynamics.com/blog/robots-that-can-chat/\">Boston Dynamics</a>, and others are working toward giving AI models a body. This is called \"embodiment,\" and AI chipmaker Nvidia wants to accelerate the process.</p>\n\n<p>\"Building foundation models for general humanoid robots is one of the most exciting problems to solve in AI today,\" said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in a statement. Huang spent a portion of Nvidia's annual <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/keynote/\">GTC conference keynote</a> on Monday going over Nvidia's robotics efforts. \"The next generation of robotics will likely be humanoid robotics,\" Huang said. \"We now have the necessary technology to imagine generalized human robotics.\"</p>\n<p>To that end, Nvidia <a href=\"https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/foundation-model-isaac-robotics-platform\">announced</a> Project GR00T, a general-purpose foundation model for humanoid robots. As a type of AI model itself, Nvidia hopes GR00T (which stands for \"Generalist Robot 00 Technology\" but sounds a lot like the famous Marvel character) will serve as an AI mind for robots, enabling them to learn skills and solve various tasks on the fly. In a <a href=\"https://x.com/DrJimFan/status/1769860044324319658?s=20\">tweet</a>, Nvidia researcher Linxi \"Jim\" Fan called the project \"our moonshot to solve embodied AGI in the physical world.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011260#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011260&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7aee1ba534827f2c1a75abe61be15e7f256b8847aa9dc1c8a0f59265aac00282","category":"Tech"}
