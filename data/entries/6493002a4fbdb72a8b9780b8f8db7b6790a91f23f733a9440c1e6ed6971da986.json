Fast forward just two months, and Vittoria has now unveiled that very tyre “dedicated to the L’Eroica vintage cycling event and all its enthusiasts.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new tyre features a tan side-wall, as if there was an alternative for a vintage themed tyre, and comes in 25mm width. The tyre construction combines the Vittoria Corsa CX tread with the A.Dugast “Flying Doctor” cotton casing and a neoprene coating for a mix of grip, puncture protection, and what Vittoria refers to as “bad weather performance”.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Vittoria-by-a.-dugast-1-1340x754.jpg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In a press release for the new tyre, Vittoria said only natural materials are used in the new tyre construction, “such as high-quality cotton, natural rubber, and natural latex.”  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tyres are handmade in the A.Dugast workshop and are limited to just 118 pieces, meaning a pair for just 59 very lucky bikes. This handcrafting process allows A.Dugast to both number and print the initials of the lucky owners onto each tyre for a truly unique tyre. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the price of such a limited edition and unique tyre? Just a cool €230 per pair, with each set delivered in a “beautiful, one-of-a-kind special edition cotton musette.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The press release had no mention as to whether the new tyres are permitted under L’Eroica’s vintage bike regulations, but there are exemptions for vintage themed modern parts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pre-order for the Vittoria tubular for L’Eroica made by A.
