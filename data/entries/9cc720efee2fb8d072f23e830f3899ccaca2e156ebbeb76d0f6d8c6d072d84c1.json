The New York Times and Reuters were affected by the delay with the t.co link-shortening service used by X, according to several news reports published yesterday.</p>\n<p>X eliminated the delay in links to news sites yesterday afternoon, according to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/musks-x-delays-access-content-reuters-ny-times-social-media-rivals-2023-08-16/\">Reuters</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/08/15/twitter-x-links-delayed/\">The Washington Post</a>. \"When contacted for comment, X confirmed the delay was removed but did not elaborate,\" Reuters wrote.</p>\n<p>Links from X to the NYT and Reuters loaded almost instantly for us today. But we still found delays of three to five seconds in links to Substack, Bluesky, Facebook, Instagram, and Threads today in our tests.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1961279#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1961279&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9cc720efee2fb8d072f23e830f3899ccaca2e156ebbeb76d0f6d8c6d072d84c1","category":"Tech"}
