The speed at which the road has been shifting has increased in measure from inches per year, to inches per month, inches per week, per day, and finally per dramatic hour by August 2021, when the road was closed west of Pretty Rocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What remains is a rare chance for bikepackers to explore one of America’s oldest and largest National Parks completely free from trucks, tour buses, campervans and hundreds of thousands of annual summer visitors.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bikepacking-tips\">Tunisia Diaries: 7 things I wish I had known before I set off on my bikepacking adventure</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/jack-ultracyclist\">‘Cycling became an obsession’: interview with Jack UltraCyclist</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/fiona-kolbinger-cyclist\">‘I just want to push my body to its limits’: Fiona Kolbinger profile</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Bear watch &amp; backcountry provisioning</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"725\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-02-725x970.jpg\" alt=\"Denali Landslide, Alaska\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-02-725x970.jpg 725w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-02-224x300.jpg 224w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-02-768x1027.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-02-1148x1536.jpg 1148w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-02-750x1003.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-02-1140x1525.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Donivan Berube</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Before I can take to the roads, however, there’s a slight bit of business to attend to at the Park Headquarters’ Backcountry Information Centre. In a small outbuilding tucked behind the bustling transit depot, a youthful ranger named Jenny is stationed for the season to take visitors through obligatory wilderness survival and bear safety notes alongside an accompanying video. If you don’t have bear spray or a mandated hardshell bear-proof food container, they’ll assign one to you.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"729\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-04-970x729.jpg\" alt=\"Denali Landslide, Alaska\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-04-970x729.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-04-300x226.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-04-768x577.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-04-750x564.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-04-1140x857.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-04.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Donivan Berube</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>It’s a nondescript room with a massive topographic map enveloping the far wall, which is utilised to lay out coordinates and choose where you’re headed. The map is carved into numbered subdivisions of varying size, with lower numbers representing more easily accessible sections that hug the Park Road, and higher numbers for areas so remote that their permitting is unlimited.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Section 11 is full tonight but the next open area is 25 miles (40km) out,’ Ranger Jenny tells me, with a worried note to her voice. ‘That’s pretty far, are you sure you can make it?’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"727\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-06-970x727.jpg\" alt=\"Denali Landslide, Alaska\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-06-970x727.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-06-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-06-768x575.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-06-750x562.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-06-1140x854.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-06.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Donivan Berube</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>I’ve arrived here having averaged 120-160km daily since rebuilding my bike in the Prudhoe Bay airport, 400km north of the Arctic Circle. Each day has been a punishing race southward, battling sideways snow on mud-crusted ice roads. I give her a wide smile, and nod. Yes, I’m sure I can make it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the entirety of the Park Road’s 148km length is technically rideable, the initial 69km that leads from its easternmost end up to the Toklat River East Fork will have you contending with traffic.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-03-970x728.jpg\" alt=\"Denali Landslide, Alaska\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-03-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-03-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-03-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-03-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-03-1140x855.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Donivan Berube</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>As such, many two-wheeled visitors choose to board any of the dark green camper shuttles with front-loaded bike racks to ride ahead as far as the closure point. These aren’t like the usual wildlife viewing tour buses, instead strictly servicing backpackers who’ll disembark at various campgrounds and trailheads along the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hiking the jagged glacier braid</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Spanning the landslide starts with a vigorous 8km trek across the Toklat river bed, carrying my bike and panniers down a long stairwell to hike for hours over shallow glacial braids scabbed with scraggy tundra.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"727\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-07-970x727.jpg\" alt=\"Denali Landslide, Alaska\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-07-970x727.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-07-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-07-768x575.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-07-750x562.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-07-1140x854.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-07.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Donivan Berube</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>A dozen or more short river crossings ensure that my shoes are soaked by the time I rejoin the road beyond. This is full off-road bike territory, and though my rigid Surly Disc Trucker with 41mm ExtraTerrestrials did its best to endure the choppy push, my hands are barbed with cramps from the relentless mix of shaking and braking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once I’m back on firmer terrain, the vast emptiness of an otherwise popular tourist hotspot is emphatically breathtaking. Mobile service has long-since evaporated, and the loose gravel road carves a soft serpentine fade that melts away into horizon after horizon of endlessly photogenic snowpacked glaciertops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Denali itself, North America’s highest summit at 6,190m, peeks out from a lilting veil of cloud cover. I pedal skyward for two days across stunning river valleys connected by blind passes and gratifying climbs. Polychrome Glacier Overlook levels off above 1,050m, followed by a quick dip back to the river before Highway Pass rises again to over 1,200m.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-05-970x728.jpg\" alt=\"Denali Landslide, Alaska\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-05-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-05-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-05-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-05-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-05-1140x855.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-05.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Donivan Berube</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Naturally, the road hasn’t been serviced since its official closure in 2021. This means having to navigate marbled cracks along with extensive rockfalls and further faulting, in some places exceeding sudden 40cm drops in the roadway.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>None shall pass</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m on a mossy hill just beyond kilometre 99 and I’m struggling to hold the bike upright amidst hurricane-force winds. Curling out ahead is Thorofare Pass, which right now is a cavernous purple nebula of brooding clouds and ice melt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the valley between, a lone grizzly bear roves atop the bridge I need to cross. It paws around to the left, forages a bit to the right, then turns to the road in my direction. I decide the wisest move is to backtrack a few miles, taking shelter from both the wind and potential unwanted bear encounters by pitching my tent beneath a concrete bridge wall in the adjacent river valley.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-08-970x728.jpg\" alt=\"Denali Landslide, Alaska\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-08-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-08-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-08-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-08-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-08-1140x855.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-08.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Donivan Berube</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>By morning the bear is gone, replaced with a herd of grazing caribou. I lean forward over the handlebars and watch them silently making their way across miles of verdant green glacier embankments before pedalling on.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Jurassic desertion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to the road closure, the once-lively Toklat River Ranger Contact Station and Eielson Visitor Centre have been effectively boarded up, and in this setting could easily pass for the abandoned science labs in a ‘Jurassic Park’ movie.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-09-970x728.jpg\" alt=\"Denali Landslide, Alaska\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-09-970x728.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-09-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-09-768x576.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-09-750x563.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-09-1140x855.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-09.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Donivan Berube</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Doors are locked tight, bathrooms and rubbish bins taped shut, tables and chairs stacked beside waist-high banks of snow, even into the height of summer. It makes for an eerily calm picnic spot offering unmarred views of Sunset Glacier to the south, though without the potable water access that such bases usually provide. I fill my bottles with snowfall instead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond Eielson is a steep descent of around 600m to the famed Wonder Lake. Its accompanying campground is also closed these days, but those willing to accept the vicious climb back up from its shores are rewarded at the bottom with unrivalled views of Denali itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At a mere 40km from the mountain’s base, this is as close as most visitors are able to get short of supplementary hikes or mountaineering expeditions. Outside a winter dog mushing cabin, I stop for a chat with two bikepackers coming from that direction. They work for one of the Kantishna lodges, a privatised group of luxury wilderness resorts whose operation within the federal boundary was ‘grandfathered in’ due to their existence predating the Park’s westward expansion.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"614\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-10-970x614.jpg\" alt=\"Denali Landslide, Alaska\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-10-970x614.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-10-300x190.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-10-768x486.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-10-750x475.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-10-1140x722.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/denali-landslide-10.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Donivan Berube</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>These are elite hotel experiences costing thousands of dollars per person, per night. Guests are reserved with aeroplane-access only. The pair do service and maintenance work there over the summer months and are taking advantage of a weekend off to bikepack deeper into the surrounding wilderness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the northernmost point of Wonder Lake it’s barely 10km to the end of Denali Park Road at Kantishna. While inarguably rewarding, getting here by bike has been by no means easy. Steep gravel gradients blasted by shuttering wind, frigid temperatures near freezing and blitzes of rain, snow and ice illuminated with eternal sunlight has made for a uniquely rugged ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it has been an experience to be remembered, especially since once the slide is cleared, the Park Road will be fully opened again and ceaseless road traffic will once again dominate. Predictable construction delays have slowed things down and left local eyes rolling, but contractors estimate the restoration’s completion in 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until then it’s an adventure cyclist’s midnight-sun daydream.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bikepacking-alaskas-denali-landslide\">Bikepacking Alaska’s Denali landslide</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Martin James","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"873758cde9caab66cae6cacc9ed494f85a2617e50df2c9019edf5b3d68cdcb26","category":"Cycling"}
