{"title":"iOS 17.3 release candidate is out now, adding several new features","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2169796/ios-17-3-beta-features-release-stolen-device-protection.html","date":1705518184000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>As expected, Apple began beta testing iOS 17.3 the day after <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2164433/ios-17-2-features-little-improvements.html\">iOS 17.2</a> was released. This update will bring collaborative playlists to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2164226/apple-music-wont-get-collaborative-playlists-until-next-year.html\">Apple Music</a> (removed in a late beta of iOS 17.2) and enables <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2168672/airplay-in-hotel-rooms-officially-delayed-until-2024.html\">AirPlay in supporting hotels</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the most interesting update in IOS 17.3 is a previously unannounced feature called Stolen Device Protection. When enabled, the feature will make it harder to perform certain actions, including changing your Apple ID password, passcode, or viewing your other passwords, when away from a familiar place. With just your iPhone passcode (which could be obtained simply by watching a user enter it), a thief can change the Apple ID password and wipe your iPhone, but Stolen Device Protection adds the layer of Face ID or Touch ID when away from your home, work, or other trusted location.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Update 01/17/24: </strong>The release candidate for iOS 17.3 is out now for developers, and should reach public testers shortly. The final release will likely come next week on the 23rd or 24th.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 17.3 Release Notes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s official release notes for iOS 17.3 are as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<p><strong>Stolen Device Protection</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Stolen Device Protection increases security of iPhone and Apple ID by requiring Face ID or Touch ID with no passcode fallback to perform certain actions</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Security Delay requires Face ID or Touch ID, an hour wait, and then an additional successful biometric authentication before sensitive operations like changing device passcode or Apple ID password can be performed</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lock Screen</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>New Unity wallpaper honors Black history and culture in celebration of Black History Month</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Music</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Collaborate on playlists allows you to invite friends to join your playlist and everyone can add, reorder, and remove songs</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Emoji reactions can be added to any track in a collaborative playlist</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This update also includes the following improvements:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>AirPlay hotel support lets you stream content directly to the TV in your room in select hotels</li>\n\n\n\n<li>AppleCare &amp; Warranty in Settings shows your coverage for all devices signed in with your Apple ID</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Crash detection optimizations (all iPhone 14 and iPhone 15 models)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Some features may not be available for all regions or on all Apple devices.

The process for installing a beta has changed since iOS 16.4. Here’s how the new process works now:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Click Sign Up on the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://beta.apple.com/&amp;xcust=1-1-2169796-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple Beta page</a> and register with your Apple ID.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Log in to the Beta Software Program.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click <em>Enroll your iOS device</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Open the <em>Settings</em> app, tap <em>General</em>, then <em>Software Update</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>In the Beta Updates section, select the iOS Public Beta.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>It may take a few moments after registering for the beta option to appear in Software Update.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 17.3: How to install the developer beta</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll need to be registered as an Apple developer. Beginning with iOS 17, you don’t need to be in the $99 per year developer program to access the developer beta. A free developer account will do. You can get one via Xcode or the Apple Developer app in iOS. Here’s how to do it via the Apple Developer app:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Download the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-developer/id640199958&amp;xcust=1-1-2169796-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple Developer App</a> from the App Store.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Open the app.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap on Account.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sign in using your usual Apple ID.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to sell applications to the App Store you’ll need to pay $99/£79 per year for a paid account. Sign up for the Apple Developer Program (<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/&amp;xcust=1-1-2169796-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">here</a>) or through Apple’s Developer App. You can <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://developer.apple.com/support/compare-memberships&amp;xcust=1-1-2169796-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">compare the free and paid accounts here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Registered developers can choose to get the Public Beta instead by selecting <em>iOS Public Beta</em> in the Software Update screen. It may take a little time after registering as a developer for the option to appear in Software Updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some developers have an Apple ID registered for developer access that is different from the Apple ID associated with their personal Apple account and data. To use a different Apple ID for beta access than is used throughout the rest of iOS, open <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>General</em> &gt; <em>Software Update</em> &gt; <em>Beta Updates</em> and select the Apple ID at the bottom of the screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Find out everything you need to know about iOS 17 in our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1519552/ios-17-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 17 superguide</a>.</p>\n\niOS</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"4a699ab2694214d93e6f1904ed87cf76a8effc89f3367121319e0d41a60ebb39","category":"Apple"}
