Otherwise, the 2nd-gen AirPods Pro have the same upgrades as the Lightning model released in 2022: longer battery life (6 hours vs 4.5 hours), Adaptive Transparency mode, greater noise cancellation (2X), and improved audio quality. And with the iOS 17 update released in September, you’ll also get Adaptive Audio that blends Transparency and Active Noise Cancellation that blends the music you’re listening to with your changing environments to create a more natural experience. Plus you’ll get faster automatic switching and new mute controls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1207444/airpods-pro-2022-review.html\">4.5-star review</a>, we praised the AirPods Pro as “the best choice for those who use Apple products.” And with a $60 discount and a new USB-C case, they’re impossible to pass up.</p>\n\nHeadphones</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"b6c5c958df489264ddf23ae71fdbdbf211e37e7eef8efe54bb5baba80d5d9898","category":"Apple"}
