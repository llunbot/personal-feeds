With their investigation reopened, officials are now renewing calls for anyone who went to the clinic to get tested for blood-borne pathogens.</p>\n<p>Vampire facials are a popular cosmetic medical procedure in which a person's own blood is spun in a centrifuge to separate proteins and platelets, and the resulting platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is re-injected into the face via microneedles or micro-abrasions.
