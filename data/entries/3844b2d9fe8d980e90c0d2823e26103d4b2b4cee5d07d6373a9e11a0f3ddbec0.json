Several other users also chimed in with similar issues, and it turns out that some of the issues could be linked to the ‌iPhone‌ turning off at night. From Reddit:<blockquote>Hijacking top comment. Check your battery settings and see if there is a gap during the night. Yesterday a lot of iPhones turned off for a few hours during the night. In my case the phone turned back on 1 minute before the alarm</blockquote>Some other people noted having to put in their passcodes in the morning, an indication that the ‌iPhone‌ restarted or shut off during the night. <em><a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2023/10/10/iphone-restart-overnight/\">9to5Mac</a></em> highlighted these issues earlier this week, and we've also experienced the problem here at <em>MacRumors</em>, as have <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/all-iphones-spontaneously-rebooted-last-night.2407082/\">multiple users on the <em>MacRumors</em> forums</a>. From <em>MacRumors</em>:<blockquote>So my iPhone 15 Pro Max with iOS 17.0.3 spontaneously rebooted last night (10. October around 01:00 AM CET). The same happened to 3 of my friends with the same iPhone and same iOS, and to someone else with an iPhone 13 Mini, also on the same iOS.</blockquote>You can tell if your ‌iPhone‌ turned off at night by opening up the Settings app, navigating to Battery, and checking the charging status over the past 24 hours. If there's a gap, the ‌iPhone‌ was turned off for a period of time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe problem affects <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> models, but it is also impacting other devices, suggesting that it's something in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>. Not all users are experiencing the shutdown issues, nor does it appear to be happening every night.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is not yet clear what is going on, and Apple has not commented.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/11/iphone-models-turning-off-at-night/\">Some iPhone Models Mysteriously Shutting Off at Night</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/some-iphone-models-mysteriously-shutting-off-at-night.2407266/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3844b2d9fe8d980e90c0d2823e26103d4b2b4cee5d07d6373a9e11a0f3ddbec0","category":"Apple"}
