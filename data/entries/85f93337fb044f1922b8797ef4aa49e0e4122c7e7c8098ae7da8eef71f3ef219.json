The fit system is integrated into the Mips Evolve Core liner for a single layer inside the helmet. The Triad is also designed with the AirEvac ventilation system which is meant to integrate with Smith eyewear to help pull air from the helmet and keep glasses from fogging. You’ll find channels in the helmet designed to hold your glasses, which can be used with the glasses toward the front or the back of the helmet. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Smith-Triad-road-gravel-helmet-with-Aleck-crash-sensor-actual-weight-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Smith-Triad-road-gravel-helmet-with-Aleck-crash-sensor-actual-weight-2-1536x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Smith Triad road gravel helmet with Aleck crash sensor straps\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Smith-Triad-road-gravel-helmet-with-Aleck-crash-sensor-actual-weight-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Smith-Triad-road-gravel-helmet-with-Aleck-crash-sensor-actual-weight-2-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Smith-Triad-road-gravel-helmet-with-Aleck-crash-sensor-actual-weight-2-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Smith-Triad-road-gravel-helmet-with-Aleck-crash-sensor-actual-weight-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Smith-Triad-road-gravel-helmet-with-Aleck-crash-sensor-actual-weight-2-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Smith-Triad-road-gravel-helmet-with-Aleck-crash-sensor-actual-weight-2-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Smith-Triad-road-gravel-helmet-with-Aleck-crash-sensor-actual-weight-2-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The helmet includes adjustable Y-Strap dividers and Ionic+ antimicrobial padding. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Aleck CS </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Smith-Triad-road-gravel-helmet-with-Aleck-crash-sensor-actual-weight-4.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Smith-Triad-road-gravel-helmet-with-Aleck-crash-sensor-actual-weight-4-1536x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Smith Triad road gravel helmet with Aleck crash sensor\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Smith-Triad-road-gravel-helmet-with-Aleck-crash-sensor-actual-weight-4-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Smith-Triad-road-gravel-helmet-with-Aleck-crash-sensor-actual-weight-4-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Smith-Triad-road-gravel-helmet-with-Aleck-crash-sensor-actual-weight-4-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Smith-Triad-road-gravel-helmet-with-Aleck-crash-sensor-actual-weight-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Smith-Triad-road-gravel-helmet-with-Aleck-crash-sensor-actual-weight-4-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Smith-Triad-road-gravel-helmet-with-Aleck-crash-sensor-actual-weight-4-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Smith-Triad-road-gravel-helmet-with-Aleck-crash-sensor-actual-weight-4-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The dial is where you’ll find the <a href=\"https://www.aleck.io/pages/app\" target=\"_blank\">Aleck</a> CS (crash sensor), which can now be found on the Payroll, Forefront 2, Trace, and Triad. The USB-C rechargeable device detects impacts and when paired with the Aleck app, it can alert your emergency contacts and nearby Aleck users that you’ve had a crash. The helmet includes a QR code on the hang tag with instructions to download the app, but our sample didn’t have much else. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It would be great if there was more instruction provided with the sensor or in the app, as I still have some unanswered questions like how to turn off the system so it won’t alert if packed in a suitcase for travel. I found out the hard way that you need to download the app and connect the helmet <em>before</em> plugging it in to charge. If you don’t, it makes the most terrible high-pitched noise presumably to alert you that it’s not paired to the app.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Smith-Triad-road-gravel-helmet-with-Aleck-crash-sensor-actual-weight-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Smith-Triad-road-gravel-helmet-with-Aleck-crash-sensor-actual-weight-1-1536x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Smith Triad road gravel helmet with Aleck crash sensor actual weight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Smith-Triad-road-gravel-helmet-with-Aleck-crash-sensor-actual-weight-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Smith-Triad-road-gravel-helmet-with-Aleck-crash-sensor-actual-weight-1-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Smith-Triad-road-gravel-helmet-with-Aleck-crash-sensor-actual-weight-1-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Smith-Triad-road-gravel-helmet-with-Aleck-crash-sensor-actual-weight-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Smith-Triad-road-gravel-helmet-with-Aleck-crash-sensor-actual-weight-1-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Smith-Triad-road-gravel-helmet-with-Aleck-crash-sensor-actual-weight-1-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Smith-Triad-road-gravel-helmet-with-Aleck-crash-sensor-actual-weight-1-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Our medium sample with Aleck CS weighs 305g, which compared to the Triad’s claimed weight of 290g likely means the sensor adds about 15g. Overall, the weight is very competitive with similar helmets like the new <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/specialized-search-delivers-mid-priced-gravel-helmet-new-recon-1-2-3-shoes/\" target=\"_blank\">Specialized Search</a> which checked in at 316g without a sensor (the Search is $30 cheaper though). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Triad is offered in seven colors, though only the Limited Edition Matte Black/Topo version above includes the Aleck CS. Standard Triad helmets are priced at $190, while the Aleck version is $210. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Product Details</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Aleck Crash Detection Sensor sends alerts in the event of a crash.

The helmet seems like it may be on the smaller side for a medium, but I have plenty of room to wear a cycling cap underneath. I needed to adjust the position of the Y-strap divider a bit, but it was easy enough to do. Like all similar dividers, they stick out a bit more along your jaw. As seen in the photo above, the sizing sticker leaves a small silhouette on the matte finish which doesn’t seem like it can be easily removed (an alcohol wipe and cleaner did nothing). I’ll update this if I find a way to remove it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ll also update this with a more thorough first impression after wearing this on my ride into Sea Otter with Otso Cycles!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.smithoptics.com/en_US/p/helmet/triad-mips®-road-helmet/E007541O85559.html\" target=\"_blank\">smithoptics.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/smith-triad-road-gravel-xc-helmet-aleck-cs-sensor/\">New Smith Triad Road, Gravel &amp; XC Helmet Adds Another Option w/ Aleck CS Sensor</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"85f93337fb044f1922b8797ef4aa49e0e4122c7e7c8098ae7da8eef71f3ef219","category":"Cycling"}
