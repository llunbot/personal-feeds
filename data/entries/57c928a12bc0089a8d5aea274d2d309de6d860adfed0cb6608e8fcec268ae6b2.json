Nine of the patients (37.5 percent) required hospitalization.</p>\n<p>Most of the cases are in children. DSHS provided an age breakdown that listed six cases as being in infants and young children between the ages of 0 and 4. This is the age group most vulnerable to measles because they have a heightened risk of complications from the disease and may be too young to be fully vaccinated with the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine. Children are recommended to get<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/mmr/public/index.html\"> two doses of the MMR vaccine</a>, one between 12 and 15 months and the second between 4 and 6 years. One dose of MMR vaccine is estimated to be 93 percent effective against measles, while two doses are 97 percent effective.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/02/measles-outbreak-doubles-in-one-of-texas-least-vaccinated-counties/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/02/measles-outbreak-doubles-in-one-of-texas-least-vaccinated-counties/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"57c928a12bc0089a8d5aea274d2d309de6d860adfed0cb6608e8fcec268ae6b2","category":"Tech"}
