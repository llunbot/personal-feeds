They’re started by riders who wanted to do something on their own and saw a gap in the market, then took the leap to create something cool.</p><p>Reddiyo’s founders not only took a leap of faith, but they went into a category that has some steep competition. But, after using it, I’d say they’ve managed to create something both interesting and useful, particularly if your focus is more on getting stronger and faster than on just entertaining yourself on the trainer.</p><p>If you’d like to try it yourself, you can use promo code <strong>BIKERUMOR30</strong> to more than double your free trial period from 14 days to a full 30 days!

Set a goal event and date, and it tailors the plan to help you perform your best at it.</p><p>All workouts are shown as intensity charts, with key metrics like type, duration, intensity, and effort. It pairs very easily with smart trainers and heart rate straps via Bluetooth…almost too easily. I was expecting more screens and instructions, but it literally just found them and gave me one-tap pairing. Which got me on the bike and moving very quickly.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01164800/reddiyo-training-app-for-cyclists-with-ai-workout-creation.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01164800/reddiyo-training-app-for-cyclists-with-ai-workout-creation.jpg\" alt=\"reddiyo cycling training smartphone app for outside and indoor workouts\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01164800/reddiyo-training-app-for-cyclists-with-ai-workout-creation.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01164800/reddiyo-training-app-for-cyclists-with-ai-workout-creation-297x167.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01164800/reddiyo-training-app-for-cyclists-with-ai-workout-creation-800x450.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01164800/reddiyo-training-app-for-cyclists-with-ai-workout-creation-120x68.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01164800/reddiyo-training-app-for-cyclists-with-ai-workout-creation-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p>If you prefer to perform your workouts via Zwift or Rouvy, it will let you export appropriate files and load into those virtual world programs, too.</p><p>Out in the real world, you can start a workout and pair your HR, speed, cadence, and/or power meter (via Bluetooth) and have the data show up and record, with the only caveat being that it’s not a controlled environment and you should watch out for traffic and prioritize the rules of the road over an interval.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01164757/reddiyo-training-app-for-cyclists-scheduling-and-results-app-screens.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01164757/reddiyo-training-app-for-cyclists-scheduling-and-results-app-screens.jpg\" alt=\"reddiyo cycling training app screenshots showing post workout training data\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1043\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01164757/reddiyo-training-app-for-cyclists-scheduling-and-results-app-screens.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01164757/reddiyo-training-app-for-cyclists-scheduling-and-results-app-screens-297x194.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01164757/reddiyo-training-app-for-cyclists-scheduling-and-results-app-screens-800x522.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01164757/reddiyo-training-app-for-cyclists-scheduling-and-results-app-screens-120x78.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01164757/reddiyo-training-app-for-cyclists-scheduling-and-results-app-screens-768x501.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/01164757/reddiyo-training-app-for-cyclists-scheduling-and-results-app-screens-1536x1001.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>The app shows you your weekly workouts, so you can plan ahead and schedule them into your day.
