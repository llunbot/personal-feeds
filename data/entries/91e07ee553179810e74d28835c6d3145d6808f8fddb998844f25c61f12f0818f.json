{"title":"The Message That Works: the Republicans Who Know Trump Best Refuse to Endorse Him","link":"https://www.thebulwark.com/p/reich-track-wrong-track","date":1730769087000,"content":"\n<p>Bill Kristol, writing last month for The Bulwark:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Democratic polling and messaging firm Blueprint <a href=\"https://blueprint2024.com/polling/trump-closing-argument-10-16/\">recently\ntested the effectiveness</a> of several closing messages for\nthe Harris campaign. (This was before Kelly’s new remarks.) Here’s\none message the group put before voters:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Donald Trump doesn’t have the character it takes to be president.\nHe’s erratic and can’t control himself. He denied the results of\nan election just because he lost and is a threat to the\nfundamental American principle of democracy. He instigated a riot\nat the Capitol that left three police officers dead.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This general (and true) statement barely moved the needle on\nvoters’ preferences. It presumably simply sounds like a\nreiteration of things voters have heard before.</p>\n\n<p>What *did *move the needle was this message:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Nearly half of Donald Trump’s Cabinet have refused to endorse\nhim. When Trump learned during the Capitol riot that his\nsupporters were threatening to kill his own vice president, he\nsaid ‘so what?’ and refused to do anything to assure the vice\npresident was safe. Republican governors, senators, and House\nmembers have all said the same thing: We can’t give Trump another\nfour years as president.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As soon as the message turned from an abstract argument against\nTrump into an unambiguous case that <em>Trump’s own former allies\nwere making</em> against him, it became the single most persuasive\nline tested by Blueprint. It was stronger even than abortion\nrights and Social Security. In other words, hearing about Trump’s\nunfitness from people who worked with him, and from Republicans\none would expect to defend him, seems to make a difference.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/11/04/kristol-reich-track-wrong-track\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"91e07ee553179810e74d28835c6d3145d6808f8fddb998844f25c61f12f0818f","category":"Tech"}
