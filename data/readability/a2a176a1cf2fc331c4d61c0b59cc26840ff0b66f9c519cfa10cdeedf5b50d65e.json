After considerable confusion about the surprise deal – both <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2020/06/confusion-reigns-inside-and-out-over-mitchelton-scotts-new-sponsor/\" target=\"_blank\">from outside the team and within</a> – team owner Gerry Ryan <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2020/06/gerry-ryan-cancels-greenedge-deal-with-manuela-fundacion/\" target=\"_blank\">cancelled the Manuela Fundación deal</a> just days after it had been announced, later saying he <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2020/07/gerry-ryan-sheds-light-on-decision-to-call-off-manuela-fundacion-deal/\" target=\"_blank\">hadn’t been involved in organising the deal</a>. The Manuela Fundación was <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2020/06/manuela-fundacion-blindsided-by-collapse-of-greenedge-deal/\" target=\"_blank\">far from happy</a> about the way things ended up.</p><p>The architect of the deal, Mitchelton-Scott’s then-general manager <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2020/06/mitchelton-scott-boss-bannan-reportedly-out-after-manuela-fundacion-fiasco/\" target=\"_blank\">Shayne Bannan soon left the team</a>, and the Manuela Fundación offered to <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2020/06/report-manuela-fundacion-offers-e10-million-for-worldtour-license/\" target=\"_blank\">buy Mitchelton-Scott’s WorldTour license</a>. When that came to nothing, the foundation <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2020/07/the-manuela-fundacion-is-in-talks-to-invest-in-the-ccc-team/\" target=\"_blank\">looked to invest in the CCC team</a> and <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2020/07/manuela-fundacion-reportedly-looking-into-options-with-other-teams/\" target=\"_blank\">other squads</a>.</p><p>Those plans also failed to eventuate, and the Manuela Fundación soon faded back into obscurity.</p><h2>What is the Manuela Fundación?</h2><p>When Manuela Fundación was announced as new title sponsor of the Mitchelton-Scott team it was a not-for-profit that hadn’t yet started operations and that had no functioning website.</p><p>The organisation was headed up by Francisco Huertas, a Spanish car dealership and construction company owner who’d been involved in various sports sponsorships for more than a decade – several of which <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2020/06/confusion-reigns-inside-and-out-over-mitchelton-scotts-new-sponsor/\" target=\"_blank\">ended poorly</a>.</p><p>The foundation was created by Huertas and his wife, María Angustias González, and named after the couple’s daughter who passed away just two days after her birth. According to the company’s <a href=\"https://manuelafundacion.org/inicio/\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>, the foundation “aims to help build a better world” with “Granad as a world reference”. It is “a group of committed people [who] fight to achieve it, like a solidarity legion that will not stop until it is achieved, bringing happiness and hope to homes, infecting the Manuela spirit.”</p><p>The organisation has sponsored amateur racing teams since 2019. Some riders from the organisation’s U23 squad will join the Continental team when it debuts next year.</p></div></div>","author":"Matt de Neef","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"a2a176a1cf2fc331c4d61c0b59cc26840ff0b66f9c519cfa10cdeedf5b50d65e","category":"Cycling"}
