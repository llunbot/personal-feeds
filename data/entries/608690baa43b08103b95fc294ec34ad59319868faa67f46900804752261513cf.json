Much of that is down to a race route that has saved its biggest tests for last, with a final-week stage menu loaded with high mountain passes and summit finishes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Highlights include such feared names as the Mortirolo and Colle delle Finestre, but one climb the peloton will be relieved not to have to face this year is Monte Zoncolan. One of a small number of Grand Tour ascents with a legitimate claim to the title of the hardest climb in cycling, the Zoncolan is a brutal test of both mind and muscle, and in its seven Giro appearances since its first inclusion in 2003, the Zoncolan has brought some of the biggest names in the business to their knees.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1025\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/new-issue-164-5.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/new-issue-164-5.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/new-issue-164-5-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/new-issue-164-5-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/new-issue-164-5-768x513.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/new-issue-164-5-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/new-issue-164-5-1140x761.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/new-issue-164-5-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/new-issue-164-5-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/new-issue-164-5-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>But where the pros fear to tread, <em>Cyclist</em> magazine doesn’t, and our July 2025 issue – available today on the newsstands and <a href=\"https://shop.cyclist.co.uk/collections/coffee/products/issue-164\" target=\"_blank\">from the Cyclist Shop</a> – zeroes in on northeast Italy for a first-hand taste of just what makes the Zoncolan such a fearsome ascent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whoever ends up as Giro winner this Sunday, the focus will then swiftly move to cycling’s biggest race, the Tour de France, which gets underway in Lille on 5<sup>th</sup> July. The Tour is a race like no other, yet for all the great Tour champions France has produced down the years, this year marks 40 years since the last time a Frenchman topped the podium in Paris. This issue we take a closer look at why French riders have found success in their own Grand Tour so elusive, and who among the latest crop of young hopefuls has a chance of ending the drought.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/new-issue-164-2.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/new-issue-164-2.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/new-issue-164-2-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/new-issue-164-2-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/new-issue-164-2-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/new-issue-164-2-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/new-issue-164-2-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/new-issue-164-2-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/new-issue-164-2-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/new-issue-164-2-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>One man who’ll be as happy as anyone to see a new home-grown Tour winner emerge is French UCI president David Lappartient.
