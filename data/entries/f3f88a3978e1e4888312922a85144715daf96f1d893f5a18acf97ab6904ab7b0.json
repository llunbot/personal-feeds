They get a 110mm wide platform that is 109mm long front-to-back – while the overall pedal is actually 117mm long when you factor in the forward sloping edge that helps glide up over obstacles. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Small pedals are designed for 36-42 sized shoes, with a 380g weight claim. They are less than a centimeter narrower at an even 100mm wide, but a centimeter and a half shorter at 95mm long.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Canyon-alloy-MTB-Performance-Flat-Pedals_on-bike.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Canyon-alloy-MTB-Performance-Flat-Pedals_on-bike.jpg\" alt=\"Canyon alloy MTB Performance Flat Pedals\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Canyon-alloy-MTB-Performance-Flat-Pedals_on-bike.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Canyon-alloy-MTB-Performance-Flat-Pedals_on-bike-297x186.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Canyon-alloy-MTB-Performance-Flat-Pedals_on-bike-800x500.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Canyon-alloy-MTB-Performance-Flat-Pedals_on-bike-120x75.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Canyon-alloy-MTB-Performance-Flat-Pedals_on-bike-768x480.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Canyon-alloy-MTB-Performance-Flat-Pedals_on-bike-1536x960.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Both sizes of pedals are ever-so-slightly concave – 17mm thick over the outside of the axles, 16mm in the center over the axle, and 18mm thick at their leading edge. But they feel a bit more concave than that with sharp 4mm tall pins front &amp; back and shorter 3mm grub screw pins closer to the axle – 10 thread-in replaceable pins per side, per pedal. The idea is to let your foot sink into the middle for a planted feel without having to be ultra-thin sacrificing on toughness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They spin on strong 15CrMo axles, with sealed DU bushings on the inside and tiny sealed bearings on the outside. Canyon assures that they will sell service/rebuild kits, replacement pins, and longer pin kits so you will get long life out of your pedals.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Review thoughts on pedal platform size</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Canyon-alloy-MTB-Performance-Flat-Pedals_courtesy-Canyon_photo-by-Roo-Fowler_plenty-of-TorqueON-muddy-grip.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Canyon-alloy-MTB-Performance-Flat-Pedals_courtesy-Canyon_photo-by-Roo-Fowler_plenty-of-TorqueON-muddy-grip.jpg\" alt=\"Canyon alloy MTB Performance Flat Pedals, photo by Roo Fowler, muddy grip\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Canyon-alloy-MTB-Performance-Flat-Pedals_courtesy-Canyon_photo-by-Roo-Fowler_plenty-of-TorqueON-muddy-grip.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Canyon-alloy-MTB-Performance-Flat-Pedals_courtesy-Canyon_photo-by-Roo-Fowler_plenty-of-TorqueON-muddy-grip-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Canyon-alloy-MTB-Performance-Flat-Pedals_courtesy-Canyon_photo-by-Roo-Fowler_plenty-of-TorqueON-muddy-grip-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Canyon-alloy-MTB-Performance-Flat-Pedals_courtesy-Canyon_photo-by-Roo-Fowler_plenty-of-TorqueON-muddy-grip-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Canyon-alloy-MTB-Performance-Flat-Pedals_courtesy-Canyon_photo-by-Roo-Fowler_plenty-of-TorqueON-muddy-grip-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Canyon-alloy-MTB-Performance-Flat-Pedals_courtesy-Canyon_photo-by-Roo-Fowler_plenty-of-TorqueON-muddy-grip-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Canyon-alloy-MTB-Performance-Flat-Pedals_courtesy-Canyon_photo-by-Roo-Fowler_plenty-of-TorqueON-muddy-grip-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption><em>c.

So when I shift my foot just slightly while riding, I end up missing out on engaging 2 of 10 pins. I never really noticed a lack of traction – I tend to ride the more supportive Leatt shoes for more aggressive gravity &amp; eMTB rides – but with the narrower shoes, I would probably get even more secure grip from the Small size pedals. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on Canyon’s weight claims, you’ll likely save around 50g with the small pedals over the ones I’ve been riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Canyon MTB Flat Pedals – Pricing, availability &amp; options</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Canyon-alloy-MTB-Performance-Flat-Pedals_courtesy-Canyon_photo-by-Roo-Fowler_muddy-TorqueON-turn.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Canyon-alloy-MTB-Performance-Flat-Pedals_courtesy-Canyon_photo-by-Roo-Fowler_muddy-TorqueON-turn.jpg\" alt=\"Canyon alloy MTB Performance Flat Pedals, photo by Roo Fowler, greasy turns\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Canyon-alloy-MTB-Performance-Flat-Pedals_courtesy-Canyon_photo-by-Roo-Fowler_muddy-TorqueON-turn.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Canyon-alloy-MTB-Performance-Flat-Pedals_courtesy-Canyon_photo-by-Roo-Fowler_muddy-TorqueON-turn-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Canyon-alloy-MTB-Performance-Flat-Pedals_courtesy-Canyon_photo-by-Roo-Fowler_muddy-TorqueON-turn-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Canyon-alloy-MTB-Performance-Flat-Pedals_courtesy-Canyon_photo-by-Roo-Fowler_muddy-TorqueON-turn-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Canyon-alloy-MTB-Performance-Flat-Pedals_courtesy-Canyon_photo-by-Roo-Fowler_muddy-TorqueON-turn-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Canyon-alloy-MTB-Performance-Flat-Pedals_courtesy-Canyon_photo-by-Roo-Fowler_muddy-TorqueON-turn-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Canyon-alloy-MTB-Performance-Flat-Pedals_courtesy-Canyon_photo-by-Roo-Fowler_muddy-TorqueON-turn-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption><em>c.
