And today’s deal may be all you’ll ever need: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09PGZHCXR/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Amazon is selling the Anker 321 Power Strip with three AC outlets, and three USB ports for just $15</a>, a savings of $11 off Anker’s MSRP and the best price we’ve ever seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This power strip is actually a power cube, with four sides of power: three sides have AC outlets for a MacBook and the fourth has two USB-S ports and one USB-C port for iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches, and AirPods. When used with a single device, the USB-C port will deliver 20W of power but will share 15W when charging two devices, still plenty of juice to quickly fill up when you’re in the red.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Anker 321 Power Strip has a compact 2.5-inch square design that can fit just about anywhere on or under a desk and its 5-foot cable with a low-profile 45-degree plug can sneak behind tables and desks. And it’s super portable as well to take on a trip or to the office.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re big fans of Anker’s charging accessories and definitely recommend grabbing this before the limited time deal disappears.</p>\n\niPhone, Mac</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"800f2712def264eb30ae26d8a4755e343b278d012252b0feed887930181c227d","category":"Apple"}
