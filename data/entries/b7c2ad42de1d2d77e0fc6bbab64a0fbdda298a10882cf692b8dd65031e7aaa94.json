{"title":"Introducing Amazon GuardDuty Extended Threat Detection: AI/ML attack sequence identification for enhanced cloud security","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-amazon-guardduty-extended-threat-detection-aiml-attack-sequence-identification-for-enhanced-cloud-security/","date":1733110193000,"content":"<p>Today, I’m happy to introduce advanced AI/ML threat detection capabilities in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/\">Amazon GuardDuty</a>. This new feature uses the extensive cloud visibility and scale of AWS to provide improved threat detection for your applications, workloads, and data. GuardDuty Extended Threat Detection employs sophisticated AI/ML to identify both known and previously unknown attack sequences, offering a more comprehensive and proactive approach to cloud security. This enhancement addresses the growing complexity of modern cloud environments and the evolving landscape of security threats, simplifying threat detection and response.</p> \n<p>Many organizations face challenges in efficiently analyzing and responding to the high volume of security events generated across their cloud environments. With the increasing frequency and sophistication of security threats, it has become more challenging to effectively detect and respond to attacks that occur as sequences of events over time. Security teams often struggle to piece together related activities that might be part of a larger attack, potentially missing critical threats or responding too late to prevent significant impact.</p> \n<p>To address these challenges, we have expanded GuardDuty threat detection capabilities to include new AI/ML capabilities that correlate security signals to identify active attack sequences in your AWS environment. These sequences can include multiple steps taken by an adversary, such as privilege discovery, API manipulation, persistence activities, and data exfiltration. These detections are represented as attack sequence findings, a new type of GuardDuty finding with critical severity. Previously, GuardDuty had never used critical severity, reserving this level for findings with the utmost confidence and urgency. These new findings introduce critical severity and include a natural language summary of the threat’s nature and significance, observed activities mapped to tactics and techniques from the MITRE ATT&amp;CK® framework, and prescriptive remediation recommendations based on AWS best practices.</p> \n<p>GuardDuty Extended Threat Detection introduces new attack sequence findings and improves actionability for existing detections in areas such as credential exfiltration, privilege escalation, and data exfiltration. This enhancement enables GuardDuty to offer composite detections that span multiple data sources, time periods, and resources within an account, providing you with a more comprehensive understanding of sophisticated cloud attacks.</p> \n<p>Let me show you how the new capabilities work.</p> \n<p><span><strong>How to use the new AI/ML threat detection in Amazon GuardDuty<br /> </strong></span>To experience the new AI/ML threat detection in GuardDuty, go to the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/home?#/summary\">Amazon GuardDuty console</a> and explore the new widgets on the <strong>Summary</strong> page. The overview widget now helps you view the number of attack sequences you have and consider the details of those attack sequences. Cloud environment findings often reveal multistage attacks, but these sophisticated attack sequences are low volume and account for a small fraction of the total number of findings. For this particular account, you can observe a variety of findings in the cloud environment, but only a handful of actual attack sequences. In a larger cloud environment, you may see hundreds or even thousands of findings, yet the number of attack sequences will likely remain relatively small in comparison.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/16/01c-AWSNEWS-2083.png\"><img src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/16/01c-AWSNEWS-2083.png\" width=\"1603\" height=\"1940\" /></a></p> \n<p>We’ve also added a new widget that helps you view the findings broken down by severity. This makes it easier to quickly pivot into and investigate specific findings that are of interest to you. The findings are now sorted by <strong>Severity</strong>, providing you with a clear overview of the most critical issues, including an additional <strong>Critical</strong> severity category, ensuring that the most urgent detections are immediately brought to your attention. You can also filter just for the attack sequences by choosing <strong>Top attack sequences only</strong>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/16/02a-AWSNEWS-2083.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/16/02a-AWSNEWS-2083.png\" width=\"794\" height=\"705\" /></a></p> \n<p>This new capability is enabled by default, so you don’t need to take any additional steps for it to start working. There are no extra costs for this feature beyond the underlying charges for GuardDuty and its associated protection plans. As you enable additional GuardDuty protection plans, this capability will provide more integrated security value, helping you gain deeper insights.</p> \n<p>You can observe two types of findings. The first one is data compromise, which indicates a potential data compromise that can be a part of a larger ransomware attack. Data is the most critical organizational asset for most customers, making this an important area of concern. The second finding is compromised credential type, which helps you detect the misuse of compromised credentials, typically during the earlier stages of an attack in your cloud environment.</p> \n<p>Let me dive into one of the compromise data findings. I’ll focus on “Potential data compromise of one or more S3 buckets involving a sequence of actions over multiple signals associated with a user in your account”. This finding indicates that we have observed data being compromised across multiple <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/\">Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)</a> buckets with multiple associated signals.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/16/03-AWSNEWS-2083.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/16/03-AWSNEWS-2083.png\" width=\"1622\" height=\"844\" /></a></p> \n<p>The summary provided with this finding gives you key details, including the specific user (identified by their principal ID) who performed the actions, the account and resources affected, and the extended time period (nearly a full day) over which the activity occurred. This information can help you quickly understand the scope and severity of the potential compromise.</p> \n<p>This finding has eight distinct signals observed over a nearly 24-hour period, indicating the use of multiple tactics and techniques mapped to the MITRE ATT&amp;CK® framework. This broad coverage across the attack chain—from credential access, to discovery, evasion, persistence, and even impact and exfiltration—suggests this may indeed be a true positive incident. The finding also surfaces a concerning technique of data destruction, which is particularly alarming.</p> \n<p>Additionally, GuardDuty provides further security context by highlighting sensitive API calls, such as the user deleting the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/\">AWS CloudTrail</a> trail. This type of evasive behavior, combined with the creation of new access keys and actions targeting Amazon S3 objects, further reinforces the severity and potential scope of the incident. Based on the information presented in this finding, you would likely want to investigate this incident more thoroughly.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/16/04-AWSNEWS-2083.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/16/04-AWSNEWS-2083.png\" width=\"664\" height=\"372\" /></a></p> \n<p>Reviewing the<strong> ATT&amp;CK tactics</strong> associated with the findings provides visibility into the specific tactics involved, whether it’s a single tactic or multiple. GuardDuty also offers security indicators that explain why the activity was flagged as suspicious and assigned a critical severity, including the high-risk APIs called and the tactics observed.</p> \n<p>Diving deeper, you can view details about the actor responsible. The information includes how the user connected to and carried out these actions, including the network locations. This additional context helps you better understand the full scope and nature of the incident, which is crucial for investigation and response. You can follow prescriptive remediation recommendations based on AWS best practices, offering you actionable insights to swiftly address and resolve identified detections. These tailored recommendations help you improve your cloud security posture and ensure alignment with security guidelines.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/16/06-AWSNEWS-2083.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/16/06-AWSNEWS-2083.png\" width=\"1000\" height=\"963\" /></a></p> \n<p>The <strong>Signals</strong> tab can be sorted by newest or oldest first. If responding to an active attack, you’ll want to start with the latest signals to quickly understand and mitigate the situation. For a post-incident review, you can trace back from the initial activities. Diving into each activity provides detailed information about the specific finding. We also offer a quick view through <strong>Indicators</strong>, <strong>Actors</strong>, and <strong>Endpoints</strong> to summarize what occurred and who took action.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/16/07-AWSNEWS-2083.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/16/07-AWSNEWS-2083.png\" width=\"947\" height=\"863\" /></a></p> \n<p>Another way to follow the details is to access the <strong>Resources</strong> tab, where you can check the different buckets that are involved and the access keys. For each resource, you can check which tactics and techniques happened. Select the open resource to pivot directly to the relevant console and learn more details.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/16/08-AWSNEWS-2083.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/16/08-AWSNEWS-2083.png\" width=\"948\" height=\"886\" /></a></p> \n<p>We’ve introduced a full-page view for GuardDuty findings, making it easier to see all the contextual data in one place. However, the traditional findings page with the side panel is still available if you prefer that layout, which provides a quick view of the details for specific findings.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/16/09-AWSNEWS-2083.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/16/09-AWSNEWS-2083.png\" width=\"1625\" height=\"887\" /></a></p> \n<p>GuardDuty Extended Threat Detection is automatically enabled for all GuardDuty accounts in a Region, leveraging foundational data sources without requiring additional protection plans. Enabling additional protection plans expands the range of security signals analyzed, improving the service’s ability to identify complex attack sequences. GuardDuty specifically recommends activating <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/s3-protection.html\">S3 Protection</a> to detect potential data compromises in Amazon S3 buckets.
