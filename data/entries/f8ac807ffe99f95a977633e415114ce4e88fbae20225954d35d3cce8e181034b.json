Experts expect the third top insulin maker in the US, Sanofi, will follow suit.</p>\n<p>The price cuts come after years of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/11/musks-twitter-chaos-tosses-outrageous-insulin-pricing-into-the-spotlight/\">escalating public backlash</a> to the companies' steep price hikes on insulin, which many advocates have described as price gouging. An analysis from 2018 found that insulin list prices were set five- to ten-times higher in the US than in other high-income countries, with average standardized units of insulin going for nearly $100. The cost of producing the products, even the newer insulins, generally falls under $10.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/novo-nordisk-to-lower-us-prices-of-several-pre-filled-insulin-pens-and-vials-up-to-75-for-people-living-with-diabetes-in-january-2024-301771409.html\">In its announcement Tuesday</a>, Novo Nordisk said that it will cut the prices of several products, including Levemir, Novolin, NovoLog, and NovoLog Mix 70/30. With the 75 percent cut, a 10mL vial of NovoLog will drop from <a href=\"https://www.novopricing.com/novolog.html\">$289.36</a> to $72.34. A NovoLog Mix 70/30 FlexPen will drop from $558.83 to $139.71.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1924105#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1924105&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f8ac807ffe99f95a977633e415114ce4e88fbae20225954d35d3cce8e181034b","category":"Tech"}
