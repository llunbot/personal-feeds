With that, the app was infected with code that caused 100 million infected devices to connect to attacker-controlled servers and download secret payloads.</p>\n<p>Now, history is repeating itself. Researchers from the same Moscow, Russia-based security firm <a href=\"https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/necro-infects-android-users/52201/\">reported Monday</a> that they found two new apps, downloaded from Play 11 million times, that were infected with the same malware family. The researchers, from Kaspersky, believe a malicious software developer kit for integrating advertising capabilities is once again responsible.</p>\n<h2>Clever tradecraft</h2>\n<p>Software developer kits, better known as SDKs, are apps that provide developers with frameworks that can greatly speed up the app-creation process by streamlining repetitive tasks. An unverified SDK module incorporated into the apps ostensibly supported the display of ads. Behind the scenes, it provided a host of advanced methods for stealthy communication with malicious servers, where the apps would upload user data and download malicious code that could be executed and updated at any time.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051854#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051854&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"78931ca37f94f3b235b1872f40928ba390e6d175836db1ba83fddbc81686e59e","category":"Tech"}
