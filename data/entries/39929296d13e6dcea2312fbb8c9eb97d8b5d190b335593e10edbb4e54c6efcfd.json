Alluding to the RCS protocol, Lockheimer goes on to state there is a \"Really Clear Solution\" and that he is offering an \"open invitation to the folks who can make this right,\" with the \"folks\" in question being a reference to Apple.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nGoogle has been rolling out RCS for the past several years, and in July, all three major carriers in the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/20/major-carriers-android-adopt-rcs/\">pledged to adopt RCS</a>, which, compared to SMS, offers support for higher quality photos and videos, audio messages, improved security, and better group chats. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWith RCS, Android to Android messaging communication will become fully end-to-end encrypted. In contrast, Android to ‌iPhone‌ communication often referred to as the \"green bubble,\" will be less secure due to Apple's unwillingness to adopt RCS.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/\">Google</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/android/\">Android</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/\">RCS</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/08/google-executive-android-iphone-users-texting/\">Google Executive Wants to Help Apple Make Texts Between Android and iPhone Users More Secure</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-executive-wants-to-help-apple-make-texts-between-android-and-iphone-users-more-secure.2315962/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=oUnC0PmatYM:knNn1jTeCko:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=oUnC0PmatYM:knNn1jTeCko:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/oUnC0PmatYM\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"39929296d13e6dcea2312fbb8c9eb97d8b5d190b335593e10edbb4e54c6efcfd","category":"Apple"}
