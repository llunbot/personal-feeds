A bike, they say, is made for expedition and the “maximum cargo” that entails.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know the headline for this new piece was pretty funny. However, the truth is that the original version of the Around The Outside (ATO) was, actually inspired by the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/HCBN7lyLT4w?si=YtsWVH5B68w8yqIS\" target=\"_blank\">popular 80s hit</a> by Malcolm McLaren. I’m not sure if that’s cool or not… that song was kinda dumb. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pearson Around The Outside titanium adventure gravel bike</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pearson-Bikes-Around-the-Outside-gravel-bike-font-side.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"770\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pearson-Bikes-Around-the-Outside-gravel-bike-font-side.jpeg\" alt=\"Pearson Bikes Around the Outside gravel bike font side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pearson-Bikes-Around-the-Outside-gravel-bike-font-side.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pearson-Bikes-Around-the-Outside-gravel-bike-font-side-297x286.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pearson-Bikes-Around-the-Outside-gravel-bike-font-side-120x116.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pearson-Bikes-Around-the-Outside-gravel-bike-font-side-768x739.jpeg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Pearson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, the first version of Pearson’s ATO was also dedicated to “maximum cargo”. But, this newly updated ATO offers the same cargo capacity with a geometry created by Pearson House Design to guarantee the rider the “‘”most sustainable” riding position. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though the bike has a sleek roadie-type aesthetic, the ATO is “every bit as capable as a modern mountain bike”. It can be run as a 1x with a maximum clearance for a 42t chainring. It’s equipped with internal routing and a plethora of mounting bosses. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pearson-Bikes-Around-the-Outside-gravel-bike-rear-side.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"816\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pearson-Bikes-Around-the-Outside-gravel-bike-rear-side.jpeg\" alt=\"Pearson Bikes Around the Outside gravel bike rear side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pearson-Bikes-Around-the-Outside-gravel-bike-rear-side.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pearson-Bikes-Around-the-Outside-gravel-bike-rear-side-294x300.jpeg 294w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pearson-Bikes-Around-the-Outside-gravel-bike-rear-side-118x120.jpeg 118w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pearson-Bikes-Around-the-Outside-gravel-bike-rear-side-768x783.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For the frame’s construction, Pearson uses high-spec titanium as a lifetime material that provides the shock-absorbing qualities of steel and a better weight-to-strength ratio than carbon. The ATO features high-quality 3AL 2.5V (Grade 9) hand-drawn tubes to combine strength with agility. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pearson says the curved downtube allows “for extra clearance for both the front wheel and luggage, as well as larger tire sizes”. The ATO sports enough clearance for 29×2.2″ or 27.5×2.3 (650bx60mm) tires.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pearson-Bikes-Around-the-Outside-gravel-bikefront-straight-on.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"715\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pearson-Bikes-Around-the-Outside-gravel-bikefront-straight-on.jpeg\" alt=\"Pearson Bikes Around the Outside gravel bike front straight on\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pearson-Bikes-Around-the-Outside-gravel-bikefront-straight-on.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pearson-Bikes-Around-the-Outside-gravel-bikefront-straight-on-297x265.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pearson-Bikes-Around-the-Outside-gravel-bikefront-straight-on-120x107.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pearson-Bikes-Around-the-Outside-gravel-bikefront-straight-on-768x686.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pearson-Bikes-Around-the-Outside-gravel-bike-rear-straight-on.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"715\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pearson-Bikes-Around-the-Outside-gravel-bike-rear-straight-on.jpeg\" alt=\"Pearson Bikes Around the Outside gravel bike rear straight on\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pearson-Bikes-Around-the-Outside-gravel-bike-rear-straight-on.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pearson-Bikes-Around-the-Outside-gravel-bike-rear-straight-on-297x265.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pearson-Bikes-Around-the-Outside-gravel-bike-rear-straight-on-120x107.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pearson-Bikes-Around-the-Outside-gravel-bike-rear-straight-on-768x686.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can get the ATO with a rigid carbon fork and drop bars or with flat bars and a short travel (40mm) FOX front suspension fork. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It even has routing for a dropper post and dynamo lighting, plus routing for a USB top cap port (nice).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pearson-Bikes-Around-the-Outside-gravel-bike-front-fork.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"1199\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pearson-Bikes-Around-the-Outside-gravel-bike-front-fork.jpeg\" alt=\"Pearson Bikes Around the Outside gravel bike front fork\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pearson-Bikes-Around-the-Outside-gravel-bike-front-fork.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pearson-Bikes-Around-the-Outside-gravel-bike-front-fork-200x300.jpeg 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pearson-Bikes-Around-the-Outside-gravel-bike-front-fork-80x120.jpeg 80w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Pearson-Bikes-Around-the-Outside-gravel-bike-front-fork-768x1151.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The carbon fork offers adaptable cage mounting points and interchangeable dropouts for a 50 or 58mm offset.
