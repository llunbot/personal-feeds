After an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/831417/apple-september-iphone-event-date-time.html\">Apple event on September 12 or 13,</a> Apple is expected to begin shipping the iPhone 15 on September 22, which means the iPhone 15 Pro Max/Ultra might not arrive until October 20. It’s not clear whether Apple will take preorders for all of the models at the same time (likely September 15).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It wouldn’t be the first time Apple delayed certain iPhone models. Last year, the iPhone 14 Plus didn’t arrive until October 7, three weeks after the other models launched, and in 2021, and in 2020, the iPhone 12 mini and Pro Max arrived on November 6, three weeks after the iPhone 12.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>9to5Mac says the delay is due to “image sensor readiness” from Sony. The iPhone 15 Pro Max/Ultra will reportedly have an exclusive periscope zoom lens that brings a big leap in zoom performance.
