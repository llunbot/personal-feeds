AT&amp;T says the Turbo add-on, <a href=\"https://about.att.com/story/2024/turbo.html\">available starting today</a>, is \"built to support high-performance mobile applications, like gaming, social video broadcasting and live video conferencing, with optimized data while customers are on the go.\"</p>\n<p>While Turbo \"boosts all the high-speed and hotspot data on a user's connection,\" AT&amp;T said the difference will be more noticeable for certain kinds of applications. For example, gaming applications using Turbo will experience \"less freezing or stuttering and lower latency,\" AT&amp;T said.</p>\n<p>The $7 charge is for each line. Adding Turbo to multiple lines on the same account requires paying the extra fee for each line. <a href=\"https://www.att.com/plans/att-turbo?cjevent=02f51e0f08be11ef839c018f0a82b821&amp;source=EC1NAT10600aff12A&amp;wtExtndSource=100017430\">AT&amp;T said</a> that Turbo lets users \"optimize their plan's high-speed (premium) and hotspot data allotments\" and provides better data performance \"even during busy times on the network.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021487#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021487&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3a3e0821b438bf5190030528890df571a0d69798a617b9067e39593d7326d164","category":"Tech"}
