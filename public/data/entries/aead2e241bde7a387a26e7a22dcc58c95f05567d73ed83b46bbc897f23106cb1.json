We are confirming the situation.\"</p>\n<p>The Japanese space agency, in concert with the rocket's manufacturer, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, has spent about $1.5 billion developing the H3 rocket over the last decade. Much of the challenge in building the new rocket involved development of a new LE-9 engine, which is fueled by liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, to power the first stage. This appeared to perform flawlessly. The second-stage engine that failed, the LE-5B, was a more established engine.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1922201#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1922201&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"aead2e241bde7a387a26e7a22dcc58c95f05567d73ed83b46bbc897f23106cb1","category":"Tech"}
