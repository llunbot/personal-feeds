Apple seeded the third betas of iOS 17.6 and iPadOS 17.6 to developers earlier this week. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iOS-17.6-Feature-Redux.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nPublic beta testers can get the beta by opening up the Settings app, going to the Software Update section, tapping on the \"Beta Updates\" option, and toggling on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a> Public Beta. Signing up on Apple's beta testing website is required.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new features that Apple announced for ‌iOS 17‌ have all been implemented at this point, so it is not clear what will be included in iOS 17.6, and no features have been discovered in the developer betas so far. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith Apple now shifting its focus to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, it is likely that iOS 17.6 will include bug fixes and other under-the-hood improvements rather than outward-facing features. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has also seeded the second public betas of upcoming watchOS 10.6 and tvOS 17.6 updates. <div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242\">iPadOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/10/apple-releases-ios-17-6-public-beta-3/\">Apple Releases Third Public Beta of iOS 17.6</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-third-public-beta-of-ios-17-6.2431079/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"caa63cd989589cdb66503dd0aa22c30fd1278f8b67e79929a950aed67abce1d2","category":"Apple"}
