They have a slightly new look with a shorter stem and a refined fit, but the real magic is on the inside. For the first time, Apple’s mid-range earbuds have active noise cancellation, which will block out outside noise so you only hear the music. You’ll also get an H2 chip for Voice Isolation, Conversation Awareness, and Siri gestures, as well as improved audio quality, better battery life, and dust, sweat, and water resistance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2463401/airpods-4-with-anc-review.html\">4.5-star review</a>, we praised the AirPods 4 with ANC’s value and features, as well as the “clarity and volume” when listening to music and podcasts, as well as the long battery life. In short, they’re fantastic earbuds and a good option for people who prefer the open-ear design over the AirPods Pro’s tight silicon seal. SO go grab a pair now before the price goes back up.</p>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2547864/the-new-airpods-4-with-anc-are-25-cheaper-now-than-black-friday.html\" target=\"_blank\">Get AirPods 4 with ANC for $139</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"ee1776a5dc9d26e541725825979188231cfc585bcae6e9517ba925fd643f2d1c","category":"Apple"}
