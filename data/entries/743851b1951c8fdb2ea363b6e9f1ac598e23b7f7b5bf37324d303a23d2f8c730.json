Outside of the big players like Michelin, Maxxis, and Continental, we’ve seen the likes of Pirelli and Goodyear launch whole ranges of tires. </span><a href=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/2018/04/goodyear-bicycle-tires/\"><span>Goodyear launched with a bang in early 2018</span></a><span>, and now they’re introducing four new road tires to supplement their existing lineup.</span></p>\n<p><span>All four of these tires – The Eagle F1 SuperSport R, Eagle F1 R, Vector Sport, and Eagle – fall into Goodyear’s Ultra High-Performance (UHP) and High-Performance (HP) road tire lineups. Just about every tire comes with a 30mm wide option, with many coming with up to a 700c x 34mm tire for a small but vocal market of folks who want the speed of a road tire but some additional comfort.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/2023/03/pro-bike-check-tom-pidcocks-training-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">Tom Pidcock’s Training Bike</a></p>\n<h2><strong>Goodyear Eagle F1 Supersport R</strong></h2>\n<p><span>Goodyear has positioned the Eagle F1 SuperSport R as their race-day tire. They do so by using a 150 TPI (Threads Per Inch) casing, which is among the highest Goodyear uses. This is paired with their UHP tire compound which they say is their lowest rolling resistance option that still offers good grip. These changes result in a tire that Goodyear claims is up to 31.9 percent faster in rolling resistance than the existing Eagle F1 tire at 60 PSI, and 36 percent faster at 100 PSI.</span></p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Goodyear-Eagle-F1-SSR-TC-1340x770.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"Goodyear Eagle F1 Super Sport R tire\" width=\"1340\" height=\"770\" /><figcaption><span>The Eagle F1 SuperSport R is a mouthful of a name, but the grip Goodyear promises to keep you feeling relaxed.</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p><span>Interestingly, this tire doesn’t claim to be just “tubeless-ready.” In fact, Goodyear has tubeless-ready tires alongside a new system they’re calling Tubeless-Complete. This consists of a ‘dual-angle bead’ that claims to provide a more air-tight seal against rims and ensures compatibility with both hooked and hookless rims. Paired with a tighter casing, Goodyear also promises better air retention after installation.</span></p>\n<p><span>The Goodyear Eagle F1 Supersport R is available in 700c x 25 mm, 700c x 28 mm, and 700c x 30 mm sizes. A tube-only F1 SuperSport R tire comes in at just 190g in 700c x 25mm width, while a Tubeless Complete option comes in at 235 grams in the same size.</span></p>\n<p>Price, clincher tube-type: $70 / £60 / €65</p>\n<p>Price, Tubeless Complete: $80 / £66 / €70</p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Goodyear-Eagle-F1-SSR-TC-colors-1340x536.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"Goodyear Eagle F1 SuperSp\" width=\"1340\" height=\"536\" /><figcaption><span>Eagle F1 SuperSport R tires in transparent (tan) or black sidewalls.</span></figcaption></figure>\n<h2><strong>Goodyear Eagle F1 R</strong></h2>\n<p><span>The Eagle F1 R is the American company’s new high-performance road tire for racing and enthusiasts alike. It features a more robust 120 TPI casing with the same UHP rubber compound. Goodyear promises performance improvements as well: 13 to 17 percent faster between 60 and 100 PSI, and 8 percent lighter than the original Eagle F1 tubeless tire.</span></p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Goodyear-Eagle-F1R-TC-1340x752.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"Goodyear Eagle F1 R tire\" width=\"1340\" height=\"752\" /><figcaption><span>The Goodyear Eagle F1 R tire is the American tire company’s option against the likes of the mighty Continental Grand Prix 5000 S TR.</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p><span>Eagle F1 R is still designed to be a top-rated road tire, only designed with the idea that folks might train or go on group rides with these tires. As such, Goodyear offers the tire in both their Tubeless-Complete and tube-only tire profiles.</span></p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Goodyear-Eagle-F1R-TC-colors-1340x536.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"Eagle F1 tires in transparent and black sidewalls.\" width=\"1340\" height=\"536\" /><figcaption><span>Eagle F1 SuperSport R tires in transparent (tan) or black sidewalls.</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p><span>The Goodyear Eagle F1 R has a size for just about every road bike fan. 700c x 34 mm is an uncommon option, but there are tires from 32 mm to 25 mm widths. A tube-only F1 SuperSport R tire comes in at just 205 grams in 700c x 25 mm width, while a Tubeless Complete option comes in at 280 grams in the same size.</span></p>\n<p>Price, clincher tube-type: $70 / £60 / €65</p>\n<p>Price, tubeless ready: $80 / £66 / €70</p>\n<h2><strong>Goodyear Eagle</strong></h2>\n<p><span>The Goodyear Eagle uses the company’s standard HP tire compound, which is said to offer more multi-condition grip and longer-term durability. It uses a more standard 60 TPI casing, which should mean it is more resistant to cuts. </span></p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Goodyear-Eagle-TR-1340x770.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"Goodyear Eagle F1 tire\" width=\"1340\" height=\"770\" /><figcaption><span>The Eagle F1 tire looks to be a solid mid-range tire, particularly in the tubeless-ready configuration.</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p><span>The Eagle tire comes in a tube-type clincher option or a tubeless-ready option. Both tires are available in 25 mm to 32 mm sizes, as well as black or transparent sidewall options. A 700c x 25 mm option in the clincher casing to weigh in at 240 grams, or 280 grams for a tubeless casing.</span></p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Goodyear-Eagle-TR-colors-1340x536.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"Goodyear Eagle tubeless tires combinations\" width=\"1340\" height=\"536\" /><figcaption><span>Eagle tires in transparent (tan) or black sidewalls.</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p>Price, clincher tube-type: $55 / £45 / €50</p>\n<p>Price, tubeless ready: $62 / £50 / €55</p>\n<h2><strong>Goodyear Vector Sport</strong></h2>\n<p><span>Think of the Vector as the endurance tire option of the bunch, a good training tire that can be swapped for the likes of an Eagle F1 SuperSport R when your special day of riding comes around. Goodyear has installed an anti-puncture belt alongside that 60 TPI casing.</span></p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Goodyear-Vector-Sport-TR-1340x947.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"Goodyear Vector Sport TR tire\" width=\"1340\" height=\"947\" /><figcaption><span>Want a tire that’s more puncture-resistant and long-wearing? Goodyear offers their Vector Sport tire.</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p><span>The Goodyear Vector Sport tire comes in tubeless-ready or clincher-specific casings, ranging from 700c x 25 mm to 700c x 32 mm widths. </span></p>\n<p>Price, clincher tube-type: $57 / £48 / €53</p>\n<p>Price, Tubeless Complete: $65 / £53 / €58</p>\n<p>There are plenty of tire options to see here, but from first impressions, the most interesting thing we’re seeing is a high-end road tire with the option for a 34 mm width. There are few tires with that measurement around and fewer that promise the ride quality and performance of the Eagle F1 R tires. That, paired with somewhat-affordable tubeless tire options should make it easier to adopt tubeless tires.</p>\n<p><span>More information can be found at </span><a href=\"http://goodyearbike.com\"><span>goodyearbike.com</span></a>.</p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Goodyear-eaglef1rollingresistance-1340x949.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"Goodyear Eagle tire differences\" width=\"1340\" height=\"949\" /><figcaption><span>Goodyear has not provided comparative data versus other popular tires, but the Eagle F1 series tires look to be faster and gripper than the previous Eagle F1 tires.</span></figcaption></figure>\n<p> </p>","author":"Alvin Holbrook","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"743851b1951c8fdb2ea363b6e9f1ac598e23b7f7b5bf37324d303a23d2f8c730","category":"Cycling"}
