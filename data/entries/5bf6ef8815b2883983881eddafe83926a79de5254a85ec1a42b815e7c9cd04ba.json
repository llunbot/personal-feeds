It was a banner year for cycling, racing especially. The Olympic years are always good for new tech and outrageous pricing in the cycling world. All the fans cross their fingers and hope that new tech leads to a victory for their favorite rider (Victor Koretzky over here). While others sit back and wait till the latest and greatest trickles down to a palatable price.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Jordan-Villella-Cycle-smart--jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1284\" height=\"867\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Jordan-Villella-Cycle-smart--jpg.webp\" alt=\"Jordan Villella Cycle smart \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Jordan-Villella-Cycle-smart--jpg.webp 1284w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Jordan-Villella-Cycle-smart--297x201.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Jordan-Villella-Cycle-smart--120x81.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Jordan-Villella-Cycle-smart--768x519.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo: Janice Checchio )</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With all the racing, tire companies out-sizing each other, and the rise of the robots (in our shifting only, hopefully), 2024 was one heck of a year as a cycling fan. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>About Jordan Villella</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/PRESSCAMP-BLACKBIRD-2024-©-Hutchinson92-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/PRESSCAMP-BLACKBIRD-2024-©-Hutchinson92-scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/PRESSCAMP-BLACKBIRD-2024-©-Hutchinson92-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/PRESSCAMP-BLACKBIRD-2024-©-Hutchinson92-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/PRESSCAMP-BLACKBIRD-2024-©-Hutchinson92-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/PRESSCAMP-BLACKBIRD-2024-©-Hutchinson92-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/PRESSCAMP-BLACKBIRD-2024-©-Hutchinson92-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/PRESSCAMP-BLACKBIRD-2024-©-Hutchinson92-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/PRESSCAMP-BLACKBIRD-2024-©-Hutchinson92-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/PRESSCAMP-BLACKBIRD-2024-©-Hutchinson92-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“Hi, I’m Jordan!”</em> I’m Racing Tech Editor at Bikerumor.com. I’m the one who is voted most likely to wear a skin suit in the group ride, can talk for hours about pre/during/post ride nutrition and loves a good CRR graph.

It’s one that I’m proud to be a part of and that I cherish with every outing. So, no matter how many gears you have, what kit you’re wearing, or your ride goals, watch out for each other. On the road and in the forests, we’re all we have. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Enduro-Stone-Soup-90-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Enduro-Stone-Soup-90-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Enduro Stone Soup 90\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Enduro-Stone-Soup-90-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Enduro-Stone-Soup-90-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Enduro-Stone-Soup-90-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Enduro-Stone-Soup-90-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Enduro-Stone-Soup-90-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Enduro-Stone-Soup-90-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2024-Enduro-Stone-Soup-90-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>I wish you all a happy and safe New Year filled with no bonks, fewer flats, and lots of great coffee — Now, onto the gear! </em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Event of the Year: Iron Maiden – Future Past Tour </h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_0650-scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"2560\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_0650-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Jordan and Nino\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_0650-scaled.webp 1920w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_0650-225x300.webp 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_0650-1536x2048.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_0650-90x120.webp 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_0650-768x1024.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_0650-1152x1536.webp 1152w\" /></a><figcaption>(<em>I’m running free, yeah, I’m running free)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you asked me the best event I attended this year, unfortunately, it wasn’t bike-related. It was taking my son to see Iron Maiden on the Future Past Tour. Heavy metal, punk, and the live music scene are a large part of my life. Taking my oldest to see a live show of one of the greatest to take the stage was a bucket list moment for me. It was also one of the few last shows Nicko McBrain would play live with the band, and that made it extra special after the fact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>My son’s favorite part of the night? </strong></em>Seeing Bruce Dickinson fight Eddie. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>My favorite part of the night? </strong></em>I looked over and saw my son’s eyes huge with excitement as the band took the stage, his first big concert, and it was a classic.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Best BIKE Event: ENVE Grodeo </h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4896-scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"2560\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4896-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Enve factory\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4896-scaled.webp 1920w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4896-225x300.webp 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4896-1536x2048.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4896-90x120.webp 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4896-768x1024.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4896-1152x1536.webp 1152w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who don’t know, the ENVE Grodeo is a gravel ride from the ENVE HQ in Ogden, UT, and covers nearly every fun terrain you’d want to ride a bike on. The ride is fun, with enough challenging sections and technical bits to keep the seasoned pro honest. But with rest stops enticing enough to make you actually get off your bike and interact with the people around you. My favorite was the axe-throwing rest stop… that was awesome. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4863-scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4863-1536x1152.webp\" alt=\"Enve factory tour\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4863-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4863-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4863-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4863-768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4863-2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4838-scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"2048\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4838-1536x2048.webp\" alt=\"Enve factory tour wheels\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4838-1536x2048.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4838-225x300.webp 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4838-90x120.webp 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4838-768x1024.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4838-1152x1536.webp 1152w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4838-scaled.webp 1920w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_5019-scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_5019-1536x1152.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_5019-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_5019-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_5019-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_5019-768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_5019-2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The best part was ending the ride at the ENVE HQ and getting a tour of the carbon room and creation process. No, it wasn’t because “I was with the press.” Everyone who attended the ride was given a tour. It was nice to see the people you were ripping down mountainsides with, giving tours of their workstations and wheel-building processes. For those looking for a ride that’s out of a usual mix of events, the ENVE Grodeo is a must-attend. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Road Bike Editor’s Choice: Sage Skyline </h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sage-Titanium-Skyline-Full-side--scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sage-Titanium-Skyline-Full-side--scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Sage Titanium Skyline Full side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sage-Titanium-Skyline-Full-side--scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sage-Titanium-Skyline-Full-side--297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sage-Titanium-Skyline-Full-side--1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sage-Titanium-Skyline-Full-side--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sage-Titanium-Skyline-Full-side--768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sage-Titanium-Skyline-Full-side--2048x1536.jpeg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t get to ride titanium bikes often, I usually get carbon aero-race gear. That’s great, don’t get me wrong, but when the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/sage-titanium-skyline-could-be-the-last-road-bike-you-ever-buy/\">Sage Skyline</a> bike review came in, I was hooked. The bike is a classic titanium build with round, robust tubes and a modern clearance for larger tires. The bike offers an incredible lively ride sensation while being responsive enough to race. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sage-Titanium-Skyline-Full-head-badge--scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sage-Titanium-Skyline-Full-head-badge--1536x1152.jpeg\" alt=\"Sage Titanium Skyline Full head badge\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sage-Titanium-Skyline-Full-head-badge--1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sage-Titanium-Skyline-Full-head-badge--297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sage-Titanium-Skyline-Full-head-badge--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sage-Titanium-Skyline-Full-head-badge--768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sage-Titanium-Skyline-Full-head-badge--2048x1536.jpeg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sage-Titanium-Skyline-Full-black--scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sage-Titanium-Skyline-Full-black--1536x1152.jpeg\" alt=\"Sage Titanium Skyline Full black\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sage-Titanium-Skyline-Full-black--1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sage-Titanium-Skyline-Full-black--297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sage-Titanium-Skyline-Full-black--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sage-Titanium-Skyline-Full-black--768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sage-Titanium-Skyline-Full-black--2048x1536.jpeg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sage-Titanium-Skyline-Full-logo--scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sage-Titanium-Skyline-Full-logo--1536x1152.jpeg\" alt=\"Sage Titanium Skyline Full logo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sage-Titanium-Skyline-Full-logo--1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sage-Titanium-Skyline-Full-logo--297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sage-Titanium-Skyline-Full-logo--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sage-Titanium-Skyline-Full-logo--768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Sage-Titanium-Skyline-Full-logo--2048x1536.jpeg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The comfort and feel of the slight vibration rolling on the tarmac made this bike stand out in my review catalog this season. Sage is a great company; I’ve loved their bikes for a while. This is just the first of their road bikes I’ve ridden. I hope to ride more in the future, and you should check them out if you’re in the market for a titanium bike, no matter the discipline.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Mountain Bike Editor’s Choice: Lauf Elja </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Lauf-Elja-all-bike-lined-up--jpeg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Lauf-Elja-all-bike-lined-up--jpeg.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Lauf-Elja-all-bike-lined-up--jpeg.webp 1920w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Lauf-Elja-all-bike-lined-up--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Lauf-Elja-all-bike-lined-up--1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Lauf-Elja-all-bike-lined-up--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Lauf-Elja-all-bike-lined-up--768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Lauf-Elja-all-bike-lined-up--800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Lauf-Elja-all-bike-lined-up--720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo: Antoine Daures</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Lauf Elja is a unique bike, not only in its looks but also in its ride quality. The silhouette is more of a retro chainstay-less design; some feel weird about it. I think it looks fantastic and makes the bike feel less “serious.” That’s the whole vibe of the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/lauf-elja-full-suspension-mountain-bike/\">Elja</a>.

Yes, the 2.6″ tires help, but the Elja ride is playful, but when you wanna go hard, it can deliver. The spec for my “race build” is precisely what I’d want, and the SRAM Flight Attendant suspension with 120mm of travel front and rear is more than enough to get rowdy (I don’t get that rowdy, actually). </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Best Kid’s Editor’s Choice: Giant Faith</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Giant-Faith-Nino-DH.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2305\" height=\"1729\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Giant-Faith-Nino-DH.jpeg\" alt=\"Giant Faith Nino DH\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Giant-Faith-Nino-DH.jpeg 2305w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Giant-Faith-Nino-DH-297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Giant-Faith-Nino-DH-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Giant-Faith-Nino-DH-120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Giant-Faith-Nino-DH-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Giant-Faith-Nino-DH-2048x1536.jpeg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Giant Faith was my son’s first real experience on a full-suspension bike.

It’s not only because the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/sram-red-xplr-13-speed-groupset/\">RED XPLR groupset </a>performs so well.

I didn’t like the older design, especially the brake feel. The new RED groupset, however, seemed to have skipped a few generations, and landed right in a sweet spot of comfort on the road and functionality off-road. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/SRAM-RED-XPLR-ENVE-MOG-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/SRAM-RED-XPLR-ENVE-MOG-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"SRAM-RED-XPLR-ENVE-MOG\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/SRAM-RED-XPLR-ENVE-MOG-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/SRAM-RED-XPLR-ENVE-MOG-297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/SRAM-RED-XPLR-ENVE-MOG-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/SRAM-RED-XPLR-ENVE-MOG-120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/SRAM-RED-XPLR-ENVE-MOG-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/SRAM-RED-XPLR-ENVE-MOG-2048x1536.jpeg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The shifting is accentuated by the meeting of SRAM’s transmission mountain bike tech and updated lever design. Having 13 gears isn’t the piece that sells the RED XPLR group, but it helps immensely in its cause. I sincerely hope that we will see an updated SRAM Force XPLR and APEX in the future. This tech should be enjoyed by all who want it, not just the race crowd. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Headunit Editor’s Choice: Garmin 1050 </h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Garmin-Edge-1050-cycling-computer-header.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"8192\" height=\"5464\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Garmin-Edge-1050-cycling-computer-header.jpeg\" alt=\"Garmin Edge 1050 cycling computer header\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Garmin-Edge-1050-cycling-computer-header.jpeg 8192w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Garmin-Edge-1050-cycling-computer-header-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Garmin-Edge-1050-cycling-computer-header-1536x1025.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Garmin-Edge-1050-cycling-computer-header-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Garmin-Edge-1050-cycling-computer-header-768x512.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the year, I’ve spent time on many different head units: the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-wahoo-elemnt-ace-cycling-computer/\">WAHOO Ace</a>, the<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/coros-dura-solar-gps-bike-computer/\"> COROS DURA</a>, and lots of smartwatches.

It’s the one you wanna ride, but they didn’t have it available for you to purchase – because it’s “pro-only”. All that changed this season when they finally made stock for the masses. I was eager to get my hands on a set, and it didn’t disappoint me. The tire is fast, super fast, and it’s an absolute ripper in the right conditions (if you can control it).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Maxxis-Aspen-ST-new-tread--scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Maxxis-Aspen-ST-new-tread--scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Maxxis Aspen ST new tread\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Maxxis-Aspen-ST-new-tread--scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Maxxis-Aspen-ST-new-tread--297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Maxxis-Aspen-ST-new-tread--1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Maxxis-Aspen-ST-new-tread--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Maxxis-Aspen-ST-new-tread--768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Maxxis-Aspen-ST-new-tread--2048x1536.jpeg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The additional suppleness is notable, and the voluminous casing is a great mix with modern cross-country racing. Unfortunately, the wear isn’t that great (it’s a race tire, so Im not bummed), and the price is bonkers, but….man, is it a fast, fun tire. It definitely should be on the short list of cross-country, short-track, and gravel racers looking to squeeze out the most speed (fun) they can on race day. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Helmet Editor’s Choice: Canyon Disruptr CFR</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-Review--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-Review--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Canyon Disruptr CFR Helmet Review\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-Review--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-Review--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-Review--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-Review--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-Review--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Canyon-Disruptr-CFR-Helmet-Review--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m going to get flack for this, but I like it.

For athletes looking to dial in their hydration for long events or are experiencing cramps (raises hand), it’s worth a try, and you can pass it around to your crew to share the knowledge. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bike Rack Editor’s Choice: Velocirax Tilt and Pivot</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Velocirax-closeup--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Velocirax-closeup--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Velocirax closeup\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Velocirax-closeup--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Velocirax-closeup--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Velocirax-closeup--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Velocirax-closeup--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Velocirax-closeup--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Velocirax-closeup--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With all the bikes coming in and out of our place during the year (including our personal bikes), it’s hard to find a reliable and durable bike rack for family use. We moved this year, and it was a chance to start over bike rack-wise, so I went in a new direction. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Velocirax-closeup-family-bikes--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Velocirax-closeup-family-bikes--1536x1152.webp\" alt=\"Velocirax closeup family bikes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Velocirax-closeup-family-bikes--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Velocirax-closeup-family-bikes--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Velocirax-closeup-family-bikes--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Velocirax-closeup-family-bikes--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Velocirax-closeup-family-bikes--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Velocirax-closeup-clean-scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Velocirax-closeup-clean-1536x1152.webp\" alt=\"Velocirax closeup clean\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Velocirax-closeup-clean-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Velocirax-closeup-clean-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Velocirax-closeup-clean-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Velocirax-closeup-clean-768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Velocirax-closeup-clean-2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I bought a<a href=\"https://www.velocirax.com/products/tilt-pivot-bike-storage-rack\"> Velocirax 8-bike </a>wall rack for my garage. It wasn’t cheap, but I figured I was in business if it held up as good as the car rack. The installation was super easy, and I’m no Al Borland (90s kids get that joke). The rack itself is super beefy and clean-looking. It can take a multitude of differing bikes and different wheel sizes. Plus, I can shuffle through each bike without scratching them. Something that was always a challenge with my homemade hanging bike rack I had previously. After nearly a year of use, I’m excited about my decision. Highly recommended.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mountain Bike Wheelset Editor’s Choice: Roval Control SL Team Issue</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4029-scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4029-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Spec Roval\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4029-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4029-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4029-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4029-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4029-768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4029-2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m very familiar with the Roval MTB wheel family. I’ve raced the<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/roval-control-sl-team-mountain-bike-wheels/\"> Roval Control SLs</a> for the past couple (5 years), and they are my go-to race wheels. So when Roval updated them, I wondered how. They didn’t do much, but they made them lighter and gave them an excellent kit package and presentation. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4051-scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4051-1536x1152.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4051-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4051-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4051-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4051-768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4051-2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4441-scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4441-1536x1152.webp\" alt=\"spec roval inside box\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4441-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4441-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4441-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4441-768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4441-2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4033-scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4033-1536x1152.webp\" alt=\"Spec roval hub\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4033-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4033-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4033-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4033-768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4033-2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4046-scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4046-1536x1152.webp\" alt=\"Spec Roval Front hub\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4046-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4046-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4046-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4046-768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_4046-2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The hubs are silver bling and have each Specialized Factory Racing team member’s signature. The carbon spokes are the same ones used on the Roval Team Edition road wheels. However, the best and most prominent selling feature of the Roval Team Edition Control SL wheels is the extra bits. The wheels arrive with a second set of ceramic speed bearings, replacement spokes, Specializes Fast Track Tires, and much more. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Road Wheels Editor’s Choice: Mavic Mavic Allroad SL</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-lone-wheel--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-lone-wheel--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Mavic AllRoad SL Wheels lone wheel\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-lone-wheel--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-lone-wheel--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-lone-wheel--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-lone-wheel--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-lone-wheel--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-lone-wheel--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>2024 was a big year for Mavic, especially in the USA. The French brand opened a USA office in 2023 and has been trucking since. One of the most iconic pieces I see from Mavic is their alloy road wheels. I raced on a set of Ksysim SL wheels for years, and they were my babies. I fell in love with the ride of Mavic wheels, and when I rode the Mavic All Road SL wheels, I was reunited with that feeling. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-rim--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-rim--1536x864.webp\" alt=\"Mavic AllRoad SL Wheels rim\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-rim--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-rim--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-rim--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-rim--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-rim--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-rim--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-font-hub--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-font-hub--1536x864.webp\" alt=\"Mavic AllRoad SL Wheels font hub\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-font-hub--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-font-hub--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-font-hub--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-font-hub--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-font-hub--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-font-hub--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-hub-service--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"864\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-hub-service--1536x864.webp\" alt=\"Mavic AllRoad SL Wheels hub service\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-hub-service--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-hub-service--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-hub-service--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-hub-service--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-hub-service--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mavic-AllRoad-SL-Wheels-hub-service--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-mavic-allroad-sl-wheels/\" target=\"_blank\">Allroad SL</a> wheels are reminiscent of the yellow age of wheels (minus the single yellow spoke). They are light and dependable, and now, thanks to a US presence with Mavic, replacement parts are readily available. Now that carbon has replaced high-end alloy, the high-end alloy Mavic creations are best served with unpaved roads, slight gravel, and the path less traveled. I’m excited to see what they have in store for 2025 and beyond. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now — on to 2025! </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Each of these products was entirely chosen purely on their technical merits, by me personally, and for the reasons described above. More great products passed through my hands in 2024. Under no circumstances were any of my picks, paid for by their producers. Nor was any preference or favor given to the brand or advertiser. My selections are mostly (but not exclusively) limited to products I’ve actually spent time riding/testing in person. So a brand’s willingness to invite Bikerumor to join a launch event, or to provide product samples can make it more likely that we will have considered their products, if only because we can share our real, firsthand experiences.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/jordan-villella-editors-choic-gear-of-the-year-2024/\">BikeRumor Editor’s Choice 2024 – Jordan Villella’s Gear of the Year </a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jordan Villella","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"5bf6ef8815b2883983881eddafe83926a79de5254a85ec1a42b815e7c9cd04ba","category":"Cycling"}
