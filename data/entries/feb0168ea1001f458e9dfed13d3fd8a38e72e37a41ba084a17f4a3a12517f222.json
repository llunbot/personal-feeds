Being raced now in the XCC short track Worlds by both Pauline Ferrand-Prévot and Tom Pidcock, the new Pinarello Dogma XC Hardtail has even more divisive looks that you’ll find on the fully or a curvy Pinarello road bike, with a big cutout above the bottom bracket and wildly asymmetric seat &amp; chainstays…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pinarello Dogma XC HT Hardtail cross-country mountain bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Pinarello-Dogma-XC-Hardtail-HT-carbon-cross-country-mountain-bike.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Pinarello-Dogma-XC-Hardtail-HT-carbon-cross-country-mountain-bike.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Pinarello Dogma XC Hardtail HT carbon cross-country mountain bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Pinarello-Dogma-XC-Hardtail-HT-carbon-cross-country-mountain-bike.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Pinarello-Dogma-XC-Hardtail-HT-carbon-cross-country-mountain-bike-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Pinarello-Dogma-XC-Hardtail-HT-carbon-cross-country-mountain-bike-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Pinarello-Dogma-XC-Hardtail-HT-carbon-cross-country-mountain-bike-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Pinarello-Dogma-XC-Hardtail-HT-carbon-cross-country-mountain-bike-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Pinarello-Dogma-XC-Hardtail-HT-carbon-cross-country-mountain-bike-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Pinarello-Dogma-XC-Hardtail-HT-carbon-cross-country-mountain-bike-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Pinarello-Dogma-XC-Hardtail-HT-carbon-cross-country-mountain-bike-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption><em>all courtesy <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/PinarelloBikes/\" target=\"_blank\">Pinarello</a>, Worlds photos by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/esmountainbike\" target=\"_blank\">ESMTB</a></em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Pinarello describes this latest full carbon iteration of their hardtail project as delivering “<em>maximum lightness, stiffness, and reactivity from the rear triangle which will suit the very fastest race circuits</em>“.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Better suited for less technically demanding races than the 90-100mm of rear wheel travel in the full-suspension Dogma XC, this new Dogma XC Hardtail is all about efficiency for the two INEOS Grenadiers riders.

The fully was already asymmetric to a lesser degree, but this hardtail goes over the top. Pinarello says they patented the rear triangle design, which reinforces the left-hand non-driveside with a more direct triangulated layout to offer increased stiffness to “counterbalance the higher forces being applied” on the drivetrain-side by rider pedaling input, presumably benefitting the direct connection of the new SRAM thru-axle and T-Type transmission.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2024-Pinarello-Dogma-XC-Hardtail-HT-carbon-cross-country-mountain-bike_photo-by-ESMTB_Ferrand-Prevot-rear-detail.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2024-Pinarello-Dogma-XC-Hardtail-HT-carbon-cross-country-mountain-bike_photo-by-ESMTB_Ferrand-Prevot-rear-detail.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Pinarello Dogma XC Hardtail HT carbon cross-country mountain bike, photo by ESMTB courtesy of Pinarello, asymmetric stays\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2024-Pinarello-Dogma-XC-Hardtail-HT-carbon-cross-country-mountain-bike_photo-by-ESMTB_Ferrand-Prevot-rear-detail.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2024-Pinarello-Dogma-XC-Hardtail-HT-carbon-cross-country-mountain-bike_photo-by-ESMTB_Ferrand-Prevot-rear-detail-297x186.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2024-Pinarello-Dogma-XC-Hardtail-HT-carbon-cross-country-mountain-bike_photo-by-ESMTB_Ferrand-Prevot-rear-detail-800x500.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2024-Pinarello-Dogma-XC-Hardtail-HT-carbon-cross-country-mountain-bike_photo-by-ESMTB_Ferrand-Prevot-rear-detail-120x75.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2024-Pinarello-Dogma-XC-Hardtail-HT-carbon-cross-country-mountain-bike_photo-by-ESMTB_Ferrand-Prevot-rear-detail-768x480.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2024-Pinarello-Dogma-XC-Hardtail-HT-carbon-cross-country-mountain-bike_photo-by-ESMTB_Ferrand-Prevot-rear-detail-1536x960.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Does that mean the dropped driveside chainstay and upper seatstay connection offer increased rider comfort or some flex to maintain rear wheel traction over rough terrain? We can’t really say. But surely there’s had to be a lot of complex carbon layup design in this unique rear triangle layout to make sure the bike tracks true &amp; straight through technical sections when Pidcock &amp; Ferrand-Prévot aren’t putting down the power in explosive sprints.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2024-Pinarello-Dogma-XC-Hardtail-HT-carbon-cross-country-mountain-bike_bottom-bracket-frame-detail.jpg\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2024-Pinarello-Dogma-XC-Hardtail-HT-carbon-cross-country-mountain-bike_bottom-bracket-frame-detail.jpg\" alt=\"2024 Pinarello Dogma XC Hardtail HT carbon cross-country mountain bike, bottom bracket hole\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2024-Pinarello-Dogma-XC-Hardtail-HT-carbon-cross-country-mountain-bike_bottom-bracket-frame-detail.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2024-Pinarello-Dogma-XC-Hardtail-HT-carbon-cross-country-mountain-bike_bottom-bracket-frame-detail-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2024-Pinarello-Dogma-XC-Hardtail-HT-carbon-cross-country-mountain-bike_bottom-bracket-frame-detail-800x800.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2024-Pinarello-Dogma-XC-Hardtail-HT-carbon-cross-country-mountain-bike_bottom-bracket-frame-detail-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/2024-Pinarello-Dogma-XC-Hardtail-HT-carbon-cross-country-mountain-bike_bottom-bracket-frame-detail-768x768.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the full-suspension bike, the Pinarello Dogma XC Hardtail also gets a triangulated strut connecting the lower seat and down tubes just above the BB for increased bottom bracket stiffness.

We suspect that from a combination of UCI &amp; Olympics regulations, Pinarello felt the need to get the bike racing by this year’s World Championships to qualify for next summer’s Paris Olympics (like we’ve seen a<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?s=track+bike\" target=\"_blank\"> lot on the track</a> this year). Likely that also means that the new Pinarello mountain bikes will need to be commercially available before next summer as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we still don’t have any more concrete pricing data or availability date on the full-suspension <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/pinarello-dogma-xc-olympic-mountain-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">Dogma XC FS</a> besides “2024”. And Pinarello still doesn’t have any Dogma XC mountain bikes listed on their website (besides <a href=\"https://pinarello.com/global/en/bikes/mtb\" target=\"_blank\">an eMTB teaser</a>). So we just have to wait and see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://pinarello.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pinarello.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/pinarello-dogma-xc-ht-hardtail-carbon-cross-country-mountain-bike/\">Pinarello Dogma XC HT adds Wild Asymmetric Hardtail to Win XCC World Champs</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"feb0168ea1001f458e9dfed13d3fd8a38e72e37a41ba084a17f4a3a12517f222","category":"Cycling"}
