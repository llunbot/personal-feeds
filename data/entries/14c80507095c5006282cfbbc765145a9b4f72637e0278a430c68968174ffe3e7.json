Further testing at the state's public health laboratory indicated that the influenza A virus was an H5-type bird flu. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has now confirmed that finding and is carrying out further testing to determine if it is the H5N1 strain currently causing a widespread outbreak among US dairy cows.</p>\n<p>It remains unclear if the person's bird flu infection was the cause of the hospitalization or if the infection was discovered incidentally. The person has since recovered and was discharged from the hospital. In its announcement, MDHSS said no other information about the patient will be released to protect the person's privacy.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048150#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048150&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"14c80507095c5006282cfbbc765145a9b4f72637e0278a430c68968174ffe3e7","category":"Tech"}
