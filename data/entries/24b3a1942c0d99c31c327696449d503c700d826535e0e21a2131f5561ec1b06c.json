{"title":"macOS Sonoma 14.1 public beta is available","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2084160/macos-sonoma-14-1-beta-is-available-with-a-fix-for-remote-widgets.html","date":1695908703000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple on Thursday released the macOS Sonoma 14.1 beta to members of the beta program. The beta comes a couple of days after the company <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1670742/macos-14-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">officially released Sonoma 14</a> to the general public.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 14.1 beta includes the new Favorites feature for Apple Music. Favorite songs, artists, albums, and playlists will be added to your library and factor into song suggestions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-14_1-release-notes&amp;xcust=1-1-2084160-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">developer release notes</a>, 14.1 contains a fix for an issue where Remote Widgets appear blank when an iPhone and Mac are running mismatched operating systems (for example, iOS 16 instead of iOS 17, and macOS Sonoma). The notes also recommend two workarounds that developers can use for issues with Wallet and WidgetKit. Here are the release notes for developers, though they are aimed at developers and their tools or reports; this release may have more features or changes than what is contained here.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Remote Widgets</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Resolved Issues</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: Remote Widgets might render blank on mismatched iOS and macOS releases. (115436466)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Wallet</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Known Issues</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Some event ticket passes might fail to ingest into Wallet when added from a website on a Mac. (115216417)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Workaround:</strong> Add them to Wallet from an iPhone.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>WidgetKit</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Known Issues</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>In widgets <code>Text(_:style:)</code> doesn’t animate its content by default. (107582710)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Workaround:</strong> To explicitly request an animation, use the <code>View.contentTransition(_:)</code> modifier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not clear if Sonoma 14.1 will contain any new features. Several features in Sonoma were not available at the official release and are <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2073611/macos-14-sonoma-is-here-but-these-features-are-coming-later.html\">due at a later date</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interested in trying out the betas?
