From what I've seen and experienced, the <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23706685/redfall-review-xbox-series-x-pc-release-date\">reviews</a> are <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/redfall-review-in-progress/\">right</a>: The set design, art, music, sound, and voice acting are all solid, sometimes splendid. But the actual gameplay is mostly uninspired marker quests, inventory stat comparisons, and brain-dead-enemy shooting with awkward-feeling guns.</p>\n<p>I might have liked to play more. We received our review codes at Ars mid-day Thursday, with an embargo set for Monday night. Being a fan of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/05/hands-on-in-prey-youll-love-being-weak-vulnerable-and-hunted/\"><em>Prey</em></a>, the whole <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/10/review-dishonored-is-stealthy-steampunk-world-building-done-right/\"><em>Dishonored</em></a> <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/09/dishonored-death-of-the-outsider-review-no-gods-no-kings/\">series</a>, and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/09/deathloop-review-a-dishonorable-bethesda-discharge/\"><em>Deathloop</em></a>, I planned to pack in as much time as I could in what I assumed would be a rich world. I had to travel over the weekend, but no matter: I'd bring my <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/i-for-one-welcome-our-new-steam-deck-killing-windows-running-overlords/\">trusty Steam Deck</a> and a good-enough laptop and get some time in on trains, planes, and idle hotel moments.</p>\n<p>But <em>Redfall </em><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/02/single-player-redfall-still-requires-a-persistent-online-connection/\">does not want you to spend any time offline</a> in its haunted, leaf-strewn New England town, nor on a slow connection. You need a Bethesda.net account to play <em>Redfal</em><em>l</em>, even though the platforms it's available on, Xbox and Steam on PC, both have their own matchmaking and voice chat capabilities. All the buttons and \"host/join\" prompts make starting a single-player game feel like starting a multiplayer game, just lonelier. But eventually, you can play <em>Redfall</em> by yourself after a few clicks.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1935993#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1935993&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1942e918806bdf9d9c17ffe33bca1786ee8544344d4a486376e58fb15cde1e24","category":"Tech"}
