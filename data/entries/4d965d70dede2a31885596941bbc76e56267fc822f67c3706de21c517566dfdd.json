{"title":"Google finally made an Android feature even Apple won’t steal","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2322890/google-android-audio-emoji-joy-clapping-poop-sounds.html","date":1714743206000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>With <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678333/wwdc-ios-macos-watchos-hardware-keynote.html\">WWDC</a> just about a month away, you’re going to read a lot of stories about how the newest features in iOS 18 are copies of something Google or Samsung already have in Android. But we’re willing to bet that the latest feature Google is rolling out to Android users will never ever show up after an iPhone update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://9to5google.com/2024/04/30/google-phone-audio-emoji-rollout/&amp;xcust=1-1-2322890-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">spotted by 9to5Google</a>, Google calls the new feature Audio Emoji and as the name suggests, the feature adds sounds to popular emoji so people can hear what they would normally look at. If you’re re-reading that sentence with a quizzical face, you’re not alone. It’s a very dumb feature. The emojis included are: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Face with tears of joy</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Clapping hands</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Party popper </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Crying face</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pile of poop</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Drum</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>When selected during a call, they will play the following corresponding sounds: laughing, clapping, party cheering, sad trombone, farting, and a ba-dum-tiss percussion sting. You read that right—you can now add a farting noise during a call on your Pixel or Galaxy phone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how it works. During an active phone call, users will see a new Audio Emoji button that displays the six options when tapped. Select one and the person you’re talking to will hear the sound on the other end, and you will see a short animation as if you were texting someone and sent an emoji as a reaction. 9to5Google has a video showing the six Audio Emoji and they’re as head-scratching as you’d expect. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google says the feature will let users “express emotions and moods while you’re in a call,” but it seems like the kind of feature no one will ever use. I could maybe see Audio Emoji in a text message but on a call? I don’t know who thought this was a good idea, but I can’t imagine it’s going to be a feature that sticks around very long.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I can guarantee that Apple will never try to imitate it on an iPhone.</p>\n\niPhone</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"4d965d70dede2a31885596941bbc76e56267fc822f67c3706de21c517566dfdd","category":"Apple"}
