It is still unclear exactly when the devices will launch, but this information suggests that Apple will announce them <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/07/iphone-se-4-and-ipad-11-by-april/\">by March or April</a>, before the release of iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe account, which has a proven track record for iOS information, leaked the build numbers for these iOS 18.3 and iPadOS 18.3 versions.
