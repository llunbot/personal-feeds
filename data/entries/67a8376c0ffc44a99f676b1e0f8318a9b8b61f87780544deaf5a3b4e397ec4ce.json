This will start with Primephonic playlists and audio content, and in the coming months, Apple will offer a dedicated Primephonic experience with improved browsing and search capabilities by composer and repertoire, better classical music metadata, and more.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nPrimephonic will be taken offline on September 7, and is no longer available for new subscribers.
