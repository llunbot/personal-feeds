Most people's first preference <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/11/are-we-ready-to-recycle-cars-lithium-batteries/\">is to reuse them</a>, repurposing the cells for a second life as stationary storage.</p>\n<p>But at some point, even those batteries will reach their end of life, and recycling them makes sense, given concerns over <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/07/general-motors-looks-to-california-for-its-next-lithium-supply/\">sourcing raw materials for fresh batteries</a> to take their place. It's even possible that using recycled materials might make a better battery, according to <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(21)00433-5\">a study</a> published in the journal Joule.</p>\n<p>Recycling a complicated construction like a battery cell is a difficult task, but it's a potentially lucrative one, which means it's of interest to academia andÂ <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/09/former-tesla-cto-wins-amazon-funding-for-battery-recycling-project/\">industry</a>. The study in Joule, led by Professor Yan Wang at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, looks at the performance of lithium-ion cells that have cathodes made from nickel, manganese, and cobalt recovered from other cells.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1806147#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1806147&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
