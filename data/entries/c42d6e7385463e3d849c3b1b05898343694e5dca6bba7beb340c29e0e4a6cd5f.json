The admission comes despite a WotC policy barring the use of AI in its art, and the controversy has already caused at least one <em>MtG</em> artist to publicly announce that he is \"done\" with the company.</p>\n<p>The promo image in question was posted in a now-deleted (but <a href=\"https://archive.is/BA6Qq\">still archived</a>) social media post last Thursday, showing five new \"retro frame\" versions of lands from the upcoming Ravnica Remastered set in a nondescript steampunk-style laboratory. While the image looks unobjectionable at first glance, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GreenSkyDragon/status/1743072023268802730\">careful viewers</a> soon <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RigoTheRiot/status/1743998240192937989\">zoomed in</a> on specific and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Jonappgar/status/1743435044650397753\">incongruous background details</a> in the lab that showed <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/pranavdixit/ai-generated-art-hands-fingers-messed-up\">telltale errors</a> common to some AI image generators.

Last August, when a longtime <em>D&amp;D</em> artist was found to be using AI tools for commissioned pieces, WotC <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DnDBeyond/status/1687969469170094083\">said</a> that it was \"updating our artist guidelines to make clear that artists must refrain from using AI art generation as part of their art creation process for developing D&amp;D art.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1994427#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1994427&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c42d6e7385463e3d849c3b1b05898343694e5dca6bba7beb340c29e0e4a6cd5f","category":"Tech"}
