There’s a surprise Big Spring Sale going on right now and we’re seeing some excellent prices on Apple gear all weekend long. Here are our favorites but go head over and check out the whole sale:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2022-10-9-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B0BJLT98Q7/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">10th-gen iPad: $350</a></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The 10th-gen iPad is tough to recommend at $450, but with $100 in savings, it’s a no-brainer. It’s essentially a stripped-down iPad Air, with a 10.9-inch display, landscape camera for FaceTime, Touch ID, and USB-C all for less than the cost of an iPhone SE.</p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2022-10-9-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B0BJLT98Q7/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">View Deal</a></p>\n\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Generation-Cancelling-Transparency-Personalized/dp/B0CHWRXH8B/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">AirPods Pro: $199</a></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can often get AirPods Pro on sale, but not always for the all-time-low price of $189. That’s good for $60 off the MSRP and an incredible price for one of the best noise-canceling earbuds on the planet. And this model comes with the new USB-C case so you can leave the Lightning cable in your drawer.</p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Generation-Cancelling-Transparency-Personalized/dp/B0CHWRXH8B/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">View Deal</a></p>\n\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Smartwatch-Aluminum-Fitness-Resistant/dp/B0CSVB8BP1/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple Watch Series 9: $329/$359</a></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple Watch Series 9 has indeed lost blood-oxygen tracking, one of its main health features, but it’s still the best smartwatch around, especially when it’s on sale for $70 off. And while you wait for the blood-oxygen sensor functionality to return, you’re still getting a top-notch heart-rate sensor, EKG, always-on display, S9 chip, crash detection, and the new double-tap gesture.</p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Smartwatch-Aluminum-Fitness-Resistant/dp/B0CSVB8BP1/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">View Deal</a></p>\n\n\n<h2><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-USB-C-Compact-Power-Adapter/dp/B0B3C493HH/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple 35W Dual USB-C Port Compact Power Adapter: $44</a></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We really like Apple’s dual-port USB-C charger, which has downward-facing USB-C ports and fold-up prongs, but we don’t love it’s regular price of $59. But knock $15 off and we like it a lot. Slip it into your pocket and you can charge a MacBook Air and an iPhone wherever you are.</p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-USB-C-Compact-Power-Adapter/dp/B0B3C493HH/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">View Deal</a></p>\niPad, MacBook</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"937113aee5e26b1c7797a7dc17b62c7eb8b41297e241dc067cf4a3d18f4b00da","category":"Apple"}
