And, they make it super easy to roll, not rotate, your foot off, making them an interesting option for anyone skeptical of traditional clip-in pedals…</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10114209/J-Pedals-magnetic-clipless-bike-pedals-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10114209/J-Pedals-magnetic-clipless-bike-pedals-2.jpg\" alt=\"j-pedals magnetic clipless pedals for road and mountain bikes\" width=\"1400\" height=\"934\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10114209/J-Pedals-magnetic-clipless-bike-pedals-2.jpg 1400w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10114209/J-Pedals-magnetic-clipless-bike-pedals-2-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10114209/J-Pedals-magnetic-clipless-bike-pedals-2-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10114209/J-Pedals-magnetic-clipless-bike-pedals-2-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10114209/J-Pedals-magnetic-clipless-bike-pedals-2-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\"></a></p><p>J-Pedal’s magnetic clipless pedals work by placing two strong magnets on the pedal body, then bolting a metal cleat to the shoe. They say it has about 80lbs of force, enough to hold your foot securely to the pedal, but it remains quick and easy to detach your foot by simply rolling it outward.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10114212/J-Pedals-magnetic-clipless-bike-pedals-3.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10114212/J-Pedals-magnetic-clipless-bike-pedals-3.jpg\" alt=\"j-pedals magnetic clipless pedals for road and mountain bikes\" width=\"1200\" height=\"606\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10114212/J-Pedals-magnetic-clipless-bike-pedals-3.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10114212/J-Pedals-magnetic-clipless-bike-pedals-3-297x150.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10114212/J-Pedals-magnetic-clipless-bike-pedals-3-800x404.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10114212/J-Pedals-magnetic-clipless-bike-pedals-3-120x61.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10114212/J-Pedals-magnetic-clipless-bike-pedals-3-768x388.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p>Rather than an outward twist of your heel like with traditional clipless pedals, you simply roll your ankle outward slightly to use the edge of the pedal as a lever to pry your foot off.</p><p>It sounds awkward or bad (because who wants to roll their ankle), but they say it’s actually a very natural motion for someone trying to get off the pedal, especially if they’re new to the sport.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10114207/J-Pedals-magnetic-clipless-bike-pedals-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10114207/J-Pedals-magnetic-clipless-bike-pedals-1.jpg\" alt=\"j-pedals magnetic clipless pedals for road and mountain bikes\" width=\"1400\" height=\"935\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10114207/J-Pedals-magnetic-clipless-bike-pedals-1.jpg 1400w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10114207/J-Pedals-magnetic-clipless-bike-pedals-1-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10114207/J-Pedals-magnetic-clipless-bike-pedals-1-800x534.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10114207/J-Pedals-magnetic-clipless-bike-pedals-1-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10114207/J-Pedals-magnetic-clipless-bike-pedals-1-768x513.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1400px) 100vw, 1400px\"></a></p><p>The system uses a metal cleat that bolts directly to 2-bolt SPD shoes (like mountain bike shoes), but has a plastic surround that adds the bolt holes for SPD-R (3-bolt road bike cleats). The pedals are the same for either.</p><p>Weights are 200g per pedal, and&nbsp;40g per metal cleat, and 16g per plastic adapter. So, 256g per side, or 512g per pair. Retail price is&nbsp;$195 for the complete version, or $172 for the MTB version only.</p><p><a href=\"http://j-pedals.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>J-pedals.com</em></a></p></section></article></div></div>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"c81a59fd020351bb1416c3f8648a8efe01e14c8abe69d03bfa375904453a7926","category":"Cycling"}
