But that DLC also comes with an addition that might seem out of place for the single-player title: microtransaction power-ups.</p>\n<p><em>RE4</em> players can now purchase a variety of \"Resident Evil 4 Weapon Exclusive Upgrade Tickets\" on Steam at a price of <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2109316/Resident_Evil_4_Weapon_Exclusive_Upgrade_Ticket_x1_A/\">$2.99 for one</a> or in bundles of up to <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2197328/Resident_Evil_4_Weapon_Exclusive_Upgrade_Ticket_x5_A/\">$9.99 for five</a>. In exchange for this payment, players can \"have access to a weapon's exclusive upgrade at any time, regardless of the weapon's level. Not only that, but once unlocked, the upgrade itself is free of charge!\"</p>\n<p>These same weapon upgrade tickets can be earned without spending real money by using earned in-game currency or fully leveling up a weapon's stats through gameplay. With this new DLC, though, Capcom is apparently hoping many players will want to pay to avoid the grind and blaze through the game's challenges with the most powerful weapons available.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1930402#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1930402&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"da50cee50f45861b0cc8af702f80a1445dc4fb754eee96cecbeb61462f838619","category":"Tech"}
