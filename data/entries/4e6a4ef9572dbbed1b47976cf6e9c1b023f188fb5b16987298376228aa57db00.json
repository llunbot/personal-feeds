The goal is to create a single “mega API”—a bridge that lets software systems talk to one another—for accessing IRS data, sources tell WIRED. The agency is expected to partner with a <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-doge-silicon-valley-corporate-connections/\">third-party vendor</a> to manage certain aspects of the data project. <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-palantir-chief-information-officers-government/\">Palantir</a>, a software company cofounded by billionaire and Musk associate Peter Thiel, has been brought up consistently by DOGE representatives as a possible candidate, sources tell WIRED.</p>\n<p>Two top DOGE operatives at the IRS, Sam Corcos and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-government-young-engineers/\">Gavin Kliger</a>, are helping to orchestrate the hackathon, sources tell WIRED. Corcos is a health-tech CEO with ties to Musk’s SpaceX.

He has also spoken about some aspects of these cuts publicly: \"We've so far stopped work and cut about $1.5 billion from the modernization budget. Mostly projects that were going to continue to put us down the death spiral of complexity in our code base,\" Corcos told Laura Ingraham on <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6370300545112\">Fox News in March</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/doge-gearing-up-for-hackathon-at-irs-wants-easier-access-to-taxpayer-data/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/doge-gearing-up-for-hackathon-at-irs-wants-easier-access-to-taxpayer-data/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Makena Kelly, wired.com","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4e6a4ef9572dbbed1b47976cf6e9c1b023f188fb5b16987298376228aa57db00","category":"Tech"}
