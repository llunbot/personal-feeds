Now though, the C-4 builds off an ultra-stiff UD carbon fiber sole with integrated vents, plus fixed heel &amp; toe pads for walkability. The carbon soles use the standard road cleat 3-bolt layout and include printed markings to help align your cleats.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Ekoi-C-4-road-bike-shoes_affordable-full-carbon-sole-woven-mesh-vented-cycling-shoe_underside.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Ekoi-C-4-road-bike-shoes_affordable-full-carbon-sole-woven-mesh-vented-cycling-shoe_underside-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"Ekoï C-4 carbon road bike shoes, affordable Ekoi full-carbon sole woven mesh vented cycling shoe, underside\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Ekoi-C-4-road-bike-shoes_affordable-full-carbon-sole-woven-mesh-vented-cycling-shoe_underside-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Ekoi-C-4-road-bike-shoes_affordable-full-carbon-sole-woven-mesh-vented-cycling-shoe_underside-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Ekoi-C-4-road-bike-shoes_affordable-full-carbon-sole-woven-mesh-vented-cycling-shoe_underside-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Ekoi-C-4-road-bike-shoes_affordable-full-carbon-sole-woven-mesh-vented-cycling-shoe_underside-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Ekoi-C-4-road-bike-shoes_affordable-full-carbon-sole-woven-mesh-vented-cycling-shoe_underside-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Ekoi-C-4-road-bike-shoes_affordable-full-carbon-sole-woven-mesh-vented-cycling-shoe_underside-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Ekoi-C-4-road-bike-shoes_affordable-full-carbon-sole-woven-mesh-vented-cycling-shoe_underside-1200x675.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Ekoi-C-4-road-bike-shoes_affordable-full-carbon-sole-woven-mesh-vented-cycling-shoe_underside.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of the carbon sole, the Ekoi has created an almost entirely open, ventilated upper thanks to a structured woven mesh material with minimal stretch for maximum breathability and security.
