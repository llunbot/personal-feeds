Tokens are fragments of words used to simplify AI data processing, and a \"context window\" is similar to short-term memory—how much human-provided input data an LLM can process at once.</p>\n<p>A larger context window means an LLM can consider larger works like books or participate in very long interactive conversations that span \"hours or even days,\" according to Anthropic:</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1938873#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1938873&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"115bc16c9410b5aa279a2d7eb7d7a4ed41b05ea866258615c28fc2cb5728f0e6","category":"Tech"}
