The Ricochet system will be required to play <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/03/call-of-duty-launches-a-free-to-play-cross-platform-battle-royale-game/\"><em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em></a> and the upcoming WWII-based <em>Call of Duty: Vanguard </em>once the software is implemented in each game.</p>\n\n<p>Assuming the publisher's claims are true, the kernel driver—slated to be added to <em>Warzone</em> later this year<em>—</em>only performs active checks on software that tries to interact with or otherwise change its files when the game application is open and will turn off when players close out. Data from the driver will be used to analyze suspicious behavior and \"assist in the identification of cheaters, reinforcing and strengthening the overall server security,\" the blog says.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1803962#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1803962&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Steve Haske","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"10d02b90544c24a27d2625615985e19707fb19c8e0c8147a6d02fc1c0bd401b2","category":"Tech"}
