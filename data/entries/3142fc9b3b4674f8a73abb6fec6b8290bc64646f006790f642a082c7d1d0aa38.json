As of publication, the company’s <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2022-38028\">advisory</a> still made no mention of the in-the-wild targeting. Windows users frequently prioritize the installation of patches based on whether a vulnerability is likely to be exploited in real-world attacks.</p>\n<p>Exploiting CVE-2022-38028, as the vulnerability is tracked, allows attackers to gain system privileges, the highest available in Windows, when combined with a separate exploit. Exploiting the flaw, which carries a 7.8 severity rating out of a possible 10, requires low existing privileges and little complexity. It resides in the Windows print spooler, a printer-management component that has <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/07/microsofts-emergency-patch-fails-to-fix-critical-printnightmare-vulnerability/\">harbored previous critical zero-days</a>. Microsoft said at the time that it learned of the vulnerability from the US National Security Agency.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019186#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019186&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3142fc9b3b4674f8a73abb6fec6b8290bc64646f006790f642a082c7d1d0aa38","category":"Tech"}
