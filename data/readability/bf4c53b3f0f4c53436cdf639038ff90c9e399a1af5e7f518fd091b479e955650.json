Put simply; one man building road, gravel and mountain bike frames from bamboo. Jason O’Nions is an outdoor educator, wildlife conservationist and teacher who has, in his own words, been bitten by the buy of building bamboo bikes. Jason built his first bamboo road frame 11 years ago, and has been building proof-of-concept frames ever since. The most notable frame would be the recent creation of a high-pivot full suspension bamboo mountain bike.</p><figure id=\"attachment_266419\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-266419\"><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26081218/earthbound-bamboo-high-pivot-full-suspension-bike.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26081218/earthbound-bamboo-high-pivot-full-suspension-bike.jpg?ezimgfmt=rs:484x321/rscb26/ng:webp/ngcb26\" alt=\"earthbound bikes bambo high pivot full suspension mtb\" width=\"1200\" height=\"797\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26081218/earthbound-bamboo-high-pivot-full-suspension-bike.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb26 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26081218/earthbound-bamboo-high-pivot-full-suspension-bike-297x197.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb26 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26081218/earthbound-bamboo-high-pivot-full-suspension-bike-800x531.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb26 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26081218/earthbound-bamboo-high-pivot-full-suspension-bike-120x80.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb26 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26081218/earthbound-bamboo-high-pivot-full-suspension-bike-768x510.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb26 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26081218/earthbound-bamboo-high-pivot-full-suspension-bike-696x462.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb26 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26081218/earthbound-bamboo-high-pivot-full-suspension-bike-1068x709.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb26 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26081218/earthbound-bamboo-high-pivot-full-suspension-bike-632x420.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb26 632w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb26 src ng ngcb26 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26081218/earthbound-bamboo-high-pivot-full-suspension-bike.jpg?ezimgfmt=rs:484x321/rscb26/ng:webp/ngcb26\" ezoid=\"0.39528543164330054\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26081218/earthbound-bamboo-high-pivot-full-suspension-bike.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb26 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26081218/earthbound-bamboo-high-pivot-full-suspension-bike-297x197.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb26 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26081218/earthbound-bamboo-high-pivot-full-suspension-bike-800x531.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb26 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26081218/earthbound-bamboo-high-pivot-full-suspension-bike-120x80.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb26 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26081218/earthbound-bamboo-high-pivot-full-suspension-bike-768x510.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb26 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26081218/earthbound-bamboo-high-pivot-full-suspension-bike-696x462.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb26 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26081218/earthbound-bamboo-high-pivot-full-suspension-bike-1068x709.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb26 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26081218/earthbound-bamboo-high-pivot-full-suspension-bike-632x420.jpg?ezimgfmt=ng:webp/ngcb26 632w\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-266419\">The Earthbound high pivot full suspension bamboo mountain bike has 130mm travel with 435mm chainstays</figcaption></figure><p>Earthbound Bikes have no website.

Where did the idea come from?</em></p><p><strong>Jason O’Nions: </strong>I can’t take any credit for the idea. Bamboo bikes were actually being made in the 1890s! But, I made my first one purely out of curiosity. I loved the idea of building a bike using a natural material.</p><figure id=\"attachment_266430\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-266430\"><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26103330/earthbound-bamboo-road-bike-original.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26103330/earthbound-bamboo-road-bike-original.jpg\" alt=\"earthbound bamboo road bike jason o'nions original\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26103330/earthbound-bamboo-road-bike-original.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26103330/earthbound-bamboo-road-bike-original-297x223.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26103330/earthbound-bamboo-road-bike-original-800x600.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26103330/earthbound-bamboo-road-bike-original-120x90.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26103330/earthbound-bamboo-road-bike-original-768x576.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26103330/earthbound-bamboo-road-bike-original-696x522.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26103330/earthbound-bamboo-road-bike-original-1068x801.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26103330/earthbound-bamboo-road-bike-original-560x420.jpg 560w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26103330/earthbound-bamboo-road-bike-original-80x60.jpg 80w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26103330/earthbound-bamboo-road-bike-original-265x198.jpg 265w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb26 src ng ngcb26 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26103330/earthbound-bamboo-road-bike-original.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26103330/earthbound-bamboo-road-bike-original.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26103330/earthbound-bamboo-road-bike-original-297x223.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26103330/earthbound-bamboo-road-bike-original-800x600.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26103330/earthbound-bamboo-road-bike-original-120x90.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26103330/earthbound-bamboo-road-bike-original-768x576.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26103330/earthbound-bamboo-road-bike-original-696x522.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26103330/earthbound-bamboo-road-bike-original-1068x801.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26103330/earthbound-bamboo-road-bike-original-560x420.jpg 560w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26103330/earthbound-bamboo-road-bike-original-80x60.jpg 80w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26103330/earthbound-bamboo-road-bike-original-265x198.jpg 265w\"></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-266430\">Jason’s first shot at building at bamboo road bike 11 years ago.

Also, its ability to flex and deflect impacts gives an undeniable improvement in cornering grip too. All of this is of course backed up by my super scientific strava results of course! 🙂 I’m simply faster on a bamboo bike.</p><p><strong>Bikerumor:</strong> <em>What is the source of your Bamboo? And, how do you prep, inspect and trust the natural irregularities of a natural material?</em></p><p><strong>Jason O’Nions: </strong>The Bamboo I use is construction grade and sourced from a wholesaler in Spain, but it originates from China. Bamboo has spent 400 million years being refined by nature and as a natural composite it is ‘designed’ to be flexible yet at the same time very strong in order to withstand swaying in the wind. In addition, a plethora of studies exploring its mechanical properties has shown it to be more than adequate for use in bicycle frames.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26081506/earthbound-bamboo-hardtail-mountain-bike-downtube.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26081506/earthbound-bamboo-hardtail-mountain-bike-downtube.jpg\" alt=\"earthbound bamboo bikes hardtail downtube\" width=\"1200\" height=\"798\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26081506/earthbound-bamboo-hardtail-mountain-bike-downtube.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26081506/earthbound-bamboo-hardtail-mountain-bike-downtube-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26081506/earthbound-bamboo-hardtail-mountain-bike-downtube-800x532.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26081506/earthbound-bamboo-hardtail-mountain-bike-downtube-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26081506/earthbound-bamboo-hardtail-mountain-bike-downtube-768x511.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26081506/earthbound-bamboo-hardtail-mountain-bike-downtube-696x463.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26081506/earthbound-bamboo-hardtail-mountain-bike-downtube-1068x710.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26081506/earthbound-bamboo-hardtail-mountain-bike-downtube-632x420.jpg 632w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb26 src ng ngcb26 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26081506/earthbound-bamboo-hardtail-mountain-bike-downtube.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26081506/earthbound-bamboo-hardtail-mountain-bike-downtube.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26081506/earthbound-bamboo-hardtail-mountain-bike-downtube-297x198.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26081506/earthbound-bamboo-hardtail-mountain-bike-downtube-800x532.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26081506/earthbound-bamboo-hardtail-mountain-bike-downtube-120x80.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26081506/earthbound-bamboo-hardtail-mountain-bike-downtube-768x511.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26081506/earthbound-bamboo-hardtail-mountain-bike-downtube-696x463.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26081506/earthbound-bamboo-hardtail-mountain-bike-downtube-1068x710.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26081506/earthbound-bamboo-hardtail-mountain-bike-downtube-632x420.jpg 632w\"></a></p><p>I do very little to prep tubes, aside from inspecting for splits, damage from transport or blemishes.

Bamboo is a lower density material meaning a bamboo bike has more material in it. More material equals more material to damp vibrations.

It gets its properties by virtue of two materials working together just like carbon fibre (carbon fibres embedded in resin vs cellulose fibres embedded in lignin. In bamboo’s case all of these fibres run in the same direction; parallel along the entire length of the tube. This gives it amazing properties in tension (think bending – swaying back and forth in strong winds) but because none of the fibres are orientated diagonally it can lack torsional (twisting) stiffness. Of course, bamboo doesn’t need to resist twisting in nature.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26105452/bamboo-carbon-road-bike-earthbound-green-clearcoat.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26105452/bamboo-carbon-road-bike-earthbound-green-clearcoat.jpg\" alt=\"bamboo road bike earthbound bikes green seat tube clearcoat\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1600\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26105452/bamboo-carbon-road-bike-earthbound-green-clearcoat.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26105452/bamboo-carbon-road-bike-earthbound-green-clearcoat-225x300.jpg 225w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26105452/bamboo-carbon-road-bike-earthbound-green-clearcoat-800x1067.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26105452/bamboo-carbon-road-bike-earthbound-green-clearcoat-90x120.jpg 90w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26105452/bamboo-carbon-road-bike-earthbound-green-clearcoat-768x1024.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26105452/bamboo-carbon-road-bike-earthbound-green-clearcoat-1152x1536.jpg 1152w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26105452/bamboo-carbon-road-bike-earthbound-green-clearcoat-696x928.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26105452/bamboo-carbon-road-bike-earthbound-green-clearcoat-1068x1424.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26105452/bamboo-carbon-road-bike-earthbound-green-clearcoat-315x420.jpg 315w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb26 src ng ngcb26 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26105452/bamboo-carbon-road-bike-earthbound-green-clearcoat.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26105452/bamboo-carbon-road-bike-earthbound-green-clearcoat.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26105452/bamboo-carbon-road-bike-earthbound-green-clearcoat-225x300.jpg 225w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26105452/bamboo-carbon-road-bike-earthbound-green-clearcoat-800x1067.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26105452/bamboo-carbon-road-bike-earthbound-green-clearcoat-90x120.jpg 90w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26105452/bamboo-carbon-road-bike-earthbound-green-clearcoat-768x1024.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26105452/bamboo-carbon-road-bike-earthbound-green-clearcoat-1152x1536.jpg 1152w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26105452/bamboo-carbon-road-bike-earthbound-green-clearcoat-696x928.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26105452/bamboo-carbon-road-bike-earthbound-green-clearcoat-1068x1424.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/26105452/bamboo-carbon-road-bike-earthbound-green-clearcoat-315x420.jpg 315w\"></a></p><p>Torsional stiffness is important for bikes as it has a large effect on lateral stiffness and thus how a bike feels under pedaling loads. On this latest crop of bikes, I’ve addressed this by laminating the inside walls of the top and down tubes with a layer of carbon fibre orientated at +45/-45 degrees (diagonally so it spirals the length of the tube). This improves the lateral stiffness without robbing the bike of its inherent booness.</p><p><strong>Bikerumor: </strong><em>How do you make everything fit together? Are those carbon lugs you are using? Do you use carbon fibre anywhere else?</em></p><p><strong>Jason O’Nions: </strong>The bamboo is mitered by hand in the same way you’d build a steel or aluminium bike. They are then tacked together and given a neat fillet using marine grade epoxy resin.</p><p>A carbon lug is then created by hand by laying ‘wet’ carbon. Once cured, this then has to be sanded by hand to achieve an attractive finish. This part of the process is extremely labor intensive but it has to be done this way due to the uniqueness of each tube. I can’t ‘cheat’ and use molds. The head tube, bottom bracket shell, and seat tube are also carbon.</p><p><a

But, on the swingarm they press directly into the carbon plate. This was a challenge using a hobbyist CNC machine.

What’s the maximum tire clearance, and is there anything unusual about the design that has come about due to the use of Bamboo?</em></p><p><strong>Jason O’Nions: </strong>I think bamboo is a great material for any style of bike, but I think its perfect niche is gravel. I’m currently building gravel bikes with 435mm chainstays and 45c tyre clearance, although 50c might fit (I’ve yet to try!).</p><p>Weight is around 1600g (-/+100g) with a 12mm x 142mm rear end, 44mm id head tube, and 31.6mm filament wound carbon seat tube.</p><p>I’ve also opted to place the flat mount bosses on the seatstay rather than the chainstay due to lack of clearance for the caliper caused by using straight tubing. If I really wanted to I could change my dropout design, but I’m happy with the seatstay mount and that’s probably the mountain biker in me talking! To me, it looks normal.</p><figure id=\"attachment_266412\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-266412\"><a

tomorrow, could you build it to my specific dimensions and geometry, and how much would it cost me?</em></p><p><strong>Jason O’Nions: </strong>I think around £1700 with full custom geometry. The build process of creating and sanding the carbon lugs makes it very labor intensive. Each frame takes around 40 work hours to complete.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/earthbound_bikes/?hl=en-gb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Earthbound Bikes on Instagram</em></a></p></div></div>","author":"Jessie-May Morgan","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"bf4c53b3f0f4c53436cdf639038ff90c9e399a1af5e7f518fd091b479e955650","category":"Cycling"}
