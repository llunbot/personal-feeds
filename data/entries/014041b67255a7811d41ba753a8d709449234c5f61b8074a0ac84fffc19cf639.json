Dirt Roamer</a> jacket is the most versatile and comfortable jacket that we’ve tested, earning its top spot in our rankings with its streamlined fit, impressive breathability, respectable water resistance, lightweight, packability, and durability. Yes, it’s fairly expensive, but this jacket provides great temperature regulation and excellent protection from wind, light rain, and really any weather short of a monsoon. The Dirt Roamer comes in two color options, sizes XS-XXXL, and a <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10083&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikejacket&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.patagonia.com%2Fproduct%2Fwomens-dirt-roamer-mountain-bike-jacket%2F24406.html%3Fdwvar_24406_color%3DSNDB\">women’s version</a> too. Anyone seeking a fully waterproof option may want to check out <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10083&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikejacket&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.patagonia.com%2Fproduct%2Fmens-dirt-roamer-storm-mountain-bike-jacket%2F24260.html%3Fdwvar_24260_color%3DBLK\">Patagonia’s Dirt Roamer Storm Jacket</a> ($319) instead.</p><p></p><p>Constructed of lightweight 2.3-oz 100% recycled nylon stretch face bonded to a 100% polyester circular-knit backing, with a DWR (durable water repellent) finish, the Dirt Roamer completely blocks wind and is highly water-resistant, but not fully waterproof (nor does it claim to be). It repels water from intermittent showers, steady drizzle, and puddle splashes with ease, but it won’t keep you dry in heavy rainfall. Given that most of us try to avoid riding in heavy rains, it has you covered for the type of weather that you’ll be experiencing most often. And, in those situations, it keeps the chill of the wind at bay while being impressively breathable and manages to stay comfortable in a huge temperature range – keeping you from overheating even up to around 70° F. This means you can spend more time riding and less time dealing with your jacket on those cool days.</p><p></p><p>The fit is on the slimmer, tailored end of the spectrum but works well with thinner layers on cold days as well. Fit is a personal preference, but the lack of extra bulk and sleek, flattering fit add to its appeal. The sleeves are a good length and interface with gloves well, while the dropped tail adds a little protection for the backside. The hood is large, works very well with a helmet, allows a full range of unimpeded motion, and stays in place well while riding. The hood can be tightened to fine-tune the fit and includes a clip to fold it down at the collar when not in use. An interior chest pocket (close fitting and about the size of a cell phone) and a larger zippered pocket right on the lower left back provide a moderate amount of storage space. The Dirt Roamer can also be packed into the rear pocket with an impressively small packed size, and at 219 grams (size S) it won’t weigh you down either.</p><p></p><p>At $249, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10083&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikejacket&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.patagonia.com%2Fproduct%2Fmens-dirt-roamer-mountain-bike-jacket%2F24381.html%3Fdwvar_24381_color%3DBSNG%26cgid%3Dsport-mountain-biking-mens-jackets\">Patagonia Dirt Roamer Jacket</a> does not come cheap, but it is an exceptionally versatile option that is backed by Patagonia’s “Iron Clad” guarantee and that we’ve found to be shockingly durable. One of our testers has had one for over four years and it still works great and looks nearly new. Like all of Patagonia’s products, the Dirt Roamer is built from recycled materials in a Fair Trade Certified factory and is a great choice for riders looking to invest in a single jacket that does it all quite well.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a

Ranger 2.5L Water Jacket</a> is a reasonably priced all-purpose mountain bike rain jacket, designed to be both waterproof and breathable. With fully sealed seams and a 10K/3K 2.5 layer DWR coated shell made with recycled materials, we found the Ranger 2.5L Water jacket best for truly rainy days but still reasonably breathable for brisk, dry conditions. The large, adjustable hood plays very nicely with helmets and, as always, we appreciated the aesthetics of the trim fit, solid black color, minimal branding, and light grid texture.</p><p></p><p>The Ranger 2.5L Water jacket has an athletic fit that’s well suited to its intended purpose of mountain biking. It’s got a somewhat slim, tailored look to it with a longer rear hem to protect your backside from puddle splashes and tire spray. The sleeves are a good length with a slight cuff extension over the back of the wrist, which plays well with and without gloves. We did notice that with the limited stretch in the waterproof fabric, the shoulders on this jacket felt a touch tighter than some of the other options we tested. That said, it wasn’t a deal breaker and the large, adjustable hood fits over helmets easily and is appreciated when the rain really starts to fall. </p><p></p><p>Given the waterproof fabric, the Ranger 2.5L Water jacket completely blocks the chilling effect of the wind while standing up well to all but the most intense of rainstorms. For most rainy days it works great, but for truly heinous conditions, however, we’d still probably go with something like the Endura MT500 Waterproof or Gorewear Endure. It offers some breathability, but the interior can feel a little clammy against the skin when you start to sweat. Wearing this jacket with a long sleeve is preferred, which makes sense given that we found it to be best in temperatures ranging from around 35° to 60° F. Above that and the lack of vents made it a little stifling.</p><p></p><p>Still, we feel the <a

Lupra</a> is a uniquely designed mountain bike jacket that aims to provide wind protection and water resistance in key areas while remaining highly breathable. With strategic paneling of windproof and water-resistant Gore-Tex Infinium on the chest, shoulders, upper arms, and hood, the Lupra jacket fends off wind chill, lights showers, and splashes from puddles, while the stretchy material across the back and under the arms breathes well and helps to keep you from overheating on the climbs. </p><p></p><p>Gore-Tex Infinium is not completely waterproof but it does block wind and is highly water resistant. While it won’t keep you dry in a proper downpour, it does shrug off light showers and tire spray quite effectively. The Gore-Tex Infinium panels on the Lupra cover the upper arms, chest, shoulders, and hood, the parts of your body that are subject to wind and falling rain when you have forward momentum on the bike. The rest of the jacket is much more breathable, allowing heat and perspiration to escape from the back, under the arms, forearms, and around the waistline. </p><p></p><p>The Lupra jacket has a mountain bike specific fit with a tailored torso, articulated elbows, and a drop tail. It also has some great features like a well-designed hood that fits easily over a helmet and moves with your head thanks to a great cut and a gripper panel that contacts the helmet. Two zippered hand pockets provide ample storage space and are positioned well to avoid conflict with backpack or fanny pack straps. Reflective strips by the elbows also add some visibility for those shoulder season rides where you end up spinning on the road home in the dark. </p><p></p><p>If you aren’t looking for a fully waterproof jacket, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=22233&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikejacket&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gorewear.com%2Fus%2Fen-us%2Flupra-jacket-mens-100853\">Gorewear Lupra</a> is a great option to keep you rolling through spring and fall rides, unsettled weather, or wet trails. The strategic placement of the Gore-Tex Infinium keeps the wind and light amounts of water at bay while the rest of the jacket allows heat and moisture to escape and helps regulate body temperature on cool days. The Lupra comes in sizes XS – XL, four different color options, and a <a

Endure</a> is an excellent waterproof mountain bike jacket that has you covered when the heavens open up, and even when they don’t. Fully constructed of Gore-Tex PACLITE Plus fabric (28K/15K rated), the Endure performs exceptionally well in rainstorms but remains comfortable and breathable when the sun comes out, and its comparatively lightweight and small packed size make it easier to bring with you than other fully waterproof options. At $250, it isn’t cheap, but the high-quality materials, fully taped seams, and versatility make it a great option across a wide variety of temperatures and weather conditions. The Endure comes in eight different colorways, sizes XS-XL, as well as the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=22233&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikejacket&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gorewear.com%2Fus%2Fen-us%2Fendure-gore-tex-jacket-womens-100916\">Endure Women’s</a> version for the ladies.</p><p></p><p>The Endure’s fit is relatively standard, relaxed through the chest, arms, and collar – enough to put a layer under and comfortable if you don’t due to the impressive breathability and relatively soft inner backing of the PACLITE Plus fabric. Proportionally, the arms are a touch longer and the front of the waist is a bit higher than most other models we tested, but not dramatically, and the dropped tail still provides great coverage for the behind. There are two good-sized front hand pockets for storage, one of which the coat will pack into, making it a relatively small and tidy package for a fully waterproof jacket. And, at 280 grams, it’s pretty darn light too.</p><p></p><p>The hood is well-sized and includes a ribbed, stretchy area, and a rubber strip that grips the top of the visor of your helmet – both nice touches for high precipitation days and effective in preventing the hood from moving around while riding. The hood is also adjustable through friction drawstrings on each side of the collar, and though they have a limited range of adjustment we never really needed to use them with the great natural fit of the hood over the helmet. </p><p></p><p>One of the best things about the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikejacket&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F214890%2Fgorewear-endure-cycling-jacket-mens%3Fcolor%3DGREY\">Gorewear Endure</a> is its versatility – both breathability and waterproofing are best in class. If you’re looking for a highly durable, do-it-all jacket for anything from brisk, dry mornings to torrential downpours, the Endure is a great option to consider. In heavy rain, it competes with much heavier and less packable competitors, making it a great option for mountain bikers or bikepackers who need a light, packable, versatile, breathable, and completely waterproof jacket. It’s so good that it made it into <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bikerumor-editors-choice-awards-2021-zachs-best-bikes-gear-picks/\">Zach Overholt’s Editor’s Choice</a> list a couple years back.

while still getting a super waterproof jacket that gets the job done. That’s where the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikejacket&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fendura-singletrack-cycling-jacket-ii-mens\">Endura Singletrack Jacket II</a> comes in. Made by the same wet weather riding gear specialists as the MT500 jacket described below, the Singletrack Jacket II costs significantly less without compromising much in terms of wet weather performance. It comes in 5 color options, sizes XS-XXXL, and Endura also makes the Singletrack Jacket II in a <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikejacket&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fendura-singletrack-cycling-jacket-ii-womens\">women’s version</a>.</p><p></p><p>The nearly impermeable ExoShell20 ECO 3-layer fabric boasts a 10K/20K rating, keeping the water out and at the same time, allowing for impressive breathability. It runs a little warmer overall than some of the lighter options, but the material’s breathability is enhanced by zippered pit vents that help evacuate any heat buildup. That said, it has a fairly relaxed, roomy fit that allows for layering on really cold days, a generous length, and adjustable wrist cuffs that easily fit over gloves, watches, etc. Endura’s sizing tends to run a tad large, in our opinion, and this jacket is a bit longer than others. The dropped tail provides great coverage from tire spray, and a drawcord can be used to cinch it up and seal out the elements/prevent snagging on the saddle. </p><p></p><p>The hood is adjustable with two clamped cords on the front of the neck, with enough range to work relatively well with or without a helmet, although it can feel a little tight on the chin when the hood is over a helmet with the zipper up all the way. Regardless, you can certainly batten down the hatches when the deluge arrives. Two zippered hand pockets and a zippered chest pocket provide ample storage for phones, snacks, and other essentials. One drawback of the Singletrack II Jacket is that is a bit heavier and it doesn’t pack down as small as some other options, making it a bit less user-friendly for those rides where the jacket might be coming on and off a few times. </p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikejacket&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fendura-singletrack-cycling-jacket-ii-mens\">Endura Singletrack II Jacket</a> comes at a reasonable price for something that will keep you dry on those days when you should probably stay at home on the couch anyway. While it runs a bit large and isn’t the most packable option, Endura’s wet weather expertise shows in this waterproof jacket that won’t break the bank.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a

href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikejacket&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fendura-mt500-waterproof-jacket-mens\">MT500 Waterproof Jacket II</a> is the latest version of their most weather-resistant mountain bike jacket. It stands to reason that the Scottish brand knows a thing or two about riding in cold and wet conditions, so it comes as little surprise that the MT500 Waterproof jacket can handle the worst that Mother Nature can throw at you.</p><p></p><p>The entire jacket is made of a 3-layer ExoShell40DR waterproof fabric that is claimed rated 40K/20K and is fully seam-sealed and closed with a water-resistant front zipper backed with a storm flap. Endura uses “MadeKind” fabric that is certified safe, and it is treated with a PFC-free DWR. The hood easily fits over helmets and has easy-to-use adjustments while the adjustable wrist cuffs fit over gloves and the internal gaiter keeps the wind from blowing up your sleeves. The cut is very mountain bike specific with articulated sleeves and a dramatically angled waist hem that avoids bunching in the front and provides great spray protection in the rear. On a 15-mile-long shuttle run on a cold day in an absolute downpour, the MT500 quickly proved its worth by keeping us warm and dry and effectively sealing out the elements. This jacket feels absolutely bombproof. </p><p></p><p>One of the major drawbacks of waterproof jackets is that they can feel quite clammy as you produce body heat. Fortunately, the backing of the ExoShell40DR fabric has a soft brushed texture that feels good against the skin, and, while it isn’t the most breathable jacket around, they’ve equipped it with ample ventilation to evacuate self-generated heat. The zippered pit vents open nice and wide, and the mesh-lined front pockets double as vents when not in use. Speaking of pockets, there is loads of storage (plus an attached lens wipe) in the two large front pockets, the zippered internal chest pocket, and the small pass pocket on the sleeve. The front pockets are positioned to stay out of the way of pack straps, and some silicone texture on the shoulders protects the fabric while adding some grip for shoulder straps. </p><p></p><p>It’s hard to find fault with the MT500 Waterproof jacket, but it is heavier than most at 550 grams (size M) and its packed size is relatively significant. The tough fabric is also a little stiffer, and somewhat noisy, and the hood is a bit bulky behind the head if you’re not wearing it. </p><p></p><p>That said, if you’re looking for a burly waterproof mountain bike jacket for cold temperatures and the absolute wettest of days, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikejacket&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fendura-mt500-waterproof-jacket-mens\">Endura MT500 Waterproof Jacket II</a> is a great option to consider. It’s not exactly cheap and it will be overkill for mild temps or light showers, but for the right conditions, you’ll be happy you have it.

Ranger Wind Pullover</a> is a reasonably priced anorak-style windbreaker with passthrough and zippered stomach pockets, quarter-zips at the neck and side of the waist, waist adjustment cord, and extended rear hem. With 4-way stretch and a comfortable, performance-oriented fit, the Ranger Pullover proved to be a great option for chilly, dry days. </p><p></p><p>With quarter-length zips at the neck and on the side, the Ranger Wind Pullover is an anorak-style jacket that must be pulled on over the head. The overall fit is relaxed but not overly casual – it fits like we like our favorite hoodies to fit, just a bit longer in the back. The dropped tail provides a little extra coverage in the rear, avoids getting in the way of the saddle while riding, and can be cinched down with the internal cord. The 89% polyester, 11% elastane, 4-way stretch material is soft and stretchy helping to make the Ranger Wind Pullover one of the most comfortable options we tested. It also dries quickly and blocks brisk winds effectively, though it provides almost zero water resistance (nor does it claim to). It also proved to be quite breathable, though it felt a bit stuffier as things warmed up than the ultralight Rapha Windblock Jersey or Trail Lightweight Jacket. </p><p></p><p>The passthrough pocket provides a place to retreat cold hands to and gives it casual appeal off the bike while the zippered stomach pocket is useful for lighter items like snacks. It also packs into the zippered pocket for tidy storage and fits neatly into a pack. Fox claims the “casual-sized hood will fit a helmet if needed” and we found it a little too small to use comfortably over a helmet, but it did fit very well without one off the bike. The well-designed cuffs extend slightly over the back of your hands, interfacing nicely with gloves, and the elastic at the inside of the wrist kept the sleeves from creeping down onto our palms. </p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikejacket&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Ffox-racing-ranger-wind-pullover-jacket-mens\">Fox Ranger Wind Pullover</a> provides the same comfortable fit as your favorite riding hoody in a more breathable material, with a secure, zippered stomach pocket. At $100, it is also the most affordable mountain bike jacket we tested and a solid value for riders looking to add a comfortable, stylish, wind-blocking option to their closet for brisk mornings, evenings, and shoulder season rides. The casual style also looks good off the bike, making it a versatile option that’s just as well suited for wearing around town or out on a hike.

With an exceptionally soft Merino wool blend back and liner and windproof, tear-resistant nylon front panel and sleeves, the Windblock Jersey is a great way to take the chill out of early mornings, cooler shoulder season days, or high-intensity rides where a jacket is more than you need.</p><p></p><p>The Windblock Jersey is incredibly comfortable and versatile. It’s made from Rapha’s <em>Performance Off Road wool blend</em> which consists of 52% Merino wool and 48% nylon. This fabric comprises the main body of the jersey, the front of which is covered in a wind block and tear-resistant nylon panel. The sleeves are made of a similar wind and tear-resistant fabric that’s a blend of 76% nylon, 13% polyester, and 11% elastane for a little stretch. This combination does wonders to take the chill out of crisp descents and cool breezes while the more open back panel allows heat and moisture to escape. Much like the similar Mons Royale jersey described below, it kept our tester comfortable across temperatures from 50° to 70° F without the need to stop and put on a jacket. </p><p></p><p>The fit is also excellent. It’s relaxed yet streamlined and avoids being excessively baggy and flapping in the wind as you get up to speed. Gusseted underarms allow for a great range of motion and don’t cause it to lift when leaned forward or moving around the bike. The length is also spot on with a dropped tail that keeps the lower back/upper behind covered while riding. Yes, it is expensive, but Rapha has a 30-day satisfaction guarantee, it comes with two patches to repair minor damage to the sleeves, and they offer free repairs for damage you can’t repair yourself. </p><p></p><p>With a spectacular fit, comfortable main body fabric, ability to adapt across a wide temperature range, and excellent wind-blocking ability, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikejacket&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F205731%2Frapha-trail-windblock-bike-jersey-mens%3Fcolor%3DOIL%2520GREEN\">Rapha Trail Windblock Jersey</a> quickly became one of our favorite pieces for cool weather riding.

The Airmap design is claimed to “put air in its place” and the garments feature strategically mapped panels of laminated materials to block wind and moisture where you need and allow maximum breathability where you don’t. The Cache is intended to be a wind blocking and water-resistant layer that is also highly breathable to keep you riding comfortably across a wide range of conditions. Like many 7Mesh products, this jacket is relatively expensive, but it’s a very quality piece that works exactly as intended. </p><p></p><p>The Airmap design concept is a good one, and in the case of the Cache Anorak, it entails a 3-layer windproof and water-resistant material on the front, paired with a 2-layer, super breathable rear side panels, hem, and cuff. This creates a shell that effectively blocks the chill of the wind and resists light rain showers and tire spray as you’re ripping downhill while also being one of the most breathable options we tested. For cool days with variable weather, this is the kind of jacket you can put on and leave on because it breathes so well you’re not overheating or getting drenched in sweat. That said, it does have limitations, and it will be overwhelmed in heavier or more consistent precipitation, but that’s not what it’s designed for either. For the type of cool, variable weather that most people are purposefully going riding in, the Cache Anorak performs beautifully. </p><p></p><p>The fit of the Cache is a lot like a regular hoody, but with slightly extended sleeves and a helmet compatible hood. It is fairly relaxed through the torso, and it is a touch baggier overall than most of the other jackets we tested that have a slimmer fit. Half elastic wrist cuffs help keep them in place and an adjustable hem allows you to cinch it around the waist. The arms are articulated, but only slightly, and this jacket looks as normal off the bike as it does while you’re riding. This makes it quite versatile, and it could easily be worn for trail runs, hikes, or spring backcountry ski missions. It should be noted that the size Small we tested fits a tad bigger than other models we tested in the same size. As with other 7Mesh garments, it’s definitely worth checking their size chart before buying. </p><p></p><p>The hood is well designed and it fits over helmets, though the neck opening is a bit snug at the chin when it is fully zipped. The Cache has a zippered stomach pouch along with a kangaroo pockets with zippers on both sides. There is a lot of storage, but the stomach location isn’t ideal for heavy items as they tend to move around. That said, they are super functional off the bike, and the jacket also packs neatly into the pouch pocket and a couple thin straps are included to attach the packed jacket to the frame for easy transport.</p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikejacket&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2F7mesh-industries-cache-anorak-mens\">7Mesh Cache Anorak</a> is a great mountain bike jacket that successfully balances wind and light water protection with impressive breathability to make it one of the most versatile and comfortable models we tested. There are better options for truly wet weather, but the Cache is perfect for the conditions that most people will find themselves in during the fall and spring. It is hard to look past the $330 price tag, but it is very well made with quality materials and a great design that help justify the expense.

href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=18518&amp;awinaffid=723761&amp;campaign=&amp;clickref=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikejacket&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rapha.cc%2Fus%2Fen_US%2Fshop%2Fmens-trail-lightweight-jacket%2Fproduct%2FTLJ01XXAMC&amp;platform=pl\">Trail Lightweight Jacket</a> is a minimalist’s dream. This super lightweight and packable jacket is constructed of ultra stretchy 100% nylon ripstop and you can easily stash it in a fanny pack or strap it to your bike frame so you’ll barely notice it until you need it. With no lining and non-waterproof materials, the Trail Lightweight isn’t a jacket for storms, but it blocks wind quite effectively and the relaxed fit encourages layering, making it a great lightweight option for brisk, dry days.</p><p></p><p>The Trail Lightweight Jacket is the type of piece you want on those cool days where you can strap it to the bike on the climbs and quickly pull it on to take the chill out of the descents. It’s a simple piece that does its job, and there isn’t a lot to it, but it’s made with signature Rapha style and it has a great fit. The fit is athletic and slightly tailored through the midsection but roomy enough to allow for layering underneath. It avoids being too long or too short, and the armpits are well-executed, allowing your arms to move freely on and off the bike. The hood is on the smaller side, but it fits over helmets though it feels a little constricting with the jacket fully zipped. Given the intended use as a light wind layer, the inability to use the hood effectively with a full zip didn’t bother us much. Though it is not intended for rain, it blocks very light rain and mist and dries quickly when the sun comes back out.</p><p></p><p>The single chest pocket works well for carrying things like a cell phone wasn’t bouncing around excessively, but storage capacity is certainly limited. The pocket is also built to pack the jacket and it comes with a nice cam-lock strap with a tacky rubber backing to attach the jacket to a frame. Strapped to a frame, it stays stable and goes virtually unnoticed, and given its 160-gram weight (size S), and very compact packed dimensions, it’ll fit in your pack or in-frame storage compartment (if you have one) quite easily. </p><p></p><p>With its lightweight, high stretch, packability, and comfortable fit, the <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=18518&amp;awinaffid=723761&amp;campaign=&amp;clickref=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikejacket&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rapha.cc%2Fus%2Fen_US%2Fshop%2Fmens-trail-lightweight-jacket%2Fproduct%2FTLJ01XXAMC&amp;platform=pl\">Rapha Trail Lightweight Jacket</a> is a great choice for those dryer days when you’re not sure if you should bring a jacket or if you know you’ll be wanting one for the descents. It’s not cheap, but it’s a well-executed piece that looks great, takes the chill out of the wind, is there when you need it, and packs away neatly when you don’t. There are four color options, it comes in sizes XS – XXL, and there’s also a <a

Izumi Summit 3L WxB Jacket</a> is intended to keep you dry on the wettest, most miserable days. The 3-layer, recycled 10K/10K waterproof fabric, and PFC-free DWR coating do this very effectively, making the Summit 3L a solid choice for truly terrible weather, and, while it was one of the warmest jackets tested in our test, it breathes quite well for a thicker material/3-layer shell. Pearl Izumi makes it in 3 colors, sizes XS-XL, as well as the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=20053&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikejacket&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pearlizumi.com%2Fproducts%2Fwomens-summit-3l-wxb-jacket-19232203%3Fvariant%3D41490179195051\">Summit 3L WxB Women’s</a>.</p><p></p><p>The fit of the Summit 3L WxB is quite relaxed, roomier in the midsection and through the waist than other mountain bike specific jackets. This makes it a great choice on colder days for layering a riding flannel or mid-layer under and probably giving it the most “normal” (or non-bike specific) fit, comparatively speaking. Thankfully, it also has a drawcord on the waist to cinch it up to keep the elements out when it’s really sloppy or you’re just wearing a thin layer beneath. The adjustable hood is well-executed and works very well with our helmets whether the jacket is fully zipped or not, offering full mobility and staying on reliably. While the two front hand pockets are on the smaller side, they hold their contents (mainly snacks and cell phones) well and are easily accessible.</p><p></p><p>The Summit 3L WxB is similar to many other dedicated rain jackets in that it is a little heavier and it doesn’t pack down quite as small for storage in a pack when not in use. Still, if you need a wet weather jacket that works well both on and off the bike, provides serious rain protection, solid breathability, and is made from a comfortable material, the <a

bike apparel for both men and women. The <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=18518&amp;awinaffid=723761&amp;campaign=&amp;clickref=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikejacket&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rapha.cc%2Fus%2Fen_US%2Fshop%2Fmens-trail-gore-tex-infinium-jacket%2Fproduct%2FSHE01XXAMC&amp;platform=pl\">Rapha Trail Gore-Tex Infinium Jacket</a> is the brand’s top-of-the-line mountain bike jacket intended to be a windproof, breathable, and highly water-resistant outer layer that is “recommended for use in cold, wet conditions”. At $375, it is expensive, but it is made with the same quality craftsmanship and attention to detail that Rapha products are known for.</p><p></p><p>While it is not completely waterproof, Gore-Tex Infinium is becoming quite common in cycling apparel for its ability to block wind, high level of water resistance, and good breathability. In this case, the entire jacket is constructed of a 3-layer 30D nylon ripstop with the Gore-Tex Infinium membrane and C-KNIT backer for stretch and next-to-skin comfort. Under the arms, however, is a stretchier, more breathable panel to allow heat and moisture to escape and provide freedom of movement. With its quality durable water-repellant (DWR) coating, it handles showery conditions and tire spray impressively well, though it should be noted that it is not fully waterproof, nor is it claimed to be. Still, we found it works well for all but the most terrible of conditions.</p><p></p><p>The finish quality of the jacket is excellent and it features Rapha’s understated style with clean lines and a streamlined fit. As for the sizing, Rapha’s MTB tops tend to run a tad large, with our size Small test jacket being slightly oversized on our typically size Small tester. That said, for layering in the deep of winter, a little extra space will be welcome. The hood is large enough to fit over helmets, and the drop tail helps keep the spray off your bum and lower back. The lower hem also features drawcords should you want to cinch it up.</p><p></p><p>Despite the Trail Infinium jacket’s impressive build construction and weather resistance, we have a few small gripes. The two zippered chest pockets, one internal and one external, can fit a phone and some other small items, but the overall storage capacity is pretty limited and they don’t provide anywhere to put your hands. The elasticized wrist cuffs also limit their ability to be worn over the cuffs of gloves to seal out the elements. And, while it is relatively breathable, it can still feel a little stuffy when the temps rise or your riding intensity is high. There’s also the price.</p><p></p><p>All that said, the <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=18518&amp;awinaffid=723761&amp;campaign=&amp;clickref=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikejacket&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rapha.cc%2Fus%2Fen_US%2Fshop%2Fmens-trail-gore-tex-infinium-jacket%2Fproduct%2FSHE01XXAMC&amp;platform=pl\">Rapha Trail Gore-Tex Infinium Jacket</a> is an otherwise impressive option that will keep you warm and dry through all but the absolute worst of rainy weather. It’s a great-looking, well-made, windproof, and very water-resistant jacket that doesn’t come cheap but will likely please anyone willing to make the spend.</p><p></p><p>You can find out more in our

Royale Tarn Merino Shift Wind Jersey</a> is a wind-blocking long sleeve that may likely serve you better than a jacket for a lot of shoulder season riding days. Made from a fabric that Mons Royale calls <em>Merino Shift</em> (52% Merino wool/35% polyester/13% nylon), this jersey features a 100% recycled Pertex Quantum front panel that protects the torso from the chilling effect of the wind as you ride.</p><p></p><p>New Zealand based Mons Royale has been putting out quality merino wool garments since 2009 with the goal of reducing environmental impact through the use of sustainable natural fibers. That continues with their current line of mountain bike apparel, including the Tarn Wind jersey. The Merino Shift wool blend fabric feels good against the skin while remaining breathable and comfortable across a wide temperature range and resisting odor better than synthetics. The entire jersey is comprised of this material and the Pertex Quantum fabric covers the entire front from the neck down to the hem at the waist. The warmth of the Merino proved to be perfect for rides in the 50° to 70° F range, and the wind-blocking front panel blocks the chill effectively enough that you don’t feel compelled to reach for a jacket every time you go downhill.</p><p></p><p>The overall fit of the Tarn Wind jersey is relaxed, although we feel it runs a bit large. Our six-foot-tall tester fit very comfortably in a size Medium, and even then the sleeves were a tiny bit long and the neck opening a tad loose for his taste. That said, it allows for excellent freedom of movement and the drop tail hangs a little lower in the back to keep some of the early and late season mud splatter off your behind. It is worth mentioning that the Pertex layer on the front does add a little weight in this area, and occasionally gives the sensation of it tugging down on the front. </p><p></p><p>Beyond that minor qualm, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10270&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikejacket&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.evo.com%2Fjerseys%2Fmons-royale-tarn-merino-shift-wind-jersey%23image%3D239117%2F995923%2Fmons-royale-tarn-merino-shift-wind-jersey-.jpg\">Mons Royale Tarn Merino Shift Wind Jersey</a> quickly became one of the most used cool weather options in our tester’s collection for cool, dry rides through the fall. It’s also a great option for layering under a jacket on cold days, and could easily double as a shirt or baselayer for other outdoor activities. At $140, it’s kind of expensive for a jersey, but it’s a quality piece that sees more use than most of our jackets.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a

North America and Europe where most of us encounter all four seasons. And, we don’t stop riding because the temperatures drop and the weather changes. Instead, we gear up and get out there. Riding bikes is a big part of the job, after all, but keeping the wheels spinning through fall winter and spring requires the proper gear to keep it enjoyable, and we have all learned the importance of having a good mountain bike jacket to keep the cold, wind, and water from ruining our fun. We’re also lucky to get to test lots of the best new gear, so we’ve got an inside track on the best mountain bike jackets on the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For our mountain bike jackets buyer’s guide, Bikerumor contributor, Paul Clauss tested the majority of the models in this review. Paul lives in northern Vermont where riding in the fall and spring means dealing with cool to frigid temperatures, frequent rain storms, and rain-soaked trail conditions, and having a quality mountain bike jacket or two is critical to staying warm and/or dry. A mechanical engineer by trade, Paul is also quite adept at analyzing designs and constructions and putting products through their paces to determine their performance differences. Paul has spent lots of time testing gear this year, including the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-flat-pedal-shoes/\">best mountain bike flat pedal shoes</a> and the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-flat-pedals/\">flat pedals</a> to go with them. In addition to Paul’s testing, we also drew from Bikerumor’s editorial staff and included several products that were tested by various members of our team. Rest assured, every product included here has been thoroughly tested for at least several weeks, and in some cases many months or more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How We Tested Mountain Bike Jackets</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We strive to provide our readers with trustworthy reviews to help inform your purchase decisions, so every product in this buyer’s guide has been tested in the real world to see how it performs. To test these mountain bike jackets, we weighed them for consistency and comparison to the manufacturer’s specs and packed them into their smallest packed size to see how portable they were. We closely examined the materials, constructions, seams, and zippers to assess the quality of craftsmanship and attention to detail. The fit of each model was examined both at home and, most importantly, out on the trail to get a sense of how well they cover the body, move with you while you ride, and function on the bike. Features like hoods, pockets, and adjustments were analyzed to assess their functionality and usefulness. And, each model was used for extended periods in the temperature and weather conditions for which it was intended, including cold, windy fall days, crisp, frosty mornings, rainstorms, rain showers, and even a few hose tests. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MTB-Jackets-testing.jpeg\"><img width=\"1311\" height=\"874\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MTB-Jackets-testing.jpeg\" alt=\"Testing mountain bike jackets on the trail with fall foliage\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MTB-Jackets-testing.jpeg 1311w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MTB-Jackets-testing-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MTB-Jackets-testing-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MTB-Jackets-testing-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MTB-Jackets-testing-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MTB-Jackets-testing-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Testing jackets on bike rides in cool fall weather is critical to seeing how they perform in the real world.

One of the most important is the intended use or the conditions you’ll be encountering on your fall, winter, and spring rides. This will help you narrow down your search to a specific type of jacket that will be best suited to your needs whether that’s wind, water-resistance, or both. After that, other factors like fit, materials, packability, breathability, pockets, features, and price are other considerations depending on your specific needs and budget.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Intended Use</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The type of temperature and weather conditions you intend to be riding in will be the most important factor in deciding what type of jacket you need. The jackets we tested range from lightweight wind shells to burly waterproof rain jackets and models that intend to strike a balance between those extremes. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rapha-Trail-Lightweight-Wind-Jacket-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rapha-Trail-Lightweight-Wind-Jacket-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"The Rapha Trail Lightweight Jacket is a good example of a wind jacket\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rapha-Trail-Lightweight-Wind-Jacket-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rapha-Trail-Lightweight-Wind-Jacket-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rapha-Trail-Lightweight-Wind-Jacket-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rapha-Trail-Lightweight-Wind-Jacket-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rapha-Trail-Lightweight-Wind-Jacket-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rapha-Trail-Lightweight-Wind-Jacket-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rapha-Trail-Lightweight-Wind-Jacket-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rapha-Trail-Lightweight-Wind-Jacket-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Thin, super lightweight, very packable, the Rapha Trail Lightweight Lightweight is a great wind jacket. (photo: Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Wind</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you generally try to avoid riding in the rain and simply need something to protect you from the chilling bite of the wind, a wind jacket, or possibly a wind jersey may be the best bet. Wind-resistant jackets are a great option to have for cold mornings or chilly spring or fall days when it is generally dry. They are typically lightweight and made from thinner breathable materials, and they are often quite packable. While they often feature a durable water-repellant (DWR) coating and can be a good option in very light precipitation and are effective for handling splashes from puddles or mud, they are usually not intended to be fully waterproof.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-MT500-Waterproof-Water-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-MT500-Waterproof-Water-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Water beading on the sleeve of the Endura MT500 Waterproof Jacket II\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-MT500-Waterproof-Water-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-MT500-Waterproof-Water-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-MT500-Waterproof-Water-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-MT500-Waterproof-Water-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-MT500-Waterproof-Water-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-MT500-Waterproof-Water-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-MT500-Waterproof-Water-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-MT500-Waterproof-Water-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>When it’s really raining, there’s no substitute for a burly waterproof model like the Endura MT500 Waterproof Jacket II. This jacket kept us dry on one of the wettest days we’ve ever ridden. (photo: Jeremy Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Rain</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you purposefully ride when it’s raining or often find yourself getting caught out in rainstorms, then a waterproof (or highly water-resistant) jacket is probably the right call. Waterproof jackets typically incorporate waterproof membranes into their constructions, which, along with taped seams, intend to completely block all water from making its way inside. These materials are almost always treated with a DWR coating to the outside to promote the water beading running off as opposed to soaking into the outermost layer of the fabric. While modern materials allow truly waterproof jackets to be fairly breathable, they are generally a bit warmer and less breathable than thinner windbreaker options. A good waterproof shell should keep you dry in the most extreme wet weather conditions you are likely to encounter on a ride and is a necessity in some areas like the damp Northeast and Pacific Northwest of the US, or the UK. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MTB-jacket-versatile.jpeg\"><img width=\"1156\" height=\"771\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MTB-jacket-versatile.jpeg\" alt=\"Riding in a windproof and highly water-resistant mountain bike jcaket\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MTB-jacket-versatile.jpeg 1156w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MTB-jacket-versatile-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MTB-jacket-versatile-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MTB-jacket-versatile-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MTB-jacket-versatile-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/MTB-jacket-versatile-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Many jackets hit the middle ground where they block the wind and repel water quite effectively without being completely waterproof. These versatile options keep the chill off your body and give you the peace of mind that they have your back if the weather changes its mind. (photo: Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Wind and Light Rain</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>For many riders, a simple wind layer may not be quite enough and a full-on rain jacket may be overkill, so thankfully there are options that fall into the middle of the spectrum. These highly versatile jackets provide great wind protection and a high level of water resistance and are capable of fending off light rains, intermittent showers, and tire spray from rain-soaked trails. With a DWR coating and water-resistant materials, these jackets are not fully waterproof, but they will still typically keep you dry in most conditions short of heavy rain, which most of us try to avoid anyway. They also tend to dry very quickly, making them a great option for riding on those unsettled days when the weather just can’t seem to make up its mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Cold</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you ride when it’s really cold, then you definitely want to block the wind and you probably also want some insulation. Both wind and waterproof jackets will add a layer of protection from the wind that takes the edge off the chill, and smart layering underneath is one of the best ways to gear up for a winter ride, similar to going skiing. In general, the thicker materials used on waterproof jackets will provide a touch more warmth than light wind layers. When it’s really, really cold, many people will opt for insulated jackets or mid-layers to help maintain body heat. While we didn’t test any insulated jackets, there are lots of great options on the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Gore-wear-Endure-materials-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Gore-wear-Endure-materials-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"The inside of the hood of the Gorewear Endure jacket showing the Gore-Tex PACLITE materials and taped seams\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Gore-wear-Endure-materials-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Gore-wear-Endure-materials-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Gore-wear-Endure-materials-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Gore-wear-Endure-materials-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Gore-wear-Endure-materials-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Gore-wear-Endure-materials-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Gore-wear-Endure-materials-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Gore-wear-Endure-materials-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>A look at the inside of the Gorewear Endure jacket shows the Gore-Tex PACLITE waterproof material and taped seams to keep water out.

These range from superlight wind-blocking fabrics to heavy-duty fully waterproof materials. Wind jackets have the easiest job and are generally made from lightweight, stretch nylon or polyester that only aims to block the wind and/or splashes from puddles. These materials are often treated with a DWR to help shed light amounts of water. Examples of wind jackets we tested are the Rapha Trail Lightweight and the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikejacket&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Ffox-racing-ranger-wind-pullover-jacket-mens\">Fox Ranger Wind Pullover</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Waterproof jackets are typically made from more advanced fabrics that include waterproof membranes like the Gore-Tex PACLITE used in the Gorewear Endure, or the ExoShell 40DR used in the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikejacket&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fendura-mt500-waterproof-jacket-mens\">Endura MT500 Waterproof Jacket II,</a> as examples. Waterproof fabrics vary in weight, thickness, breathability, and even water resistance, and while they all get the job done, they are not created equal. Jackets made from waterproof materials typically have a couple of numbers associated with them, like 10K/10K, that provide ratings for waterproofness and breathability, respectively. These numbers are derived by lab tests to determine where they land on the rating scale. The higher the numbers, the more waterproof and breathable a material is, and vice versa. Additionally, these materials are almost always treated with a DWR to shed water at the surface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In between the lighter wind materials and the completely waterproof options are those that are wind-blocking and highly water-resistant. These are essentially a hybrid of the two. While not completely waterproof, these jackets are typically a bit lighter, more easily packable, and more breathable than rain jackets while still providing enough water resistance for most situations. Gore-Tex Infinium is a commonly used membrane found in the <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=18518&amp;awinaffid=723761&amp;campaign=&amp;clickref=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikejacket&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rapha.cc%2Fus%2Fen_US%2Fshop%2Fmens-trail-gore-tex-infinium-jacket%2Fproduct%2FSHE01XXAMC&amp;platform=pl\">Rapha Trail Gore-Tex Infinium Jacket</a> and parts of the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=22233&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikejacket&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gorewear.com%2Fus%2Fen-us%2Flupra-jacket-mens-100853\">Gorewear Lupra Jacket</a> that blocks wind and repels water well in most situations short of proper downpours. Likewise, the Patagonia Dirt Roamer Jacket works similarly with a great DWR that sheds water very effectively, but only up to a point. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/rapha-trail-gore-tex-infinium-jacket-1.jpeg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/rapha-trail-gore-tex-infinium-jacket-1.jpeg\" alt=\"Water beading off the Rapha Trail Gore-Tex Infinium jacket\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/rapha-trail-gore-tex-infinium-jacket-1.jpeg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/rapha-trail-gore-tex-infinium-jacket-1-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/rapha-trail-gore-tex-infinium-jacket-1-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/rapha-trail-gore-tex-infinium-jacket-1-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/rapha-trail-gore-tex-infinium-jacket-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/rapha-trail-gore-tex-infinium-jacket-1-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/rapha-trail-gore-tex-infinium-jacket-1-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>A good DWR, like that used on the Rapha Trail Gore-Tex Infinium Jacket, will make water bead and roll right off. (photo: Jessie-May Morgan)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Durable Water-Repellant (DWR)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>DWR treatments/coating/finishes have been around for many years and they are a treatment applied to the outside of most jackets that causes water to bead up and run off of the material as opposed to soaking in. These treatments work very effectively when garments are new, however, they do break down over time, use, and exposure to the sun, water, mud, dirt, etc. When this happens, you’ll notice the outermost layer of the material may begin to “wet out” or absorb some of the water on the surface. With a truly waterproof membrane underneath, you’ll still stay dry, but this can have an adverse effect on the material’s breathability. Often, simply washing your jacket can help to revitalize the DWR, but eventually, it will probably need to be reapplied. Nikwax makes a number of wash-in DWR replenishment products for use at home that work quite well and there are technical equipment cleaners that may be able to do it for you. Before doing any at-home DWR treatments, however, we recommend checking with the manufacturer for specific recommendations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When DWR treatments first came out, they were mostly made from “forever chemicals” that had toxic by-products that persist in the environment and are “possibly carcinogenic” according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer. These chemicals, often referred to as PFAs and/or PFCs were even banned in many countries. Brands have been seeking alternatives, and these days most companies are claiming to use PFC-free or non-toxic DWR treatments on their garments. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Fox-Ranger-Wind-Pullover-Fit-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Fox-Ranger-Wind-Pullover-Fit-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"The Fox Ranger Wind Pullover seen from the back to demonstrate fit\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Fox-Ranger-Wind-Pullover-Fit-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Fox-Ranger-Wind-Pullover-Fit-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Fox-Ranger-Wind-Pullover-Fit-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Fox-Ranger-Wind-Pullover-Fit-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Fox-Ranger-Wind-Pullover-Fit-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Fox-Ranger-Wind-Pullover-Fit-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Fox-Ranger-Wind-Pullover-Fit-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Fox-Ranger-Wind-Pullover-Fit-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>As always, fit is a personal preference, but the majority of mountain bike jackets are fairly trim through the torso with extended ream hems to combat tire spray. (photo: Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fit</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Like all outerwear, a jacket should fit well and allow a full range of motion on and off the bike. Most of the jackets we tested have mountain bike specific fits optimized for riding – a slim midsection, articulated arms, gusseted underarms, an extended rear waist hem to keep your hindquarters dry, and a large hood for use with helmets. The fits are tailored but relaxed – loose enough to be comfortable on and off the bike and layer underneat, but streamlined enough to not flap around excessively, fall over your hands, or catch on your seat while riding. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For mountain biking, we’ve found that it’s important to get the right size, as a jacket that is too small can restrict movement or be uncomfortable and one that is too large might flap excessively in the wind, snag on your saddle, or have sleeves that extend down too far over your hands. In general, going with the same size you usually buy for jerseys or casual wear will probably work well, but not always. When in doubt, check your measurements and reference a brand’s size chart. Some brands show pictures of models along with their dimensions and the size they are wearing for reference. And, if possible, trying something on before you buy is always the best way to ensure you get something that fits. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have noticed in the past few years that many brands’ sizing has been trending a little larger than it used to. For example, one of our testers is a 6-foot-tall male who has been a size Large top for as long as he can remember. Recently, he has been easily and comfortably fitting into size Medium jerseys and jackets, despite the fact that his body size hasn’t changed. That said, it’s worth double-checking size charts before you buy, or buying something that can easily be returned or exchanged if it doesn’t fit quite right. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Features</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the type of jacket, the features you need or want may vary depending on the intended use. Most wind and rain jackets feature hoods, several pockets, ventilation, and a variety of adjustments to dial them into your needs or the conditions. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Gorewear-Endure-Hood-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Gorewear-Endure-Hood-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"The hood of the Gorewear Endure jacket shown up over a mountain bike helmet\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Gorewear-Endure-Hood-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Gorewear-Endure-Hood-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Gorewear-Endure-Hood-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Gorewear-Endure-Hood-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Gorewear-Endure-Hood-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Gorewear-Endure-Hood-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Gorewear-Endure-Hood-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Gorewear-Endure-Hood-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Hood designs vary, and the Gorewear Endure, pictured here, and the Gorewear Lupra jackets have a couple of the best among the models we tested. (photo: Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Hood</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>All of the jackets we tested have one thing in common, a hood. Not all hoods are created equal, of course, and some are executed far better than others. Things we look for in a hood on a mountain bike jacket are the ability for it to fit over a helmet comfortably and securely, adjustability, and for it to move with your head without constricting or getting into the peripheral vision. Of course, it’s also nice when they tuck away neatly and/or sit comfortably behind the head when not in use. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/rapha-gore-tex-infinium-hybrid-trail-jacket-pocket.jpeg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/rapha-gore-tex-infinium-hybrid-trail-jacket-pocket.jpeg\" alt=\"Putting a phone in the chest pocket of the Rapha Gore-Tex Infinium jacket\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/rapha-gore-tex-infinium-hybrid-trail-jacket-pocket.jpeg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/rapha-gore-tex-infinium-hybrid-trail-jacket-pocket-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/rapha-gore-tex-infinium-hybrid-trail-jacket-pocket-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/rapha-gore-tex-infinium-hybrid-trail-jacket-pocket-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/rapha-gore-tex-infinium-hybrid-trail-jacket-pocket-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/rapha-gore-tex-infinium-hybrid-trail-jacket-pocket-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/rapha-gore-tex-infinium-hybrid-trail-jacket-pocket-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Storage needs vary as do the number of pockets on jackets. The Rapha Trail Gore-Tex Infinium Jacket has a single pocket that’s large enough to fit a phone or similar item. (photo: Jessie-May Morgan)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Pockets</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on what you like to carry with you when you ride, pockets may or may not be a big consideration. The jackets we tested vary considerably in the number, placement, and storage capacity of their pockets. If you’re a minimalist or you carry most of your essentials in shorts/pants pockets, cargo bib pockets, in-frame storage, or a pack of some kind, then a jacket with a single pocket might be just fine for your needs. If you want to carry a phone, wallet, keys, snacks, and tools in your jacket, then you’ll probably want to look for something with several pockets and ample storage space. The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikejacket&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Fendura-mt500-waterproof-jacket-mens\">Endura MT500 Waterproof Jacket II</a> has the most pockets and storage capacity of all the models we tested, plus they are well executed and designed to stay out of the way of pack straps. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-Wrist-Cuffs-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-Wrist-Cuffs-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"The adjustable wrist cuffs on the Endura Singletrack II Jacket\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-Wrist-Cuffs-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-Wrist-Cuffs-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-Wrist-Cuffs-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-Wrist-Cuffs-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-Wrist-Cuffs-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-Wrist-Cuffs-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-Wrist-Cuffs-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-Wrist-Cuffs-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Extended wrist cuffs, like those on the Endura Singletrack II Jacket, provide a little extra coverage, while the adjustability allows you to fit them over gloves and seal out the elements when needed. (photo: Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Wrist Cuffs</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Wrist cuff designs vary by brand and intended use of the jacket. Most mountain bike jackets have extended cuffs that hang a little farther than normal so they don’t ride up when you’re leaning forward and to cover the back of the wrist/bottom of gloves. Some have elastic to keep them semi-tightened around the wrist while others are adjustable through velcro straps. What works best for you will depend on the conditions you’re riding in and how you want them to interface with your gloves (if you wear them). If, for example, you’re riding in extremely wet or cold conditions, you may want to be able to tighten the wrist cuff around your gloves to seal out the water or frigid air. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Drawcord Hem</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The majority of mountain bike jackets have a drawcord hem that can be used to cinch the bottom of the jacket tight around the body. While many riders may never feel the need to use such an adjustment, it is a nice feature to have on particularly cold or wet days to prevent cold air or water/mud from entering up through the bottom of the jacket.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-MT500-Waterproof-Pockets-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-MT500-Waterproof-Pockets-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"The inside of the mesh lined pockets that double as vents on the Endura MT500 Waterproof Jacket II\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-MT500-Waterproof-Pockets-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-MT500-Waterproof-Pockets-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-MT500-Waterproof-Pockets-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-MT500-Waterproof-Pockets-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-MT500-Waterproof-Pockets-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-MT500-Waterproof-Pockets-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-MT500-Waterproof-Pockets-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Endura-MT500-Waterproof-Pockets-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The Endura MT500 Waterproof Jacket features massive pit vents and the mesh-lined pockets double as vents when they aren’t carrying your stuff. (photo: Jeremy Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>Ventilation</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Many jackets rely on the breathability of the materials to allow heat and moisture to escape. Often, especially in the case of rain-specific jackets, that isn’t enough, so some have armpit and/or pocket vents built into their designs. Vents can be a great feature to evacuate body-generated heat if/when the material can’t do it for you. Of course, unzipping the front zipper is also an excellent way to get some air flowing inside the jacket. Both the Endura Singletrack II and the MT500 Waterproof II feature ventilation. Adding vents to a jacket does have the adverse effect of adding weight and decreasing packability.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Breathability</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When we ride we generate body heat and perspire, even when it’s cold and/or rainy. This is especially true when riding with a jacket as most are not nearly as breathable as riding without one. And, when riding in the cold, being wet with sweat can make you feel even colder when you are in the wind or start riding downhill. Regulating temperature is tricky, and something that the user needs to stay on top of because even the most breathable waterproof fabric still ends up trapping user-generated heat and moisture. Some fabrics perform much better in this regard, effectively allowing your heat and moisture to escape while keeping chilling wind and water from getting in, while others are a bit stuffier and feel wet on the inside. The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10083&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikejacket&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.patagonia.com%2Fproduct%2Fmens-dirt-roamer-mountain-bike-jacket%2F24381.html%3Fdwvar_24381_color%3DBSNG%26cgid%3Dsport-mountain-biking-mens-jackets\">Patagonia Dirt Roamer Jacket</a> is impressively breathable and helps to maintain a consistent comfort level inside the jacket, making it easier to leave on all the time without overheating or getting drenched in sweat. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Dirt-Roamer-Packability-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Dirt-Roamer-Packability-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"The Patagonia Dirt Roamer mountain bike jacket packed into its pocket and compared to a pair of gloves and water bottle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Dirt-Roamer-Packability-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Dirt-Roamer-Packability-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Dirt-Roamer-Packability-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Dirt-Roamer-Packability-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Dirt-Roamer-Packability-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Dirt-Roamer-Packability-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Dirt-Roamer-Packability-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Dirt-Roamer-Packability-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The Patagonia Dirt Roamer Jacket packs into its own pocket and is roughly the size of a small water bottle. It’s easy to fit into a fanny pack, and it’s also very lightweight too. (photo: Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Packability</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For those among us who like to bring a jacket on a ride in the off chance it might rain or because you know you’ll be taking it off the climbs and putting it back on for the descents, packability, and weight, is an important consideration. Our storage space, whether it’s in a fanny pack, backpack, cargo bib pocket, or in-frame storage, is relatively finite, so being able to pack your jacket down to a compact size that fits in that space is essential. For those carrying a jacket, weight is also a concern, and typically, the lighter the better. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to packability, the lighter wind jackets typically take the cake. For example, the <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=18518&amp;awinaffid=723761&amp;campaign=&amp;clickref=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikejacket&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rapha.cc%2Fus%2Fen_US%2Fshop%2Fmens-trail-lightweight-jacket%2Fproduct%2FTLJ01XXAMC&amp;platform=pl\">Rapha Trail Lightweight</a> jacket weighs just 160 grams (size S) and packs into the chest pocket to a tiny size. Additionally, it comes with a strap that can be used to stash it on your frame when not in use. Likewise, the Patagonia Dirt Roamer Jacket weighs just 219 grams (size S), stuffs into its own pocket, and is approximately the size of a 20-ounce water bottle. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast, the thicker materials used in most waterproof jackets make them a bit heavier and they aren’t able to pack down quite as small. The exception to this rule is the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikejacket&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F214890%2Fgorewear-endure-cycling-jacket-mens%3Fcolor%3DGREY\">Gorewear Endure</a> which is made with Gore-Tex PACLITE, weighs just 280 grams (size S), and is about as packable as fully waterproof jackets get. On the flip side of that coin is the Endura MT500 Waterproof Jacket II which weighs 550 grams (size M) and would be nearly impossible to fit into a fanny pack if you had to take it off.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rapha-Trail-Lightweight-Packability-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rapha-Trail-Lightweight-Packability-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"The Rapha Trail Lightweight Jacket packed into its own pocket and strapped to a mountain bike frame\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rapha-Trail-Lightweight-Packability-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rapha-Trail-Lightweight-Packability-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rapha-Trail-Lightweight-Packability-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rapha-Trail-Lightweight-Packability-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rapha-Trail-Lightweight-Packability-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rapha-Trail-Lightweight-Packability-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rapha-Trail-Lightweight-Packability-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rapha-Trail-Lightweight-Packability-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Rapha’s Trail Lightweight jacket is another standout for its packability.

While they are obviously not jackets, a wind-blocking long-sleeve jersey can be the perfect layer to wear on cool days when all you really need is to take the bite out of the wind to stay comfortable. The two options we tested, the Rapha Trail Windblock Jersey and the Mons Royale Tarn Merino Shift Wind Jersey, both feature merino wool blend fabrics that comprise the main body, covered by a wind-blocking nylon front panel to keep the wind off your torso. We found both of these jerseys to be excellent for cool temperatures where you generate some body heat on the climbs but might catch a chill on the decents. They proved to be exceptionally versatile pieces that get a lot of use in the fall and spring. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rapha-Trail-Windblock-Jersey-1-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rapha-Trail-Windblock-Jersey-1-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Wearing the Rapha Trail Windblock Jersey\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rapha-Trail-Windblock-Jersey-1-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rapha-Trail-Windblock-Jersey-1-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rapha-Trail-Windblock-Jersey-1-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rapha-Trail-Windblock-Jersey-1-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rapha-Trail-Windblock-Jersey-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rapha-Trail-Windblock-Jersey-1-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rapha-Trail-Windblock-Jersey-1-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Rapha-Trail-Windblock-Jersey-1-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>For a lot of fall, spring, and early morning riding, a windblock jersey like the Rapha Trail might be a more comfortable and versatile option. (photo: Paul Clauss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Value</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a large variation in price between the jacket models we tested, and like anything else in the sport of mountain biking, they can be quite expensive. Spending more on a jacket typically gets you higher quality materials, construction, or something unique that excels in a specific way like waterproofness or packability (maybe both). Other times it gets you those things plus a brand name. While we certainly love looking fancy in expensive gear, we also appreciate a good value, and we know a lot of other people do too. So, sure, you can spend $330 to get the bombproof Endura MT500 Waterproof Jacket II, or you can save over a hundred bucks and get the Endura Singletrack II which performs nearly on par with its more expensive sibling. Yes, the Singletrack II isn’t technically as waterproof as the MT500, but it’s got to be so miserable outside to matter that you probably shouldn’t be out there anyway. Similarly, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikejacket&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F225567%2Ffox-ranger-25-layer-water-bike-jacket-mens%3Fcolor%3DORANGE\">Fox Ranger 2.5L Water Jacket </a>costs even less and gets the job done while looking pretty snappy to boot. And, if you’re only looking for a wind jacket, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=11465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgapparelcyclingmountainbikejacket&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.competitivecyclist.com%2Ffox-racing-ranger-wind-pullover-jacket-mens\">Fox Ranger Wind Pullover</a> is the least expensive option we tested, yet it performs well while having a casual style that doesn’t pigeonhole it as strictly a riding piece. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Mountain Bike Jackets</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><div><div><div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Why should I buy a mountain bike jacket? </div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>While you definitely can and many people do ride mountain bikes in jackets not specifically designed for mountain biking, we prefer riding in jackets made for the task for several reasons. Mountain bike jackets have bike-specific designs, cuts, and features that are purpose-built for riding a bike. Things like articulated arms and gusseted underarms are made for being in the riding position and they help prevent the jacket from riding up when you’re leaning forward or moving around on the bike. Many jackets have tailored fits that are streamlined to avoid excessive bagginess, along with having a longer rear hem that drops down to cover more of your backside and protect it from tire spray. Hoods that fit over helmets are another important feature, as well as pockets designed to carry stuff while you ride and stay out of the way of pack straps. Packability is another consideration as many mountain bike jackets are designed to pack down small to make them easy to carry when not in use.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>What kind of jacket do I need?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>What kind of weather will you be encountering on your rides? Considering the conditions you expect to encounter in the fall, winter, and spring will help you zero in on the type of jacket you need. If you never ride in the rain, then a wind jacket should probably do the trick. If you always ride in the rain, then you’re going to need a waterproof jacket. For many people, having multiple jackets might be necessary to cover the spectrum of riding conditions they will encounter, while others can go for a versatile all-arounder that does the trick pretty much all of the time.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>What do numbers like 10K/10K mean?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Waterproof jackets are often rated on a waterproof/breathability scale that is represented in _K/_K. Though not all the jackets we tested use this measurement, it is relatively standard and can be used to estimate the water resistance and breathability of a material. The first number refers to water column pressure – representing the water in pressure that can be exerted on the fabric before it soaks through. A garment with a 10K rating can withstand a water column pressure of 10,000mm before water permeates the material. The higher the number, the more waterproof the material is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second number in the rating refers to breathability, indicating the amount of moisture in grams that can pass through a square meter of fabric in a 24-hour period, estimating how easily moisture generated by your body escapes through the material. Higher breathability ratings mean better moisture management and should feel less clammy or sticky when worn in warmer or more humid conditions.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>How do take care of a mountain bike jacket?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>It really depends on the jacket. Definitely take a look at the care instructions on the tag or on the brand’s website to make sure you do it correctly. Simple wind jackets can often just get machine-washed and hung to dry and they are basically good as new. Waterproof materials and those that are treated with DWR often need to be washed with a bit more care, and the DWR treatments do occasionally need to be reapplied. Wash-in DWR treatments, such as Nikwax, can work pretty well, but it is always best to check the manufacturer’s recommendations for reapplication. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>\n\n\n<div><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-helmet/?sce=post-related-link\"><div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"mountain bike helmets\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_9921-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></div><div><h2>The Best Mountain Bike Helmets of 2023</h2><p> <span>Read more…</span></p></div></a></div>\n\n\n<div><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-shorts/?sce=post-related-link\"><div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Mountain-bike-shorts-lead-image-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Group shot of mountain bike shorts tested\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Mountain-bike-shorts-lead-image-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Mountain-bike-shorts-lead-image-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Mountain-bike-shorts-lead-image-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Mountain-bike-shorts-lead-image-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Mountain-bike-shorts-lead-image-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Mountain-bike-shorts-lead-image-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Mountain-bike-shorts-lead-image-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Mountain-bike-shorts-lead-image-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></div><div><h2>The Best Mountain Bike Shorts of 2023</h2><p> <span>Read more…</span></p></div></a></div>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-jackets/\">The Best Mountain Bike Jackets of 2023</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jeremy Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"014041b67255a7811d41ba753a8d709449234c5f61b8074a0ac84fffc19cf639","category":"Cycling"}
