The new R5 comes in four different models and ranges in price from £8,299 to £11,699, whilst a frameset costs £4,499.</p>\n<p>The R5 will come in a range of different builds with a choice of SRAM Red eTap AXS, <a href=\"/sram/9438/sram-force-etap-axs-groupset-review\">SRAM Force eTap AXS</a> or <a href=\"/reviews/9947/shimano-dura-ace-r9200-and-ultegra-r8100-shimano-finally-goes-12-speed\">Shimano’s new 12-speed groupsets</a>, Dura-Ace Di2 R9270 and Ultegra Di2 R8170.</p>\n<p>A popular modern classic, the R-series has been winning pro races since 2003 and has roots going back <a href=\"/in-depth/7978/faster-always-faster-the-story-of-cervelo\">nearly 20 years</a>.</p>\n<h3>2022 Cervélo R5: Stiffer, squishier, lighter, aero-er</h3>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/09/85e_0355.jpg?itok=bfFTxF8P\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Reducing stiffness in a climbing bike might seem slightly outlandish but Cervélo has dived right in with the new R5.</p>\n<p>The fork has been refined with dialled back longitudinal stiffness, the head tube stiffness has also been reduced and compliance has been added by dropping the top tube.</p>\n<p>Compared to the previous generation R5, Cervélo’s stiffest ever road frame and whose climbing abilities ‘came at the expense of a bit of bone-jarring’, the newly refined R5 not only promises efficient and fast climbing but also ‘less fatigue and more effective recovery’.</p>\n<p>According to Cervélo, Tom Dumoulin has been the prime candidate for testing the new R5 and ‘loves it’ whilst Primož Roglič has said ‘it’s good’.</p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/09/0h0r5grx1c_detail3.jpg?itok=918KuJiN\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>The new R5 frameset benefits from a claimed 16% weight reduction, making it 130g lighter than the previous model.</p>\n<p>It weighs in at just over 1kg, with the new frame at 703g and new fork at 329g.</p>\n<p>And Cervélo hasn’t stopped the trim there. The handlebar and stem have apparently shed 12g and the seatpost is 20g lighter too.</p>\n<p>Cervélo says that even though aerodynamics weren’t a focus for the new R5 (like they would be for the S5 and P5), the cables are now internal, reducing drag by a claimed 25g.</p>\n<p>According to the brand, all of this combines to make the R5 ‘faster in every direction’.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/1015/paris-roubaix-all-you-need-to-know\">Paris-Roubaix 2021: Route, start list and all you need to know</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/6300/photo-essay-the-brutal-reality-of-paris-roubaix\">Photo Essay: The brutal reality of Paris-Roubaix </a></div>      <div><a href=\"/buying-guides/677/gifts-for-cyclists\">Best gifts for cyclists: presents for the cyclist in your life</a></div>    </div></div><h3><span>2022 Cervélo R5 geometry</span></h3>\n<p>The new R5’s geometry isn’t anything out of the ordinary for a race bike.</p>\n<p>Reach and stack for a size 54cm are 380mm and 547mm respectively while head tube angles range from 71 to 73 degrees across the size range.</p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/09/0h0r5grx1c_detail2.jpg?itok=1Z6Iko2f\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>A notable feature is the increased tyre clearance of 34mm, compared with 30mm in the previous model.</p>\n<p>The R5 range comes in five black and lime/black whilst the frameset is also offered as a Jumbo-Visma replica.</p>\n<p>Sizes range from 48cm to 61cm.</p>\n<h3>Cervélo R5 specs, prices and availability</h3>\n<h4>Cervélo R5 Red eTap AXS</h4>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/09/0h0r5grx1c_r5_redaxs_fiveblack_profile.png?itok=Yyst1_0H\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li>Frameset: Carbon</li>\n<li>Groupset: SRAM RED eTap AXS HRD 12-speed</li>\n<li>Wheels: Reserve DT240 XDR</li>\n<li>Availability: Likely end of 2021</li>\n<li>Price: £11,699 / $12,000 / €11,999</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Cervélo R5 Force eTap AXS</h4>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/09/0h0r5gfx2c_r5_forceaxs_limeblack_profile.png?itok=paDRq4A9\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li>Frameset: Carbon</li>\n<li>Groupset: SRAM Force eTap AXS HRD 12-speed</li>\n<li>Wheels: Reserve DT370 XDR</li>\n<li>Availability: Likely end of 2021</li>\n<li>Price: £8,599 / $8,400 / €8,799</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Cervélo R5 Dura Ace Di2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Frameset: Carbon</li>\n<li>Groupset: Shimano Dura-Ace Di2 R9270 12-speed</li>\n<li>Wheels: Reserve DT240</li>\n<li>Availability: Likely end of 2021</li>\n<li>Price: £11,699 / $12,000 / €11,999</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Cervélo R5 Ultegra Di2</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Frameset: Carbon</li>\n<li>Groupset: Shimano Ultegra Di2 R8170 12-speed</li>\n<li>Wheels: Reserve DT370</li>\n<li>Availability: Likely end of 2021</li>\n<li>Price: £8,299 / $8,700 / €8,299</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Cervélo R5 Frameset</h4>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/09/0h0r5gfs6x_r5_fs_jumbovisma_profile.jpg?itok=qb4mp4RF\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li>Frameset: Carbon</li>\n<li>Availability: Likely end of 2021</li>\n<li>Price: £4,499 / $5,000</li>\n</ul>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/bikes\">Bikes</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"ecole","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"f9f8729a76c106256b6c8958042bb619c6ca33c0857199d1395f767154008f48","category":"Cycling"}
