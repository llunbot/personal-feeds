He not only won the 108th Giro d’Italia, but did so without winning a single stage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s something that has happened a few times but for varying reasons, Yates’s case is very different to those who have claimed victory after the initial ‘winner’ has had his title stripped.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve taken a look back at the handful that have replicated this feat at the Giro in the past 25 years to see what happened and why.d why</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>2002: Paolo Savoldelli</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2048\" height=\"1510\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-1133719419.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-1133719419.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-1133719419-300x221.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-1133719419-970x715.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-1133719419-768x566.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-1133719419-1536x1133.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-1133719419-750x553.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-1133719419-1140x841.webp 1140w\" /><figcaption>Franck Fife/AFP via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This was a Giro d’Italia marked by police raids. Stefano Garzelli, who had dominated the opening week for Mapei-QuickStep, had already left the race after a positive test. Italian police raided the hotels of many teams after the second rest day including Mapei, Lampre and Alexia Alluminio. No arrests were made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jens Heppner of Team Telekom was in the <em><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-d-italia-why-jersey-pink\">maglia rosa</a></em> heading into the final week. It was a close affair with the top 13 riders all within three minutes of each other. Stage 16 was the next mountain stage and brought with it the Cima Coppi of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/classic-climbs-passo-pordoi\">Passo Pordoi</a>. The day was won by Julio Alberto Perez Cuapio of Panaria-Fiordo, while behind Paolo Savoldelli was able to eke out a gap by speeding down the descent. He finished second on the day to move up to sixth overall, with 25-year-old Cadel Evans becoming the new race leader.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Savoldelli finished second again the next day on the summit finish of the Passo Coe to rise into the pink jersey as Evans lost over 17 minutes. With an individual time-trial sandwiched between the remaining two flat stages, all the Italian had to do was put in a respectable time to secure his first Grand Tour win. Given he had placed third on the prologue, it wasn’t in doubt. Another third place was enough to solidify his lead and he rolled into Milan as victor. Those second places in the Dolomites were the reason for his race win.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Best stage result</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>2nd place:</strong> Stage 16, Stage 17</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"332\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-970x332.webp\" alt=\"Cyclist newsletter banner saying 'stay one step ahead of the pack, click here to sign up'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-970x332.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-300x103.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-768x263.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-1536x526.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-2048x701.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-750x257.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-1140x390.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>2008: Alberto Contador</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1697\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-990461622-scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-990461622-scaled.webp 2560w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-990461622-300x199.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-990461622-970x643.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-990461622-768x509.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-990461622-1536x1018.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-990461622-2048x1358.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-990461622-750x497.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-990461622-1140x756.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-990461622-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Tim de Waele/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Astana were in hot water at the beginning of their 2008 season. The team were not invited to the Tour de France and all other ASO races because of their doping scandals over the previous two seasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A mass of new riders joined from the defunct Discovery Channel as well as team manager Johan Bruyneel. They received an invite to ride in the Giro d’Italia and had GC-focused riders in Alberto Contador and Levi Leipheimer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Time-trialling was a strong suit for Contador. His fourth place on Stage 16 meant he rode into the <em>maglia rosa</em> with an advantage of 41sec over Riccardo Riccò. The gap closed by a large amount on Stage 19, when Contador lost contact with his rivals on the Monte Pora. Suddenly, he only held the pink jersey by a matter of seconds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stage 20 had to be something special. It took the peloton over the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/passo-gavia-cycling\">Passo Gavia</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/mortirolo-cycling\">Passo del Mortirolo</a> in the Italian Alps. Contador weathered attacks from Riccò on the Mortirolo and at the end of the day his advantage was slim but intact. Stage 21 wasn’t a processional this time, with an individual time-trial standing in the way of Contador and taking home the pink jersey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But given the way he had managed himself throughout the three time-trials already in the race the result was all but certain. Contador placed 11th on the day to extend his lead overall by almost two minutes, all without winning a stage – and it wouldn’t be his only time doing so either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Best stage result</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>2<sup>nd</sup> place:</strong> Stage 10 (ITT)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-2025-gallery\">The 21 best photos from the Giro d’Italia 2025</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/simon-yates-giro-ditalia-2025\">Simon Yates takes the bull by the horns to win Giro d’Italia</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/2025-giro-ditalia-ranking\">We graded every team’s 2025 Giro d’Italia</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/criterium-du-dauphine-preview\">Critérium du Dauphiné 2025 preview: Route, favourites, how to watch and start list</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>2011: Michele Scarponi</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"2009\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-143718244-scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-143718244-scaled.webp 2560w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-143718244-300x235.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-143718244-970x761.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-143718244-768x603.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-143718244-1536x1205.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-143718244-2048x1607.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-143718244-750x588.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-143718244-1140x894.webp 1140w\" /><figcaption>Luk Benies/AFP via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Contador being stripped of his 2011 Giro meant the win was given to then-second place Michele Scarponi. It was a race marred by tragedy; Leopard-Trek rider Wouter Weylandt crashed and died on the descent of the Passo del Bocco on Stage 3. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the stripped results, Scarponi would’ve been in the <em>maglia rosa</em> from Stage 16, which in turn was a victory then given to Vincenzo Nibali. Who knows how the race would’ve panned out in that case? The gap between first and second (Scarponi and Nibali) was only 47sec after Stage 16.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Best stage result:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>2nd place:</strong> Stage 7, Stage 16 (ITT)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>2012: Ryder Hesjedal</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1827\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-145349209-scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-145349209-scaled.webp 2560w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-145349209-300x214.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-145349209-970x692.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-145349209-768x548.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-145349209-1536x1096.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-145349209-2048x1461.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-145349209-120x86.webp 120w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-145349209-350x250.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-145349209-750x535.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-145349209-1140x814.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-145349209-190x136.webp 190w\" /><figcaption>Luk Benies/AFP via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To say Ryder Hesjedal won the 2012 Giro d’Italia without a stage win would <em>technically</em> be a lie. His Garmin-Barracuda team time-trialled to victory on Stage 4, so to reframe it as Hesjedal won the 2012 Giro d’Italia without an individual stage win is more accurate. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hesjedal spent brief stints in pink throughout the race. He became the first Canadian to wear the jersey after finishing fifth on Stage 7 but slipped down a place to Katusha’s Joaquim Rodríguez on Stage 10. It would be an intense tussle between the pair throughout the race. On Stage 14, Rodríguez slipped back on the Cervinia summit finish, giving away the race lead by only nine seconds. It switched hands once more the next day. Scarponi attacked in the final 2km to draw out GC riders on the Pian dei Resinelli and Hesjedal was unable to stick with the group. Rodríguez then kicked away to join his teammate Alberto Losado up the road, who buried himself for his team leader. It worked. Rodríguez was in pink at the end of the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Continuing through the Dolomites, the race wound up heading to the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/stelvio-cycling-giro\">Stelvio Pass</a> for the queen stage. At the start of Stage 20, Hesjedal had managed to reduce the gap to Rodríguez slightly, but there was a mammoth task standing in front of him. The 1-2 punch of the Mortirolo followed by the Stelvio summit finish. It was on the final climb that Hesjedal again lost touch with Rodríguez and Scarponi, now sitting 31sec down overall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stage 21 would work in his favour. Subverting a processional final day once more for a 28.2km individual time-trial, former Canadian Time-Trial Champion Hesjedal would end up finishing 1min 09sec down on stage winner Marco Pinotti while Rodríguez came in almost two minutes behind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hesjedal won the Giro by just 16 seconds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> <strong>Best result:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>1st:</strong> Stage 4 (TTT)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>2nd:</strong> Stage 19</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>2015: Alberto Contador</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/GettyImages-475401236-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/GettyImages-475401236-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/GettyImages-475401236-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/GettyImages-475401236-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/GettyImages-475401236-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/GettyImages-475401236-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/GettyImages-475401236-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/GettyImages-475401236-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/GettyImages-475401236-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/GettyImages-475401236-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/GettyImages-475401236-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Luk Benies/AFP via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>He’s back again. This time with Tinkoff-Saxo, Contador soared into the race lead early on at the Giro d’Italia after finishing fourth on Stage 5. He would’ve held it all the way if it wasn’t for Fabio Aru.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Italian was racing for Contador’s former team Astana. He’d been sitting in second since Stage 5, only two or three seconds back until Stage 12, where he lost a few seconds as Contador gained bonuses. At the beginning of Stage 13, Aru sat 17 seconds behind his rival. It was a flat day that descended into chaos. A crash just outside the all-important 3km to go mark took down many including Contador. Aru slipped through and grabbed the <em>maglia rosa </em>with an advantage of 19 seconds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things capitulated for Aru however in the following stage’s time-trial. Contador placed third to take back pink as Aru remained second overall but now sat almost two and half minutes down. At the end of the race in Milan, Contador would win overall by 1min 53sec ahead of Aru.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to other editions of the Giro, this was perhaps the one with the weakest GC field. Sky brought Richie Porte who abandoned before Stage 16.<strong> </strong>Rigoberto Urán was here for Etixx-QuickStep having finished second in both 2013 and 2014. If it wasn’t for Aru, this might’ve been a whitewash.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Best result:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>2nd:</strong> Stage 1 (TTT), Stage 12</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>2025: Simon Yates</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2218128632-970x646.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2218128632-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2218128632-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2218128632-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2218128632-1536x1023.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2218128632-2048x1364.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2218128632-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2218128632-1140x759.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2218128632-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2218128632-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2218128632-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Tim de Waele/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So we come to our most-recent offering in Simon Yates. The silent assassin of the 2025 Giro d’Italia kept himself out of trouble and within GC contention for three weeks as Isaac del Toro mostly held the <em>maglia rosa</em>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yates steadily made his way up the general classification and truly came to the fore in the final week. The GC herd had mightily thinned with Giulio Ciccone (Lidl-Trek), Primož Roglič (Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe) and Juan Ayuso (UAE Team Emirates XRG) all abandoning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things would go down to the wire on Stage 20. The main men Del Toro, Richard Carapaz and Yates all came together for one last fight. For Yates though, this was personal. They had to scale the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/colle-delle-finestre-cycling\">Colle delle Finestre</a>. The place where he imploded and lost the Giro back in 2018.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This time would be different. Bridging to Del Toro and Carapaz, he attacked once, twice, three times. He was a man on the offensive. It was the fourth attack that Carapaz refused to follow and Yates was off like a rocket, no matter the 13km that remained of the ascent. Wout van Aert was ahead, waiting to help shepherd his teammate to glory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that he did. By the time everyone had crossed the finish line, Yates won the Giro d’Italia without taking a stage. Del Toro was in second, 3min 56sec down. Carapaz in third, 4min 43sec back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Best result:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>3rd</strong>: Stage 20</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>What to learn from this?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To no one’s surprise, the final week is where these riders dealt the decisive blow. There are some differences though. Whereas Savoldelli, Scarponi and Yates all won the <em>maglia rosa</em> at the end of the race, Hesjedal and Contador’s times in pink (the latter in 2015, not 2008) were broken up by other riders. That could be a commentary on the former’s control over the race. While Yates wasn’t leading, he never looked uncomfortable and always stayed in reach until it was time to attack, and on that day the breakaway won.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another difference lies in the final day. Whereas some were the flat stages we’re accustomed to now like in 2002, 2015 and 2025, others were individual time-trials that helped the GC fight. Contador extended his lead from four seconds to almost two minutes in 2008. While he didn’t need the stage to help his advantage in 2011, he still didn’t see the processional final stage. Hesjedal grabbed the pink jersey thanks to the individual time-trial Stage 21 in 2012. All riders except one finished second as their best result on a stage too, showing the stage win was indeed close and their Grand Tour wins weren’t flukes. Even in the one exception of Yates, he still finished third.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the time, riders will top Grand Tour standings and win at least one stage in the process. But for a select few, they were either unlucky in finishing on the day’s podium but not crossing the line first, or they hid so well in plain sight until it was necessary. And in the end, the leader’s jersey is what matters most.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+3\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-3-970x300.webp\" alt=\"Cyclist banner saying 'the best rides, bikes, kit and pro interviews every month, click here to subscribe'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-3-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-3-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-3-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-3-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-3-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-3-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-3-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/riders-who-won-the-giro-ditalia-without-winning-a-stage\">Riders who won the Giro d’Italia without winning a stage</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Robyn Davidson &#124; Editorial Assistant","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"b9cd75e19b2d9f9bcd6ba10188354fbad9fbbd1284ab80b8fcbeb2a1e7913465","category":"Cycling"}
