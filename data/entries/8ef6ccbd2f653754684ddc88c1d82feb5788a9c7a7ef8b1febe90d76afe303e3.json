The lowest cumulative overall time across each of these stages is declared the winner.</p>\n<p>This year’s race was won by <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/5-tips-to-tackling-multi-day-events-from-mark-beaumont/\">Mark Beaumont</a> – the current record holder for a supported circumnavigation of the globe by bicycle – in a time of 135 hours and 24 minutes.</p>\n<p>Ollie Hayward came second and Jaimi Wilson then took third, simultaneously taking the top spot in the solo women’s category.</p>\n<p>The race was not without drama, with Angus Young – who was leading the race for much of the event – <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CS8NKOloULC/\" target=\"_blank\">eventually being disqualified</a> for taking support from a dot-watcher who lent him his bike after a serious mechanical failure.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Choosing dependable kit, which can often involve mods or custom parts, is key to success in bikepacking races.</span></figcaption><span> <a href=\"https://tommycheck.com/\"><strong>Tommy Check</strong></a></span></div>\n<p>Choosing dependable and trusted kit is key to success in long-distance racing, which can often lead to riders running a wide variety of different setups (as we saw in our <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/2021-highland-trail-550-bikes/\">tech gallery from the Highland Trail 550</a> earlier this year).</p>\n<p>However, all three of the top riders met some consensus, with drop-bar <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bikes/\">gravel bikes</a> dominating the event.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, every setup is unique to each, which makes for fascinating viewing for us tech-obsessed armchair bikepackers.

He rode the route on this lovely titanium Reilly Gradient, which is also built around a Shimano GRX Di2 groupset.\n<p>An electronic groupset might seem like a bold choice for a bikepacking race, given the ease of swapping a mechanical gear cable, but the consistent operation and easy cable routing (bikepacking bags can often force shift cables through difficult bends) can be an advantage when riding through grimy conditions.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> His left shifter took quite a serious knock during the ride…</span></figcaption><span> <a href=\"https://tommycheck.com/\"><strong>Tommy Check</strong></a></span></div>\n<p>It clearly hasn’t been all plain sailing for Hayward, though, with the bottom portion of his left lever missing after, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CS4D4aoMaJt/\" target=\"_blank\">according to his Instragam</a>, a gnarly crash that left him without a rear brake.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> It is possible to charge Di2 on the go via a USB charger.</span></figcaption><span> <a href=\"https://tommycheck.com/\"><strong>Tommy Check</strong></a></span></div>\n<p>Shimano’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/shimano-di2-setup/\">Di2 groupsets</a> also have an advantage in that they can be (unofficially) charged on the go, as Hayward appears to have done via a Sinewave Revolution. This neat little box converts power from a dynamo hub into USB-friendly output, allowing you to charge devices on the move.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, Hayward opted to forgo a dynamo light and instead used a battery-powered Exposure Strada to light his way during the night stages.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> His front bag is supported by a neat homemade rack.</span></figcaption><span> <a href=\"https://tommycheck.com/\"><strong>Tommy Check</strong></a></span></div>\n<p>His Pro Discover bar bag is supported by a minimalist homemade rack.</p>\n<p>Speaking to BikeRadar, Hayward said the rack was made less than 24-hours before the race after he discovered his bar bag was bouncing on the front wheel and wearing a hole in it.</p>\n<p>The rack itself “started life as a sheep feed bucket handle” that, once bent into a U-shape, was welded onto a 2mm steel plate by Hayward’s dad. It was then attached to the bike using a pair of mudguard struts and finished off with black paint and Gorilla tape. Ingenious stuff.</p>\n<p>Finally, Hayward completed the ride on a pair of 47mm-wide Specialized Rhombus Pro tyres.</p>\n<h3>Ollie Hayward’s Reilly Gradient spec highlights</h3>\n<ul><li>Reilly

mount.</p>\n<p>It’s a simple setup but clearly a solid one that worked – in comparison to the other two bikes features, there are no notable bumps or scrapes to speak of.</p>\n<h3>Jaimi Wilson’s Salsa

non-traditional 5,000-member strong biking club based in the UK. </p>\n<p>It organises 14 different events across the UK, stretching from the relatively gentile 80km <a href=\"https://www.theracingcollective.com/cotsduro.html\" target=\"_blank\">Cotsduro</a> to the country-spanning GBDuro. </p>\n<p>This is the third edition of GBDuro. The inaugural edition was won by <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/lachlan-morton-podcast/\">Lachlan Morton of EF Pro Cycling</a>. An <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e74xncSCoqw\" target=\"_blank\">excellent film</a> was produced by Rapha Films about his ride, which is still well worth a watch. </p>\n<p>As an interesting aside, riders were required to get to/from the start and finish of the race without flying to reduce the environmental impact of the race. </p>\n<p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section>","author":"Jack Luke","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"8ef6ccbd2f653754684ddc88c1d82feb5788a9c7a7ef8b1febe90d76afe303e3","category":"Cycling"}
