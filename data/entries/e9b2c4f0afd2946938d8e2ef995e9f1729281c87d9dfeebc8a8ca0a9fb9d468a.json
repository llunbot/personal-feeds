Last year, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/29/apple-loses-lawsuit-against-corellium/\">a judge dismissed Apple's claim</a> that Corellium had infringed upon the tech giant's copyrights, claiming instead that Corellium was operating under fair rules. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhile Corellium offers a replica of the iOS operating system that runs on the ‌iPhone‌, the security research firm says that it benefits Apple if anything. By providing security researchers with access to the same operating system that runs on millions of devices, security experts can find security vulnerabilities and potential exploits more efficiently, leading them to be fixed by Apple.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nCiting court documents, <em>The Washington Post</em> reports, that Apple and Corellium have agreed on a confidential settlement to bring the lawsuit to an end. Despite Apple's grievances with Corellium, however, the settlement does not include Corellium suspending the sale and distribution of tools used by security researchers.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nLikely fueled by the lawsuit and the discussion around security research on ‌iPhone‌, Apple last year <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/22/apple-security-research-device-program/\">launched a program</a> that would give secuirty researchers access to specially configured iPhones for researching secuirty vulnerabilities and exploits. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lawsuit/\">lawsuit</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/11/apple-corellium-lawsuit-settlement/\">Apple and Corellium Agree on Settlement to Bring Lawsuit to an End</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-and-corellium-agree-on-settlement-to-bring-lawsuit-to-an-end.2307176/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=-GoH1rkd3ug:sfIB0smv6OM:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=-GoH1rkd3ug:sfIB0smv6OM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/-GoH1rkd3ug\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e9b2c4f0afd2946938d8e2ef995e9f1729281c87d9dfeebc8a8ca0a9fb9d468a","category":"Apple"}
