This guide highlights everything new that Apple added to the ‌Apple Music‌ app in ‌iOS 17‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/iOS-17-Apple-Music-Feature.jpg\" alt width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Crossfade</h2>\r<br />\nCrossfade allows songs that are playing to smoothly transition into one another, eliminating any dead air time between songs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/apple-music-crossfade-length.jpg\" alt width=\"2558\" height=\"1439\" />\r<br />\n<h2>Collaborative Playlists</h2>\r<br />\nWith collaborative playlists, friends and family members can add to, reorder, and remove songs from a single ‌Apple Music‌ playlist. You can set up a playlist with several people, and each person can contribute songs and react to songs in the playlist with emoji.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/apple-music-collaborative-playlist.jpg\" alt width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" />\r<br />\nCollaborative playlists are not yet implemented and will be coming to an ‌iOS 17‌ update a bit later this year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Music SharePlay for CarPlay</h2>\r<br />\n‌iOS 17‌ brings an ‌Apple Music‌ SharePlay experience to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/\">CarPlay</a>, so everyone in the car can play their favorite songs and contribute music. The car owner that has their <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> connected to the car needs to have an ‌Apple Music‌ subscription for this feature to work, but passengers do not.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/shareplay-carplay.jpg\" alt width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nThe ‌Apple Music‌ interface provides a QR code that each person can scan to get access to a playlist where songs can be added to the in-car ‌Apple Music‌ queue.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Interface Updates</h2>\r<br />\nFull-screen animated artwork is available for albums that support the option, and album art is also now designed to blend seamlessly into the music player where the controls are located.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/apple-music-ios-17.jpg\" alt width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" />\r<br />\nWhen the music player is minimized, there is now a hovering effect that adds depth.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Non-synced Lyrics</h2>\r<br />\nSong lyrics that are not synced to the music that's playing are shown in a larger, more legible font. This brings the lyric size in line with the lyrics that are synced to an ‌Apple Music‌ song.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Song Credits</h2>\r<br />\nTapping on the three-dot icon next to a song that is playing or in a playlist shows song credits. The credits show the performing artists, composition artists, and those who were involved in production and engineering.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/song-credits-apple-music.jpg\" alt width=\"4320\" height=\"2700\" />\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Music Sing on Apple TV</h2>\r<br />\nWith an ‌iPhone‌ running ‌iOS 17‌ and an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> 4K running tvOS 17, the ‌iPhone‌ can serve as a camera for the ‌Apple TV‌, showing you on the screen as you perform. You can also do this with an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, and it is the same feature that enables <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a> on ‌Apple TV‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/apple-music-sing-continuity-camera.jpg\" alt width=\"970\" height=\"546\" />\r<br />\n‌Apple Music‌ Sing is integrated into ‌Apple Music‌. It uses the built-in follow-along lyrics and turns down vocals so you can sing along with your favorite songs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Read More</h2>\r<br />\nMore on all of the new features in ‌iOS 17‌ can be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">found in our in-depth iOS 17 roundup</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242\">iPadOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-music-app/\">Everything New in the Music App in iOS 17</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/everything-new-in-the-music-app-in-ios-17.2399666/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d4b629568fc1290ae7614b4f9586fa925c4c4d903401f119f0bf1ab5ca85cb94","category":"Apple"}
