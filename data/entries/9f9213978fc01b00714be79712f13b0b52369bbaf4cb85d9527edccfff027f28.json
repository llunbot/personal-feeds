Unlike Gemini, Gemma models can run locally on a desktop or laptop computer. It's Google's first significant open large language model (LLM) release since OpenAI's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/openai-invites-everyone-to-test-new-ai-powered-chatbot-with-amusing-results/\">ChatGPT</a> started a frenzy for AI chatbots in 2022.</p>\n\n<p>Gemma models come in two sizes: Gemma 2B (2 billion parameters) and Gemma 7B (7 billion parameters), each available in pre-trained and instruction-tuned variants. In AI, parameters are values in a neural network that determine AI model behavior, and weights are a subset of these parameters stored in a file.</p>\n<p>Developed by Google DeepMind and other Google AI teams, Gemma pulls from techniques learned during the development of Gemini, which is the family name for Google's most capable (public-facing) commercial LLMs, including the ones that power its <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/google-debuts-more-powerful-ultra-1-0-ai-model-in-rebranded-gemini-chatbot/\">Gemini AI assistant</a>. Google says the name comes from the Latin <em>gemma</em>, which means \"precious stone.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005035#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005035&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9f9213978fc01b00714be79712f13b0b52369bbaf4cb85d9527edccfff027f28","category":"Tech"}
