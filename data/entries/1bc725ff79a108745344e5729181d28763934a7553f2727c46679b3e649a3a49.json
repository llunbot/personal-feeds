The generally more affordable Coros Pace family of GPS-tracking multi-sport smartwatches goes Pro with a new top model promising an improved display, faster processor, and all-around improved performance. Plus, it keeps the Coros core of super long battery life – up to 38 hours of GPS activity tracking or 20 days of regular smartwatch use – light weight from just 37g, and affordability… </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well at $350, at least it’s relatively affordable compared to the top-tier multi-sport watches from trusted brands…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Coros Pace Pro affordable premium GPS smartwatch</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Coros-Pace-Pro-smartwatch_affordable-premium-multi-sport-GPS-trackign-watch_with-nylon-band-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Coros-Pace-Pro-smartwatch_affordable-premium-multi-sport-GPS-trackign-watch_with-nylon-band-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Coros Pace Pro smartwatch, an affordable premium multi-sport GPS tracking watch, with lightweight nylon band\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Coros-Pace-Pro-smartwatch_affordable-premium-multi-sport-GPS-trackign-watch_with-nylon-band-jpg.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Coros-Pace-Pro-smartwatch_affordable-premium-multi-sport-GPS-trackign-watch_with-nylon-band-297x248.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Coros-Pace-Pro-smartwatch_affordable-premium-multi-sport-GPS-trackign-watch_with-nylon-band-1536x1280.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Coros-Pace-Pro-smartwatch_affordable-premium-multi-sport-GPS-trackign-watch_with-nylon-band-120x100.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Coros-Pace-Pro-smartwatch_affordable-premium-multi-sport-GPS-trackign-watch_with-nylon-band-768x640.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Coros)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A year ago, I only really knew of Coros anecdotally as a smartwatch brand used by ultra-distance runners because of the watches’ light weight, GPS accuracy, and super-long activity-tracking battery life, and their relative low-cost compared to the legacy names in sport trackers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then we heard at the start of 2024 that Coros was preparing to bring their low-cost, lightweight &amp; super long runtime strategy to cycling, my interest was piqued. Even before we got any details on what would become their <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/coros-dura-solar-gps-bike-computer/\" target=\"_blank\">$250 Dura GPS</a> cycling computer with awesome 120-hour battery life. So I wanted to try out their Pace family of smartwatches to see how they worked on- and off-the-bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I strapped a Pace 3 around my wrist and have pretty much not used another smartwatch since. Its in-app and on-watch menu navigation took me a while to get used to (mostly because these days new devices don’t come with much in the way of explanatory operating instruction manuals). But once I figured it out (and flipped the watch’s band &amp; its electronic face around 180° so that my wrist didn’t accidentally press the pause button during activities), I’ve been perfectly happy with the Pace for tracking runs, mountain bike rides, hikes, XC skiing &amp; spilt-boarding. Plus, generally tracking my fitness, sleep &amp; recovery when I want to know more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now, there’s a faster, brighter, more powerful Pace Pro that does everything I already love with the regular Pace 3 better, plus the mapping capabilities of smartwatches more than 2x as expensive.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Comparing it to the Pace 3</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Coros-Pace-Pro-smartwatch_affordable-premium-multi-sport-GPS-tracking-watch_anime-watch-face-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Coros-Pace-Pro-smartwatch_affordable-premium-multi-sport-GPS-tracking-watch_anime-watch-face-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Coros Pace 3 affordable GPS smartwatch with customizable watch faces\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Coros-Pace-Pro-smartwatch_affordable-premium-multi-sport-GPS-tracking-watch_anime-watch-face-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Coros-Pace-Pro-smartwatch_affordable-premium-multi-sport-GPS-tracking-watch_anime-watch-face-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Coros-Pace-Pro-smartwatch_affordable-premium-multi-sport-GPS-tracking-watch_anime-watch-face-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Coros-Pace-Pro-smartwatch_affordable-premium-multi-sport-GPS-tracking-watch_anime-watch-face-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Coros-Pace-Pro-smartwatch_affordable-premium-multi-sport-GPS-tracking-watch_anime-watch-face-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>No, that’s not normally my custom watch face, but I guess it is today, because why not? +1 for customizable watch faces! (Photo/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I know you might not know the $230 Pace 3 that I already use, but it has excellent GPS tracking capabilities. It is thin, smooth-edged &amp; weighs just 40g. And I only have to charge it really once-a-week when I use it to track rides, or could go 2 weeks when I am tracking cycling activity with by Wahoo Elemnt <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wahoo-updates-elemnt-roam-gps-with-32gb-memory-better-navigation-and-much-more/\" target=\"_blank\">Roam</a> or more recently with the Coros <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/coros-dura-solar-gps-bike-computer/\" target=\"_blank\">Dura</a> (which coincidentally has the same display just with touch added). Really, I usually stick it in the charger every other time I hop in the shower for 15 minutes or so, and it is always charged.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>So what’s new?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Coros-Pace-Pro-smartwatch_affordable-premium-multi-sport-GPS-tracking-watch_Grey-sunrise-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Coros-Pace-Pro-smartwatch_affordable-premium-multi-sport-GPS-tracking-watch_Grey-sunrise-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Coros Pace Pro smartwatch, an affordable premium multi-sport GPS tracking watch, sunride\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Coros-Pace-Pro-smartwatch_affordable-premium-multi-sport-GPS-tracking-watch_Grey-sunrise-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Coros-Pace-Pro-smartwatch_affordable-premium-multi-sport-GPS-tracking-watch_Grey-sunrise-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Coros-Pace-Pro-smartwatch_affordable-premium-multi-sport-GPS-tracking-watch_Grey-sunrise-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Coros-Pace-Pro-smartwatch_affordable-premium-multi-sport-GPS-tracking-watch_Grey-sunrise-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Coros-Pace-Pro-smartwatch_affordable-premium-multi-sport-GPS-tracking-watch_Grey-sunrise-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Coros-Pace-Pro-smartwatch_affordable-premium-multi-sport-GPS-tracking-watch_Grey-sunrise-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Coros-Pace-Pro-smartwatch_affordable-premium-multi-sport-GPS-tracking-watch_Grey-sunrise-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So, now the more powerful Pace Pro gets a 3x better resolution AMOLED vs. LCD that is also brighter and can be always on. It has a 2x faster processor, 3x more RAM, 8x bigger memory, 3x faster WiFi up/download speeds, and new full mapping &amp; navigation capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Coros-Pace-Pro-smartwatch_affordable-premium-multi-sport-GPS-tracking-watch_diagram-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Coros-Pace-Pro-smartwatch_affordable-premium-multi-sport-GPS-tracking-watch_diagram-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Coros Pace Pro smartwatch, an affordable premium multi-sport GPS tracking watch, overview\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Coros-Pace-Pro-smartwatch_affordable-premium-multi-sport-GPS-tracking-watch_diagram-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Coros-Pace-Pro-smartwatch_affordable-premium-multi-sport-GPS-tracking-watch_diagram-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Coros-Pace-Pro-smartwatch_affordable-premium-multi-sport-GPS-tracking-watch_diagram-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Coros-Pace-Pro-smartwatch_affordable-premium-multi-sport-GPS-tracking-watch_diagram-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Coros-Pace-Pro-smartwatch_affordable-premium-multi-sport-GPS-tracking-watch_diagram-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, it still has the same 38-hour GPS-tracking runtime, but now with all GPS systems tracking at the same time for increased accuracy thanks to a 46% higher capacity battery. That also means that everyday use tracking lasts 33% longer for 20 days of regular stress &amp; sleep tracking between charges. Coros says the Pace Pro is 4mm bigger in diameter, half a millimeter thicker, and 7g heavier (10g heavier comparing the standard silicone watchbands) – all minimal enough changes to probably feel the same around your wrist. Although, I do hope to test out the new watch soon to see how I like the updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Coros-Pace-Pro-smartwatch_affordable-premium-multi-sport-GPS-tracking-watch_exploded-Processor-view-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1364\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Coros-Pace-Pro-smartwatch_affordable-premium-multi-sport-GPS-tracking-watch_exploded-Processor-view-scaled.webp\" alt=\"Coros Pace Pro smartwatch, an affordable premium multi-sport GPS tracking watch, new processor exploded view\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Coros-Pace-Pro-smartwatch_affordable-premium-multi-sport-GPS-tracking-watch_exploded-Processor-view-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Coros-Pace-Pro-smartwatch_affordable-premium-multi-sport-GPS-tracking-watch_exploded-Processor-view-297x158.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Coros-Pace-Pro-smartwatch_affordable-premium-multi-sport-GPS-tracking-watch_exploded-Processor-view-1536x818.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Coros-Pace-Pro-smartwatch_affordable-premium-multi-sport-GPS-tracking-watch_exploded-Processor-view-120x64.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Coros-Pace-Pro-smartwatch_affordable-premium-multi-sport-GPS-tracking-watch_exploded-Processor-view-768x409.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Coros-Pace-Pro-smartwatch_affordable-premium-multi-sport-GPS-tracking-watch_exploded-Processor-view-2048x1091.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One other upgrade from Coros’ more-premium Vertix expedition family of watches is a new ECG sensor, presumably for better exercise recovery analytics. And with that, I think the only thing that the $700 Vertix 2S does better than this Pace Pro would be its much longer runtime. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, the Pace Pro upgrades to a new USB-C charging cable with a dongle that will fit on a keychain, for what appears to be another new proprietary charging interface, but an improved port for better connection.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ultra-long runtimes</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Coros-Pace-Pro-smartwatch_affordable-premium-multi-sport-GPS-tracking-watch_with-external-heart-rate-and-stride-sensors-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Coros-Pace-Pro-smartwatch_affordable-premium-multi-sport-GPS-tracking-watch_with-external-heart-rate-and-stride-sensors-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Coros Pace Pro smartwatch, an affordable premium multi-sport GPS tracking watch, cross-training\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Coros-Pace-Pro-smartwatch_affordable-premium-multi-sport-GPS-tracking-watch_with-external-heart-rate-and-stride-sensors-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Coros-Pace-Pro-smartwatch_affordable-premium-multi-sport-GPS-tracking-watch_with-external-heart-rate-and-stride-sensors-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Coros-Pace-Pro-smartwatch_affordable-premium-multi-sport-GPS-tracking-watch_with-external-heart-rate-and-stride-sensors-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Coros-Pace-Pro-smartwatch_affordable-premium-multi-sport-GPS-tracking-watch_with-external-heart-rate-and-stride-sensors-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Coros-Pace-Pro-smartwatch_affordable-premium-multi-sport-GPS-tracking-watch_with-external-heart-rate-and-stride-sensors-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>345mAh battery </li>\n\n\n\n<li>All GPS systems active battery life: 38 hours, 28hr with Always-On display, 10hr with Always-on &amp;
