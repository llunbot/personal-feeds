Apple designed the ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ to test features that may be introduced into future release versions of Safari.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/Safari-Technology-Preview-Feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n‌Safari Technology Preview‌ release 128 includes bug fixes and performance improvements for Web Inspector, CSS, JavaScript, Live Text, Media, Performance API, and Web API.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe current ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ release is built on the new Safari 15 update included in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">macOS Monterey</a>, and as such, it includes several Safari 15 features. There's a new streamlined tab bar with support for Tab Groups to organize tabs, along with improved support for Safari Web Extensions.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nNotably, this release includes the same changes to the tab layout that were <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/14/macos-monterey-safari-redesign/\">made in macOS Monterey beta 3</a>, now defaulting to separate tab and address bars. The streamlined layout with a single bar remains available in the View menu through the \"Show Separate Tab Bar\" option.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nLive Text allows users to select and interact with text in images on the web, but the ‌macOS Monterey‌ beta and an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> Mac is required. There's also Quick Notes support for adding links and Safari highlights to remember important information and ideas.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOther updates <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Safari-Release-Notes/safari-15-beta-release-notes\">include</a> WebGL 2 and new HTML, CSS, and JavaScript features.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe new ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ update is available for both <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-big-sur/\">macOS Big Sur</a> and ‌macOS Monterey‌, the newest version of the Mac operating system that's set to release this fall.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ update is available through the Software Update mechanism in System Preferences to anyone who has <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/safari/download/\">downloaded the browser</a>. Full release notes for the update are available <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/release-notes/\">on the Safari Technology Preview website</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's aim with ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ is to gather feedback from developers and users on its browser development process. ‌Safari Technology Preview‌ can run side-by-side with the existing Safari browser and while designed for developers, it does not require a developer account to download.\r\n<br />\r\n<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari-technology-preview/\">Safari Technology Preview</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/21/apple-releases-safari-technology-preview-128/\">Apple Releases Safari Technology Preview 128 With Bug Fixes and Performance Improvements</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-safari-technology-preview-128-with-bug-fixes-and-performance-improvements.2305042/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=w2-h2LEDybM:qZIR59on7tY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=w2-h2LEDybM:qZIR59on7tY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/w2-h2LEDybM\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"cb2aca3196c018c071a3f979f8d4b63ac5571549400732f9cafec7bf0ec1a13b","category":"Apple"}
