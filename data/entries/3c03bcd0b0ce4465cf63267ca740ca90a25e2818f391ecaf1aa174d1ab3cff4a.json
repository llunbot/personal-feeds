There have been no changes to ‌iCloud‌ plans and all ‌iCloud‌ plans are now ‌iCloud‌+ plans, but more camera footage can be stored.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe $0.99 per month 50GB ‌iCloud‌+ storage plan offers support for one ‌HomeKit Secure Video‌ Camera, which is a major improvement because previously, the 200GB plan was required to use ‌HomeKit Secure Video‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWith the $2.99 per month 200GB ‌iCloud‌+ plan that previously offered support for one camera, you can now record with five ‌HomeKit Secure Video‌ cameras at one time. The $9.99 per month 2TB ‌iCloud‌+ storage plan supports unlimited ‌HomeKit Secure Video‌ cameras, up from five.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAll ‌HomeKit Secure Video‌ footage that's stored in ‌iCloud‌ is secure and end-to-end encrypted, and no camera footage counts against the total ‌iCloud‌ storage that you have available. To use ‌HomeKit Secure Video‌, you need the 50GB plan at a minimum, along with a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> that serves as a home hub for your ‌HomeKit‌ devices.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h3>Package Detection</h3>\r\n<br />\r\n‌HomeKit Secure Video‌ already supports people detection to narrow down motion alerts, but in ‌iOS 15‌, security cameras and video doorbells that support ‌HomeKit Secure Video‌ can detect a package delivery and let you know when the package you're waiting for arrives on your doorstep.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Home Keys</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nHomeKit-enabled door locks that support ‌iOS 15‌'s new Home Keys feature can store a digital key in the Wallet app.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/ios-15-wallet-app-home-key.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe digital key can be used to tap to unlock a compatible lock, so you don't need a manufacturer's app to use digital unlocking features.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nHome Keys can be accessed on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> or on the Apple Watch using the Wallet app.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Time-Based Siri Commands</h2>\r\n<br />\r\n‌Siri‌ in ‌iOS 15‌ can be used to control a ‌HomeKit‌ device at a specific time. So if you want your bedroom lights to turn off at 9:00 p.m., you can say \"Hey ‌Siri‌, turn the bedroom lights off at 9:00 p.m., and the voice assistant complies.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/siri-homekit-automations.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThis feature uses the Automation option in the Home app, so every time you ask ‌Siri‌ control a ‌HomeKit‌ device at a specific time, it creates an automation. You can view and delete automations in the Automation section of the Home app.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Siri-Enabled Third-Party Accessories</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nThird-party ‌HomeKit‌ accessory makers can integrate ‌Siri‌ functionality into their devices in ‌iOS 15‌, but the person using the device needs to own a ‌HomePod‌ that can be used to route requests. This functionality needs to be implemented by manufacturers and so it won't be available right when ‌iOS 15‌ launches.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/HomePodandMini-feature-orange.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nWith ‌Siri‌ integration, you can ask any compatible product in your home to send messages, set reminders, contact family members, control devices, and more.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Guide Feedback</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nHave questions about the new ‌HomeKit‌ changes in ‌iOS 15‌, know of a feature we left out, or want to offer feedback on this guide? <a href=\"mailto:guides@macrumors.com\">Send us an email here</a>.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/\">HomeKit</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit-secure-video/\">HomeKit Secure Video</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-15-homekit/\">What's New With HomeKit in iOS 15</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whats-new-with-homekit-in-ios-15.2308665/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=SB9Fxiqja4I:Og6oRpXQlO8:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=SB9Fxiqja4I:Og6oRpXQlO8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/SB9Fxiqja4I\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3c03bcd0b0ce4465cf63267ca740ca90a25e2818f391ecaf1aa174d1ab3cff4a","category":"Apple"}
