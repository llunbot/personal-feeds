In addition to our existing and ever-growing library of inflight content such as movies and games, Beond will showcase stunning resort destinations and activities in the Maldives. We are working now with partners in the Maldives to prepare truly amazing footage. The inflight experience will build anticipation for passengers before they arrive in the Maldives. Offering the Apple Vision Pro is another step in our vision of delivering a premium travel experience to our customers, from the start to finish of their journey. We're proud to be the first airline to deploy the technology.\"</blockquote>The overall response to ‌Apple Vision Pro‌ from users, critics, and the broader public has been varied. However, the consensus is that wearing the headset during flights stands out as one of its most widely appreciated applications.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAcknowledging the headset's potential to make long-haul flights more private and liberating, Apple has included a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/apple-vision-pro-guest-user-and-travel-modes/\">Travel mode</a> in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/visionos/\">visionOS</a> that stabilizes visuals for users on an airplane, allowing them to, for example, watch movies on a massive virtual screen.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-Vision-Pro-Travel-Mode.jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nBeond said it will offer \"Apple's ground-breaking content experience\" beginning in July 2024. The news follows Beond's launch of commercial passenger services in 2023 from Munich, Zurich, and Riyadh to Malé, Maldives. Beond says it plans to debut flights from Milan, Dubai, and Bangkok to the Maldives in mid-2024, in an all-lay flat seating configuration. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro\">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/premium-leisure-airline-apple-vision-pro/\">Premium Airline Beond to Offer Passengers Apple Vision Pro Headsets</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/premium-airline-beond-to-offer-passengers-apple-vision-pro-headsets.2419609/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"fabe2ffcacdf737195562c90974ac3c8ea51d7d140d229d569502007664d0121","category":"Apple"}
