The screen is not new. Original story follows.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<hr />\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has begun placing prominent warning labels on EU App Store listings that use alternative payment methods. The warning symbols appear as a red exclamation mark in a triangle, accompanied by text stating that the app \"does not support the App Store's private and secure payment system\" and \"uses external purchases.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/app-store-external-payments-warning.jpg\" alt=\"App Store\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nAs noted by <a href=\"https://mjtsai.com/blog/2025/05/14/critical-warning-for-external-purchases-in-app-store/\">Michael Tsai</a>, Apple is using its highest-level \"critical\" alert iconography – the same triangle symbol that macOS reserves for situations that might result in \"unexpected loss of data.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nInstacar, a popular Hungarian car valuation app with thousands of positive reviews, appears to be among the first to receive this treatment.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's use of the warning labels comes just weeks after the European Commission <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/23/apple-breach-digital-markets-act-eu/\">fined Apple €500 million</a> for violating the Digital Markets Act by restricting developers from informing users about alternative payment options. The Commission ordered Apple to \"remove the technical and commercial restrictions on steering.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>first time seeing this.
