It’s also a great way to start and end the day for mental health, almost like hitting a reset button for your mind twice a day. In December 2020, I started a new job with the perfect bike commute. What better way to kick it off than to build a new custom bike?</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue2-0243.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue2-0243.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue2-0243.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue2-0243.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The commute was roughly 12 miles each way, with multiple dirt routes in between, so I could choose my own adventure to and from the office. I’m not one to carry a backpack with my laptop and dirty laundry unless I have to, so my solution was to build a capable basket bike. This bike became the perfect mix of a comfortable townie grocery-getter and fun steel shredmuter.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Josh-Onko-Rinkus-My-Boy-Blue-8769.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Josh-Onko-Rinkus-My-Boy-Blue-8769.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Josh-Onko-Rinkus-My-Boy-Blue-8769.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Josh-Onko-Rinkus-My-Boy-Blue-8769.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>In 2018, my good friend <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/onko_rinkus/\" target=\"_blank\">Brendan</a>, a scientist by trade, started learning to build frames under the watchful eye of Paul Sadoff in his Santa Cruz, CA, shop, working under the name <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/tag/onko-rinkus/\" target=\"_blank\">Onko Rinkus</a>. The name is a simplified pronunciation of <em>Oncorhynchus</em>, better known as the Pacific salmon. I asked if he’d be interested in brazing up a frame and fork for my dream basket bike, and he gladly obliged. This frame was the 14th bike he’d built, and it came to be known as “My Boy Blue.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Josh-Becker-Onko-Rinkus-Basket-Bike-15.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Josh-Becker-Onko-Rinkus-Basket-Bike-15.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Josh-Becker-Onko-Rinkus-Basket-Bike-15.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Josh-Becker-Onko-Rinkus-Basket-Bike-15.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>What is a perfect commuter to me? First off, it has to be capable of handling Santa Cruz’s mini adventure routes with a mix of pavement, fire roads, with a little bit of singletrack sprinkled in.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Josh-Becker-Onko-Rinkus-Basket-Bike-13.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Josh-Becker-Onko-Rinkus-Basket-Bike-13.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Josh-Becker-Onko-Rinkus-Basket-Bike-13.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Josh-Becker-Onko-Rinkus-Basket-Bike-13.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>It has to have a comfortable steel frame and fork, flat bars, enough clearance for a WTB Nano 40, and a basket to carry my lunch, clothes, and laptop. I was on a budget when I built up My Boy Blue, so I pieced it together with the few random parts I had in the garage. These included a barely-used Easton EC90 crankset, an old Industry Nine wheelset with a fairly new 11–42 cassette, and a silver Chris King bottom bracket from an older build.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-1010547.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-1010547.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-1010547.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-1010547.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Brendan scored a discontinued turquoise King headset dirt cheap, so I snagged that too. Paul had a set of Shimano Alfine brakes and levers lying around the shop that he practically gave me. Even though Alfines are kind of chunky, clunky, and made for more urban cruisers, I didn’t care much, and they’d work fine. The handlebars are courtesy of my friend Noah, a phenomenal fabricator and framebuilder. He mentioned he was “ti-curious” and wanted to bend up some titanium bars, but needed someone to help guinea pig a raw chromoly batch of bars first.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Josh-Becker-Onko-Rinkus-Basket-Bike-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Josh-Becker-Onko-Rinkus-Basket-Bike-6.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Josh-Becker-Onko-Rinkus-Basket-Bike-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Josh-Becker-Onko-Rinkus-Basket-Bike-6.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>My inspiration was Hunter <a href=\"https://huntercycles.bigcartel.com/product/hunter-smooth-move-low-rise-handlebar\" target=\"_blank\">Smooth Move</a> bars, but with a slightly lower rise. Noah doesn’t hydroform tubes; he bends each one, so the entire bar is ⅞” in diameter, but he machined a slick little shim so I could run a standard 31.8 road stem. They are raw, polished steel, and I had originally intended to oil them once in a while to keep that shiny polish, but living next to the ocean, the rust came on fast. I ended up loving the look and just let them rust away.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Josh-Becker-Onko-Rinkus-Basket-Bike-9.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Josh-Becker-Onko-Rinkus-Basket-Bike-9.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Josh-Becker-Onko-Rinkus-Basket-Bike-9.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Josh-Becker-Onko-Rinkus-Basket-Bike-9.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Josh-Becker-Onko-Rinkus-Basket-Bike-2.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Josh-Becker-Onko-Rinkus-Basket-Bike-2.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Josh-Becker-Onko-Rinkus-Basket-Bike-2.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Josh-Becker-Onko-Rinkus-Basket-Bike-2.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Josh-Becker-Onko-Rinkus-Basket-Bike-14.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Josh-Becker-Onko-Rinkus-Basket-Bike-14.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Josh-Becker-Onko-Rinkus-Basket-Bike-14.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Josh-Becker-Onko-Rinkus-Basket-Bike-14.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>My Boy Blue ended up looking pretty sweet, and I couldn’t have been happier with the way it turned out.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Poor-Blue-4105.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Poor-Blue-4105.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Poor-Blue-4105.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Poor-Blue-4105.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Boy Blue Goes Boom</h3>\n<p>Cut to the very beginning of summer 2022… I had been commuting on the bike for about a year and had clocked just over 2,000 miles on it. With the combination of a big year of almost daily commuting, weekend rides, and the base miles I racked up riding down the West Coast on Iris’s Tailwind Tour in July of 2021, my fitness was probably the best it had ever been. I had just raced Grinduro on the singlespeed and finished about a minute off the podium, so I was itching for a good result the following week at my all-time favorite race: Lost &amp; Found.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Josh-Becker-Onko-Rinkus-Basket-Bike-12.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Josh-Becker-Onko-Rinkus-Basket-Bike-12.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Josh-Becker-Onko-Rinkus-Basket-Bike-12.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Josh-Becker-Onko-Rinkus-Basket-Bike-12.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>It was the Friday of Memorial Day weekend. I grabbed my laptop, all the dirty laundry from my locker, and rolled out of the office a little early, looking forward to a mellow weekend before heading off midweek to race 100 miles of the rugged, rowdy backcountry of the high Sierra.</p>\n<p>It was a nice sunny day, so I had planned to take the long way home and ride the beach, but I found an iPhone lying in the middle of the street. It was unlocked, so I called the last person in the call log. It ended up being the owner’s brother, and they asked if I could drop it off somewhere for him to retrieve it. It was a few miles out of my way in the opposite direction, but being the nice guy that I am, I went back and dropped it off. Then I turned around and opted for the quickest way home via one of Santa Cruz’s busiest streets: Soquel Avenue.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Poor-Blue-4079.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Poor-Blue-4079.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Poor-Blue-4079.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Poor-Blue-4079.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Soquel Avenue is a four-lane road that parallels Highway 1 and stretches roughly seven miles from downtown Santa Cruz towards Aptos. Most of it has a bike lane, but it gets extremely congested during rush hour, making it pretty treacherous with all the driveways, stoplights, and distracted drivers on their phones, angry that they’re sitting in a car stuck in traffic trying to get home after work. Even though it’s always faster by bike, you’re constantly riding on high alert.</p>\n<p>I was just under four miles from my front door, moving with traffic in the bike lane, when I approached the green light at a busy intersection. I made eye contact with the driver to my left, who then turned on his right-hand signal to tell me he was going to turn, and let me go ahead of him through the intersection. So I sped up to avoid slowing traffic. Just after I passed through the light, I caught up to another vehicle moving at about the same speed as me.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-1020366.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-1020366.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-1020366.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-1020366.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-1020716.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-1020716.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-1020716.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-1020716.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Although they just passed me not even thirty seconds earlier, the driver didn’t realize I was even there. Suddenly, they slowed down, decided they were going to direct traffic, and waved on another car from an oncoming turn lane to cross over the two lanes into a parking lot, directly in front of me.</p>\n<p>The car made that left turn… directly into me. I slammed into it just behind the front passenger-side wheel of a Honda CRV while moving about 28 mph. I never saw it coming.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Poor-Blue-4088.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Poor-Blue-4088.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Poor-Blue-4088.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Poor-Blue-4088.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Poor-Blue-4107.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Poor-Blue-4107.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Poor-Blue-4107.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Poor-Blue-4107.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The impact was so sudden that I didn’t even have a chance to be confused about what had just happened. I was lying in the right lane, bleeding, concussed, and with the wind knocked out of me. The driver got out of his car and hovered over me, immediately yelling repeatedly that it was my fault and he’s not taking the blame for this. I hadn’t even tried to get up when I heard a soft soothing, but familiar voice call my name: “Don’t worry, Josh. I got you. Just tell me what you need me to do.” With a quick flip of his moto helmet visor, I realized it was my co-worker, Loz.</p>\n<p>“Can you please get this guy away from me,” was all I could say. So he did.</p>\n<p>Flashback 30 seconds: It turns out the other driver that directed the CRV to make the turn quickly accelerated to leave the scene after he saw the collision (likely because he probably knew he was partly responsible for it?). That sudden lane change almost caused another collision as it cut Loz off as he was approaching on his motorcycle through traffic. After slamming on the brakes, he noticed me lying in the road.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-00061.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-00061.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-00061.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-00061.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-00314.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-00314.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-00314.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-00314.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>It was pure luck that Loz was there; he immediately took control of the situation and stopped the driver who hit me as he tried to leave the scene. The guy attempted to get away not once, but twice, and a firefighter forced him to stay until CHP arrived. I refused the ambulance, and my partner, Brenna, rushed over to take me to the ER. After a few x-rays, I ended up with a concussion, stitches in my chin, a possible torn labrum, and a torn bicep tendon that would ultimately require shoulder surgery.</p>\n<p>The following week, I took the bike to my local shop for a full crash assessment report for the insurance company. Since it was a custom frame and fork with a few high-end parts, the total replacement at retail value added up to quite a bit. My lawyer sent the report to the insurance company, and they told me I’d receive a check within a week. I was stoked.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Onko-Rinku-Boat-Text.png?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Onko-Rinku-Boat-Text.png?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Onko-Rinku-Boat-Text.png?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Onko-Rinku-Boat-Text.png?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Poor-Blue-4113.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Poor-Blue-4113.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Poor-Blue-4113.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Poor-Blue-4113.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Well, that stoke only lasted until a few days later when I got a text from an auto auction company telling me to schedule a time for them to “come pick up my 2020 ONKO RINKU boat.” Apparently they thought my custom bike was a boat. I figured the insurance company didn’t know their ass from a hole in the ground when it came to bikes. I called my lawyer right away, and he had to go to bat to stop them from salvaging it. In the end, to get my check, I had to buy the bike back as a “salvage vehicle” for $475. This definitely made me kind of angry, but I took the deal, and they just subtracted it from the payout.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue2-0883.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue2-0883.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue2-0883.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue2-0883.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>After the check came through, I stripped all the parts, covered the frame in Jasco, and dropped it off with a friend who sandblasted at his work. The down tube was bent, and the top tube had a little hitch in its giddy-up, but Brendan was able to save the whole rear end, build another fork, and weld on a new front triangle. Complete with a new, brighter metallic blue paint job, a wheelset, and a few new parts, my Onko Rinkus shredmuter was reincarnated as “My Boy Blue.2”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue2-Reincarnated.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue2-Reincarnated.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue2-Reincarnated.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue2-Reincarnated.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue2-4719.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue2-4719.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue2-4719.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue2-4719.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>My Boy Blue 2: Onko Rinkus to the Rescue!</h3>\n<p>I couldn’t have asked for a better outcome than being able to salvage and rebuild the bike almost exactly as it was. But more than that, I was extremely grateful I hadn’t been hurt worse. If you’ve ever had shoulder surgery (this was my second rodeo on the same shoulder), then you know how long the recovery takes, how painful it is, and how brutal the physical therapy can be. Still, I tried my best not to let it drag me down. I was determined to keep going. After all the progress I had made in my fitness and the hope of having a promising season of racing, I was crushed to be stopped dead in my tracks by some asshole in a CRV.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-5886.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-5886.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-5886.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-5886.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-5893.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-5893.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-5893.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-5893.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>A few weeks after surgery (and against my physical therapist’s orders), I tightened up the sling close to my chest and started trail running. I needed to move my body and to feel forward momentum again. I’d push myself as far as I could stand, even with my shoulder jumbling around in pain. Between running and riding the trainer a few days a week, I was able to hold onto a little bit of the fitness I had worked so hard to build.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-5979.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-5979.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-5979.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-5979.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-5974.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-5974.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-5974.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-5974.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-5989.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-5989.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-5989.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-5989.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Almost exactly one year later, fully recovered, I lined up at the start of Lost &amp; Found on my singlespeed, shoulder to shoulder with a few teammates and best friends, ready to try and reclaim what was taken from me the year before. As soon as the race started, I was seeing red, and that didn’t stop. I was determined to finish with a spot on that podium. The only thing on my mind was proving to myself that I could do it and, frankly, a big “fuck you” to the asshole in the Honda CRV.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-6049.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-6049.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-6049.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-6049.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-6086.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-6086.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-6086.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue-6086.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Around mile 18, I passed the person I thought was sitting in third place and kept pushing to find the race leader. For miles and miles, I was chasing what turned out to be a ghost. As I rolled into the third aid station, where the timing tent was, they told me I was the first singlespeeder they’d seen and that I was in the lead. For some reason, I didn’t believe them, so I never let up. I pushed through the cramps and kept chasing that ghost to the finish. I crossed the line in 6:03:26 to put me on the top spot of that podium. And damn, did it feel good to be back!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue2-6134.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue2-6134.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue2-6134.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue2-6134.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue2-8410.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue2-8410.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue2-8410.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue2-8410.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue2-8428.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue2-8428.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue2-8428.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue2-8428.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue2-8448.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue2-8448.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue2-8448.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/My-Boy-Blue2-8448.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Having Brendan save My Boy Blue by bringing it back from the dead and building it up back before I could even start riding again fired me up. It meant a lot to me and was a huge part of the healing process. But in the end, a bike is just a bike, and ultimately it’s replaceable. I’m one of the lucky ones who got hit and walked away, while also getting to reincarnate one of my favorite bikes in the quiver. Plenty of others haven’t been so fortunate.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Josh-Becker-Onko-Rinkus-Basket-Bike-21.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Josh-Becker-Onko-Rinkus-Basket-Bike-21.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Josh-Becker-Onko-Rinkus-Basket-Bike-21.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/05/Josh-Becker-Onko-Rinkus-Basket-Bike-21.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Every day is a gift.
