Users running Vanguard on Windows 11 systems <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AntiCheatPD/status/1433767214130282497\">have seen pop-ups</a> notifying them that a TPM 2.0 module and Secure Boot support will both need to be present and enabled before Vanguard-protected games like <a href=\"https://playvalorant.com/en-us/\"><em>Valorant</em></a> will run on a Windows 11 PC. PCGamer <a href=\"https://www.pcgamer.com/valorant-leads-the-charge-on-enforcing-windows-tpm-to-perma-ban-cheaters-hardware/\">reports</a> that those requirements do not appear to apply to Windows 10 users, at least not yet (any Windows 10 system bought or built within the last five years or so will usually include TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot support, though one or both may be disabled by default).</p>\n<p>Vanguard is already notable for the low-level access it has to your system—it uses a kernel-mode driver that launches when Windows boots, whether you're playing a game that requires it or not. Shut down Vanguard for any reason, and you need to reboot Windows before you can launch a protected game. Services like <a href=\"https://easy.ac/en-us/\">Easy Anti-Cheat</a> also advertise kernel-level protection.</p>\n<p>These kernel-level services do work better than anti-cheat services that run in \"user mode\" with most of your other apps, but buggy or compromised kernel-level software can also potentially <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/04/ring-0-of-fire-does-riot-games-new-anti-cheat-measure-go-too-far/\">cause more instability and security problems</a>. They also aren't foolproof; external hardware can still be used to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/07/cheat-maker-brags-of-computer-vision-auto-aim-that-works-on-any-game/\">get around kernel-level anti-cheat software</a>, and many online games rely on user reports to identify and ban cheaters.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1792789#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1792789&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"021851a182e7d72f94ee08bfe99c63080d8ad437277f9fe075541adaaf3cb68a","category":"Tech"}
