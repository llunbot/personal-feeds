News emerged at the Giro d’Italia of potential links to Chinese companies, and at the 2024 Tour de France, XDS and Astana team management began negotiations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘As a result [of negotiations], mutual understanding was reached, and a decision to cooperate was made,’ Astana said in its first official comment about the matter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I am very happy to be part of this project and look to the future with great enthusiasm,’ says Alexander Vinokourov, the current team director of Astana Qazaqstan. ‘We understand that the team and the entire project as a whole will face some significant changes, but we are ready for this.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The significant changes will come in the form of a larger budget, a new Chinese identity and some major technical shakeups according to XDS’s CEO and the Astana team staff. News of when these changes will arrive is not currently confirmed, but it is possible that it could begin in 2025.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n

message that the team’s budget will increase and that XDS has ‘invested’ in the team for a period of at least five years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The draft agreement provides for long-term investment for a period of at least five years and financing at the level of leading WorldTour teams.’ It has been previously speculated that a Chinese-invested Astana team would seek a budget similar to that of cycling’s super-teams such as Visma-Lease a Bike, UAE Team Emirates and Ineos Grenadiers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We have been diligently searching for an investor capable of taking the team to a new level of development,’ Vinokourov states, hinting at the future plans for ‘super-team status’. Astana currently sit deep within the relegation zone of the UCI Rankings and if things don’t improve by the end of 2025, the team could face a demotion to the second-tier of professional cycling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘XDS is ready for long-term investment, which, among other things, will include technical partnership with a new bicycle brand,’ Vinokourov confirms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is likely that X-Lab, the bike manufacturer within XDS’s business umbrella, will supply the team’s bikes as part of this new deal. X-Lab provided some of the bikes for China’s mountain biking squad at the last Olympic Games.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>‘We will make sure the team has very enough budget’</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T112557.099-970x647.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T112557.099-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T112557.099-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T112557.099-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T112557.099-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T112557.099-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T112557.099-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T112557.099-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T112557.099-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T112557.099-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-15T112557.099.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Charly Lopez</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In response to the news, the CEO of XDS Yancong Tan expressed his satisfaction with the new deal, ‘Since 2022, we started seeking for the opportunity to get involved in the WorldTour,’ he said. ‘It was very lucky that we met Astana Qazaqstan Team this year in the Shanghai show.

Regardless, the partnership with Astana Qazaqstan will no doubt help elevate the XDS brand outside of the Asia-Pacific market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Chinese-Kazakh collaboration may also spell the end of the team’s Astana moniker, which has used since 2006.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/mark-cavendish-wilier-filante-slr-tour-de-france-2024\">Pro bike: Mark Cavendish’s record-breaking Wilier Filante SLR</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/mark-cavendish-tour-de-france-2024\">‘It’s not romantic’: Mark Cavendish on his final Tour de France, #35 and an Astana lifeline</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pro-cycling-sponsors\">Who actually are the Tour de France team sponsors 2024?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/astana-qazaqstan-rap-review\">Astana Qazaqstan’s new rap video has dropped: The Cyclist review</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/chinese-company-invests-in-astana-qazaqstan\">Chinese company XDS to invest in Astana Qazaqstan</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Ewan Wilson &#124; Staff Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"1faa70a59c4cab5ec2afb2002b3a787f1f19bfaea026532eac3c5b22eae91aa4","category":"Cycling"}
