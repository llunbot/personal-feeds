Gone are the red graphics, which are now replaced by a more subdued white, which the brand says suits a larger range of bikes.</p>\n<p>The derailleurs feature removable batteries that can be charged on or off the bike. Campagnolo says the batteries will last 750km in heavy use but reckons you could get 1,000km from them in normal conditions.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Campagnolo Super Record Wireless front derailleur\" title=\"Campagnolo Super Record Wireless front derailleur\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The derailleurs can be charged on or off the bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Both derailleurs feature magnetic ‘Mac-type’ charging ports. Campagnolo claims the batteries can be charged to 90 per cent in 45 minutes or full in 60 minutes.</p>\n<p>If you happen to run out of battery on a ride, Campagnolo says you can charge the system up to 20 per cent in 10 minutes, providing you’re carrying the charge cable.</p>\n<p>You cannot swap the batteries between the derailleurs because they are different. Campagnolo says it needed to use different battery shapes to avoid infringing on SRAM’s patent.</p>\n<p>SRAM shares batteries across its front and rear derailleurs, as well as other wireless components such as its dropper post, so they can be interchanged.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Campagnolo Super Record Wireless battery charger\" title=\"Campagnolo Super Record Wireless battery charger\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This is the battery charger that powers the derailleurs.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Campagnolo</i></span></div>\n<p>Campagnolo says replacement batteries are available if you want to carry spares on a ride. If the groupset runs out of charge, you will be stuck in whatever gear you happen to be in. Campagnolo says it is developing a ‘Ride Home Function’, where you can manually select a gear, and plans to roll this feature out in a future firmware update.</p>\n<p>The electronic components of the groupset are ingress protection rated to IP69K (the outgoing Super Record 12 EPS groupset was rated to IP67).</p>\n<p>Campagnolo says this level of protection means you can even <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-pressure-wash-a-bike/\">pressure wash</a> the components. The brand says it tested this in production, although it doesn’t recommend doing so.</p>\n<p>Campagnolo will also be launching the MyCampy 3.0 app. This will enable you to monitor the charge of the components and customise the groupset’s settings.</p>\n<p>The existing MyCampy app for the previous EPS groupset will continue to exist for now, but Campagnolo says it is planning to combine the two together.</p>\n<h2>Campagnolo Super Record Wireless shifters</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Campagnolo Super Record Wireless shifters\" title=\"Campagnolo Super Record Wireless shifters\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Gone are the thumb shifters.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The shifters represent the most significant development, with Campagnolo ditching its iconic thumb shifter. Campagnolo’s previous shifters use a thumb shifter on the inside face to change into a smaller cassette cog or chainring.</p>\n<p>The brand says the decision to remove the thumb shifter was market-oriented and it says there was a 50:50 split on whether people got on with it.</p>\n<p>Each shifter paddle features two separate buttons, with Campagnolo referring to the shifting logic as “one lever, one action”.</p>\n<p>In fact, the shifting arrangement is similar to Shimano Di2, only the buttons are separated vertically, rather than sitting side by side and overlaying each other.  Unlike <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/fsa-k-force-we-groupset-review/\">FSA’s K-Force WE</a>, the buttons aren’t shared on a single rocker paddle.</p>\n<p>By default, the uppermost button on the right shifter shifts the rear derailleur into an easier gear, with the lower button for a harder gear.</p>\n<p></p><div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-shifter-logic-annotated-right-011d7fe.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Annotated image of Campagnolo Super Record Wireless lever button functions\" title=\"Annotated image of Campagnolo Super Record Wireless lever button functions\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>There are two buttons, one on top of the other.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/05/Campagnolo-Super-Record-Wireless-shifter-logic-annotated-left-d64f821.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Annotated image of Campagnolo Super Record Wireless lever button functions\" title=\"Annotated image of Campagnolo Super Record Wireless lever button functions\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The left-hand shifter functions in much the same way.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\nThe uppermost button on the left shifter shifts you into the big chainring and the lower button into the small chainring.\n<p>However, you can customise the shifting logic in the MyCampy 3.0 app, if this isn’t to your tastes.</p>\n<p>The body lever shape has been redesigned and Campagnolo says the new hood features extra grip and cushioning for enhanced riding comfort, as well as more efficient braking.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Campagnolo Super Record Wireless shifters\" title=\"Campagnolo Super Record Wireless shifters\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The lever is less angular than its predecessor.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The lever is also a slightly different shape compared to its predecessor – a little shorter and wider than the previous Super Record 12 EPS groupset.</p>\n<p>On the inside, where the thumb shifter used to live, are two mode buttons, which are used to set up the indexing and monitor battery life.</p>\n<p>When you shift gear, a blue flash next to the mode button indicates good charge. If the light flashes red, that signifies there is less than 15 per cent of charge left.</p>\n<p>Campagnolo has also removed the bump on the shifter hood where it transitions to the handlebar.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Campagnolo Super Record Wireless shifters\" title=\"Campagnolo Super Record Wireless shifters\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Peeling back the rubber hood exposes a slot for a CR2032 battery.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The shifters are powered by a CR2032 coin battery on the outside of each shifter. Campagnolo says it’ll last for two years, broadly in line with SRAM’s AXS and Shimano’s Di2 systems.</p>\n<p>The levers feature 15mm of reach adjustment. This is adjusted with a 2.5mm hex bolt on the inside of the lever blade. Campagnolo has abandoned its AMS (Adjustable Modulation System) contact adjustment, which adjusted the bite point of the pads contacting the rotor because it found riders didn’t really use it.</p>\n<p>The shifters communicate with the derailleurs via Bluetooth and ANT+.</p>\n<h2>Campagnolo Super Record Wireless cassette</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Campagnolo Super Record Wireless rear derailleur and cassette\" title=\"Campagnolo Super Record Wireless rear derailleur and cassette\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Other than the 10t, the cassette has a similar appearance to Campagnolo’s other 12-speed cassettes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Like SRAM, Campagnolo’s road cassettes now start with a 10t cog and are made of CNC-machined steel.</p>\n<p>Campagnolo will be offering three cassette sizes – 10-25t, 10-27t and 10-29t. Previous-generation 12-speed cassettes started with an 11t.</p>\n<p>The 13-25/27/29 cluster is made of a single piece, with the 10, 11 and 12-tooth cogs separate pieces.</p>\n<p>The cassettes run on Campagnolo’s N3W (Next Three Ways) <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/freehubs/\">freehub</a> body. This standard was first introduced on its latest Shamal wheels a few months before Ekar’s release, with two of its cassettes using a 9t starting cog. The standard is backwards compatible with existing 10, 11 and 12-speed Campagnolo cassettes.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Cassette on bike\" title=\"Campagnolo Ekar groupset\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Two of Ekar’s three cassettes start with a minuscule 9t.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matthew Loveridge / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>BikeRadar asked Campagnolo if it considered starting its cassettes with a 9t but the brand replied it wasn’t necessary. While the brand didn’t expand on this further, it may be due to additional potential drivetrain friction.</p>\n<p>Like Ekar (which features six one-tooth jumps), Campagnolo has paid attention to optimising the tooth progressions. All of the cassette options feature at least six one-tooth jumps in the first six cogs and there are never any jumps larger than three teeth.</p>\n<p>The ratios are as follows:</p>\n<div>\n                <table><colgroup><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col></colgroup><thead><tr><th></th><th>High (12th)</th><th>11th</th><th>10th</th><th>9th</th><th>8th</th><th>7th</th><th>6th</th><th>5th</th><th>4th</th><th>3rd</th><th>2nd</th><th>Low (1st)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><b>10-25</b></td><td>10</td><td>11</td><td>12</td><td>13</td><td>14</td><td>15</td><td>16</td><td>17</td><td>19</td><td>21</td><td>23</td><td>25</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>10-27</b></td><td>10</td><td>11</td><td>12</td><td>13</td><td>14</td><td>15</td><td>16</td><td>17</td><td>19</td><td>21</td><td>24</td><td>27</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>10-29</b></td><td>10</td><td>11</td><td>12</td><td>13</td><td>14</td><td>15</td><td>16</td><td>18</td><td>20</td><td>23</td><td>26</td><td>29</td>        </tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n<p>Campagnolo says the new groupset is not compatible with previous-generation 12-speed cassettes, and vice versa. It specifically stressed a 10-25t cassette is not compatible because the system has been designed around specific gear ratios.</p>\n<h2>Campagnolo Super Record Wireless rear derailleur</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Campagnolo Super Record Wireless rear derailleur and cassette\" title=\"Campagnolo Super Record Wireless rear derailleur and cassette\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A single rear derailleur is used across the various cassette ratios.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>There’s just one rear derailleur to cover the three cassette options and it’s produced from technopolymer and carbon fibre.</p>\n<p>Shifting speed is increased over Super-Record EPS and you can shift from one end of the cassette to the other by holding onto the relevant button, which Campagnolo calls MultiShift.</p>\n<p>Unlike SRAM, which uses its Orbit clutch damper (or spring clutch on its Rival eTap AXS rear derailleur), Super Record Wireless doesn’t feature a clutch mechanism to manage the chain.</p>\n<p></p><div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/05/CAMBIO-front-SUPER-RECORD-WRL-2024-039dd37.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Campagnolo Super Record Wireless rear derailleur\" title=\"Campagnolo Super Record Wireless rear derailleur\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The derailleur cage is constructed from carbon. </span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Campagnolo</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2023/05/CAMBIOnoBATT-front-SUPER-RECORD-WRL-2024-6250e33.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" width=\"556\" height=\"723\" alt=\"Campagnolo Super Record Wireless rear derailleur\" title=\"Campagnolo Super Record Wireless rear derailleur\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The battery is easily removable. </span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Campagnolo</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\nThe derailleur cage has been redesigned and is now constructed from carbon fibre.

Their patented rounded shape is said to regulate temperature and reduce risk of injury.</p>\n<p>Campagnolo says when it was originally developing the rotors it undertook medical laboratory research and experimented with fake skin to find the best shape.</p>\n<p>The discs are available in 140mm and 160mm sizes in Center Lock only and continue to be 1.85mm thick – a little wider than Shimano and SRAM.</p>\n<p>Campagnolo continues to use a floating design with seven rotor carriers on the 160mm rotor and six on the 140mm.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Campagnolo Super Record Wireless brake caliper and rotor\" title=\"Campagnolo Super Record Wireless brake caliper and rotor\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The rounded profile is claimed to prevent injury.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The brand says a small amount of play is built into the rotors. This can be felt when rocking the bike back and forth with the brakes locked. Campagnolo says this enables the brake to better absorb heat when descending.</p>\n<h2>Campagnolo Super Record Wireless crankset</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Campagnolo Super Record Wireless crankset and front derailleur\" title=\"Campagnolo Super Record Wireless crankset and front derailleur\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> It’s unmistakably a Campagnolo crankset.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The Super Record Wireless <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/cranksets/\">crankset</a> uses a four-arm design. The arms are constructed from carbon fibre and paired with a titanium axle.</p>\n<p>The crank arms are a little smaller in profile than the outgoing Super Record to meet modern frame standards. It retains the carbon bracing for stiffness purposes.</p>\n<p>To complement the smaller 10t starting cassette sprocket, Campagnolo is using smaller chainring sizes.</p>\n<p>The three options are 50/34, 48/32 and 45/29-tooth, with all of the cranksets sharing an identical 121/88mm asymmetric BCD and a 45.8mm chainline.</p>\n<p>The cranks are available in 165, 170, 172.5 and 175mm lengths. The Q-factor is 147.5mm, up from 145.5mm on previous 12-speed cranksets.</p>\n<p>The brand says it may introduce larger chainring sizes for the pros.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Campagnolo Super Record Wireless crankset\" title=\"Campagnolo Super Record Wireless crankset\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Like its predecessor, the crank bolt is located on the non-driveside.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>When SRAM released its eTap AXS 12-speed ecosystem, it also utilised smaller-sized chainrings – 50/37, 48/35 and 46/33. As Campagnolo intends to, SRAM produces pro-only larger chainrings.</p>\n<p>The crankset continues to use Campagnolo’s tried-and-tested Ultra Torque system, which sees the titanium spindle split in two. The two halves are connected by a Hirth joint.</p>\n<p>Super Record has always been the outlier of Campagnolo’s cranksets in that it uses a titanium bolt with a reverse thread to remove the cranks and that continues with this generation. Lower-tier cranksets use a steel bolt with a standard thread.</p>\n<p>Campagnolo says you can’t run the system as a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/1x-drivetrains/\">1x drivetrain</a>, nor did it consider collaborating with Classified for Powershift compatibility.</p>\n<p>SRAM offers its road bike groupsets in both 1x and 2x configurations, whereas Shimano’s road groupsets all utilise 2x cranksets. Classified’s Powershift is a 2-speed gear system housed in the rear hub that effectively replaces a front derailleur.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Campagnolo Super Record Wireless crankset power meter fitting\" title=\"Campagnolo Super Record Wireless crankset power meter fitting\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This nodule is almost certainly for a future power meter.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The eagle-eyed among you may spot a nodule on the inside of the crank arm.

It’s already available in a number of threaded and press-fit standards.</p>\n<p>The Super Record Wireless variant uses the brand’s USB (Ultra Smooth Bearings) ceramic bearings.</p>\n<h2>Campagnolo Super Record Wireless chain</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Campagnolo Super Record chain with C-link (quick link)\" title=\"Campagnolo Super Record chain with C-link (quick link)\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Many will be overjoyed to see a quick link.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The chain is unchanged from the previous 12-speed groupsets, barring the new option of using a joining pin or C-link (<a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/chain-quick-links/\">quick link</a>).</p>\n<p>With the exception of Ekar, all of Campagnolo’s chains have used a joining pin up to this point. The pin requires peening and only certain <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-chain-tool/\">chain tools</a> have this function.</p>\n<p>The new chain is backwards-compatible with Campagnolo’s other 12-speed groupsets.</p>\n<h2>What does this mean for the future?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Campagnolo Record 12 crankset on Pinarello GAN K\" title=\"Campagnolo Record 12 crankset on Pinarello GAN K\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Is Record the next groupset to get the Wireless treatment?</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Campagnolo was tight-lipped on any specific future developments, but noted it always launches new technology at the top of the range before trickling it down.</p>\n<p>While that means a lower-tier Wireless groupset is likely to come in the future, whether it wears the Record or Chorus name remains to be seen.</p>\n<p>The brand says top riders in its pro teams will get to ride on Super Record Wireless first, before it trickles down to the rest of the riders. Campagnolo also confirmed there is a time-trial shifter in development.</p>\n<p>Speaking to BikeRadar, Campagnolo confirmed that, as the market has moved on, it sees less demand for top-end mechanical groupsets. As such, the brand currently has no plans to produce an updated mechanical version of Super Record.</p>","author":"Oscar Huckle","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"db51df0025be0ede828018515da2904b2c4d75e6328f3046ee2270b291f7f075","category":"Cycling"}
