Bikerumor</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve been watching the progression of Zoceli’s full-suspension steel mountain bikes for a few years, all designed and handcrafted in the Czech Republic. They also have some fun names, for those who dig into the Czech language. The brand itself “<em>z oceli</em>” means simply the bikes made ‘<em>of steel</em>‘. And now the new trail bike “<em>na rum</em>” means ‘<em>for rum</em>‘. Like, <em>let’s go for a ride to get a shot</em>. Drink and ride responsibly, of course. But just another reminder not to take riding bikes too seriously.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Narum-handmade-steel-full-suspension-trail-mountain-bike_made-in-Czechia_linkages.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Narum-handmade-steel-full-suspension-trail-mountain-bike_made-in-Czechia_linkages.jpg\" alt=\"Zoceli Narum handmade steel full-suspension trail mountain bike, made in Czechia, suspension detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Narum-handmade-steel-full-suspension-trail-mountain-bike_made-in-Czechia_linkages.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Narum-handmade-steel-full-suspension-trail-mountain-bike_made-in-Czechia_linkages-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Narum-handmade-steel-full-suspension-trail-mountain-bike_made-in-Czechia_linkages-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Narum-handmade-steel-full-suspension-trail-mountain-bike_made-in-Czechia_linkages-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Narum-handmade-steel-full-suspension-trail-mountain-bike_made-in-Czechia_linkages-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Narum-handmade-steel-full-suspension-trail-mountain-bike_made-in-Czechia_linkages-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Narum is another new short-link 4-bar suspension design, this time with a vertical linkage-driven shock. Designed to be a progressive, poppy trail bike, the Zoceli Narum can be setup with either 135mm or 125mm of rear travel (with a 185 x 55mm or 50mm stroke Trunnion shock). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zoceli framebuilder Martin Saida designed the Narum and its geometry around a 140mm fork. But you can also build it with up to 160mm forks if you are looking for something slacker.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Narum-handmade-steel-full-suspension-trail-mountain-bike_made-in-Czechia_rear-triangle.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Narum-handmade-steel-full-suspension-trail-mountain-bike_made-in-Czechia_rear-triangle.jpg\" alt=\"Zoceli Narum handmade steel full-suspension trail mountain bike, made in Czechia, rear triangle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Narum-handmade-steel-full-suspension-trail-mountain-bike_made-in-Czechia_rear-triangle.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Narum-handmade-steel-full-suspension-trail-mountain-bike_made-in-Czechia_rear-triangle-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Narum-handmade-steel-full-suspension-trail-mountain-bike_made-in-Czechia_rear-triangle-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Narum-handmade-steel-full-suspension-trail-mountain-bike_made-in-Czechia_rear-triangle-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Narum-handmade-steel-full-suspension-trail-mountain-bike_made-in-Czechia_rear-triangle-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Narum-handmade-steel-full-suspension-trail-mountain-bike_made-in-Czechia_rear-triangle-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Narum-handmade-steel-full-suspension-trail-mountain-bike_made-in-Czechia_rear-triangle-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Narum-handmade-steel-full-suspension-trail-mountain-bike_made-in-Czechia_rear-triangle-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides their 26″ slopestyle bike, the Narum is Zoceli’s shortest travel mountain bike. It’s definitely designed to be more of an everyday trail bike vs. their bigger bikes that are more suited to bikeparks or full-on gravity racing. That said, the Narum still provides a stiff ‘steel is real’ platform ready for abuse, and gets slack geometry that’s capable of handling steep technical terrain.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Narum Tech Details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Narum-handmade-steel-full-suspension-trail-mountain-bike_made-in-Czechia_linkage-detail.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Narum-handmade-steel-full-suspension-trail-mountain-bike_made-in-Czechia_linkage-detail.jpg\" alt=\"Zoceli Narum handmade steel full-suspension trail mountain bike, made in Czechia, linkage detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Narum-handmade-steel-full-suspension-trail-mountain-bike_made-in-Czechia_linkage-detail.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Narum-handmade-steel-full-suspension-trail-mountain-bike_made-in-Czechia_linkage-detail-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Narum-handmade-steel-full-suspension-trail-mountain-bike_made-in-Czechia_linkage-detail-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Narum-handmade-steel-full-suspension-trail-mountain-bike_made-in-Czechia_linkage-detail-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Narum-handmade-steel-full-suspension-trail-mountain-bike_made-in-Czechia_linkage-detail-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Narum-handmade-steel-full-suspension-trail-mountain-bike_made-in-Czechia_linkage-detail-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Zoceli Narum frame is handbuilt in Brno, Czechia in the heart of Europe from a mix of chromoly and Columbus steel tubing. Its 3-piece rocker &amp; 1-piece lower links are machined from 6060 alloy, and all threaded pivot hardware are CNC-machined from 7075 aluminum. All threaded pivot hardware is replaceable. Links rotate on standard-sized sealed bearings and stainless steel hardware.

Saida designed it around 160mm of front wheel travel. But you can also go up or down with 150-170mm forks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The enduro bike is just a half a degree slacker up front than the new trail bike, and actually has shorter frame reach and slacker seat angle putting rider weight a bit further back to go down steeper tracks.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Naosm-handmade-steel-full-suspension-enduro-mountain-bike_made-in-Czechia_detail.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Naosm-handmade-steel-full-suspension-enduro-mountain-bike_made-in-Czechia_detail.jpg\" alt=\"Zoceli Nasom handmade steel full-suspension enduro mountain bike, made in the Czech Republic, suspension detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Naosm-handmade-steel-full-suspension-enduro-mountain-bike_made-in-Czechia_detail.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Naosm-handmade-steel-full-suspension-enduro-mountain-bike_made-in-Czechia_detail-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Naosm-handmade-steel-full-suspension-enduro-mountain-bike_made-in-Czechia_detail-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Naosm-handmade-steel-full-suspension-enduro-mountain-bike_made-in-Czechia_detail-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Naosm-handmade-steel-full-suspension-enduro-mountain-bike_made-in-Czechia_detail-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Naosm-handmade-steel-full-suspension-enduro-mountain-bike_made-in-Czechia_detail-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Naosm-handmade-steel-full-suspension-enduro-mountain-bike_made-in-Czechia_detail-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Suspension-wise, the Naosm also gets a short-link 4-bar suspension design. But here those links rotate in opposite directions from each other. And the horizontal shock is driven by the lower link, which also happens to rotate on double-row bearings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Naosm is also welded in-house from chromoly tubes, a folded plate cage, and Columbus tubing. That box around the pierced lower seattube also houses a stainless bottle opener for post-ride adult beverages.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Dobordelu steel freeride bike frame</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Dobordelo-mk2_handmade-steel-full-suspension-freeride-mountain-bike_made-in-the-Czech-Republic_frameset.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Dobordelo-mk2_handmade-steel-full-suspension-freeride-mountain-bike_made-in-the-Czech-Republic_frameset.jpg\" alt=\"Zoceli Dobordelu handmade steel full-suspension freeride mountain bike, made in the Czech Republic, frame\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Dobordelo-mk2_handmade-steel-full-suspension-freeride-mountain-bike_made-in-the-Czech-Republic_frameset.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Dobordelo-mk2_handmade-steel-full-suspension-freeride-mountain-bike_made-in-the-Czech-Republic_frameset-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Dobordelo-mk2_handmade-steel-full-suspension-freeride-mountain-bike_made-in-the-Czech-Republic_frameset-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Dobordelo-mk2_handmade-steel-full-suspension-freeride-mountain-bike_made-in-the-Czech-Republic_frameset-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Dobordelo-mk2_handmade-steel-full-suspension-freeride-mountain-bike_made-in-the-Czech-Republic_frameset-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Dobordelo-mk2_handmade-steel-full-suspension-freeride-mountain-bike_made-in-the-Czech-Republic_frameset-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Dobordelo-mk2_handmade-steel-full-suspension-freeride-mountain-bike_made-in-the-Czech-Republic_frameset-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Dobordelu freeride bike is both bigger and a bit more complex. It gets 175mm or 180mm of rear wheel travel from another short-link 4-bar design, paired to 180-200mm forks. But this time, the lower main pivot is concentric around the threaded bottom bracket. That’s said to help keep chainstays short and chain growth to a minimum on this big freeride shredder.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Dobordelo-mk2_handmade-steel-full-suspension-freeride-mountain-bike_made-in-the-Czech-Republic_BB-linkage-detail.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Dobordelo-mk2_handmade-steel-full-suspension-freeride-mountain-bike_made-in-the-Czech-Republic_BB-linkage-detail.jpg\" alt=\"Zoceli Dobordelu handmade steel full-suspension freeride mountain bike, made in the Czech Republic, suspension detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Dobordelo-mk2_handmade-steel-full-suspension-freeride-mountain-bike_made-in-the-Czech-Republic_BB-linkage-detail.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Dobordelo-mk2_handmade-steel-full-suspension-freeride-mountain-bike_made-in-the-Czech-Republic_BB-linkage-detail-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Dobordelo-mk2_handmade-steel-full-suspension-freeride-mountain-bike_made-in-the-Czech-Republic_BB-linkage-detail-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Dobordelo-mk2_handmade-steel-full-suspension-freeride-mountain-bike_made-in-the-Czech-Republic_BB-linkage-detail-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Dobordelo-mk2_handmade-steel-full-suspension-freeride-mountain-bike_made-in-the-Czech-Republic_BB-linkage-detail-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Dobordelo-mk2_handmade-steel-full-suspension-freeride-mountain-bike_made-in-the-Czech-Republic_BB-linkage-detail-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Zoceli-Dobordelo-mk2_handmade-steel-full-suspension-freeride-mountain-bike_made-in-the-Czech-Republic_BB-linkage-detail-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Integrated around the Dobordelu’s lower link, Zoceli has developed a built-in chainguide with a Sag-o-meter to help dial in suspension setup.

So, we don’t often see complete bikes. These two are just a couple of builder Saida’s own bikes to get an idea of what these steel shredders look like with wheels on ’em. Everything from the shock to the tires is up to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Zoceli <a href=\"https://www.zoceli.cz/en/narum\" target=\"_blank\">Narum</a> sells for 2600€ for the frameset.

Then, you get to pick from 27.5, 29″, or mullet wheels geo. As a result, it also means you get to pick your paint color. Zoceli includes any RAL powder coat color in the standard price. Clear powder coating adds 85€ extra to see the raw steel tube colors underneath, and 220€ chrome plating can give your new frame a mirror finish. Custom wet paint is possible, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frame orders require a 50% deposit up front, with delivery lead times between 2-3 months. Although, a limited number of pre-built frames are sometimes ready to ship right away.
