If that interests you, you might want to wait.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>AirPods Pro: Pricing and specs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Last update: September  2022</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three years after the original AirPods Pro, the second-gen version landed in September of 2022. They sound better, have better noise cancelling quality, the battery lasts longer, the case supports Find My…it’s just a nice improvement all around. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the typical update cadence for AirPods, we don’t expect a new model until at least 2024 and likely 2025. In fact, the only real rumor right now is that Apple is going to make new super-affordable AirPods that certainly won’t compete with the AirPods Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>Apple AirPods Pro (second-generation)</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"1960\" height=\"1566\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/AirPods-Pro-2nd-gen-hero.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Apple AirPods Pro (second-generation)\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/AirPods-Pro-2nd-gen-hero.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1960w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/AirPods-Pro-2nd-gen-hero.jpg?resize=300%2C240&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/AirPods-Pro-2nd-gen-hero.jpg?resize=768%2C614&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/AirPods-Pro-2nd-gen-hero.jpg?resize=1200%2C959&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/AirPods-Pro-2nd-gen-hero.jpg?resize=1536%2C1227&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$249\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BDHWDR12?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$199.99 at  Amazon</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-pro-2nd-generation%2F-%2FA-85978612&amp;publisher_slug=macworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=macworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macworld.com%2Ffeed&amp;u1=1-1-351589-5-1344377-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$199.99 at  Target </a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Facmqd83ama.html&amp;publisher_slug=macworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=macworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macworld.com%2Ffeed&amp;u1=1-1-351589-5-1344377-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$219 at  Adorama</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<h2>AirPods Pro: Why you should buy</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The AirPods Pro are a big step up from regular AirPods, and the second-gen version is a surprisingly significant improvement from the first. They have quite good noise cancellation, the battery lasts a lot longer, and sound quality has improved in general.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of iOS’s best AirPods features work only with AirPods Pro. Spatial Audio in Apple Music works on all headphones, but enabling it in video requires AirPods Pro or AirPods Max. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>AirPods Pro: Why you should wait</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now the only real reason to wait is to look for a sale. The latest model doesn’t have have the steep discounts you could find on the first-gen AirPods Pro, but that will change as time goes on. Our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673507/best-airpods-deals.html\">AirPods deals article</a> tracks the latest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One wrinkle: A recent rumor projects that Apple will make AirPods with USB-C charging, rather than Lightning, available at its September 12 event. It’s not clear to which AirPods models this might apply, or if they’ll have any other changes. If a USB-C charging case interests you, waiting might be a good idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there’s the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/550796/beats-fit-pro-review.html\">Beats Fit Pro</a>, which are not technically AirPods, but they are made by Apple (which owns Beats) and have the H1 chip inside. They do literally everything the AirPods Pro do except wireless charging, and they sound better, fit better, and have longer battery life. We think most iPhone users would be happier with those than the first-gen AirPods Pro. Now that the second-gen AirPods Pro are a few months old, it’s possible a second-gen Beats Fit Pro are right around the corner. If you prefer the Beats form factor, you might want to hold out for those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1338544/airpods-pro-2nd-generation-should-you-upgrade.html\">AirPods Pro 2022: Should you upgrade?</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673885/airpods-pro-lite-release-date-price-specs-rumours.html\">New AirPods 2023: What to expect from the next-gen AirPods.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Macworld recommends: BUY/WAIT</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The second-gen AirPods Pro are a really nice upgrade over the originals, and they’re probably going to be around for a couple more years before Apple replaces them. You could hold out for a sale, but you might be waiting a while–go ahead and grab ’em now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you really want a USB-C charging case (rather than Lightning), wait for the September 12 event to see if there’s an update. If such a thing doesn’t matter to you, you’re probably safe buying AirPods now.</p>\n\nHeadphones</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"79ac401d4d78f20040fb25defb1947370325ca03dab619dc422b7f5776d15dee","category":"Apple"}
