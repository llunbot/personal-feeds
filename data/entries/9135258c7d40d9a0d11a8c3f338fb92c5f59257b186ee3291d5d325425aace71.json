This week, EU regulators announced that they are also categorizing Apple's iPadOS as a \"gatekeeper,\" meaning that the iPad will soon be subject to the same regulations as the iPhone.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=d0z8d8rx\">a developer blog post released today</a>, Apple said that it would comply with the EU's regulations \"later this fall, as required.\" All changes that Apple has made to iOS on European iPhones to comply with the DMA will be implemented in the same way on the iPad, though it's not clear whether these changes will be brought to iPadOS 17 or if they'll just be a part of the upcoming iPacOS 18 update.</p>\n\n<p>The EU began investigating whether iPadOS would qualify as a gatekeeper in September 2023, the same day it decided that iOS, the Safari browser, and the App Store were all gatekeepers.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020496#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020496&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9135258c7d40d9a0d11a8c3f338fb92c5f59257b186ee3291d5d325425aace71","category":"Tech"}
