However, the account's interest rate was lowered this week, with the annual percentage yield (APY) <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/28/apple-card-savings-account-rate-lowered-again/\">dropping from 3.75% to 3.65%</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/Apple-Card-iPhone-16-Pro-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2049\" height=\"1153\" />\r<br />\nIf you deposited $1,000 into the account, and maintained that balance for one year, you would earn $36.50 in interest based on the current APY.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe chart below compares the Apple Card savings account's APY to some other popular high-yield savings accounts in the United States.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<table>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <th>Provider</th>\r<br />\n <th>APY*</th>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Ally</td>\r<br />\n <td>3.60%</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Discover</td>\r<br />\n <td>3.60%</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>American Express</td>\r<br />\n <td>3.60%</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Capital One</td>\r<br />\n <td>3.60%</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td><strong>Apple Card Savings</strong></td>\r<br />\n <td><strong>3.65%</strong></td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <td>Marcus by Goldman Sachs</td>\r<br />\n <td>3.65%</td>\r<br />\n \r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n </tr><tr>\r<br />\n <td>Citizens Bank</td>\r<br />\n <td>3.70%</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>SoFi</td>\r<br />\n <td>3.80%</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Barclays</td>\r<br />\n <td>3.80%</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>PNC Bank</td>\r<br />\n <td>3.95%</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Synchrony</td>\r<br />\n <td>4.00%</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Betterment</td>\r<br />\n <td>4.00%</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Wealthfront</td>\r<br />\n <td>4.00%</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>UFB Direct</td>\r<br />\n <td>4.01%</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Fierce</td>\r<br />\n <td>4.25%</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Openbank by Santander</td>\r<br />\n <td>4.40%</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Pibank</td>\r<br />\n <td>4.60%</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n</table>\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\n<small>* Advertised APYs as of May 28, 2025, excluding promotional rates and affiliate bonuses.

The account can be opened and managed in the Wallet app on the iPhone, and it has no fees, no minimum deposits, and no minimum balance requirements. To open an account, you must have an Apple Card, be a U.S. resident, and be at least 18 years old.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe account allows Apple Card holders to earn interest on their Daily Cash cashback balance, and on funds deposited via a linked bank account or an Apple Cash balance. The maximum balance allowed <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/01/apple-card-savings-1-million-limit/\">is $1 million</a>, up from $250,000 originally.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen the account launched, Apple and Goldman Sachs offered an APY of 4.15%, but the rate has fluctuated, often in line with U.S. Federal Reserve benchmark rate changes. The APY peaked at 4.5% in early 2024, and the current 3.65% is an all-time low.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo open a savings account in the Wallet app, tap on your Apple Card, tap on the circle with three dots in it, tap Daily Cash, and select Set Up next to Savings.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGoldman Sachs may <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/15/goldman-sachs-apple-card-partnership-end-early/\">end its consumer lending partnership with Apple early</a>, but it is unclear if this will have any impact on Apple Card holders. According to a report earlier this year, there were at least <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/16/apple-card-new-partner-talks/\">three companies vying to replace Goldman Sachs</a> as the Apple Card's financial partner, including Barclays, Synchrony, and JPMorgan Chase. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/01/visa-american-express-apple-card-deal/\">Visa or American Express</a> may succeed Mastercard as the Apple Card's payment processor.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/\">Apple Card</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/28/apple-card-savings-account-comparison/\">Apple Card Savings Account vs. Competitors: Which Can Earn You More?</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-card-savings-account-vs-competitors-which-can-earn-you-more.2457818/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"65643d417d0651eeec897a320fd4520b45d43619376b6782f527340420ba014d","category":"Apple"}
