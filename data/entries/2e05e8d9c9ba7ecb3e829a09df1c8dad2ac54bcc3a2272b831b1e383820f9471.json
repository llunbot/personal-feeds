Two scenes in particular show King Harold feasting in an extravagant hall in a village called Bosham. Archaeologists think they have now located the site of that feast, concluding that it was the king's own home, according to a <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/antiquaries-journal/article/where-power-lies-lordly-power-centres-in-the-english-landscape-c-8001200/7FFE73EFCD219699F9632D4F3589096B\">new paper</a> published in The Antiquaries Journal.</p>\n<p>“The Norman Conquest saw a new ruling class supplant an English aristocracy that has left little in the way of physical remains, which makes the discovery at Bosham hugely significant,\" <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1071614\">said co-author Oliver Creighton</a> of the University of Exeter. \"We have found an Anglo-Saxon show-home.” The findings are part of an ongoing project called \"Where Power Lies,\" intended to assess archaeological evidence for aristocratic centers across England from the pre-Norman period.</p>\n<p>Scholars believe the Bayeux Tapestry dates back to the 11th century and was likely created just a few years after the Battle of Hastings, mostly likely commissioned by Bishop Odo of Bayeux (although there is still considerable debate over alternative theories). It's technically not a tapestry, since it's not woven but embroidered on linen using wool yarn of various colors. There are 58 individual scenes spanning 230 feet (nearly 70 meters) in length and 20 inches (50 cm) in height. Latin text provides context for the imagery. Among the historical events depicted is the appearance of what is now known as Halley's Comet, used here as a harbinger of the coming Norman invasion.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/a-telltale-toilet-reveals-lost-site-shown-in-bayeux-tapestry/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/01/a-telltale-toilet-reveals-lost-site-shown-in-bayeux-tapestry/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2e05e8d9c9ba7ecb3e829a09df1c8dad2ac54bcc3a2272b831b1e383820f9471","category":"Tech"}
