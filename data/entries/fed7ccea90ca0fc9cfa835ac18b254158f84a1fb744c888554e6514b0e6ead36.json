Indeed can anyone remember a Giro where heavy snow or rain or freak withdrawals hasn’t played a part? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It seems like RCS, the Giro’s organisers, are in a constant battle with finding a Cima Coppi – the highest point of the race – that avoids cancellation or neutralisation owing to bad weather. Soon Fausto’s memory will be only associated with climbs under 2,000m, just to be on the safe side.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/CAuldPhoto-2023GirodItalia-Stage7-0660-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Peloton rides up into mountains covered in snow\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/CAuldPhoto-2023GirodItalia-Stage7-0660-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/CAuldPhoto-2023GirodItalia-Stage7-0660-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/CAuldPhoto-2023GirodItalia-Stage7-0660-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/CAuldPhoto-2023GirodItalia-Stage7-0660-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/CAuldPhoto-2023GirodItalia-Stage7-0660-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/CAuldPhoto-2023GirodItalia-Stage7-0660-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/CAuldPhoto-2023GirodItalia-Stage7-0660-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/CAuldPhoto-2023GirodItalia-Stage7-0660-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/CAuldPhoto-2023GirodItalia-Stage7-0660-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/CAuldPhoto-2023GirodItalia-Stage7-0660-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Chris Auld</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>This year’s weather-related drama primarily affected Stage 13, when what was supposed to be a 206km slog featuring the Cima Coppi was reduced to a 75km blast starting at the foot of the lesser Croix de Coeur and concluding at Crans Montana. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Admittedly, it was exciting to watch <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/thibaut-pinot-giro-ditalia\" target=\"_blank\">Thibaut Pinot</a> and Jefferson Cepeda knocking seven shades out of each other only for Colombia’s Einer Rubio to exploit their spat and take a memorable win. But ‘exciting’ is not how the GC battle could be described. Waiting for one of the favourites to attack throughout the 106th edition was like, well, waiting for a Mark Cavendish sprint win: you needed to hang around right to the end.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-2023-gallery\">The 21 best photos from the Giro d’Italia 2023</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 143: on sale now!</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/vuelta-a-espana-route-race-reports-tv-guide-and-all-you-need-to-know\">Vuelta a España 2023: Stage-by-stage preview and everything we know so far</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>So muted was the fight for pink that we saw more action from the riders’ representative, Adam Hansen, than we did from the leading GC contenders. And when they did race the Plan B Cima Coppi in the Dolomites, it was less about ‘G’ than his Canadian namesake, debutant Derek Gee coming runner-up for a fourth time while pink jersey rivals Geraint Thomas and Primož Roglič cancelled each other out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the backloaded <em>percorso</em> eventually hit the bullseye in that decisive uphill time-trial, it did the race few favours in the build-up. It certainly didn’t help that Covid reared its ugly head, either. You can’t help but think that had Remco Evenepoel stayed around longer, Roglič, Thomas and João Almeida would have been forced to come out of their stasis a little earlier.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"347\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-970x347.jpg\" alt=\"Subscribe to Cyclist Magazine\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-970x347.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-300x107.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-768x275.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-1536x550.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-750x269.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-1140x408.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4.jpg 1818w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Holding back was an understandable, if predictable, choice for the favourites. The rain and freezing temperatures only compounded matters. It contributed to the most attritional Giro in recent memory with 51 riders forced out, largely through sickness or weather-related crashes, or in Tao Geoghegan Hart’s case, taken out by Alessandro Covi (not Covid). The smallest field for 20 years completed the race, which only sparked to life after Roglič dropped his chain in a sea of Slovenian spectators on Monte Lussari.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, course design is something that can be easily addressed, but to sidestep the extreme weather (which consistently sees favourites crash out or fall ill) you need a bold change. What I propose is swapping the Giro and the Vuelta a España in the race calendar.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/CAuldPhoto-2023GirodItalia-Stage13-7683-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Cycling fans behind barrier with pink advertising cover, fans all with raincoats and umbrellas as it rains\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/CAuldPhoto-2023GirodItalia-Stage13-7683-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/CAuldPhoto-2023GirodItalia-Stage13-7683-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/CAuldPhoto-2023GirodItalia-Stage13-7683-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/CAuldPhoto-2023GirodItalia-Stage13-7683-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/CAuldPhoto-2023GirodItalia-Stage13-7683-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/CAuldPhoto-2023GirodItalia-Stage13-7683-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/CAuldPhoto-2023GirodItalia-Stage13-7683-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/CAuldPhoto-2023GirodItalia-Stage13-7683-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/CAuldPhoto-2023GirodItalia-Stage13-7683-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/CAuldPhoto-2023GirodItalia-Stage13-7683-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Chris Auld</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The weather in Spain in May is just as predictably clement as it is in Italy in late August and early September. Not only would a later Giro dovetail nicely with the Italian autumn Classics – the Giro dell’Emilia, Tre Valli Varesine and Gran Piemonte – the final (and most overlooked) Monument of the season, Il Lombardia, would enjoy renewed significance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a precedent in running the Vuelta earlier, too. Before 1995, it was the first Grand Tour of the season, shoehorned into the calendar in late April to finish just ahead of the Giro. The change came because of its proximity to the Giro, but push the Italian race back until after the Tour and this issue disappears quicker than Fernando Gaviria in a bunch sprint.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/CAuldPhoto-2023GirodItalia-Stage16-5642-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclists riding along winding coastal road, view from road above after hairpin bend\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/CAuldPhoto-2023GirodItalia-Stage16-5642-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/CAuldPhoto-2023GirodItalia-Stage16-5642-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/CAuldPhoto-2023GirodItalia-Stage16-5642-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/CAuldPhoto-2023GirodItalia-Stage16-5642-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/CAuldPhoto-2023GirodItalia-Stage16-5642-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/CAuldPhoto-2023GirodItalia-Stage16-5642-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/CAuldPhoto-2023GirodItalia-Stage16-5642-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/CAuldPhoto-2023GirodItalia-Stage16-5642-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/CAuldPhoto-2023GirodItalia-Stage16-5642-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/CAuldPhoto-2023GirodItalia-Stage16-5642-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Chris Auld</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>An alternative, yet unsatisfactory, solution is to host the Giro in June. However, this is a month already packed with the traditional pre-Tour races such as the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/criterium-du-dauphine-preview\" target=\"_blank\">Dauphiné</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-suisse-preview\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de Suisse</a>. And hosting it so close to July would discourage riders from having a pop at what has practically become a dodo of cycling achievements: the Giro-Tour double.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Swapping the Giro and Vuelta would reinvigorate this holy grail. Although, knowing how race organisers operate, I imagine it would take years of conversations and Cima Coppi cancellations for it to be even considered, so averse are they to change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, a slightly later May start for the Giro may be the answer. It is rumoured that RCS is pushing for this in 2024 so that the last day can coincide with Italy’s national holiday, Republic Day, on Sunday 2nd June. After which it will be less than four weeks until the Tour de France starts… in Italy.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-vuelta-weather-swap\">Is it time to swap the dates of the Giro and Vuelta?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Martin James","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"fed7ccea90ca0fc9cfa835ac18b254158f84a1fb744c888554e6514b0e6ead36","category":"Cycling"}
