Let me explain why.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The case against steel</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/11/stiffness_05-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Carbon frame on stiffness testing apparatus\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/11/stiffness_05-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/11/stiffness_05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/11/stiffness_05-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/11/stiffness_05-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/11/stiffness_05-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/11/stiffness_05-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/11/stiffness_05-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/11/stiffness_05-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/11/stiffness_05.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>You want the lightest, stiffest bike possible? Don’t use steel. </figcaption><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want a bike to be as light and stiff as possible and you prize these characteristics above all others, you should make it out of carbon. If you claim otherwise, you’re ignoring the facts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The very lightest steel frames weigh more than even very average carbon ones, and steel bikes that manage to be very light only do so by virtue of being built up with expensive high-end components.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steel is also a far less versatile material than carbon composite, because carbon is infinitely customisable in a way that steel simply can’t be. There’s no limit to the number of ways you can lay up sheets of carbon to target stiffness, strength and flexibility where you want it. You can also make pretty much any shape you want, a critical consideration when it comes to aerodynamics.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bike-groupset-names-meaning\">Opinion: Why do bicycle groupset names make no sense?</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/opinion-electronic-shifting\">Opinion: Down with electronic shifting!</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-steel-road-bike\">Best steel road bikes 2023 reviewed</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>By contrast, a steel frame is inherently more compromised. Yes, you can select specific grades of steel for different tubes that have different fundamental properties, and yes you can do some very clever things to influence the materials behaviour ranging from exactly how you treat the metal during production, to butting and all manner of manipulation into different forms. However these methods all need to work within the limitations of the material.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/steel-microstructure-970x728.jpeg\" alt=\"Microscope image of steel showing crystalline structure\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/steel-microstructure-970x728.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/steel-microstructure-300x225.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/steel-microstructure-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/steel-microstructure-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/steel-microstructure-2048x1536.jpeg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/steel-microstructure-750x563.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/steel-microstructure-1140x855.jpeg 1140w\" /><figcaption>Put steel under a microscope and you might be surprised what you see. <em>Djhé via Wikimedia Commons.

Manufacturing methods work with the grain structure to produce finished products with the desired characteristics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think of it like wood – you wouldn’t make a table leg with the grain running crossways because it would be incredibly weak, with little ability to withstand shearing forces such as someone dragging the table across the floor. (You’d also need to start with a very wide tree, but that’s an unhelpful aside.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Grain structure is one reason steel products are often bent, forged or drawn rather than simply machined from solid blocks. These processes preserve grain structure and align it to the form of the finished piece, distributing stresses more evenly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Machining, on the other hand, cuts through the grain structure. As a result, if you compare two outwardly similar metal components (eg brake levers) where one is forged and one is machined, the forged one is likely to be stronger and less likely to have stress risers – points where stress is concentrated that can increase the chance of failure over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In reality, many components are made using a combination of processes. For example, the overall shape might be produced by forging, but finer detailing added by CNC machining.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My point here is that for all its wonderful qualities, a frame builder is limited in what they can do with steel because its fundamental structure can’t be changed at the point tubes are being turned into a bicycle. And at the macro level there’s only so much you can manipulate a tube – you can’t have any form you please.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"652\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/11/02175037/argon_18_insider_02-970x652.jpg\" alt=\"Carbon frame in mould\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/11/02175037/argon_18_insider_02-970x652.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/11/02175037/argon_18_insider_02-300x202.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/11/02175037/argon_18_insider_02-768x516.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/11/02175037/argon_18_insider_02-1536x1033.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/11/02175037/argon_18_insider_02-750x504.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/11/02175037/argon_18_insider_02-1140x767.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/11/02175037/argon_18_insider_02.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>There are literally infinite ways to lay up carbon. </figcaption><figcaption>George Marshall / Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Composites place more power in the hands of the manufacturer because the act of laying up carbon is analogous to being able to determine the desired microstructure of steel and arrange it differently to suit different areas of the frame.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As well as choosing different grades, weaves and types of carbon sheets to suit their needs, carbon frame manufacturers can specify the orientation of every piece during the lay-up process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>I do not hate steel bikes</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/genesis_pack-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Steel all-road bike\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/genesis_pack-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/genesis_pack-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/genesis_pack-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/genesis_pack-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/genesis_pack-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/genesis_pack-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/genesis_pack-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/genesis_pack-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/genesis_pack-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/genesis_pack-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>I actually really like steel, I’m just realistic about its properties. </figcaption><figcaption>Joseph Branston / Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Does it sound like I don’t like steel?

Our affection for the material is inextricably linked to our collective fetish for all things retro, and as a result we’re not always clear-eyed in our assessment of why we prefer one bike over another.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can tell when someone’s writing about steel – and I’ve been one of the offenders here – because they’ll trot out adjectives like ‘classy’ and ‘timeless’ while perhaps lauding ‘springy’ or ‘smooth’ ride quality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the latter point, there’s good data to suggest that steel frames aren’t any more compliant than aluminium or carbon ones. Alee Denham of <em>Cycling About</em> <a href=\"https://www.cyclingabout.com/why-impossible-steel-frames-more-comfortable-than-aluminium/\" target=\"_blank\">looked at this topic</a> back in 2020 and highlighted studies showing that vertical frame deflection – often taken to be a direct corollary to comfort – hardly varies between different materials because the frame contributes so little flex to the total package compared to other elements such as the tyres and seatpost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many steel bikes adopt traditional geometry with a near-horizontal top tube meaning there’s not much seatpost on show, and as a result it’s entirely likely they’ll be less comfortable than comparable aluminium and carbon designs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course ride feel is about more than simple deflection. Vibration damping is a significant factor (carbon composites tend to be good at this…) but some people simply prefer the way steel rides. That’s fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/03175051/dassi_insider_1_0-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Industrial oven for carbon\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/03175051/dassi_insider_1_0-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/03175051/dassi_insider_1_0-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/03175051/dassi_insider_1_0-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/03175051/dassi_insider_1_0-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/03175051/dassi_insider_1_0-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/03175051/dassi_insider_1_0-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/03175051/dassi_insider_1_0-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/01/03175051/dassi_insider_1_0.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>This is not your average oven. </figcaption><figcaption>Fred MacGregor / Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Steel is also intrinsically linked to notions of artisanal authenticity. It’s the OG frame material and unsurprisingly the one favoured by most custom builders, because you can build steel frames with some relatively simple and affordable equipment. The same is not true of carbon, which typically requires expensive industrial machinery such as specialist ovens (unless you’re <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/sideways-viola-townsend\" target=\"_blank\">Sideways</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let’s be clear: steel is pretty, practical and can be made into great bikes. It is not however the most highly optimisable material, nor the best choice if absolute performance (i.e. the best possible stiffness-to-weight ratio) is the priority.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steel is real, but it isn’t magic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Looking for more hot takes?
