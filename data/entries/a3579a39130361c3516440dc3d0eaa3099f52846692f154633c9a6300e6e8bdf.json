The 45mm GPS device is on sale for $379.00 in every Aluminum color, down from $429.00.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Apple Watch Series 9 is Apple's newest mainline wearable device. It shares the same look as the previous generation model, but includes a faster S9 chip, brighter display, and new features like Double Tap.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX5R8BP%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$50 OFF</div>Apple Watch Series 9 (41mm GPS) for $349.00</div></a></div>\r<br />\n<div><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHXF9R4Y%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$50 OFF</div>Apple Watch Series 9 (45mm GPS) for $379.00</div></a></div><h2>Apple Watch SE</h2>\r<br />\nAmazon has the 40mm GPS Apple Watch SE for $199.00, down from $249.00, and the 44mm GPS Apple Watch SE for $229.00, down from $279.00. Both models are available in three Aluminum colors: Midnight, Silver, and Starlight.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Apple Watch SE is Apple's low-cost option in the Apple Watch lineup, and it'll get the job done for most people who want a simple fitness tracker.

This one is available in a large collection of colors and band styles, and it's just about $10 away from the all-time low price.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Apple Watch Ultra 2 is Apple's most rugged wearable, and compared to the previous generation it has an improved GPS, more durable display, extra long battery life, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CHX7C4CL%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$50 OFF</div>Apple Watch Ultra 2 for $749.00</div></a></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBe sure to visit our full <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/\">Deals Roundup</a> to shop for even more Apple-related products and accessories.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/\">Apple Deals</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/03/apple-watch-new-year-deals/\">Apple Watch New Year Deals Include $50 Off Series 9, SE, and Ultra 2</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-new-year-deals-include-50-off-series-9-se-and-ultra-2.2415345/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Mitchel Broussard","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a3579a39130361c3516440dc3d0eaa3099f52846692f154633c9a6300e6e8bdf","category":"Apple"}
