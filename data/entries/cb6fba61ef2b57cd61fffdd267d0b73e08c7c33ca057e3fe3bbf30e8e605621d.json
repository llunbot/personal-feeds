Still, even in recent years, you could usually count on big-budget console games from major studios to receive at least a perfunctory disc release to fill up <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/08/why-some-of-us-will-miss-gamestop-when-its-gone/\">the dwindling GameStop shelves</a>.</p>\n<p>So it was a bit of a surprise that <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/05/alan-wake-ii-coming-in-mid-october-promising-another-cryptic-pc-powerhouse/\">yesterday's release date announcement for <em>Alan Wake 2</em></a> came alongside news that developer Remedy Entertainment and publisher Epic Games currently have \"no plans to release <em>Alan Wake 2</em> on disc,\" as they put it in <a href=\"https://www.alanwake.com/story/alan-wake-2-faq/\">a new FAQ</a>. When you look a little deeper, though, what might be more surprising is that there haven't been <em>more</em> major console publishers willing to give up on discs completely.</p>\n<h2>The rainbow of their reasons</h2>\n<p>The <em>Alan Wake 2</em> FAQ notes, correctly, that \"it is not uncommon to release modern games as digital-only.\" In fact, measured on a per-title basis, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/fewer-and-fewer-console-games-are-seeing-a-physical-release/\">the vast majority of console games are now not available on disc</a> at all. Still, such disc-free releases are relatively rare when it comes to the kinds of major games that dominate the console charts.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1942230#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1942230&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cb6fba61ef2b57cd61fffdd267d0b73e08c7c33ca057e3fe3bbf30e8e605621d","category":"Tech"}
