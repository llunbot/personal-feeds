But Apple’s other over-ear headphones, the Beats Studio Pro, get our full recommendation—especially when they’re on sale. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8PR4W22?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Amazon is selling the Beats Studio Pro for $180</a>, a savings of $170 and the best price we’ve ever seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1999165/beats-studio-pro-review.html\">Beats Studio Pro</a> headphones have a simple design compared to the AirPods Max, but many of the features are very similar. You’ll get active noise cancellation and transparency mode, personalized spatial audio, Siri support, on-device controls, and up to 40 hours of battery life. They also have a USB-C port that delivers lossless audio—a feature that’s not available on the AIrPods Max.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you want a pair of fantastic high-end noise-cancelling headphones without paying Apple’s exorbitant prices for a three-year-old model, go grab this deal before it’s gone.</p>\n\nHeadphones</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"8ebac6293522b039618285fb48b9a2c73c3e6021a656c0b824e7cb04fa7100a8","category":"Apple"}
