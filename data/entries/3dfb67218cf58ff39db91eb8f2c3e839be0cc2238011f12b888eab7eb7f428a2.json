Whether you’re into the spirit of love or angry about the reminder of recent heartache, Apple Music has you covered with two new radio stations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://music.apple.com/us/station/love/ra.q-MO3UCQ&amp;xcust=1-1-2236280-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Love</a> is a station features songs about romantic love, falling in love, feeling amorous, and feelings that these experiences bring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://music.apple.com/us/station/heartbreak/ra.q-MNDEBw&amp;xcust=1-1-2236280-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Heartbreak</a> is full of songs about heartbreak, unrequited love, breaking up, or sad love. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To find these two new stations, open Apple Music, select the Listen Now tab (renamed the Home tab in iOS 17.4) and scroll down to the Stations for You section. Apple Music radio stations are algorithmically generated using your listening history to include songs you like and others that you might like. They’re infinite and ever-changing, unlike like the “Made for You” playlists that feature 25 songs each and are refreshed weekly.</p>\n\nStreaming Media</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"3dfb67218cf58ff39db91eb8f2c3e839be0cc2238011f12b888eab7eb7f428a2","category":"Apple"}
