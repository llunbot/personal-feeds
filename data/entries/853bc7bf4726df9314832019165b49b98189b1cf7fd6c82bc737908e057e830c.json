In exchange for connecting you to a few streaming services you use, a TV will <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/walmart-buying-tv-brand-vizio-for-its-ad-fueling-customer-data/\">collect data</a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/after-luring-customers-with-low-prices-amazon-stuffs-fire-tvs-with-ads/\">show ads</a>, and serve as another <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/04/roku-forcing-2-factor-authentication-after-breach-of-600k-accounts/\">vector</a> for <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/04/patches-released-for-as-many-as-91000-hackable-lg-tvs-exposed-to-the-internet/\">bad actors</a>. In a few reported cases, though, a modern connected TV has been blamed for attacks not on privacy, eyeballs, or passwords but on an entirely different computer.</p>\n<p>The TV in question is a Hisense TV, and the computer is a Windows PC, specifically one belonging to Priscilla Snow, a <a href=\"https://ghoulnoise.bandcamp.com/\">musician</a> and audio designer in Montr√©al, Quebec. Her <a href=\"https://cohost.org/ghoulnoise/post/5286766-do-not-buy-hisense-t\">post about her Hisense experience</a> reads like a mystery. Of course, because you already know the crime and the culprit, it's more like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbo\">a <em>Columbo</em> episode</a>. Either way, it's thrilling in a very specific I-can't-believe-that-fixed-it kind of thrill.</p>\n<h2>Disappearing Settings, keyboards, remote desktops, and eventually taskbars</h2>\n<p>Snow's Windows PC had \"a few hiccups over the past couple of years,\" Snow wrote on April 19. She couldn't open display settings, for one. A MIDI keyboard interface stopped working. Task manager would start to hang until force-closed. Video capture cards had trouble connecting. As Snow notes, any veteran of a Windows computer that has had lots of stuff installed on it can mentally write off most of these things, or at least stash them away until the next reinstall.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019333#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019333&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"853bc7bf4726df9314832019165b49b98189b1cf7fd6c82bc737908e057e830c","category":"Tech"}
