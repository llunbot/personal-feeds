There are more than 75 games available, including Angry Birds Showdown and Cut the Rope.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYouTube is focusing on \"lightweight, entertaining games,\" so many of the options are games that are meant to be played for a short period of time rather than longer games that you might find on the ‌App Store‌. Game progress is saved, and YouTube keeps track of all-time best scores.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPlayables have been available for a small number of users in select markets as YouTube has tested the feature, but as of today, the games are rolling out to everyone and are more widely available. Playables can be accessed in the iOS app by going to the Explore menu and choosing the Playables section.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNetflix has offered a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/14/netflix-games-tvs-macs-pcs/\">selection of in-app games</a> since 2021, and has started testing games on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> as well. Other companies like The New York Times also offer dedicated games.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/youtube/\">YouTube</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/28/youtube-playables/\">YouTube Launches 'Playables' Mobile Games for iOS</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/youtube-launches-playables-mobile-games-for-ios.2427617/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"971cbefe76a1f6aa520368b3d5242aecaf2448cf5714546ca5281b6a8e0acf1e","category":"Apple"}
