Ten years on, Google Photos remains one of Google's most popular products, and it's getting a couple of new features to celebrate its 10th year in operation. You'll be able to share albums a bit more easily, and editing tools are getting a boost with, you guessed it, AI.</p>\n<p>Google Photos made a splash in 2015 when it <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/05/google-photos-leaves-google-launches-as-a-standalone-service/\">broke free</a> of the spiraling Google+ social network, offering people supposedly unlimited free storage for compressed images. Of course, that was too good to last. In 2021, Google <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/google-photos-wants-money-stricter-storage-limitations-kick-in-next-week/\">began limiting photo uploads</a> to 15GB for free users, sharing the default account level storage with other services like Gmail and Drive. Today, Google encourages everyone to pay for a Google One subscription to get more space, which is a bit of a bummer. Regardless, people still use Google Photos extensively.</p>\n<p>According to the company, Photos has more than 1.5 billion monthly users, and it stores more than 9 trillion photos and videos. When using the Photos app on a phone, you are prompted to automatically upload your camera roll, which makes it easy to keep all your memories backed up (and edge ever closer to the free storage limit). Photos has also long offered almost magical search capabilities, allowing you to search for the content of images to find them. That may seem less impressive now, but it was revolutionary a decade ago. Google says users perform over 370 million searches in Photos each month.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/google-photos-turns-10-celebrates-with-new-ai-infused-photo-editor/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/google-photos-turns-10-celebrates-with-new-ai-infused-photo-editor/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ryan Whitwam","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c0b744fcbe4a3003addde57c83510cc3325acefe1246dd56ed2888eeb6a8378c","category":"Tech"}
