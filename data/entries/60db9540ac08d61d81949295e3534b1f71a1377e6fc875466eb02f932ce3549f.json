You can get this device <a href=\"https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-462641-13142092?url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-tv-4k-4\">in new condition for just <strong>$99.99</strong></a> if you're an Amazon Prime member. <strong>Note that this sale will last for one day only</strong>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/2017-apple-tv.jpg\" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors.

Although this is for the older 2017 model of the Apple TV 4K with the original Siri Remote, it's a great entry level price point for Apple's set-top box. This model was priced at $179 when it was the latest generation.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-462641-13142092?url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-tv-4k-4\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>FLASH SALE</div>32GB Apple TV 4K (2017) for $99.99</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe biggest differences between the 2017 and 2021 Apple TV 4K lie in their internals, with the 2021 model getting an update with Apple's A12 Bionic chip vs the 2017's A10X Fusion chip. Still, the 2017's performance will be enough for most people, making Woot's offer today a great idea for holiday shoppers.
