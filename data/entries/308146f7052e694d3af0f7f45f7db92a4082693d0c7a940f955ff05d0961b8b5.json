Well, let’s take a look at the 2020 Milan–San Remo winner’s setup – and some of the potential advantages that might have led to the decision.</p>\n<h2>What’s van Aert running, and why?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> It’s unusual to see a 1x drivetrain in the pro peloton.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Wout van Aert / Instagram</i></span></div>\n<p>In pictures posted to his Instagram account, Van Aert reveals he will race on a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/cervelo-s5-force-etap-axs-review/\">Cervélo S5</a>, but will forgo his typical 2x setup in favour of a 1x <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/sram-12-speed-red-etap-axs-hrd-review/\">SRAM Red eTap AXS</a> electronic groupset.</p>\n<p>It’s hard to tell from the low-res screengrabs but we predict van Aert is running either a 54-tooth or 56-tooth chainring paired with a 10-33 tooth cassette. He also appears to be using a chain guide.</p>\n<p>That’s a big gear, but Milan–San Remo is a notably fast race with few steep climbs, and, as a result, van Aert may not miss the wider choice of gears presented by a 2x setup.</p>\n<p>In theory, a 1x setup could also be slightly more aerodynamic.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Ditching the relatively bulky SRAM Red AXS front derailleur (pictured here on a bike that’s not Wout van Aert’s) could present a slight aerodynamic advantage.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>SRAM eTap AXS front derailleurs are relatively big and, given the high speeds of the race, there’s a small saving to be made here.</p>\n<p>Running a chain guide diminishes those potential aero advantages slightly, but that comes with advantages of its own.</p>\n<p>Speaking to BikeRadar, Michael Valgren (EF Education–EasyPost) said that, although he crested the Poggio (the race’s critical final climb) in the front group of 10-15 riders in last year’s race, a dropped chain at the top of the descent spelt the end of his day.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, there is no chance of a mistimed front shift with 1x and the ability to run a chain guide boosts chain security.</p>\n<h2>1x groupsets in road racing – a short history</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Aqua Blue Sport experimented with 1x drivetrains back in 2018.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Marc Gasch/Aqua Blue Sport</i></span></div>\n<p>Outside of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/10-steps-to-your-best-ever-time-trial/\">time trials</a>, 1x drivetrains have had <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/1x-drivetrains-in-the-pro-peloton-im-sceptical/\">a chequered history</a> on the road.</p>\n<p>Former Aqua Blue Sport rider turned pundit Adam Blythe pinned the team’s downfall to its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/aqua-blue-sport-take-first-victory-on-3t-strada/\">early adoption of 1x drivetrains</a>.</p>\n<p>Sub-optimal gearing options that significantly disrupted cadence when shifting and limited range were the two most common complaints from riders on the team.</p>\n\n<p>However, 1x drivetrains on road bikes have gone through a very small-scale renaissance in recent years, primarily in races run on flatter parcours.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/lizzie-deignan-paris-roubaix-femmes/\">Lizzie Deignan’s win at the inaugural Paris-Roubaix Femmes</a> in 2022 is the biggest win in recent memory.</p>\n<p>Though not strictly a 1x setup, Victor Campenaerts has been experimenting with single-ring drivetrains paired with a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/classified-parcours-partnership/\">Classified two-speed hub</a>.</p>\n<p>Could a decisive win at Milan–San Remo further interest in 1x drivetrains on the road?</p>\n<p>We have contacted SRAM and Cervélo for further information and will update this story as soon as we know more.</p>","author":"Jack Luke","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"308146f7052e694d3af0f7f45f7db92a4082693d0c7a940f955ff05d0961b8b5","category":"Cycling"}
