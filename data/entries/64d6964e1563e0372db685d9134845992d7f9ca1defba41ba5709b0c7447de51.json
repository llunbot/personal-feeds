Or take off-road for more adventure in the outdoors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Why would you even want a light cargo trailer?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer-made-in-Germany_gravel-bikepacking.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer-made-in-Germany_gravel-bikepacking.jpg\" alt=\"Veolo Bike Trailer, a lightweight modular bicycle cargo trailer, made-in Germany, riding gravel\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer-made-in-Germany_gravel-bikepacking.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer-made-in-Germany_gravel-bikepacking-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer-made-in-Germany_gravel-bikepacking-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer-made-in-Germany_gravel-bikepacking-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer-made-in-Germany_gravel-bikepacking-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer-made-in-Germany_gravel-bikepacking-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The case for Veolo’s lightweight, suspended performance bicycle cargo trailer concept essentially boils down to a couple simple facts. One, a trailer can carry more gear that all the bikepacking bags you could imagine. Or, even a lot more than a full rack &amp; panniers setup. But it puts that weight low where it won’t ruin your bike’s handling. And can be pulled off your bike in seconds when not needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer-made-in-Germany_grocery-shopping.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer-made-in-Germany_grocery-shopping.jpg\" alt=\"Veolo Bike Trailer, a lightweight modular bicycle cargo trailer, grocery shopping\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer-made-in-Germany_grocery-shopping.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer-made-in-Germany_grocery-shopping-297x269.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer-made-in-Germany_grocery-shopping-800x725.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer-made-in-Germany_grocery-shopping-120x109.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer-made-in-Germany_grocery-shopping-768x696.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer-made-in-Germany_grocery-shopping-1536x1392.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And two, it’s probably a lot more practical to add a light trailer to a bike that you already ride, rather than buying a separate expensive  cargo bike that you won’t really fully utilize all that often. How many people are really going to drag out a long cargo bike to get groceries. And you certainly won’t load that heavy cargo bike up to head out for a weekend camping trip.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech Details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer-made-in-Germany_now-on-Kickstarter_angled.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer-made-in-Germany_now-on-Kickstarter_angled.jpg\" alt=\"Veolo Bike Trailer, a lightweight modular bicycle cargo trailer, made-in Germany, angled\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer-made-in-Germany_now-on-Kickstarter_angled.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer-made-in-Germany_now-on-Kickstarter_angled-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer-made-in-Germany_now-on-Kickstarter_angled-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer-made-in-Germany_now-on-Kickstarter_angled-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer-made-in-Germany_now-on-Kickstarter_angled-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer-made-in-Germany_now-on-Kickstarter_angled-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer-made-in-Germany_now-on-Kickstarter_angled-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Veolo’s bicycle cargo trailer features a lightweight aluminum wrap-around frame and a black powder-coated tray to carry your gear. Its two 20″ wheels sit on CNC-machined alloy swingarms with 45mm of independent elastomer-damped suspension at each side.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer-made-in-Germany_dimesnsions.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer-made-in-Germany_dimesnsions.jpg\" alt=\"Veolo Bike Trailer, a lightweight modular bicycle cargo trailer, made-in Germany, now on Kickstarter, dimensions\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer-made-in-Germany_dimesnsions.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer-made-in-Germany_dimesnsions-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer-made-in-Germany_dimesnsions-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer-made-in-Germany_dimesnsions-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer-made-in-Germany_dimesnsions-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer-made-in-Germany_dimesnsions-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The load tray is 48cm wide x 78cm long. And the overall trailer is 76.5cm wide outside, with 18cm of ground clearance, and extends a total of 135cm back from your bikes rear axle. It weighs a claimed 8.5kg in total, and has a load carrying capacity of 80kg.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When you get home, the modular wheels pop off in seconds, so you can stow it against the wall to save space.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer_Thule-style-hitch.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer_Thule-style-hitch.jpg\" alt=\"Veolo Bike Trailer, a lightweight modular bicycle cargo trailer, made-in Germany, Thule trailer hitch\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer_Thule-style-hitch.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer_Thule-style-hitch-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer_Thule-style-hitch-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer_Thule-style-hitch-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer_Thule-style-hitch-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer_Thule-style-hitch-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Veolo Bike Trailer looks to do a good job of innovating where it can make a difference, and leaning on existing tech makes sense. What stands out for me in that tech details is that the standard Veolo trailer attachment uses the same hitch that Chariot child trailers (<em>now part of Thule</em>) has used for decades. It does mean anyone with a thru-axle bike will need a special adapter, but we’ve been happy with one made by Robert Axle Project for many years.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer-made-in-Germany_push-to-release-wheels-with-independant-suspension.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer-made-in-Germany_push-to-release-wheels-with-independant-suspension.jpg\" alt=\"Veolo Bike Trailer, a lightweight modular bicycle cargo trailer, made-in Germany, quick release wheels &amp; independant suspension\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer-made-in-Germany_push-to-release-wheels-with-independant-suspension.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer-made-in-Germany_push-to-release-wheels-with-independant-suspension-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer-made-in-Germany_push-to-release-wheels-with-independant-suspension-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer-made-in-Germany_push-to-release-wheels-with-independant-suspension-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer-made-in-Germany_push-to-release-wheels-with-independant-suspension-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer-made-in-Germany_push-to-release-wheels-with-independant-suspension-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Veolo-Bike-Trailer_lightweight-modular-bicycle-cargo-trailer-made-in-Germany_push-to-release-wheels-with-independant-suspension-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They also seem to use the same proven standard push-button quick release hub/axle interface that’s on tons of trailers &amp; stroller, so it’s fast &amp; secure to install and remove the side wheels. (This time of year, that could also mean an adventurous winter fat bike rider could probably strap on a set of <a href=\"https://www.thule.com/bike-trailers/bike-trailer-accessories/thule-chariot-cross-country-skiing-kit-_-20201401\" target=\"_blank\">Thule XC skis</a>!)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Veolo engineered every element to survive everyday cargo use in the city and off-the beaten track. And on top of that, they guarantee that all spare parts will be available.
