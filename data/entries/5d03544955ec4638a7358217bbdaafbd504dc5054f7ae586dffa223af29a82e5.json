The design of the clones closely matches the redesign that is expected to bring squared-off edges to the Apple Watch, much like those of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> lineup, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, and 24-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough the units in the images are clones and not legitimate Apple devices, they may give the best impression yet of what we can expect the new Apple Watch design to look like in the real world. Majin Bu <a href=\"https://twitter.com/majinbuofficial/status/1431237843939209217?s=21\">explained</a> that these Apple Watch Series 7 clones will sell for around $60 in China.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>They also created the stainless steel version <a href=\"https://t.co/qjTDIFmuty\">pic.twitter.com/qjTDIFmuty</a></p>— Majin Bu  (@MajinBuOfficial) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1431249545191739393?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 27, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe design of the Apple Watch Series 7 has only been seen thus far in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/19/prosser-apple-watch-series-7-design/\">renders that were reportedly based on leaked images</a> and alleged <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/17/apple-watch-series7-cad-larger-display/\">industry-sourced CAD renders</a>, featuring two long speaker grilles along the left side of the device, squared-off edges, and a thinner casing.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough the Apple Watch Series 7 is expected to be 1.7mm thinner than the Series 6, it is worth bearing in mind that this change may not have been carried over to the clones and the smartwatches depicted in these images may look thicker than the authentic devices.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nClones of popular Apple products are commonly made in China, often in the hopes of duping customers into thinking that they are the real thing. The issue is so widespread that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/16/apple-anti-counterfeit-team/\">Apple has a team</a> whose sole focus is to crack down on counterfeit products and prevent them from being sold.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>Apple Watch Series 7<br />Copycat products <a href=\"https://t.co/bXN375XUcI\">pic.twitter.com/bXN375XUcI</a></p>— DuanRui (@duanrui1205) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/duanrui1205/status/1431283843990884353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 27, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nEarlier this year <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/12/airpods-3-redesign-new-images/\">in March</a>, images of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/09/counterfeit-airpods-3/\">third-generation AirPods clones</a> emerged online. Given that these <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a> have yet to launch over half a year later, it goes to show how far in advance counterfeit manufacturing operations in China take place. Nevertheless, the range of images showing third-generation ‌AirPods‌ clones have given the clearest look yet at the expected design of the new wireless earbuds.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Apple Watch Series 7 is expected to be unveiled by Apple as soon as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/20/digitmes-mulitple-apple-events-for-september/\">next month</a>, likely alongside the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a> lineup, offering <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/14/apple-watch-7-thinner-display-borders/\">improved display technology and Ultra Wideband connectivity</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/23/apple-watch-series-7-double-sided-s7-chip/\">faster processor</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/28/apple-watch-series-7-improved-battery-life/\">bigger battery</a>, and more.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 6</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/majin-bu/\">Majin Bu</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/27/apple-watch-series-7-clones-emerge-in-china/\">Apple Watch Series 7 Clones Emerge in China</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-series-7-clones-emerge-in-china.2308897/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=6rftxLt2VB4:BQJ_nX23_Ns:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=6rftxLt2VB4:BQJ_nX23_Ns:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/6rftxLt2VB4\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5d03544955ec4638a7358217bbdaafbd504dc5054f7ae586dffa223af29a82e5","category":"Apple"}
