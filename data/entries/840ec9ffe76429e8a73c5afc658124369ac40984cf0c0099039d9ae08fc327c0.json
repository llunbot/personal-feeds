In the United States, for example, a 14-inch MacBook Pro configured with an M1 Max chip, 64GB of unified memory, and a 512GB SSD is estimated for delivery by January 3.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn-store availability is also scarce at the moment, with many MacBook Pro configurations unavailable for Apple Store pickup around the world.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/macbook-pro-january-delivery.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are likely several factors behind the lengthy shipping delays, including strong demand for the new MacBook Pro models, an industry-wide chip shortage, and pandemic-related manufacturing disruptions. On an earnings call last month, Apple CEO Tim Cook said supply constraints had an estimated <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/28/apple-supply-constraints-6-billion-q4-2021/\">$6 billion impact on Apple's revenue</a> last quarter, and he said he expected the supply constraints to continue through the holiday season.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nKey features of the new MacBook Pro models include Apple's M1 Pro and M1 Max chips, mini-LED displays with ProMotion for up to a 120Hz refresh rate, longer battery life, and the return of ports like an SD card slot, HDMI, and MagSafe. Pricing starts at $1,999 for the 14-inch model and at $2,499 for the 16-inch model in the United States.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">14 &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">14\" &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/09/14-and-16-inch-macbook-pro-backordered-january/\">Some 14-Inch and 16-Inch MacBook Pro Models Backordered Into 2022</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/some-14-inch-and-16-inch-macbook-pro-models-backordered-into-2022.2322561/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=oUJWJRoV9Ns:81ORdLhF8ss:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=oUJWJRoV9Ns:81ORdLhF8ss:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/oUJWJRoV9Ns\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"840ec9ffe76429e8a73c5afc658124369ac40984cf0c0099039d9ae08fc327c0","category":"Apple"}
