Kobo had <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/16/apple-new-eu-antitrust-complaint-kobo/\">argued</a> that Apple's mandatory 30% commission on App Store purchases made it virtually impossible to operate profitably while competing with Apple Books, which isn't subject to the same fee structure.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe probe examined Apple's requirement that developers use its in-app purchase system, and restrictions preventing developers from informing iPhone and iPad users about cheaper purchasing options outside the App Store.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAlthough this particular investigation has concluded, the Commission said that the closure does not indicate Apple's conduct complies with EU competition rules. Apple still faces scrutiny under both EU competition laws and the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which designates Apple as a \"gatekeeper\" and requires changes to its App Store practices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ebook investigation was one of three parallel probes launched by the Commission in 2020.
