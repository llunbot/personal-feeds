In a research note seen by MacRumors, Kuo shared some of his key hardware expectations for next year's tentatively named iPhone 14 Pro models, including a hole-punch display and a 48-megapixel Wide lens for the rear camera system.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/iPhone-14-Hole-Punch-Feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nA hole-punch design refers to a display with only a small circular cutout for the front camera, as seen on many recent Samsung smartphones.
