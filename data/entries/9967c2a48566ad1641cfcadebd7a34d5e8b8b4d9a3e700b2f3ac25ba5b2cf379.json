The drug has been used for decades, racking up a remarkably good safety record in that time. It is currently used in the majority of abortions in the US.</p>\n<p>The high court found that the anti-abortion medical groups that legally challenged the FDA's decision to approve the drug in 2000 and then ease usage restrictions in 2016 and 2021 simply <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/03/abortion-pill-case-scotus-skeptical-of-anti-abortion-groups-legal-standing/\">lacked standing</a> to challenge any of those decisions.
