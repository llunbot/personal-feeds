However, there are plenty of deals already in stores and online, so keep your eyes peeled before the best bargains start to go out of stock!</p>\n<h2>How to get a good deal on Black Friday 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>A little research goes a long way. Read a few online reviews before you commit to buy. There may be a reason for that 40 per cent discount.</li>\n<li>Have you actually thought about what you want to buy? We recommend you put together a wishlist in advance so you don’t come to regret a rash decision.</li>\n<li>Take price drops with a pinch of salt: they can often be hugely exaggerated, since they’re listed against an RRP that might be years old. Helpfully, we track deal prices and do our best to let you know about a product’s price history so you know you’re definitely getting the best deal.</li>\n<li>Don’t let the stress get to you. If you see a deal that’s marked as ‘nearly out of stock’, add it to your shopping basket straight away. Then take a look at the prices other retailers are advertising. You normally get at least a couple of minutes before the item leaves your basket.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Why Black Friday?</h2>\n<p>Black Friday was originally a US-based tradition. Black Friday is the day after America’s Thanksgiving holiday. Previously, the Friday was spent recuperating from the turkey and pumpkin pie, but sensing an opportunity, retailers began to offer post-Thanksgiving sales to tempt people off their couches and into the stores.</p>\n<p>Black Friday really took off when the internet offered people the chance to stay sat on their couches and still go shopping. It has turned into an online sales frenzy, with online retailers often offering their best – or close to best – prices over the Thanksgiving holiday period.</p>\n<p>It’s become such an internet event that the Monday after the holiday has been anointed Cyber Monday and offers yet more opportunities to buy at a discount.
