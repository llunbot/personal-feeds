There’ll always be some disagreement over the definition of ‘cheap’, but with the advent of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/what-is-the-cycle-to-work-scheme\" target=\"_blank\">Cycle to Work Scheme</a> and other similar purchase offers, most really serious road bikes kick off at around £1,000.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We took a quick straw poll in the office and when most of us took our first proper steps towards becoming cyclists, we each spent around £500 on our first bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some researched their purchase for months, others went straight out to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/in-praise-of-local-bike-shops\" target=\"_blank\">their local bike shop</a> and asked the staff for their advice. But time and time again the ballpark figure was somewhere between £500 and £1,000.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s here that road bikes begin to look like serious racers: the gear shifters are combined with the brake levers so your hands can stay in one comfy position and the frames are made of lighter materials such as butted <a href=\"https://auth.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/4599/best-aluminium-road-bikes\" target=\"_blank\">aluminium</a> or perhaps even carbon fibre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can pick up bikes for less than £500 but often they’re heavy, inefficient and will grumble if you really up the mileage. They might be fine for fair-weather weekend riding, but start <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-create-a-cycling-training-plan\" target=\"_blank\">training</a> for a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/our-top-choice-cycling-challenges-you-should-try-in-2020\" target=\"_blank\">sportive</a> and their shortcomings will soon show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that in mind, here’s a rundown of what we consider to be the best road bikes under £1,000. There’s been significant bike price inflation in the last few years and some bikes which used to cost comfortably under £1,000 now cost uncomfortably over £1,000. We’ve included a couple of bikes that now exceed £1,000 at full price. You might be prepared to pay that, or you may just be able to find the bike you’re interested in at a discount.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus further down you can find a buying guide to help you with sizing, the right questions to ask when deciding what you need, what accessories to buy, and how to go about planning your first big ride.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-road-bike-upgrades\">Best road bike upgrades for every budget</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-single-speed-bikes\">Best single-speed bikes 2023: Fixed gear and single-speed bikes from £250</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-is-a-road-bike\">What is a road bike?

Spending top money sees the bike’s compact 6061-T6 heat-treated aluminium frame and carbon fibre fork hung with a Shimano Sora groupset – an inclusion usually reserved for much pricier bikes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The crankset might not be Shimano but is decent nonetheless. The brakes are acceptable, and the Schwalbe Lugano tyres are reputable enough. With space for mudguards and a rear rack, it’s a great introduction to drop-bar riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://www.evanscycles.com/brand/pinnacle/laterite-3-2021-road-bike-934352#colcode=93435240\" target=\"_blank\">Evans Cycles (£655)</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>2.

At the same time, its geometry is quite nippy for a more budget road bike, meaning that you’ll still get proper racing bike performance out of the Contend if you push it. Adding to its ride comfort, Giant has also employed a D-Fuse seatpost for a gentler ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time as being nicely racy, the Contend is also versatile. This means there’s still space for wide 32mm tyres and attachments for mudguards and racks, making it an able commuter or touring bike as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Buy from <a href=\"https://www.giant-bicycles.com/gb/contend-2\" target=\"_blank\">Giant (£879</a></strong><a href=\"https://www.giant-bicycles.com/gb/contend-2\" target=\"_blank\">)</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>3.

With a short top tube and upright front end, its frame and carbon fork are designed for endurance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it’s the superlative 11-speed Shimano 105 R7000 groupset and hybrid mechanical/hydraulic brake callipers that really set it apart. Backed up by lightweight wheels with cartridge bearings and tubeless-ready tyres, it’s also ripe for future upgrading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s an even cheaper model and a gravel-spec edition also in the range, and both are equally good value.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Read our first ride of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/decathlon-btwin-triban-rc500-and-rc520-review\" target=\"_blank\">Triban RC 520</a></strong></li><li><strong><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://www.decathlon.co.uk/p/rc520-disc-road-bike-105/_/R-p-308072?mc=8554421&amp;c=BLUE\" target=\"_blank\">Decathlon (£850)</a></strong></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>4.

Aimed at riders after comfort over long distances, the AL 2 Disc provides this via a relaxed geometry and 32mm tyres.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With both frame and fork including robust bolt-through axles, this is a bike unafraid of being pointed at rough surfaces. In fact, depending on how you define the term, it’ll even cope with light off-road work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With handling that’s less skittish than more aggressive designs, the Domane is a versatile machine that can take mudguards and racks for touring or commuting, yet is equally happy to tackle a speedy weekend century ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fitted out with a full Shimano 2x 8-speed Claris groupset, in both looks and operation it could easily be mistaken for a more expensive bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://www.evanscycles.com/brand/trek/domane-al-2-disc-road-bike-934049\" target=\"_blank\">Evans Cycles (£779)</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>5.

Gearing may be limited to a 2x 8-speed setup, but the wide 11-32 cassette range should provide confidence when heading into the hills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This older model Allez with rim brakes is still available, and often with a discount, but the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/specialized-allez-2023\">latest model Allez</a>, introduced in 2023, has disc brakes and much wider tyre clearance of 35mm, plus a price increase.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://www.evanscycles.com/specialized-allez-e5-road-bike-933507?#colcode=93350711\" target=\"_blank\">Evans Cycles (£899)</a></strong></li><li><strong>Read our reviews of the (rim brake) <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-allez-sport-review\" target=\"_blank\">Specialized Allez Sport</a>, the next tier up in the Allez range and the newer disc brake <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-allez-review\" target=\"_blank\">Specialized Allez Sport</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>6. Ribble Endurance AL Disc Tiagra: The best for customisation</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/07/02113909/ribble_endurance_al_alt-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"ribble_endurance_al_alt\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Price: £999</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>At the heart of the Ribble Endurance’s appeal is a frame that’s designed for comfort over the long haul. This is then fitted with a customisable assortment of components – none of which look remotely like a weak link.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Available at different price points dependent on the groupset, we think this Shimano Tiagra-equipped model hits the sweet spot. Giving you a 2x 10-speed drivetrain to play with, the ratios provided can be chosen at checkout, perfect for tailoring it to your nearby terrain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fixed in place via stiff bolt-through axles, the Ribble’s Mavic Aksium Disc wheels are tough and infinitely serviceable. With Tektro MD510 mechanical disc brakes taking care of the stopping, a sub-10kg weight is respectable for such a bulletproof build.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using what was formerly Ribble’s audax geometry, the Endurance is happy to take a rack or panniers, making it good for light touring or winter use.

A word of warning, though: be careful when referring to bikes by their frame sizes. Some manufacturers measure things differently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main two things to worry about are saddle height and reach. There are lots of different methods to work out your <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-change-your-saddle-height\">correct saddle height</a>, but as a general rule, when your foot is at its lowest point your knee should have a 30-degree bend, as that’s the angle that gets your big glute muscles firing.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/07/02113926/bike_fitting_04-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"bike_fitting_04\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The reach is something that you need to get a feel for, but if you’ve never ridden a road bike with dropped bars before, the appropriate reach can actually feel quite stretched at first and will take some getting used to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s almost always the case that when your saddle is the correct height, you won’t be able to remain sat on it and have both feet flat on the floor, since in reality you never really have to do this while cycling. If you’re nervous about it, plan ahead for your stops so you can pull up at a kerb and rest your foot on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Choosing your pedals</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/07/02113928/ritchey_wcs_carbon_echelon_clipless_pedal-970x545.jpeg\" alt=\"ritchey_wcs_carbon_echelon_clipless_pedal\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of new bikes don’t come with pedals, so your first big decision is whether to go for flat pedals or clipless road bike pedals. Flat pedals may be more versatile (because you can use them wearing regular shoes), but they’re inefficient. Trainers flex a lot at the sole, so you lose a lot of pedalling power wearing them – it’s like trying to knock in a nail with a rubber hammer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clipless pedals (so called because they replaced traditional toeclips and straps) work by binding to a cleat that’s screwed onto the sole of the shoe. The shoes that go with clipless pedals have far stiffer soles to make pedalling more efficient and a lot more comfortable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two distinct patterns of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-to-the-best-clipless-road-bike-pedals\">clipless pedal</a> – two-bolt (Shimano SPD) and three-bolt (including Shimano SPD-SL and Look) pedals.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/07/02113929/ritchey_offroad_clipless_pedals.jpeg\" alt=\"ritchey_offroad_clipless_pedals\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Two-bolt cleats are usually recessed into the sole of the shoe to make walking easier – these are favoured by mountain bikers, gravel riders and commuters, since there is typically more walking involved. Walking is possible in three-bolt cleats, but you may look like a penguin. Also check that your shoes are compatible with your pedals – the shop will be able help with this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a little perseverance, once you’ve got the hang of clipless pedals, you’ll be able to release your foot far quicker than you could pull your shoes out of old-fashioned toeclips.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ask the right questions</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/07/02113930/local_bike_shop_2-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"local_bike_shop_2\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you go and take a look at what your local bike shop has to offer, it pays to do your research and have a good think about what you want from your purchase. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-best-bicycle-mudguards\">Mudguards</a> and a rack? Rim or disc brakes?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is the bike going to be used mainly for commuting or leisure riding? There are so many different models to choose from, that if you don’t have a good idea of what you need from it, you’ll likely end up totally bewildered. It also helps the shop, as they’ll then know what they can safely recommend, rather than relying purely on guesswork.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/07/02113933/tour_de_france_mechanic_08-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"tour_de_france_mechanic_08\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Most shops will include a servicing package to help keep your bike in good shape and will probably offer a discount on accessories. If you’d like to swap some parts on the bike straight out the box, ask – but don’t count on the shop doing it free of charge. If it’s an own-brand stem, they might not have one in stock, but things like cassettes or tyres are normally done for the cost difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sale bikes can be great, but don’t compromise on getting the correct size for a groupset upgrade. You’ll be much happier – and faster – on a bike that’s comfortable. Buying a second-hand bikes can net you a bargain but equally can be a minefield: unless you know the pitfalls to avoid, we’d recommend steering clear.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Essential extras</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/07/02113935/in_praise_of_fixing_punctures_2-970x692.jpg\" alt=\"in_praise_of_fixing_punctures_2\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>When buying a new bike you’ll have to reserve a portion of your budget for essential kit. Luckily, most shops will cut you a deal if you buy these at the same time. Expect to spend a minimum of £50 for a decent <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-bike-helmet\">helmet</a>, and try several makes and models to find the best fit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you’re planning to ride on your own or with friends, you’ll need enough small tools to be self-sufficient. You will get a puncture at some point, so practise <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-change-bike-tyre-inner-tube-without-levers\">changing an inner tube</a> at home until you’re confident you’ll be able to do it on the road when all your friends are watching (and heckling).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/07/02113937/pocket-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"pocket\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The minimum kit we’d recommend would include a set of tyre levers (Topeak Shuttle levers, £5.99, <a href=\"http://www.extrauk.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">extrauk.co.uk</a>), two spare inner tubes (around £5 each; ensure you get the correct type – road bikes use Presta valves), a pack of glueless patches (Park Tool Super Patch, £3.49, <a href=\"http://www.madison.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">madison.co.uk</a>), and last but not least, a mini pump (Lezyne Gauge Drive HP, £40, <a href=\"http://www.upgradebikes.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">upgradebikes.co.uk</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some big brands such as <a href=\"http://www.bontrager.com\" target=\"_blank\">Bontrager</a> and <a href=\"http://www.specialized.com\" target=\"_blank\">Specialized</a> produce kits that includes all these items, and a saddlebag to stow them in. Buy yourself a multitool – look for something that includes 3, 4 5 and 6mm allen keys (Topeak Mini 20 Pro, £29, <a href=\"http://www.extrauk.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">extrauk.co.uk</a>). Make sure you’ve got the correct size allen key to remove your wheels, usually 6mm, if you have a disc brake bike with thru-axles without levers. We’d also recommend getting a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-bottle-cage\">bottle cage</a> and bottle, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Plan your first ride</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/07/02113940/garmin_edge_1030_plus_bike_computer-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"garmin_edge_1030_plus_bike_computer\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you’ve got the bike all and your kit together, you’ll be keen to get riding, but it pays to spend some time planning your first outing to avoid potential problems that may arise. We’d say 20 miles is a good distance to start with – you don’t want to risk running out of food, water and energy, or discovering a fault in your bike when you’re a long way from home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don’t know the best roads for cycling in your area, the <a href=\"http://www.strava.com\" target=\"_blank\">Strava website</a> is useful – it has a great ride-planning tool that makes route suggestions based on their popularity with other cyclists. Although you’ll need a paid subscription to access this, you can try free for a month. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can then use the Strava app on your smartphone to navigate, while recording your journey. We’d also recommend <a href=\"http://www.komoot.com\" target=\"_blank\">Komoot</a> for its route-planning tools and ride recommendations from other cyclists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During your first ride, pay particular attention to how the bike feels. Is the saddle a little low? Get your <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-the-best-cycling-multitools\">multitool</a> out and shift it up a little. Short test rides are good for working out any small adjustments like this you may need to make.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Need some help with the basics?
