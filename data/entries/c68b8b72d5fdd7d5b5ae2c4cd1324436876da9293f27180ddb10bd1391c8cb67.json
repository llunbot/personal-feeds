{"title":"5 of our favorite Black Friday Apple deals you may have overlooked","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2154358/black-friday-favorite-apple-deals-overlooked.html","date":1700926123000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>In case you haven’t noticed, it’s Black Friday weekend and just about every product Apple makes is on sale somewhere. If you’re looking for an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1374180/best-ipad-black-friday-deals-november-2023.html\">iPad</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1373543/best-macbook-black-friday-deals-november-2023.html\">MacBook</a>, you’re likely to find it at or near an all-time low price, but if you don’t have a specific product in mind, it can be more difficult to find a deal you just can’t pass up. We’re tracking every deal, of course, and these are three of our favorites that you might have missed.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<h2>AirTag 4-pack: $80 ($20 off)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>AirTags are an often overlooked product in Apple’s catalog, but those who use them will tell you they’re an indispensable accessory for your luggage, wallet, bag, or anything else that isn’t made by Apple. Small, elegant, and simple to use, AirTags will track whatever you want in the Find My app and help you easily locate it when lost. This deal knocks $20 off the 4-pack price and brings the cost down to just $20 each, a savings of $9 off the AirTag MSRP. And if you want a keychain holder, this <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Carabiner-Protective-Scratch-Resistance-Accessory/dp/B09MQ72DT6/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">one from Belkin is under $12</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MX542AM-A-AirTag-Pack/dp/B0932QJ2JZ/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">AirTags 4-pack</a></p></div></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<h2>10th gen iPad: $349 ($100 off)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll admit that we don’t love the 10th-gen iPad at its $449 list price. It’s a great device with a 10.9-inch Retina display, an iPad Air-inspired design, and the only of Apple’s tablets with a landscape camera, but it’s a little too expensive to recommend it over either the iPad mini or 9th-gen iPad. But at $100 off, it’s a fantastic tablet at a fantastic price. And if 64GB is too little, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2022-10-9-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi/dp/B0BJLBNNRT/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">the 256GB model is $100 off too</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2154358/black-friday-favorite-apple-deals-overlooked.html\" target=\"_blank\">10th-gen iPad</a></p></div></div>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.techadvisor.com/cmsdata/reviews/3818235/review-ipad-2022.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"iPad 10th generation\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<h2>MagSafe Charger: $29 ($10 off)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone 15 might have USB-C, but the best and easiest way to charge is still MagSafe. You can buy plenty of magnetic chargers from no-name companies that simulate MagSafe, but there’s only one official MagSafe Charger, which Apple sells for $39. But this weekend it’s on sale for $29 after you apply an Amazon checkout coupon, knocking 25 percent off the price and practically making it an impulse buy. </p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MHXH3AM-A-MagSafe-Charger/dp/B08L5NP6NG/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">MagSafe Charger</a></p></div></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<h2>Magic Mouse in black: $89 ($10 off)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s Magic Mouse gets a lot of ridicule, but the fact remains that it’s a pretty great mouse. And it’s absolutely gorgeous in black. Of course, Apple charges more for it ($99 vs $79) but this weekend you can get it at the very rare discount price of $89. And if you don’t like black, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Magic-Mouse-Wireless-Rechargable/dp/B09BRD98T4/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">the white model is on sale for $68 as well</a>.</p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Magic-Mouse-Wireless-Rechargable/dp/B09V4LZS9S/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Magic Mouse in black</a></p></div></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<div><div>\n<h2>15-inch MacBook Air: $1,049 ($250 off)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The 15-inch MacBook Air is easy to overlook with the new 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro but it’s quietly the best value in Apple’s lineup. When it’s $250 off it’s a downright steal. You’re not going to find a better screen, processor, or design for less. If 256GB of storage is enough for you, $1,049 is just ridiculous for what you get: a gorgeous Liquid Retina display with an incredibly thin and light design, a speedy M2 processor,  fast charging with MagSafe, a pair of Thunderbolt ports, and all-day battery life. (And <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2023-MacBook-Laptop-chip/dp/B0CDJRL5RZ?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">the 512GB model with 16GB of RAM is $250 off too</a>.)</p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2023-MacBook-Laptop-chip/dp/B0C75NSLJY/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">15-inch MacBook Air</a></p></div></div>\n</div></div>\n\nApple Inc</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"c68b8b72d5fdd7d5b5ae2c4cd1324436876da9293f27180ddb10bd1391c8cb67","category":"Apple"}
