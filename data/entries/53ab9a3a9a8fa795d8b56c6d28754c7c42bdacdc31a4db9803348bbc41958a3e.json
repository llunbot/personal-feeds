And football. And golf. And Strictly Come Dancing. And charity fundraising. And politics. And his custom Ribble road bike. In fact, in this week’s episode there are few topics not discussed, so screw your earphones in tight and turn up your car stereo, this one’s a rambling good one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interview starts at 4:52</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out <a href=\"https://www.ribblecycles.co.uk/blog/dj-spoonys-dream-machine-turntables-to-tarmac-with-ribble-cycles/\" target=\"_blank\">DJ Spoony’s custom Ribble Ultra SL R here</a>, it’s pretty mad looking.</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Listen to <a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/618e52740da782001471efbe/episodes/102-dj-spoony-on-cycling-music-dave-brailsford-and-sportswas\" target=\"_blank\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 102 now on Acast</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Check out <a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/618e52740da782001471efbe/episodes\" target=\"_blank\">all episodes</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Also available wherever you get your podcasts</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/maurice-burton-podcast\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 101: Maurice Burton, the original British track legend</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/ribble-ultra-sl-r-gold-dj-spoony\">Ribble’s Special Edition Ultra SL R: A solid gold hit for DJ Spoony</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/ribble-ultra-road-launch-all-new-aero-bike-with-unique-bars\">Ribble Ultra Road launch: all-new aero bike with unique bars</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>Did you know <em>Cyclist</em> is also stunning monthly magazine?
