Depending on exactly when mass production begins in the second half of 2026, the devices could launch either later next year, or at some point in 2027.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman believes that Apple is working on a foldable ‌iPad‌ with a 20-inch display that will come out in 2028, while analyst Ross Young has said that he expects a foldable tablet-like device in 2026 or 2027, so it's safe to say there's uncertainty about a launch date. There also appear to be conflicting reports about what kind of device the larger foldable will be.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPu believes the foldable device that Apple is working on will be a MacBook-iPad hybrid with a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/apple-foldable-macos-prediction/\">touch-based screen and support for macOS</a>. Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has also referred to Apple's larger foldable device as a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/23/20-inch-foldable-macbook-crease-free-rumor/\">MacBook</a>, while Ross Young has also written about Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/23/18-8-inch-foldable-macbook-rumor/\">work on a notebook</a> with an 18.8-inch display. <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> said in December that Apple is working on a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/15/iphone-17-air-19-inch-macbook-report/\">19-inch MacBook with a foldable screen</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHowever, Gurman has referred to Apple's large-screened foldable device as an ‌iPad‌, as has research firm Omdia. Whether the large-screened foldable is ultimately an ‌iPad‌ or a Mac will come down to the operating system that Apple is planning to use. If the device runs macOS, it'll be in the Mac family, and if it runs iPadOS, it'll be in the ‌iPad‌ family. Gurman has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/16/ios-19-big-design-changes/\">claimed</a> that some of the design updates that Apple is making in iOS 19 and macOS 16 to unify the operating systems will pave the way for foldable devices and touchscreen Macs, so a hybrid is also a possibility.\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/07/foldable-iphone-expected-2026-rumored-features/\">Foldable iPhone Expected Next Year: All the Rumored Features So Far</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nAll in all, the details of Apple's larger foldable device remain murky. That's in contrast to rumors about Apple's smaller book-style foldable iPhone, which have recently been converging on a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/07/foldable-iphone-expected-2026-rumored-features/\">2026 release</a>.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-ipad/\">Foldable iPad</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-macbook/\">Foldable MacBook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/\">Jeff Pu</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/10/apple-larger-foldable-mass-production-2026/\">Apple's 18.8-Inch Foldable Device to Enter Mass Production in Late 2026</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-18-8-inch-foldable-device-to-enter-mass-production-in-late-2026.2455049/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"aa067a36f7d6b559b402d5f1bc43a03cb9abb7468576fb9f17748d96c9bbca1f","category":"Apple"}
