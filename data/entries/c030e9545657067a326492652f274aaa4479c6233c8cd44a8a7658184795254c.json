That matches the lowest price we've ever tracked.</p>\n<p>While an ebook reader isn't exactly essential for most people, we've <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/05/guidemaster-ars-tests-and-picks-the-best-e-readers-for-every-budget/\" target=\"_blank\">long recommended the Paperwhite</a> as a great option for anyone in that market. It's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/11/kindle-paperwhite-2018-review-the-best-value-kindle-gets-even-better/\" target=\"_blank\">almost three years old</a> at this point—and we wouldn't be surprised if Amazon gave it a refresh in the not-too-distant future—but it still offers a compact and comfortable design, a side-lit, 6-inch, 300-pixels-per-inch display that is crisp and allows you to read in darker settings, and Amazon's typically extensive catalog of ebook and audiobook content. This model also has Bluetooth audio support for listening to audiobooks from Audible, as well as an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Code\" target=\"_blank\">IPX8 waterproof</a> rating, so it's safe to read in the tub or pool.</p>\n<p>You still have to put up with ads on the lock screen and other places unless you pay <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2W77Oa5\" target=\"_blank\">an additional one-time fee</a>, and if you can live with a lower-resolution display, Amazon's base-level Kindle is a solid budget-friendly alternative that's <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3CW8gJ7\" target=\"_blank\">currently on sale for $65</a>. If you'd rather avoid entering Amazon's locked-down platform altogether, Kobo's Clara HD offers similar hardware—minus the waterproofing and Bluetooth support—and is <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305166/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FKobo-Clara-HD-eReader-6-Glare-Free-High-Definition-Carta-E-Ink-Touchscreen-Display-ComfortLight-PRO-Wi-Fi-enabled%2F848940265&amp;subid1=dealmaster081821\" target=\"_blank\">discounted to $100</a>. If you go with one of Amazon's deals, though, note that both Kindle offers include a three-month trial of the Kindle Unlimited service, which provides an on-demand selection of books for one monthly fee.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1787843#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1787843&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Staff","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c030e9545657067a326492652f274aaa4479c6233c8cd44a8a7658184795254c","category":"Tech"}
