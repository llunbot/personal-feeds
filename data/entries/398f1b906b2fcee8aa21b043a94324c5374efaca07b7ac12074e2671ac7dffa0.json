With dimpled aero tech for road Race &amp; gravel Grava and reinforced impact protection for both Grava &amp; MTB Rocks cranksets, QO is already working with top small-batch bike builders and will have aftermarket cranks available within the next couple months. Plus, they tease that cranksets are just the beginning, with plenty more components being prepared in the wings…</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Where did QO come from, and where are the QOing?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QO-brand-debut-with-carbon-bicycle-cranksets_Grava-gravel-cranks-at-Velofollies.webp\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QO-brand-debut-with-carbon-bicycle-cranksets_Grava-gravel-cranks-at-Velofollies.webp\" alt=\"QO brand debut with carbon bicycle cranksets at Velofollies\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QO-brand-debut-with-carbon-bicycle-cranksets_Grava-gravel-cranks-at-Velofollies.webp 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QO-brand-debut-with-carbon-bicycle-cranksets_Grava-gravel-cranks-at-Velofollies-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QO-brand-debut-with-carbon-bicycle-cranksets_Grava-gravel-cranks-at-Velofollies-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QO-brand-debut-with-carbon-bicycle-cranksets_Grava-gravel-cranks-at-Velofollies-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QO-brand-debut-with-carbon-bicycle-cranksets_Grava-gravel-cranks-at-Velofollies-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/QO)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, pun intended, if you can call it that?  QO meant the name as a synonym of GO, hence mention of the brand “QOing forward” in this introductory PR campaign, and over the weekend at Velofollies. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But while the name is new, the people behind the new brand are quite familiar. Qo founders Pablo Carrasco and Ignacio Estellés just happen to have also been founders of Rotor all the way back in 1996. That’s where the two pioneered tech like <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/act-fast-rotor-is-giving-away-oval-q-rings-to-celebrate-25-years-of-drivetrain-innovation/\" target=\"_blank\">oval chainrings</a>, single &amp; dual-sided <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?s=rotorbike+power\" target=\"_blank\">powermeter</a> cranks, modular cranksets, even the very cool (if not commercially successful) <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/rotor-uno-hydraulic-shifting-development-story-hands-tech-overview-actual-weights/\" target=\"_blank\">Uno</a> hydraulic shifting, and the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/eb18-rotor-1x13-ratchets-up-drivetrain-wars-with-13-speed-hydraulic-1x-road-gravel-mtb-derailleur/\" target=\"_blank\">1st production 13-speed groupset</a> for road, gravel &amp; mountain bikes. Plenty of interesting drivetrain tech that saw the spotlight under multiple Grand Tour and World Championship-winning cyclists in multiple disciplines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carrasco left his role as head of Rotor R&amp;D a few years ago, when the two started a utilitarian <a href=\"https://mooevo.com/\" target=\"_blank\">e-mobility company</a> together. But they still carried on with Rotor as well until relatively recently. Now the two are back together with an all-new brand, leveraging much of their design, engineering &amp; manufacturing knowledge to create an all-new premium component company.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Qo carbon crankset development</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QO-brand-debut-with-carbon-bicycle-cranksets_sample.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QO-brand-debut-with-carbon-bicycle-cranksets_sample.webp\" alt=\"QO brand debut with carbon bicycle cranksets, road bike Race cranks\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QO-brand-debut-with-carbon-bicycle-cranksets_sample.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QO-brand-debut-with-carbon-bicycle-cranksets_sample-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QO-brand-debut-with-carbon-bicycle-cranksets_sample-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QO-brand-debut-with-carbon-bicycle-cranksets_sample-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QO-brand-debut-with-carbon-bicycle-cranksets_sample-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QO-brand-debut-with-carbon-bicycle-cranksets_sample-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QO-brand-debut-with-carbon-bicycle-cranksets_sample-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The first product range to come out of Qo is a series of carbon cranksets.

But the three carbon cranksets – Race, Grava &amp; Rocks – are real products set to debut in a limited release already starting in March 2025. This first round is said to be available through traditional distributors in Europe, starting with their home in Spain and BeNeLux, France, Germany, Ireland, Switzerland &amp; the UK, plus China, Japan, Korea &amp; Thailand. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QO-brand-debut-with-carbon-bicycle-cranksets_Grava-gravel-bike-cranks.webp\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QO-brand-debut-with-carbon-bicycle-cranksets_Grava-gravel-bike-cranks.webp\" alt=\"QO brand debut with carbon bicycle cranksets, Grava\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QO-brand-debut-with-carbon-bicycle-cranksets_Grava-gravel-bike-cranks.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QO-brand-debut-with-carbon-bicycle-cranksets_Grava-gravel-bike-cranks-297x165.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QO-brand-debut-with-carbon-bicycle-cranksets_Grava-gravel-bike-cranks-1536x853.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QO-brand-debut-with-carbon-bicycle-cranksets_Grava-gravel-bike-cranks-120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QO-brand-debut-with-carbon-bicycle-cranksets_Grava-gravel-bike-cranks-768x427.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>QO Grava gravel crankset</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Qo also named several early OEM partners who will spec their cranks (and future components) on small-batch &amp; custom bike builds. <em>We’re waiting for a list of partner bikebuilder brands, and will update here when we know more. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QO-brand-debut-with-carbon-bicycle-cranksets_Rocks-mountain-bike-cranks.webp\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QO-brand-debut-with-carbon-bicycle-cranksets_Rocks-mountain-bike-cranks.webp\" alt=\"QO brand debut with carbon bicycle cranksets, Rock MTB\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QO-brand-debut-with-carbon-bicycle-cranksets_Rocks-mountain-bike-cranks.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QO-brand-debut-with-carbon-bicycle-cranksets_Rocks-mountain-bike-cranks-297x165.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QO-brand-debut-with-carbon-bicycle-cranksets_Rocks-mountain-bike-cranks-1536x853.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QO-brand-debut-with-carbon-bicycle-cranksets_Rocks-mountain-bike-cranks-120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QO-brand-debut-with-carbon-bicycle-cranksets_Rocks-mountain-bike-cranks-768x427.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>QO Rocks MTB crankset</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Not announced more broadly though, we have a good idea of expected pricing. Crankarm sets alone will sell for 550-570€. A complete road Race crankset with chainrings for 750€, complete gravel Grava crankset with 1x ring for 700€, and complete MTB Rocks crankset with a chainring for 650€. Qo also offers direct mount chainrings &amp; the spider separately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check in with Qo directly in the coming months to then find your local distributor if you are one of those first countries to get access to the new cranksets. And we’ll keep you updated as Qo expands into more markets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://qobike.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>QObike.com</em></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/qo-carbon-cranks-launch-new-road-gravel-mtb-components-from-founders-of-rotor/\">QO Carbon Cranks Launch New Road, Gravel &amp; MTB Components from Founders of Rotor</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"398f1b906b2fcee8aa21b043a94324c5374efaca07b7ac12074e2671ac7dffa0","category":"Cycling"}
