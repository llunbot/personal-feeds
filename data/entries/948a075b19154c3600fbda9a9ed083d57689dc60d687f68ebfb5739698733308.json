However, the leaker did not provide any specific details about this alleged upgrade.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple already advertises the AirPods Pro 2 as featuring \"up to twice as much\" active noise cancellation compared to the original AirPods Pro, so the AirPods Pro 3 would be even more improved in this regard.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to announce both low-end and mid-tier AirPods 4 models during its September 9 special event. Kosutami claimed that the AirPods Pro 3 are also <a href=\"https://x.com/Kosutami_Ito/status/1828351173784674478\">coming \"soon,\"</a> but it is unclear if this information is accurate, as <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman has <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-25/apple-airpods-plans-4th-generation-low-end-3rd-generation-pro-and-usb-c-max\">previously reported</a> that Apple planned to release redesigned AirPods Pro in 2025.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBoth the low-end and mid-tier AirPods 4 are rumored to feature a revised design with better fit in the ear, improved sound quality, and an updated charging case with a USB-C port. The mid-tier AirPods 4 are also said to feature active noise cancellation, and a speaker in the charging case that can play a sound for Find My location tracking.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAirPods Max are also rumored to be updated later this year, but the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/29/gurman-usb-c-airpods-max-late-2024/\">only change expected is a USB-C charging port</a> instead of Lightning.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKosutami is known as a prototype Apple product collector, but he has occasionally shared accurate information about Apple's future plans, including <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/exclusive-first-look-finewoven-apple-watch-band/\">details about FineWoven accessories</a> before they launched last year. Kosutami also revealed that iPhone 16 Pro batteries <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/20/iphone-16-pro-leak-reveals-redesigned-battery/\">will have a metal enclosure</a>, and this change was later corroborated by other sources.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/kosutami/\">Kosutami</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro\">AirPods Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/27/airpods-pro-3-much-better-anc-rumor/\">AirPods Pro 3 Rumored to Feature 'Much Better' Active Noise Cancellation</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airpods-pro-3-rumored-to-feature-much-better-active-noise-cancellation.2434494/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"948a075b19154c3600fbda9a9ed083d57689dc60d687f68ebfb5739698733308","category":"Apple"}
