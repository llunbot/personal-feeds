The brand's roots in motorsport date back to the early 1970s with their rally efforts, and recently the company has been keen to recapture some of that racing spirit.</p>\n<p>The first evidence came by way of its joint partnership with Subaru to develop the Scion FR-S (later known as the Toyota 86, and now, in its second generation, the GR86) as well as its more recent collaboration with BMW to produce the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/03/the-2021-toyota-supra-we-didnt-think-they-made-them-like-this-anymore/\">Supra</a> and its Bavarian counterpart, the Z4. Now, after building the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/06/an-emerald-tinted-drive-in-the-2022-toyota-gr-yaris/\">sensational GR Yaris</a> the gearheads at Toyota's performance-focused Gazoo Racing division have turned their attention to the Corolla, and the result is something that's a far cry from <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/01/the-2020-toyota-corolla-hybrid-isnt-exciting-but-it-is-quite-frugal/\">the staid machine</a> that we've come to associate with the name.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/071A7829-scaled.jpg\"><img alt=\"The slightly larger Corolla is much better suited to our roads than the Yaris would be.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/071A7829-980x653.jpg\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/071A7829-scaled.jpg\">The slightly larger Corolla is much better suited to our roads than the Yaris would be.</a> (credit: Bradley Iger)</p></div>\n<p>Lowered, widened, boosted, and packing a sophisticated all-wheel drive system to go along with a raft of other performance features, the GR Corolla is a nod to Toyota's glory days in the World Rally Championship, and it takes square aim at hot hatches like the Honda Civic Type R and Volkswagen Golf R. To celebrate its introduction, Toyota also introduced two special-edition models: The Circuit Edition—which includes performance hardware that's optional on the Core base model as well as a forged carbon roof, heat extractors on the hood, and some aesthetic upgrades—and this, the Morizo Edition.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1926969#p3\">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1926969&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Staff","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"30a3b50daf161e79bfeddee13e22fdbcfb69d1abe7fd30d3dbb9844f5dd94d2b","category":"Tech"}
