They also used these annoying T25 bolts that stripped VERY easily to install the proprietary Paul chainrings (you could also update the Paul cranks to modern times using the <a href=\"https://www.btchnbikes.com/components/paulcrankadapter\" target=\"_blank\">BTCHN Bikes adaptor</a>). They also didn’t have extracting caps, so you had to use crank pullers to take them off.</p>\n<p>Paul updated some finickiness with the modern Pure Cranks by switching to J.I.S. taper and SRAM 3-bolt, arguably the most prolific 1x chainring design on the market. These new Pure Cranks also have self-extracting caps, making taking them on and off a cinch and you’ll need those caps as you dial in your spindle length.</p>\n<p>Instead of offering a “road/track” and a “MTB” crank like the first version of the Pure Cranks, there is only one crank arm design in this new release.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Paul-Pure-Cranks-JIS-Review-03.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Paul-Pure-Cranks-JIS-Review-03.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Paul-Pure-Cranks-JIS-Review-03.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Paul-Pure-Cranks-JIS-Review-03.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Why?</h3>\n<p>Why not a 28 or 30 mm spindle? Why square taper? Why no 2x compatibility? Why? Why? WHY?</p>\n<p>Because they’re in a cult!</p>\n<p>Jokes aside, the team at Paul are nerds, just like us, and while they love modern bikes, they still make rim brake calipers and yes, square taper cranks. While they love disc brakes, they only make cable-actuated disc brakes. And while they love their cranks, they kinda don’t see a need to complicate things. Not saying they won’t make 30 mm DUB cranks in the future, but for now, they’re cool with square taper.</p>\n<p>I’ve been riding these cranks for a few months on a rigid MTB and I’m not dialing back my riding on this bike. I’m 190 lbs and like to take dumb lines and send every booter on the trail, suspension or not. So far, I haven’t had any issues with the square taper design. In fact, I think it has a lot of merits on a “modern” bike.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Paul-Pure-Cranks-Review-4.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Paul-Pure-Cranks-Review-4.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Paul-Pure-Cranks-Review-4.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Paul-Pure-Cranks-Review-4.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Q-Factor Tuning</h3>\n<p>Square tapers are amazing for tuning your desired Q-factor. If you like a narrow QF, you can slam the cranks against the cups and go with whatever offset chainring you need for chainline health. On a 73 mm bottom bracket shell, you can start with a 108 mm spindle and go from there. On a 68 mm bottom bracket shell, you can start with a 103 mm spindle for a 1x setup.</p>\n<p><strong>Getting your chain line right with these cranks will take some time, and I highly suggest enlisting your local bike shop for this procedure. Definitely read the instructions Paul has on its site, too. </strong></p>\n<p>I used a 108 mm Phil Wood spindle I bought off the <a href=\"https://radbazaar.theradavist.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Rad Bazaar</a> for the final setup of my Pure Cranks.
