When the migration takes place, the Apple Account that's signed in for use with ‌iCloud‌ will be the primary Apple Account, and the Apple Account signed in for Media and Purchases will be the secondary Apple Account.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo go through the process, you'll need to sign in with two different accounts on an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, one for ‌iCloud‌ and one for purchases. There are several steps to go through, such as making sure that both accounts are set to the same country, and ensuring the secondary account does not have a remaining balance.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf you're interested in merging accounts, you should <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/117294\">go through the checklist</a> that Apple has outlined, and <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/117267\">read through Apple's info</a> on what happens during an account migration and how to undo it. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe actual merging process can be done by opening up the Settings app, going to Media and Purchases, tapping View Account, and then choosing the Migrate Purchases option. After migration, the secondary account can no longer be used for purchases, and you will need to sign in with the primary account on all Apple devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen combining accounts, all payment methods associated with the secondary account will migrate to the primary Apple Account, and subscriptions will also transfer over. The secondary account's Up Next queue in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> will also migrate over and replace content from the primary account, as will any podcast library data.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMigrating Apple Account purchases is not available in the European Union, United Kingdom, or India at the current time.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/apple-migrate-purchases-apple-account/\">Apple Now Lets You Move Digital Purchases From One Apple Account to Another</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-now-lets-you-move-digital-purchases-from-one-apple-account-to-another.2449217/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d95674db20cbe27fe3853ce765f53d042151c90b4bb30c0e7b9b8ecf4498b9f2","category":"Apple"}
