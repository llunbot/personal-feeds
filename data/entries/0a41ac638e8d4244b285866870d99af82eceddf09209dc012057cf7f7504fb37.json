While bikepacking bags often focus on carrying the most possible gear without racks, the Restrap Saddle Pack is a smaller bag for when you need to carry just some extra clothes, a spare jacket, or a lot of ride snacks. Or if you pack light, you can stuff plenty in here for some fast fair-weather credit card touring…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Restrap Saddle Pack, now in medium 4.5L or small 2.5L</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Restrap-Saddle-Pack-redesigned-in-medium-4-5L-or-small-2-5L_ready-for-adventure.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Restrap-Saddle-Pack-redesigned-in-medium-4-5L-or-small-2-5L_ready-for-adventure.webp\" alt=\"Restrap Saddle Pack redesigned in medium 4.5L or small 2.5L, ready for adventure\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Restrap-Saddle-Pack-redesigned-in-medium-4-5L-or-small-2-5L_ready-for-adventure.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Restrap-Saddle-Pack-redesigned-in-medium-4-5L-or-small-2-5L_ready-for-adventure-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Restrap-Saddle-Pack-redesigned-in-medium-4-5L-or-small-2-5L_ready-for-adventure-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Restrap-Saddle-Pack-redesigned-in-medium-4-5L-or-small-2-5L_ready-for-adventure-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Restrap-Saddle-Pack-redesigned-in-medium-4-5L-or-small-2-5L_ready-for-adventure-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Restrap-Saddle-Pack-redesigned-in-medium-4-5L-or-small-2-5L_ready-for-adventure-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(Photos/Restrap)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of my experience with Restrap is for their dedicated bikepacking bag setups, whether you are looking for their heavy-duty, big-volume <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/restrap-bar-bag-v3-gives-holster-style-bikepacking-bag-more-storage-options/\" target=\"_blank\">Classic Bikepacking</a> bags or their lightweight <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/restrap-adventure-race-bikepacking-bags/\" target=\"_blank\">Adventure Race</a> range. But one of my favorite recent bags from them is the tiny <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/restrap-tool-pouch-carries-all-your-spares-in-heavy-duty-mini-saddlebag-first-rides/\" target=\"_blank\">Tool Pouch</a>. Fitting in between is their Saddle Pack, which had just been offered in 4.5L. That’s a good size for lightweight ‘fastpacking’. But it’s probably too big for even your longest one-day rides, yet maybe not quite big enough for most overnighters either. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So Restrap went back to the drawing board to crate a smaller happy medium. And in the meantime, they completely revamped the original, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s new?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Restrap-Saddle-Pack-redesigned-in-medium-4-5L-or-small-2-5L_loaded.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Restrap-Saddle-Pack-redesigned-in-medium-4-5L-or-small-2-5L_loaded.webp\" alt=\"Restrap Saddle Pack redesigned in medium 4.5L, packed\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Restrap-Saddle-Pack-redesigned-in-medium-4-5L-or-small-2-5L_loaded.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Restrap-Saddle-Pack-redesigned-in-medium-4-5L-or-small-2-5L_loaded-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Restrap-Saddle-Pack-redesigned-in-medium-4-5L-or-small-2-5L_loaded-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Restrap-Saddle-Pack-redesigned-in-medium-4-5L-or-small-2-5L_loaded-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Restrap-Saddle-Pack-redesigned-in-medium-4-5L-or-small-2-5L_loaded-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Restrap-Saddle-Pack-redesigned-in-medium-4-5L-or-small-2-5L_loaded-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The most obvious newness is the addition of the smaller 2.5L size to the carry-over 4.5L option. That’s great for riders looking for more in-betweener carrying size options. Or if you just want to get all the tuff out of your overstuffed jersey pockets.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Restrap-Saddle-Pack-redesigned-in-medium-4-5L_empty-but-secure.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Restrap-Saddle-Pack-redesigned-in-medium-4-5L_empty-but-secure.webp\" alt=\"Restrap Saddle Pack redesigned in medium 4.5L, empty\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Restrap-Saddle-Pack-redesigned-in-medium-4-5L_empty-but-secure.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Restrap-Saddle-Pack-redesigned-in-medium-4-5L_empty-but-secure-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Restrap-Saddle-Pack-redesigned-in-medium-4-5L_empty-but-secure-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Restrap-Saddle-Pack-redesigned-in-medium-4-5L_empty-but-secure-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Restrap-Saddle-Pack-redesigned-in-medium-4-5L_empty-but-secure-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But beyond that, both Saddle Packs are actually all-new. The new small-to-mid-sized bags now add a light plastic inner structue so that they better hold their shape, whether you stuff them to the brim or leave them empty. That’s especially helpful, as it makes the bags much more stable when you need to wear the extra layers you had packe inside, instead of having a flappy empty bag under your saddle when it gets cold or wet on your ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Restrap-Saddle-Pack-redesigned-in-medium-4-5_packed-full.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Restrap-Saddle-Pack-redesigned-in-medium-4-5_packed-full.webp\" alt=\"Restrap Saddle Pack redesigned in medium 4.5L or small 2.5L, side view\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Restrap-Saddle-Pack-redesigned-in-medium-4-5_packed-full.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Restrap-Saddle-Pack-redesigned-in-medium-4-5_packed-full-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Restrap-Saddle-Pack-redesigned-in-medium-4-5_packed-full-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Restrap-Saddle-Pack-redesigned-in-medium-4-5_packed-full-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Restrap-Saddle-Pack-redesigned-in-medium-4-5_packed-full-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Restrap-Saddle-Pack-redesigned-in-medium-4-5_packed-full-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Restrap-Saddle-Pack-redesigned-in-medium-4-5_packed-full-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Add on top of that some redesigned attachment straps at the post, and Restrap says it sits more snugly against your saddle and post for no sway.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Restrap-Saddle-Pack-redesigned-in-medium-4-5L_orange-inside-with-Fidlock-strap.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Restrap-Saddle-Pack-redesigned-in-medium-4-5L_orange-inside-with-Fidlock-strap.webp\" alt=\"Restrap Saddle Pack redesigned in medium 4.5L or small 2.5L, orange inside\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Restrap-Saddle-Pack-redesigned-in-medium-4-5L_orange-inside-with-Fidlock-strap.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Restrap-Saddle-Pack-redesigned-in-medium-4-5L_orange-inside-with-Fidlock-strap-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Restrap-Saddle-Pack-redesigned-in-medium-4-5L_orange-inside-with-Fidlock-strap-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Restrap-Saddle-Pack-redesigned-in-medium-4-5L_orange-inside-with-Fidlock-strap-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>handmade from 100% waterproof coated 1000D nylon with taped seams</li>\n\n\n\n<li>bright orange inner lining to easily find your gear inside</li>\n\n\n\n<li>heavy-duty TPU-coated nylon reinfoced panels &amp;
