Balance limits and other requirements vary by provider.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere are many other HYSAs not listed in our chart, so be sure to do your research before deciding which option is best suited for you.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<table>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <th>Provider</th>\r<br />\n <th>Maximum APY*</th>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>American Express</td>\r<br />\n <td>4.35%</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Ally</td>\r<br />\n <td>4.35%</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Barclays</td>\r<br />\n <td>4.35%</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Capital One</td>\r<br />\n <td>4.35%</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Discover</td>\r<br />\n <td>4.35%</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Citizens Bank</td>\r<br />\n <td>4.5%</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n<tr>\r<br />\n <td><strong>Apple (Goldman Sachs)</strong></td>\r<br />\n <td><strong>4.5%</strong></td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Marcus (Goldman Sachs)</td>\r<br />\n <td>4.5%</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>SoFi</td>\r<br />\n <td>4.6%</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>PNC Bank</td>\r<br />\n <td>4.65%</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <td>Betterment</td>\r<br />\n <td>4.75%</td>\r<br />\n \r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Synchrony</td>\r<br />\n <td>4.75%</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Wealthfront</td>\r<br />\n <td>5%</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>CIT Bank</td>\r<br />\n <td>5.05%</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>UFB Direct</td>\r<br />\n <td>5.25%</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n</table>\r<br />\n<div></div>* Advertised APYs as of January 27, 2024, excluding limited-time/affiliate rates. APYs may vary.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThese rates will continue to increase or decrease over time, often in line with U.S. Federal Reserve rate decisions. Money can be withdrawn from the Apple Card savings account and switched to a different HYSA at any time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple launched its savings account <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/apple-card-savings-account-launching-today/\">in April 2023</a>, in partnership with Goldman Sachs. The account can be opened and managed in the Wallet app on the iPhone, and it has no fees, no minimum deposits, and no minimum balance requirements. You must have an Apple Card, be a U.S. resident, and be at least 18 years old to open an account.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe account allows Apple Card holders to earn interest on their Daily Cash cashback balance, and on funds deposited via a linked bank account or an Apple Cash balance. The maximum balance allowed is $250,000, which is lower than some HYSAs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo open a savings account in the Wallet app, tap on your Apple Card, tap on the circle with three dots at the top of the screen, tap Daily Cash, and select Set Up Savings.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGoldman Sachs reportedly plans to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/apple-goldman-sachs-partnership-ending/\">end its partnership with Apple</a>, but it is unclear how this might impact the Apple Card. In any case, balances up to the $250,000 limit are fully insured by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/\">Apple Card</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/27/apple-card-savings-interest-rate-comparison/\">Here's How the Apple Card's New Savings Rate Compares to Competitors</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/heres-how-the-apple-cards-new-savings-rate-compares-to-competitors.2417598/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0960276e6ad6f5c86982cd56f2f2eedb500bd42030084800b5cf74e86c9cfd8d","category":"Apple"}
