With that in mind, the peloton kept the trio of escapees at arm's length, never allowing the gap to get beyond four minutes or so.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/8801/best-of-the-best-cyclists-favourite-aero-bikes\">Best of the best: Cyclist's favourite aero bikes</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 117: on sale now!</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/2104/vuelta-a-espana-route-race-reports-tv-guide-and-all-you-need-to-know\">Vuelta a Espana 2021: Route, start list, live TV guide and all we know so far</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nIn the end the wind proved less of a factor than expected, though a temperature in the mid-thirties didn't make it any easier on the three breakaway hopefuls. But this was always going to be a day for the sprinters, and following a three-way battle for control between Alpecin-Fenix, Deceuninck-QuickStep and UAE Team Emirates, Philipsen timed his run to the finish line expertly to overhaul Jakobsen and take the green jersey for his troubles.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/tags/primoz-roglic\" target=\"_blank\">Primož Roglič</a> (Jumbo-Visma) remained in the leader’s red jersey he took with <a href=\"/in-depth/9972/gallery-peerless-primoz-roglic-dominates-opening-vuelta-a-espana-tt\" target=\"_blank\">victory in Saturday's opening time-trial</a>, although second placed Alex Alanburu did gain a couple of seconds in the intermediate sprints and nearly gained more than that with a strong fifth place in the sprint.</p>\n<p>The Astana rider is now just four seconds down overall, but the GC picture should change greatly today with a tough summit finish at Picon Blanco.
