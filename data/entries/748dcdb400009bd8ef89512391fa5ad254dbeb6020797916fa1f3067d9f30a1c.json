It allows training the model with custom data, such as company documents or project documentation. OpenAI claims that a fine-tuned model can perform as well as GPT-4 with lower cost in certain scenarios.</p>\n\n<p>In AI, fine-tuning refers to the process of taking a pretrained neural network (like GPT-3.5 Turbo) and further training it on a different dataset (like your custom data), which is typically smaller and possibly related to a specific task. This process builds off of knowledge the model gained during its initial training phase and refines it for a specific application.</p>\n<p>So basically, fine-tuning teaches GPT-3.5 Turbo about custom content, such as project documentation or any other written reference. That can come in handy if you want to build an AI assistant based on GPT-3.5 that is intimately familiar with your product or service but lacks knowledge of it in its training data (which, as a reminder, was scraped off the web before September 2021).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1962565#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1962565&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"748dcdb400009bd8ef89512391fa5ad254dbeb6020797916fa1f3067d9f30a1c","category":"Tech"}
