Then the top and bottom latches are spring-loaded and lock the phone in place. Every touch point for the phone is covered in softer materials to prevent scuffing, and the mount straps to the bar with the same robust strap you’ll find on Lezyne’s larger lights. The mount will sell for $59.99 and will be available mid-May. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://ride.lezyne.com\" target=\"_blank\">ride.lezyne.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/lezyne-clik-valve-pumps-pocket-drive-pump-cnc-phone-mount/\">Lezyne Partners with Clik for New Valves &amp; Pumps, Adds Tiny Pocket Drive Pump</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"710011795dfc6437513e481379d5866334fb2b2d0f8059fe7645776f62f51093","category":"Cycling"}
