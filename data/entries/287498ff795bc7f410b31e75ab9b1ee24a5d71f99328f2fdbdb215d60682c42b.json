It says that the new tyres save 2% in weight over the standard Corsa Pro while reducing rolling resistance by 5%. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They have been in development for three years and have already been put to good effect by Vittoria’s sponsored pro riders, including Jonas Vingegaard when he won the 2023 Tour de France Stage 16 time-trial in blistering fashion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new tyres are claimed to shave up to 45g off the weight of the standard Corsa Pro and are priced at £89.99 / $104.99 / €94.95 per tyre.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n

tyres share their cotton construction (and tan sidewalls) with the standard <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/vittoria-corsa-pro-and-corsa-pro-control-tyres\" target=\"_blank\">Corsa Pro</a>, as opposed to the more normal nylon carcass. Vittoria says that it has designed the tyres to maximise speed, grip and control, with a new formulation of its <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/vittoria-the-future-looks-like-this\" target=\"_blank\">graphene/silica</a> rubber compound that it claims is fast without sacrificing grip in either dry or wet conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with the standard Corsa Pro tyres, the Corsa Pro Speeds have a tread that tapers into the sidewall and is electrically bonded to the carcass. This is instead of glueing, as was the case with the previous generation Corsa tyres. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Corespun 320tpi cotton casing remains, but Vittoria has changed the tread pattern on the new tyres, with a wider slick section at their centre and closer grooves for improved cornering grip and a more supple ride. The tread is also thinner than on the standard Corsa Pros, but similar to the previous generation Corsa Speed tyres.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vittoria has removed the standard tyres’ puncture protection layer to save weight – a common approach in time-trial tyres, although Continental did keep a puncture protection layer in its <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/continental-grand-prix-5000-as-tr-all-season-tyre\" target=\"_blank\">GP5000 TT TR tyres</a>. Vittoria’s Bead Shield is retained to reinforce the beads.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"649\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Corsa-PRO-Speed-Vingegaard-jpeg-970x649.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Corsa-PRO-Speed-Vingegaard-jpeg-970x649.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Corsa-PRO-Speed-Vingegaard-jpeg-300x201.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Corsa-PRO-Speed-Vingegaard-jpeg-768x514.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Corsa-PRO-Speed-Vingegaard-jpeg-1536x1028.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Corsa-PRO-Speed-Vingegaard-jpeg-2048x1371.jpeg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Corsa-PRO-Speed-Vingegaard-jpeg-750x502.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Corsa-PRO-Speed-Vingegaard-jpeg-1140x763.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Corsa-PRO-Speed-Vingegaard-jpeg-465x310.jpeg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Corsa-PRO-Speed-Vingegaard-jpeg-350x233.jpeg 350w\" /><figcaption>Vittoria </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Vittoria Pro Speed tyres were <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/jonas-vingegaard\" target=\"_blank\">Jonas Vingegaard</a>’s secret weapon when he beasted the Stage 16 time-trial in the 2023 Tour de France, beating <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tadej-pogacar\" target=\"_blank\">Tadej Pogačar</a>‘s time by 98 seconds and effectively ending the latter’s bid for a third Tour win.
