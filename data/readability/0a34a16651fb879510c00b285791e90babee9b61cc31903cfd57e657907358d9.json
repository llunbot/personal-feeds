And we missed it. But now we know, so let’s take a closer look at her record-breaking setup…</p><h2>Joscelin Lowden: Women’s Hour Record holder at 48.405km</h2><p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xxCGdh9izdU?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe></p><p>I personally got excited when <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/alex-dowsett-aims-for-hour-record-on-custom-factor-hanzo-with-silca-prototype-ti-track-dropouts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alex Dowsett</a> recently tried <em>unsuccessfully</em> to reclaim his men’s Hour Record title back from <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/victor-campenaerts-sets-hour-record-on-custom-shaped-ridley-unique-kit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Victor Campenaerts</a>, mainly because the modern aero track bike tech these riders are racing is so easy to geek out on. But while both of these time trial specialists were riding the latest and greatest aerodynamic track bikes from their respective sponsors, British cyclist Joss Lowden recently set a new women’s Hour Record on a<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/new-argon-electron-pro-bikes-debuting-danish-national-track-team/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"> five-year-old Argon 18</a> bike, not their <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2020-argon-18-electron-pro-track-bike-of-cycling-australia-gets-wild-40mm-wide-fork/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">latest model</a> that Cycling Australia raced this year at the Olympics.</p><p>Would she have gone even further on the latest bike? Maybe, but her new 48.405km benchmark already tacked on more than 400m more than Vittoria Bussi’s ride three years earlier.</p><p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kLSVfPjAmW0?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe></p><p>The wild thing to me (but unfortunately, still not surprising) is that Lowden is a pro rider for Continental team <a href=\"https://www.dropslecol.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Drops-LeCol </a>(the UCI’s second tier of women’s pro teams), who even though they hope to upgrade to UCI tier-1 World Teams status next season, have not yet been able to pay all of their riders a salary.
