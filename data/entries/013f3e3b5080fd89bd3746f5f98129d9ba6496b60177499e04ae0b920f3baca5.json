But the little public-facing data we have doesn't bear that out.</p>\n<p>Both AMD and Nvidia are in similar <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/09/now-the-chip-shortage-is-being-exacerbated-by-a-labor-shortage/\">chip-shortage</a> boats—all leaky and going down <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/07/chip-shortages-continue-apple-amd-intel-hunker-down-for-a-long-haul/\">the same hellish supply chain creek</a> without a paddle. Yet, <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/videocard/\">Steam hardware surveys</a> have told a tale of Nvidia enjoying a noticeable installation lead with its current-day RTX 3000 series of GPUs (5.76 percent of all registered GPUs on Steam in September 2021, excluding laptop variants) over AMD's RDNA 2 (0.16 percent in the form of a single GPU, and that's <em>not</em> a decimal-point typo). You might assume this would compel AMD to try something drastic with its latest GPU.</p>\n<p>That's not the case this month. <a href=\"https://www.amd.com/en/products/graphics/amd-radeon-rx-6600\" target=\"_blank\">AMD's RX 6600</a>, which goes on sale at some point today, is nowhere near the drastic card that AMD arguably needs right now. It's loudly positioned as a \"1080p\" resolution card... just like its older sibling, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/08/amd-rx-6600xt-review-a-sad-trombone-noise-of-a-379-2021-gpu/\">the RX 6600XT</a>, which came and went in August. In fact, both cards involve AMD's Navi 23 die, with the 6600 either copying or slashing specs while also dropping in MSRP from $379 to $329.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1803544#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1803544&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"013f3e3b5080fd89bd3746f5f98129d9ba6496b60177499e04ae0b920f3baca5","category":"Tech"}
