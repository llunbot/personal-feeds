Since the movies are unplayable in 3D via the TV app without a Vision Pro headset, it is currently unclear what resolution and frame rate they play in. 3D titles seen in the ‌Apple TV‌ app include <em>Jurassic World Dominion</em>, <em>Pacific Rim Uprising</em>, <em>Shrek</em>, <em>Trolls</em>, <em>Warcraft</em>, <em>Minions: The Rise of Gru</em>, <em>Mortal Engines</em>, <em>Everest</em>, <em>Kung Fu Panda 3</em>, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>This 3D icon is live in the Apple TV app. <a href=\"https://t.co/EEKPRDVphx\">https://t.co/EEKPRDVphx</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/PFvCiyj78B\">https://t.co/PFvCiyj78B</a></p>— Steve Moser (@SteveMoser) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SteveMoser/status/1722631501890900357?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 9, 2023</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple showcased a 3D version of <em>Avatar: The Way of Water</em> to demonstrate some of the entertainment capabilities of the Vision Pro headset when it was unveiled in June and touted the ability to play 2D, 3D, and \"immersive\" movies on the device, including in a virtual cinema.
