That included a lot of nitty-gritty talk about hardware specs and software interpolation, but also design decisions surrounding how to balance hardware-power and battery-power concerns.</p>\n<p>AMD's custom-built Steam Deck APU, dubbed Aerith after the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/final-fantasy-vii/\"><em>Final Fantasy VII</em></a> character, is the core of the system and was a focus of the presentation. AMD says the system is the company's first mobile chip to feature an <a href=\"https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/rdna-2\">RDNA2 GPU architecture</a>, so it should have full support for DirectX 12 and the latest Vulkan APIs. That also means that not only will Steam Deck be <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/07/valve-promises-steam-deck-will-run-the-entire-steam-library-at-30-fps/\">compatible with the entire Steam library</a>, but many Steam games will already be <em>optimized</em> for the specific chip configuration found inside, Valve says.</p>\n<p>The CPU portion of the Aerith chip features four Zen 2 cores capable of running eight threads at 3.5 Ghz. Meanwhile, the GPU features eight RDNA2 compute units running at 1.6 Ghz.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1813205#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1813205&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5f0c47e63686302f6de5807b6ca6b1a5eaec39fe6104d9e4f46e72940fbfbafe","category":"Tech"}
