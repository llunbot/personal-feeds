A perfect ending for a fitting goodbye to one of cycling’s very best champions, Tony Martin certainly went out with a bang.</p>\n<p>The mixed time trial relay first made its debut at the world championships in 2019, and it looks like it’s here to stay after replacing the trade team time trial.</p>\n<p>But it was the latest instalment that tugged on the heartstrings of many worldwide. The German men set off first, producing a time of 24:38 with Martin, Nikias Arndt and Max Walscheid.</p>\n<p>Then the German women stepped up and showed out. Lisa Brennauer, Lisa Klein and Mieke Kroeger’s performance resulted in a time of 50:49 for Germany.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/9910/womens-tour-2021-stage-routes-revealed\">Women's Tour 2021 stage routes revealed</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/9247/womens-tour-2021-postponed\">Women's Tour 2021 postponed</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/5348/womens-tour-expands-to-six-stages-for-2019\">Women's Tour expands to six stages for 2019</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nNo-one could beat that.
