Corellium's technology allowed security researchers and developers to run virtual iPhones, enabling them to probe iOS outside of Apple's own security measures. This capability was at the core of Apple's allegations, claiming that Corellium's software not only replicated iOS but also served as an alternative to Apple's security research products.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCorellium defended its actions under fair use, asserting that its replication of iOS was solely for the purpose of security research and was substantially transformative. In 2021, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/11/apple-corellium-lawsuit-settlement/\">agreed to drop its claims</a> but then <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/17/apple-appeals-corellium-copyright-lawsuit/\">filed an appeal</a> that challenged an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/29/apple-loses-lawsuit-against-corellium/\">earlier ruling</a> in favor of Corellium's fair use claim.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis week, the court announced that both Apple and Corellium have ultimately come to a confidential settlement, bringing the prolonged dispute to an end.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lawsuit/\">Apple Lawsuits</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/15/apple-and-corellium-reach-settlement/\">Apple and Corellium Reach Settlement in iOS Replication Lawsuit</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-and-corellium-reach-settlement-in-ios-replication-lawsuit.2413808/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0838a8b4bb336177ffc39d8634318015e59727703d8d245cf56a94c87eb4c79b","category":"Apple"}
