Impressively, the results that are available so far show that the highest-end M4 Pro chip is faster than the highest-end M2 Ultra chip in terms of peak multi-core CPU performance.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/M4-Pro-on-Blue.jpg\" width=\"4656\" height=\"2617\" />\r<br />\nHere is a comparison of the results:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<ul><li><strong>Mac mini with M4 Pro (14-core CPU):</strong> 22,094 multi-core score (average of 11 results)</li>\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<li><strong>Mac Studio with M2 Ultra (24-core CPU):</strong> 21,351 (average of <a href=\"https://browser.geekbench.com/macs/mac-studio-2023-24c-cpu-60c-gpu\">more than 600 results</a>)</li></ul>Based on these results, the M4 Pro now holds the record of being the fastest Apple silicon chip ever in the Geekbench 6 database. Of course, it will soon be surpassed by the M4 Max chip with a 16-core CPU, but no results are available for that chip as of writing. We will publish a follow-up report with the M4 Max results once they are available.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhat this means is that you can now purchase a Mac mini with a 14-core M4 Pro for $1,599 in the U.S. and get similar to faster peak performance than a Mac Studio with the 24-core M2 Ultra, a configuration that starts at $3,999.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs for year-over-year performance improvements, the M4 Pro is up to 45% faster than the highest-end M3 Pro chip in terms of multi-core CPU performance, based on the Geekbench 6 results that are available so far.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHere is a comparison of the results:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<ul><li><strong>Mac mini with M4 Pro (14-core CPU):</strong> 22,094 multi-core score (average of 11 results)</li>\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<li><strong>14-inch MacBook Pro with M3 Pro (12-core CPU):</strong> 15,282 (average of <a href=\"https://browser.geekbench.com/macs/macbook-pro-14-inch-nov-2023-12c-cpu-18c-gpu\">more than 4,000 results</a>)</li></ul>Read our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/29/apple-announces-m4-pro-chip/\">earlier coverage of the M4 Pro announcement</a> to learn more about the chip.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll of Apple's new Macs launch on Friday, November 8.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/\">Mac Studio</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/benchmarks/\">Benchmarks</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/geekbench/\">Geekbench</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac-Studio\">Mac Studio (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini\">Mac Mini (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-studio.237\">Mac Studio</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146\">Mac mini</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/31/m4-pro-chip-benchmark-results/\">M4 Pro Chip Benchmark Results Reveal an Extremely Impressive Performance Feat</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m4-pro-chip-benchmark-results-reveal-an-extremely-impressive-performance-feat.2441668/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b63667854978db66ff6a295bd866e2dca3929d8f8d9d3a7ead394daff6c6df76","category":"Apple"}
