It was only a matter of time, wasn't it?</p>\n<p>The new machine from Rapha is not exactly new but a collaboration with 'Rolls-Royce of the coffee world' Rocket Espresso on one of its existing machines, the futuristic-looking R Cinquantotto.</p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cyclist.b-cdn.net/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/12/rapha-rocket-4050-high_res-final.jpg?itok=tPM9gSNG\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>This particular machine will be limited to 100 made-to-order units, each numbered, and only available to members of the Rapha Cycling Club.</p>\n<p>It's black with pink with silver details in keeping with club colours and will cost £2,735, including taxes and duties, thank heavens. The only thing that could make it more Rapha would be if the machine had a job at PWC. </p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/reviews/8957/adidas-the-road-cycling-shoe-review\">Adidas The Road Cycling Shoe review</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/9283/adidas-launches-spd-version-of-samba-trainers\">Adidas launches SPD version of Samba trainers</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/9978/adidas-goes-off-road-with-release-of-the-gravel-cycling-shoes\">Adidas goes off-road with release of The Gravel Cycling Shoes</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nTo be fair, the R Cinquantotto is a proper piece of kit. It comes equipped with dual boilers which allow you to steam milk and boil water simultaneously, water which can be brought in directly from your main supply as this particular machine can be plumbed in, if you fancy it. </p>\n<p>If not, there's an internal water reservoir that you can fill up from your Brita. Either way, all your water is pulled through into the machine from a <em>commercial grade</em> rotary pump. None of your amateur rubbish, eh.</p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cyclist.b-cdn.net/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/12/rapha-rocket-4066-high_res-final.jpg?itok=2poQ2m8I\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>The dual independently operated PID controlled boilers also claim to guarantee 'optimum extraction of any coffee type or roast style' . If that weren't enough, Rocket has also transferred machine functions to a removable touch screen communication pod. All Rocket machines are fully servicable by the brand too.</p>\n<p>The RCC R Cinquantotto espresso machine goes on sale today and <a href=\"https://www.rapha.cc/gb/en/shop/rapha-rocket-r58-espresso-machine/product/ROC01XXMUL\" target=\"_blank\">can be picked up here</a>.
