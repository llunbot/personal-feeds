While ratings were a bit sluggish, they were good enough to win the series a second season, and Disney+ just dropped the first action-packed teaser trailer.</p>\n<p><strong>(Spoilers for S1 below.)</strong></p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/08/official-andor-trailer-shows-us-what-the-birth-of-a-revolution-looks-like/\">previously reported</a>, the story begins five years before the events of <em>Rogue One</em>, with the Empire's destruction of Cassian Andor's (Diego Luna) homeworld and follows his transformation from a \"revolution-averse\" cynic to a major player in the nascent rebellion who is willing to sacrifice himself to save the galaxy. S1 left off with Cassian returning to Ferrix for the funeral of his adoptive mother, Maarva (Fiona Shaw), rescuing a friend from prison, and dodging an assassination attempt. A post-credits scene showed prisoners assembling the firing dish of the now-under-construction Death Star.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/02/the-revolution-starts-now-with-andor-s2-teaser/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/02/the-revolution-starts-now-with-andor-s2-teaser/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7e5c7b6e501dd8cc0a6a0a59b5af99847b63b2836f6cef674e9711072bf64554","category":"Tech"}
