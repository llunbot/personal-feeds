She’s giving her body the care it needs and building up slowly again.</span></p>\n<p><span>I progressed throughout the domestic ranks very successfully, very quickly. Of course, like anybody, I had a couple of crashes.</span><span> But once I got into the professional peloton, I progressed even faster. I won a WorldTour race in my first year in Europe, then I won another WorldTour race the following year. And really, everything sort of came crashing down when my team folded at the end of 2020 in the pandemic year. </span></p>\n<p><span>2021 seemed to be going smoothly, I had a new team, Ceratizit-WNT, but a freak accident at <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/strade-bianche-everything-you-need-to-know\">Strade Bianche</a> threw the whole year out of kilter.</span><span> I spent the whole year recovering from that.</span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/117_spread_by_Alessandra_Bucci_approved-6833.jpg?v=1677147935\" alt=\"Lizzy Banks article in Issue 117 of Rouleur magazine, Body\" /></span><span>I was ready to go again in late September, beginning of October 2021. I worked so bloody hard, and I was so good: I was recovering better than I’ve ever recovered before. In January, I set the best power numbers I’d ever done. I was convinced that the rest that my body had was going to fare me well in 2022. I was starting with a new team. I would have a complete new set of opportunities, more support than I’d ever had before, more money in the bank than I’ve had before. And I could actually support myself with physio and anything else that I needed. Then the day before my first race, I got covid and I had no idea what would come to pass with getting pericarditis from covid and spending eight months battling it. I have had some rather shit luck the last few years. </span></p>\n<p><span>At the end of September 2022, I felt like I was ready to start again.</span><span> I was cautiously stepping back into it. I did my first one-hour ride. The day after that, some family were visiting me and one of my family members tested positive for covid. Four days later, I got covid for the second time. And then two weeks after that, I visited the cardiologist to have a checkup. And five days later, I picked up bronchitis from the cardiologist.</span></p>\n<p><span>I did everything right, I went off the bike, when I had covid, I didn’t train, I came back very slowly, I did everything right.</span><span> But it’s something that you can’t control; there are millions of people living with long covid, unable to get a diagnosis, unable to get treatment. </span></p>\n<p><span>Really, I consider myself bloody lucky that I have the resources to be able to do that, and that I’ve recovered from it. If I were doing a normal job, I would have been able to do that for a number of months. But I don’t have a normal job.</span></p>\n<p><span>There’s nothing in my history that could have predicted this.</span><span> It’s a series of really unfortunate events. And I know what it looks like from the outside; I know what people say. People see riders who haven’t raced for two years or have one thing after another and they just write off that rider. </span></p>\n<p><span>But I’m not ready to be written off yet.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/pages/subscribe\"><em><strong>To read the full article with Lizzy Banks, subscribe to Rouleur and receive your issue of 117, Body.</strong></em></a></p>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Rouleur Media","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"39eae864ffe71ce7c0dcacb555374fb873cd6bebfee45fe73704852c6cbebd32","category":"Cycling"}
