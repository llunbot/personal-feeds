In many ways, that might be true, but there's one major caveat: Netflix.</p>\n<p>In a statement reported by <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-17/watching-netflix-on-apple-vision-pro-you-ll-have-to-use-the-web\">Bloomberg</a> today, Netflix revealed that it does not plan to offer an app for Vision Pro. Instead, users will have to use a web-based interface to watch the streaming service.</p>\n<p>Netflix compares the experience to the Mac, but there are a few reasons this won't be an ideal experience for users.
