Yes, <em>that</em> Lemond. The Tour de France-winning, aerobar-pioneering maverick has reinvented himself with an eponymous bike brand that at this point in time, is all about the ebike. Super light and sleek ebikes with integrated lighting and their own unique style.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lemond-All-Road-Prolog-ebike-gravel2.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"855\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lemond-All-Road-Prolog-ebike-gravel2.webp\" alt=\"Lemond All-Road Prolog lights\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lemond-All-Road-Prolog-ebike-gravel2.webp 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lemond-All-Road-Prolog-ebike-gravel2-297x169.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lemond-All-Road-Prolog-ebike-gravel2-800x456.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lemond-All-Road-Prolog-ebike-gravel2-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lemond-All-Road-Prolog-ebike-gravel2-768x438.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After unveiling the Dutch, and then the Prolog, Lemond has now introduced the All-Road Prolog. The newest bike looks to be simply a different build for the existing Prolog frame, incorporating drop bars and bigger all-road tires. The original Prolog was already incredibly light at 26lbs, so the All-Road version gets a bit heavier thanks to the bigger tires and heavier bars, but it’s still a featherweight compared to other ebikes at 28lbs. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ebike System</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Mahle M1 ebike drive system keeps things light with a 250W rear hub motor with 40Nm of torque. You’ll find a 250Wh battery in the downtube, which is controlled with a single button on the top tube. The bike has a 20mph top assisted speed, and a claimed range of up to 70 miles. There’s also a range extender available that claims to boost the range by 70%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fitted with a Shimano GRX 1×11 drivetrain (Di2 available for an upgrade), the All-Road relies on a carbon dropbar for rider positioning. At the tires, the All-Road bumps up to 700c x 43mm Panaracer Gravelking SK from the 38mm tires found on the Prolog. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Geometry</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lemond-All-Road-Prolog-geometry.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1319\" height=\"1435\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lemond-All-Road-Prolog-geometry.png\" alt=\"Lemond All-Road Prolog geometry\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lemond-All-Road-Prolog-geometry.png 1319w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lemond-All-Road-Prolog-geometry-276x300.png 276w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lemond-All-Road-Prolog-geometry-800x870.png 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lemond-All-Road-Prolog-geometry-110x120.png 110w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lemond-All-Road-Prolog-geometry-768x836.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Offered in three sizes, the All-Road Prolog has the same geometry as the existing Prolog.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pricing &amp; Availability</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lemond-All-Road-Prolog-ebike-gravel3.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"620\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lemond-All-Road-Prolog-ebike-gravel3-800x620.jpg\" alt=\"Lemond All-Road Prolog rosa\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lemond-All-Road-Prolog-ebike-gravel3-800x620.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lemond-All-Road-Prolog-ebike-gravel3-297x230.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lemond-All-Road-Prolog-ebike-gravel3-120x93.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lemond-All-Road-Prolog-ebike-gravel3-768x596.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lemond-All-Road-Prolog-ebike-gravel3-1536x1191.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lemond-All-Road-Prolog-ebike-gravel3.jpg 1728w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lemond-All-Road-Prolog-ebike-gravel4.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"620\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lemond-All-Road-Prolog-ebike-gravel4-800x620.jpg\" alt=\"Lemond All-Road Prolog black\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lemond-All-Road-Prolog-ebike-gravel4-800x620.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lemond-All-Road-Prolog-ebike-gravel4-297x230.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lemond-All-Road-Prolog-ebike-gravel4-120x93.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lemond-All-Road-Prolog-ebike-gravel4-768x596.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lemond-All-Road-Prolog-ebike-gravel4-1536x1191.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Lemond-All-Road-Prolog-ebike-gravel4.jpg 1728w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Available in three colors, Matte Blanc, Noir, and Rosa, the bike starts at $5,995.
