The New York Times reports:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Over the past two months, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida has\nrepeatedly declared victory in his yearlong effort to restrict the\n<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/article/disney-florida-desantis.html\">autonomy of Disney World</a>, the state’s largest employer.\n“There’s a new sheriff in town,” he said numerous times, including\nat a news conference last month on Disney property, hours before\nappointing a new, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/10/business/disney-world-florida-tax-board.html\">handpicked oversight board</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Nobody seemed to have paid attention, however, to an important\ndetail: Disney had been simultaneously maneuvering to restrict the\ngovernor’s effort. In early February — at a public meeting held\nby the previous, Disney-controlled oversight board — the company\npushed through a development agreement that would limit the new\nboard’s power for decades to come.</p>\n\n<p>And now, the governor’s appointees, having belatedly discovered\nthe action, are none too pleased. “It completely circumvents the\nauthority of the board to govern,” Brian Aungst Jr., a member of\nthe new council, said on Wednesday at the <a href=\"https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-ne-disney-new-reedy-creek-board-powerless-20230329-qalagcs4wjfe3iwkpzjsz2v4qm-story.html\">group’s second\nmeeting</a>. “We’re going to have to deal with it and\ncorrect it.”</p>\n\n<p>The agreement is effective for perpetuity. It uses contractual\nlanguage known as a “royal lives” clause: “Shall continue in\neffect until twenty one (21) years after the death of the last\nsurvivor of the descendants of King Charles III, King of England\nliving as of the date of this declaration.” (The royal language\nquickly spawned <a href=\"https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/breaking-news/os-ne-disney-desantis-charles-royal-clause-loophole-board-20230330-2ucrvv22hfhcvbrn446us6xmuu-story.html\">numerous internet memes</a>, striking\npeople as odd in a matter involving a theme park that is home to\nCinderella’s castle.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The people who run Disney are pretty smart, and Ron DeSantis seems pretty dumb, so I’m not surprised at how this turned out.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/30/disney-1-desantis-0\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b5f39cb475214b3c2bc15d349b9f1128167001c7fbcaacb89272e6ab8037779d","category":"Tech"}
