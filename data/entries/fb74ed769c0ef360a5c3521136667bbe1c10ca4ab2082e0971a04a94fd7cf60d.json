{"title":"The 2025 Mini Countryman SE: Whimsy doesn’t make up for annoying","link":"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/the-2025-mini-countryman-se-whimsy-doesnt-make-up-for-annoying/","date":1744305668000,"content":"<p>For its third incarnation, the Mini Countryman now comes in an all-electric variant. The Countryman is Mini's take on the family car, a compact crossover with bold design both inside and out. At a time when far too many automakers are supersizing their vehicles, Mini's offerings are still right-sized, even if the Countryman is a bit bigger than <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/10/minis-new-countryman-hybrid-is-hobbled-by-too-small-a-battery/\">the model it replaces</a>. But at times, you might be left feeling that style took preference over substance.</p>\n<p>The previous Countryman was available with the brand's only plug-in hybrid powertrain, but Mini now only offers the Countryman with either an internal combustion engine or as a full battery electric vehicle. Consequently, the Countryman SE is a fair bit more expensive now, starting at $45,200 before any tariffs are taken into account.</p>\n<p>Much of that money has gone to more lithium-ion—66.5 kWh in total (64.7 kWh useable), coupled to a pair of electric motors with a combined output of 308 hp (230 kW) and 364 lb-ft (494 Nm). That's sufficient for an EPA range estimate of 212 miles (341 km), although that might be a little on the conservative side. Based on the past few hundred miles, the test car we spent a week with averaged 3.4 miles/kWh (18.3 miles/kWh), which should allow for 220 miles (354 km) on a single charge, at least in good weather.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/the-2025-mini-countryman-se-whimsy-doesnt-make-up-for-annoying/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/the-2025-mini-countryman-se-whimsy-doesnt-make-up-for-annoying/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
