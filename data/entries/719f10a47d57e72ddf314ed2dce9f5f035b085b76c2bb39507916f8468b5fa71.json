Most road bike <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/drivetrains-explained-all-of-the-parts-that-make-your-bike-go/\">drivetrains</a> now have two chainrings and between nine and 12 cogs – <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/rotor-1x13-hydraulic-groupset-weights-price-specs-details/\">or now, even 13</a> – in the rear.</p>\n<p>Shimano and SRAM are, by far, the most common drivetrain brands, although you will find Campagnolo, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/buyers-guide-to-microshift/\">Microshift</a> and FSA components out there too.</p>\n<p>In general, endurance bikes have smaller gears, meaning it’s easier to get up hills, while race bikes have larger gears for higher top-end speed.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Shimano Dura-Ace R9200 chainrings\" title=\"Shimano_Dura-Ace_Di2_R9270_Fairlight_Strael 3_019\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The 53t largest chainring has all but disappeared except on pro bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Bigger chainrings mean more outright speed (and effort), and smaller chainrings – dubbed compact – mean less effort.</p>\n<p>Some road bikes use <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/1x-drivetrains/\">1x drivetrains</a>, which omit a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/front-derailleur/\">front derailleur</a> and have a wider <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/bike-cassettes/\">cassette</a> range, although this is more popular on gravel bikes.</p>\n<p>For a detailed breakdown of the options, see our <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/road-bike-groupsets-everything-you-need-to-know/\">buyer’s guide to road bike groupsets</a>.</p>\n<h3>Rim brakes or disc brakes?</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Giant Propel Advanced Pro 0 AXS aero road bike\" title=\"Giant Propel Advanced Pro 0 AXS - 03\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The adoption of disc brakes has accelerated on road bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>For decades, road bikes used caliper rim brakes, where blocks of rubber squeezed against the rims.</p>\n<p>Now, however, the majority of mid-range and high-end road bikes come equipped with disc brakes, which have been used on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike/\">mountain bikes</a> for many years.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/road-disc-brakes-everything-you-need-to-know/\">disc brakes vs. rim brakes</a> debate is endless but, in short, discs offer superior braking in wet weather, but are heavier and slightly more hassle to maintain.</p>\n<p>Rim brakes are still common on more affordable bikes, and they remain a perfectly viable option for many riders.</p>\n<p>Note that the majority of rim brake bikes cannot be converted to discs and vice versa, so once you’ve made your choice, you’re committed to it.</p>\n<h3>Aluminium or carbon fibre wheels?</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Roval Rapide CLX II carbon road wheelset\" title=\"Roval Rapide CLX II - bike front\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Quality carbon road wheels are light and aerodynamic.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Josh Patterson / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>With few exceptions, road bikes will come with 700c <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/buyers-guide-to-road-bike-wheels/\">wheels</a> with either aluminium or carbon fibre rims.</p>\n<p>Aluminium rims come as standard on many road bikes, particularly at the lower end of the price spectrum, because they are relatively cheap to produce.</p>\n<p>Carbon rims are becoming increasingly common on new, complete bikes. Wheels with carbon rims can be even lighter than those with aluminium rims. They can be more aerodynamic too, because the high strength-to-weight ratio of the material means manufacturers can create ‘deep-section’ rim profiles that aren’t prohibitively heavy.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Jack’s Canyon Ultimate CF SLX Haute Route Davos Horse for the Course\" title=\"@OpenProd - HR DAVOS - Canyon RP-10\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The performance of rim brakes on carbon rims diminishes in the rain.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Olivier Penpenic / Haute Route </i></span></div>\n<p>If you have a rim brake bike, the rim material itself takes the brunt of the braking force. This makes aluminium rims a popular choice because when the rim eventually wears down through use, it’s cheaper to replace aluminium rims than carbon rims.</p>\n<p>Aluminium rims also provide a better braking surface than carbon rims in wet conditions, so many riders will fit aluminium rims to their bike in winter, saving their wheels with carbon rims – if they have them – for summer.</p>\n<p>The growing popularity of disc brakes has made much of the debate between aluminium and carbon rims redundant, however. Because disc brakes bind with a metal rotor attached to the wheel rather than the rim itself, riders can now opt for carbon rims regardless of weather conditions or season.</p>\n<h3>What tyres will my road bike come with?</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Vittoria Corsa Pro TLR\" title=\"Vittoria Corsa Pro TLR\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Numbers on the sidewall refer to the size of the tyre on the wheel and width of the tyre when inflated.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Most road bikes come with slick or very lightly treaded tyres.</p>\n<p>While extremely narrow tyres used to be commonplace, it’s become more common to spec wider tyres on road bikes in recent years. Race bikes are often fitted with 25mm-wide tyres, while endurance bikes come with 28mm or even 32mm tyres.</p>\n<p>Regardless of the width, all of these tyres will roll fast and the wider tyres give you a little more cushioning (and speed over rougher road surfaces) in exchange for a little more weight.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bike-tyres/\">best road bike tyres</a> will offer a combination of speed (low rolling resistance), grip and puncture resistance.</p>\n<p>Tyres are one of the easiest things to change and one of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-upgrades/\">best bike upgrades</a>. So you don’t need to worry much about what the bike comes with. That said, if you are keen on maximising the comfort of your bike, make sure the frame has clearance for wider tyres.</p>\n<p>Again, race bikes that favour aerodynamics will typically skew towards skinny tyres, while the endurance bikes that deliver comfort will generally have plump rubber.</p>\n<p>If you’re unsure <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/how-to-inflate-a-bicycle-tyre-everything-you-need-to-know-about-pumps-valves-pressure-and-more/\">how to pump up your tyres</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-change-a-bike-tyre/\">how to change your tyres</a>, check out our comprehensive guides.</p>\n<h2>How to choose a road bike by price</h2>\n<h3>Best cheap road bikes – best road bikes under £750/$750</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pack shot of the Triban RC500 road bike\" title=\"Triban RC500 - 01\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> You don’t have to spend much to get started with road cycling.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Getting into road riding needn’t cost you a fortune.

A budget road bike that fits you like a glove will feel and handle much better than an ill-fitting superbike.</p>\n<p>While most brands have bike fit charts on their websites, it’s vital to just go and sit on the thing if you are new to cycling.</p>\n<p>Once you learn what fit works for you, you can shop using the charts; in the meantime, try bikes as you would shoes.</p>\n<p>Once you have selected the right size frame – which any good bike shop can help you with – you then need to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/how-to-get-your-bike-saddle-height-right/\">get your bike’s saddle height correct</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-adjust-your-handlebar-height/\">adjust the handlebar height</a> for comfortable riding. Again, a professional fit at a good shop is invaluable here.</p>\n<p>Most good shops will work with you to fine-tune other elements of your fit too, such as the distance to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/road-bike-handlebars-guide-how-to-choose-the-right-ones/\">handlebar</a>, the angle of the handlebar and even the feel of the saddle.</p>\n<p>Note that saddle preference is highly personal; there’s no universal right answer here. The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-saddles/\">best road bike saddles</a> will be supportive while allowing sufficient blood flow in your delicate areas, and won’t get in the way of pedalling.</p>\n<p>Many saddles are considered unisex, but some of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-womens-road-bike-saddles/\">best women’s road bike saddles</a> have features specifically tailored to female anatomy.</p>\n<p>Just try a few until you find something comfortable – many saddle manufacturers will also offer demo services via their dealers.</p>\n<h2>What do I need to go on a road ride?</h2>\n<p>So you’ve decided on your new road bike, but if you’re new to road cycling, what else do you need to go on your <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/how-to-plan-your-first-road-bike-ride/\">first road bike ride</a>?</p>\n<h3>Helmet</h3>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Specialized Prevail 3 helmet\" title=\"DSC00053\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> How to wear a helmet correctly.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ashley Quinlan / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The most important thing you will need is a road bike helmet.</p>\n<p>While here in the UK a helmet is not mandatory by law, it is advisable to wear a helmet to help minimise the risk of serious head injuries.</p>\n<p>Many of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bike-helmets/\">best road bike helmets</a> will be lightweight, breathable and focus on ensuring comfort for long days out.</p>\n<p>A growing trend in road bike helmets is technology that will protect your head against rotational impacts. A popular option used by brands is the third-party technology <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/what-is-mips/\">MIPS</a>, but other brands have their own version, such as Lazer’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/lazer-kineticore-helmet-safety-technology/\">KinetiCore</a>.</p>\n<p>Wearing a helmet is important for safety but <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/sizing-and-fit/how-to-wear-bike-helmet/\">how you wear a helmet</a> is equally important, because without the correct fit, a helmet’s protection can be compromised.</p>\n<h3>Shoes</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Shimano S-Phyre RC902 Cycling Shoes\" title=\"Shimano S-Phyre RC902 Cycling Shoes\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Many cycling shoes are available in bold colours.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>While you can use your normal shoes to go for a road bike ride, the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-cycling-shoes/\">best road bike shoes</a> will often be lighter, more ventilated and stiffer for greater pedalling efficiency (although, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/does-cycling-shoe-stiffness-actually-matter/\">whether cycling shoe stiffness actually matters</a> is a subject of some debate).</p>\n<p>They will often be slimmer than day-to-day shoes, more aerodynamic and with closing systems that won’t get caught in your bike.</p>\n<p>It’s worth taking the time to find the right shoes for you, because the fit of cycling shoes can vary greatly and can be as personal a choice as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/how-to-choose-the-best-saddle/\">best bike saddles</a>.</p>\n<p>Road cycling shoes will often come with mounts for three-bolt cleats, which are compatible with road bike pedals. Others will come with holes for two-bolt cleats, which are compatible with mountain-bike style pedals. Some may even come with mounts for both types of cleats.</p>\n<h3>Pedals</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Garmin Rally RS200 power meter pedal\" title=\"20210317_SB_5DSR_MG_4015\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Road bike pedals tend to provide a wide pedalling platform, creating a direct feel with the bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bike-pedals/\">best road bike pedals</a> tend to be one-sided, clipless pedals, compatible with three-bolt cleats (though, as always, there are exceptions such as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/pedals/wahoo-speedplay-zero-pedals-review/\">Wahoo’s Speedplay Zero</a> range).</p>\n<p>While many people will start out using <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/flat-or-clipless-pedals-which-is-right-for-you/\">flat pedals</a>, road cyclists tend to like <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/skills/how-to-use-clipless-pedals/\">cycling with cleats</a> because they provide a firm and secure connection between the foot and the bike.</p>\n<p>Some road cyclists opt for mountain bike pedals that are compatible with two-bolt cleats, because these enable them to use shoes with treads for walking. These systems are also typically easier to clip into and often offer a dual-sided platform, making them more beginner-friendly.</p>\n<p>You can read our guide on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/shimano-spd-vs-spd-sl/\">SPD vs SPD-SL</a> pedals to find out whether a three-bolt or two-bolt cleat system is best for you.</p>\n<h3>Cycling kit</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Albion Rain Jacket for road cycling in bright orange\" title=\"Albion Rain Jacket\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A cycling rain jacket is a wise investment.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Paige O'Sullivan / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Just as there’s no reason to stop you from riding your road bike with normal shoes, there’s no reason you can’t head out in your normal clothes either.</p>\n<p>But there is a whole world of cycling kit – from socks to headbands – tailored to the specific demands of cycling.</p>\n<p>One of the most valuable pieces of cycling-specific clothing to consider is a pair of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cycling-shorts/\">best bib shorts</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-womens-cycling-shorts/\">best women’s bib shorts</a>. These are close-fitting Lycra bottoms with pads designed to keep your bottom comfortable on long rides.</p>\n<p>Many cyclists will opt for a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/cheap-cycling-jerseys/\">cycling jersey</a> because these will help wick sweat away and have pockets on the back to carry supplies.</p>\n<p>Wearing form-fitting clothing is also an easy way to make yourself faster on the bike, if that interests you, as it is more aerodynamic than baggy clothing.</p>\n<p>For colder weather, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/best-winter-bib-tights-for-cycling/\">cycling tights</a> will offer the same advantages as cycling shorts but provide extra warmth. The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-winter-cycling-gloves/\">best cycling gloves</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-overshoes/\">best overshoes</a> will help keep you warm, too.</p>\n<p>As with virtually any outdoor activity, it’s worth investing in a good <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-waterproof-jackets-for-cyclists/\">waterproof jacket</a>.</p>\n<h3>Hydration</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"The 3T Exploro RaceMax gravel bike come with a 3T Matte carbon bottle cage\" title=\"3T Exploro RaceMax 02\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Fitting a bottle cage to your bike is a good idea.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>If you’re heading out for a long day’s cycling, or even a short ride, staying hydrated is important.</p>\n<p>Many road bikes will have mounts on the down tube and seat tube for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bottle-cages/\">water bottle cages</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cycling-water-bottles/\">water bottles</a>.</p>\n<h3>Supplies to fix a flat tyre</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"How to fit tight bike tyres\" title=\"How to fit tight bike tyres 08\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Knowing how to fix a puncture could save you a lot of hassle.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Yogamaya von Bromley / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>One of the great things about road bikes is they enable you to cover great distances with ease, but this does mean being prepared to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-fix-a-puncture-video/\">fix a flat tyre</a> is wise because you don’t want to end up stranded.</p>\n<p>In order to fix a flat tyre, you will need <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/6-of-the-best-tyre-levers/\">tyre levers</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/how-to-choose-a-bicycle-pump/\">pump</a>.

These contain plugs that help the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/which-tubeless-sealant-works-the-best/\">tubeless sealant</a> within the tyre seal the hole back up, so you can re-inflate the tyre using a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-pump/\">mini bike pump</a> and carry on riding.</p>\n<p>It may also be worth having a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/6-of-the-best-co2-inflators/\">CO2 inflator</a> with you on your rides. This will supply enough pressure to seat the tyre beads back on the rim, if you’ve had to remove them to carry out a repair.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, a spare inner tube can be fitted to a tubeless tyre with a puncture that can’t be fixed with plugs and sealant alone.</p>\n<h3>Saddle bag</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Sila Mattone Grande seat pack\" title=\"silca_mattone_grande_front\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Mattone Grande is a larger version of Silca’s original Mattone seat pack.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Stan Portus / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>Rather than carrying your spare tools and parts in your jersey pocket, using one of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-saddle-bags/\">best saddle bags</a> will free up room in your pockets, and mean you can leave the tools attached to your bike so you will never forget them when going out for a ride.</p>\n<h3>Bike computer</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"GPS bike computer mounted on\" title=\"Garmin Edge 530 data fields\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Bike computers can help you navigate.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matthew Allen / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>You don’t need a bike computer to start using your new road bike, but many riders quickly realise their value and how they can enhance your time spent on the bike.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-computers/\">best bike computers</a> will provide information such as your speed while you ride, help you navigate, create a record of your rides if you’re starting to train, and give you the data to upload your rides to apps such as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/strava-tips-20-of-the-best/\">Strava</a>.</p>\n<p>If you want to get really nerdy, then a bike computer can record and display data from other sensors such as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/gadgets/heart-rate-monitors/\">heart rate monitors</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-power-meters/\">power meters</a>, if you have these.</p>","author":"Jack Luke","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"719f10a47d57e72ddf314ed2dce9f5f035b085b76c2bb39507916f8468b5fa71","category":"Cycling"}
