The latest trailer shows the good Doctor reunited with his former companion Donna Noble (Catherine Tate) and facing off against two classic adversaries from the Whovian archives: an alien race called the Meeps and a celestial being known as The Toymaker, played by Neil Patrick Harris.</p>\n<p><strong>(Spoilers below for prior seasons of <em>Doctor Who</em>.)</strong></p>\n<p>When the BBC announced that Ncuti Gatwa would succeed <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/12/doctor-who-wraps-a-solid-season-with-its-first-female-time-lord/\">Jodie Whittaker's Thirteenth Doctor</a> as the new incarnation of <em>Doctor Who</em>, fans naturally expected Gatwa to make his first appearance in the traditional regeneration sequence.

It was a savvy marketing move, given the enormous popularity of Tennant's Doctor. With showrunner Chris Chibnall stepping down and Russell T. Davies re-assuming the reins for the show's 60th anniversary, what better time to revisit that character, along with my personal favorite of the companions, Donna Noble?</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1970740#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1970740&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2fdc393eba9a1bc606ae791827125d248676e810343f4ea0a4614f454385d5d4","category":"Tech"}
