You will learn about AWS Serverless technologies and event-driven architectures from customers, experts, and leaders.</p> \n<p>AWS Serverless Innovation Day is an event to empower builders and technical decision-makers with different AWS Serverless technologies, including <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/\">AWS Lambda</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/\">Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)</a> with <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/\">AWS Fargate</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge\">Amazon EventBridge</a>, and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions\">AWS Step Functions</a>. The talks of the day will cover three key topics: event-driven architectures, serverless containers, and serverless functions, and how they can be utilized to build and modernize applications. Application modernization is a priority for organizations this year, and serverless helps to increase the software delivery speed and reduce the total cost of ownership.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/05/08/Site-Merch_Innovation-Day_Serverless_Console-Sign-In.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/05/08/Site-Merch_Innovation-Day_Serverless_Console-Sign-In.png\" alt=\"AWS Serverless Innovation Day\" width=\"570\" height=\"450\" /></a></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/singledigit/\" target=\"_blank\">Eric Johnson</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jldeen/\" target=\"_blank\">Jessica Deen</a> will be the hosts for the event. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/holly-mesrobian-a1b710/\" target=\"_blank\">Holly Mesrobian</a>, VP of Serverless Compute at AWS, will deliver the welcome keynote and share AWS’s vision for Serverless.
