That way you won’t be able to see any Beta updates, and won’t be tempted to install them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To leave the iOS 17 beta program, follow these steps on your iPhone: </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remove your device from the iOS beta program. </p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Sign in. </li><li>Click Leave Program. </li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If you ever decide you want back into the beta program–like when the iOS 18 public beta arrives, for instance, you can head over to the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram&amp;xcust=1-1-1067004-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple Beta Software Program site</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671198/how-to-install-ios-beta.html\">re-enroll your device</a>.

But now that your iPhone has a stable release of a shiny new operating system, you might not want to keep up with the betas anymore. It is easy to stop getting beta updates and just use the final version.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Open Settings. </li><li>Tap on General. </li><li>Tap on Software Update.</li><li>Tap on Beta Updates. </li><li>Tap on Off. </li><li>Tap on Back. </li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you’ll only receive software updates when Apple pushes them to the general public, roughly once every six weeks. You can still see that there is a beta update, but your iPhone won’t volunteer to download them unless you switch Beta Updates back on by following the steps above.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to remove a Beta Profile </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to iOS 16.3, the process for removing an iOS beta was different. </p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Head over to the Settings app.</li><li>Tap General. </li><li>Tap on VPN &amp; Device Management. </li><li>Select the iOS Beta Software Profile that appears. </li><li>Tap Remove Profile. </li><li>Enter your device password.</li><li>Tap Remove a second time to confirm. </li><li>The iPhone will now need to restart.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>We also cover <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673127/how-to-remove-macos-beta-from-a-mac.html\">How to remove macOS beta from a Mac</a>.</p>\n\niOS</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"2d1d297b21f6af9cee2fd0b1cb7dcc55e02b9222e6c5de99175fdbb3cd8a348f","category":"Apple"}
