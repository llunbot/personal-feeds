With the 10th anniversary of the ‌iPhone‌, Apple unveiled the all-display ‌iPhone‌ X with no bezels at the top or the bottom for the camera or the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a> home button. It marked the debut of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/\">Face ID</a>, and dictated the next decade of ‌iPhone‌ design.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/All-Screen-iPhone-2027-Feature-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nFor the \"‌iPhone‌ XX,\" Apple needs to do even better, and rumors suggest that the company has some big ideas that it's aiming for.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple wants to create an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/12/20th-anniversary-iphone-all-screen-design/\">all-glass iPhone</a> that doesn't have cutouts in the display, so there could be a high-end ‌iPhone‌ 19 Pro model that fulfills that requirement. Apple wants a true <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/03/20th-anniversary-iphone-all-screen-report/\">edge-to-edge display</a>\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Design</h2>\r<br />\nThe 20th anniversary ‌iPhone‌ that Apple is planning for 2027 could feature a radical design, offering a display that has no visible frame or bezels. An early rumor suggests that Apple is aiming for a display that curves around all four edges of the device, for a borderless visual experience.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/Beyond-iPhone-13-Better-Triad.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nApple wants a mostly glass ‌iPhone‌ with a curved display and no cutouts, which would necessitate under-display ‌Face ID‌ and an under-display camera.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAn all-glass ‌iPhone‌ with a wraparound display that covers all four edges of the device would be less durable than current ‌iPhone‌ models that have titanium or aluminum frames, so Apple may need to come up with more durable glass before such a device is a possibility.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Battery</h2>\r<br />\nApple is developing <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/14/2027-iphone-game-changing-silicon-battery/\">new battery technology</a> that could make it into the 2027 ‌iPhone‌ models. Apple is looking into using pure silicon anode batteries, which are able to store more lithium ions per gram than current batteries, resulting in significant increases in battery life without major increases in battery size.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>RAM</h2>\r<br />\nApple could use advanced AI memory technology for the 2027 ‌iPhone‌ models. Apple is rumored to be considering Mobile High Bandwidth Memory (HBM), a type of DRAM that stacks memory chips vertically and connects them through tiny vertical interconnects to boost signal transmission speeds.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn smartphones, the technology would provide high data throughput while minimizing power consumption and the physical footprint of RAM dies.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Name</h2>\r<br />\nTechnically, the 20th anniversary ‌iPhone‌ lineup would be the ‌iPhone‌ 19 lineup, but in 2017, Apple released a surprise \"‌iPhone‌ X\" alongside the ‌iPhone‌ 8 models. This year, Apple could have similar plans for the high-end device, though what it might be called is unclear.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple could decide to call it the ‌iPhone‌ 20, like the decision it made for the ‌iPhone‌ X in 2017, or the company could stick with the ‌iPhone‌ 19 naming. Alternatively, the all-display device could have an entirely new name, like <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-ultra/\">iPhone Ultra</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌iPhone‌ that Apple has planned could be a replacement for the ‌iPhone‌ Pro models, or it could be sold alongside them. With plans for a foldable ‌iPhone‌ in 2026, though, it may not make sense to add yet another phone to the lineup.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Launch Date</h2>\r<br />\nThe 20th anniversary ‌iPhone‌ would presumably come out in the fall of 2027.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/20th-anniversary-iphone/\">Apple's 20th Anniversary iPhone: What We Know So Far</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-20th-anniversary-iphone-what-we-know-so-far.2457232/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"91d745cd62bfe7d7f8363f98233216f9067bce7360259a68cd9d05fe879dec25","category":"Apple"}
