When you open up a new Safari tab and then tap into the search field, Safari shows your recent search history.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/ios-18-4-safari-search.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nIn iOS 18.3.1, opening up a new tab and then tapping into search does not show your history, and the view remains on the personalized Safari home page. iOS 18.3.1 has no clear view of prior searches at all, except that a recent search will show up in your suggested results if you search for the same thing again.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs noted by <em><a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2025/02/25/ios-184-makes-your-safari-search-history-way-more-visible/\">9to5Mac</a></em>, having Safari search so visible may not always be desirable if you're ever in a situation where you hand your <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> over to someone else to let them use Safari or another app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOf course, if you don't ever let anyone use your devices, having recent search available at a tap has the potential to be useful if you're often using the same search terms multiple times. Apple also offers a Private browsing mode where searches are not saved.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere is no setting in iOS 18.4 to disable the recent search view, but Apple may opt to tweak the feature before the beta sees a public launch. Users can also opt to clear their search history at any time with the \"Clear All\" option.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari/\">Safari</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/26/ios-18-4-safari-search-history/\">iOS 18.4 Shows Your Search History in New Safari Tabs</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-4-shows-your-search-history-in-new-safari-tabs.2450242/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8b6ac35d7e6dfa649a4eb38212071dd480ccc522b59994d9370941bae5c69f73","category":"Apple"}
