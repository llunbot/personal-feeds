{"title":"All Meta Ray-Ban Smart Glasses Users Get Live Translation, Live AI Coming Soon","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/23/meta-ray-ban-live-translation/","date":1745446620000,"content":"Meta <a href=\"https://www.meta.com/blog/ray-ban-ai-glasses-skyler-wayfarers-live-translation-instagram-direct/\">today announced</a> that it is rolling out a new live translation feature to all Ray-Ban Meta glasses users, providing wide access to functionality that was previously only available to early access users in a beta capacity.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/meta-ray-bans.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1724\" height=\"970\" />\r<br />\nLive translation supports English, French, Italian, and Spanish, allowing users to translate between those languages in real-time while having a conversation. As long as a particular language pack has been downloaded in advance, no Wi-Fi or cellular connection is required to use the feature.\r<br />\n<blockquote>When you're speaking to someone in one of those languages, you'll hear what they say in your preferred language through the glasses in real time, and they can view a translated transcript of the conversation on your phone. To get started, just say, \"Hey Meta, start live translation.\"</blockquote>\r<br />\nLive translate will translate what the person speaking in another language is saying, while responses can be seen on a connected smartphone.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn the near future, Meta plans to introduce live AI, a feature where the Meta smart glasses can see whatever the wearer sees through the built-in camera, allowing for real-time AI conversations.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMeta says the glasses will be able to provide hands-free help with meal prep, gardening, exploring, and more. Questions can be asked without the need to say a wake word, and the AI can understand context between requests for referencing prior queries.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMeta's smart glasses should be of interest to Apple users because they provide some insight into what we might see from Apple in the future. Rumors suggest that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/apple-still-exploring-smart-glasses-meta-ray-bans/\">Apple is considering</a> developing smart glasses that are similar to Meta's Ray-Bans. Apple glasses could feature AI, microphones, and cameras, though there wouldn't be augmented reality capabilities.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/meta/\">Meta</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/23/meta-ray-ban-live-translation/\">All Meta Ray-Ban Smart Glasses Users Get Live Translation, Live AI Coming Soon</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/all-meta-ray-ban-smart-glasses-users-get-live-translation-live-ai-coming-soon.2455852/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ba50166c00e75714c47c92d38ff66ce38c3fa4fe2c40f85d8b2c0ca67b1f9da1","category":"Apple"}
