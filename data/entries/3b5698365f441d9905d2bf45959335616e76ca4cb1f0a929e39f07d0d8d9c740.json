{"title":"Apple Announces New Fee Structure and Updated Guidelines for Apps in the EU That Link Out to the Web for Purchases","link":"https://9to5mac.com/2024/08/08/apple-app-store-eu-link-out-changes/","date":1723171111000,"content":"\n<p>Benjamin Mayo, writing at 9to5Mac:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Following the <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2024/06/24/apple-anti-steering-europe-breach-dma/\">EU ruling in June that said</a> Apple’s App\nStore anti-steering policies are officially in breach of the\nDigital Markets Act, Apple is announcing changes. Specifically,\nthese changes address the rules around app developers linking\nout to the web to inform users about alternative payment\nmethods. [...]</p>\n\n<p>If you are operating under the EU alternative business terms, the\nCore Technology Fee still applies on installs. Additionally, the\nfees are charged as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Initial Acquisition Fee: 5%</li>\n<li>Store Services Fee: 10% (reduced to 5% for members of the App\nStore Small Business Program, or a qualifying renewal of a\nsubscription after one year)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you are continuing to offer your app inside the App Store under\nthe standard business terms, the Core Technology Fee does not\napply (as it never did). But the associated link out commission\nfee rates are increased:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Initial Acquisition Fee: 5%</li>\n<li>Store Services Fee: 20% (reduced to 7% for members of the App\nStore Small Business Program, or a qualifying renewal of a\nsubscription after one year)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This results in a complicated matrix of eligibility and fee costs,\nthat developers will need to carefully evaluate. The new terms are\navailable now to review on Apple’s developer website, including an\nupdated fee calculator.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>“Complicated matrix of eligibility and fee costs” is an understatement. Understanding all of this seems like it requires a CPA. I’ve looked across social media and read a slew of posts about this news, and I haven’t found a single person saying anything other than this is a convoluted mess. I think that’s as much on the DMA as it is on Apple: a convoluted mess of a compliance plan for a convoluted mess of a law.</p>\n\n<p>What many people want is for Apple just give in, concede, and allow iOS apps in the EU to just collect payments however they want, in-app or through links to the web, freely. Where by <em>freely</em> I mean free-of-charge freely. No CTF for downloads, no tracking up purchases made after users tap a link in the app to the web. What Apple wants is to continue making bank from every purchase on digital good from an iOS app. We’re left with a mess where no one is happy with the result.</p>\n\n<p><strong>See also:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.techmeme.com/240808/p30#a240808p30\">Techmeme’s roundup of news coverage</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mjtsai.com/blog/2024/08/08/dma-compliance-initial-acquisition-and-store-services-fees/\">Michael Tsai’s roundup of commentary</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/08/08/apple-eu-new-fee-for-apps-that-link-out\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"3b5698365f441d9905d2bf45959335616e76ca4cb1f0a929e39f07d0d8d9c740","category":"Tech"}
