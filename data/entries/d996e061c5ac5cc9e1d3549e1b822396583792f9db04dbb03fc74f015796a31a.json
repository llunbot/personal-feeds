The new Series 7 also sports improved IP6X certification for dust resistance in addition to WR50 water resistance. The new watch, however, keeps the same CPU as the Series 6. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Series 7 comes in five aluminum case finishes, including a refined blue case, (PRODUCT)RED, midnight, starlight, and green. Stainless steel options in silver, graphite, and gold stainless steel alongside \"Apple Watch Edition\" in titanium and black titanium will also be available. The Series 7 starts at $399 and joins the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/\">Apple Watch SE</a> and the Apple Watch Series 3 in the lineup. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nTo learn more about the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌, including on whether you should upgrade or not, be sure to check out our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">comprehensive roundup</a>.  <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 7</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/04/apple-watch-series-7-pre-orders/\">Apple Watch Series 7 Pre-Orders to Start This Friday, Available on October 15</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-series-7-pre-orders-to-start-this-friday-available-on-october-15.2315310/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=olZFX_samdY:4uqZjpqIhgg:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=olZFX_samdY:4uqZjpqIhgg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/olZFX_samdY\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d996e061c5ac5cc9e1d3549e1b822396583792f9db04dbb03fc74f015796a31a","category":"Apple"}
