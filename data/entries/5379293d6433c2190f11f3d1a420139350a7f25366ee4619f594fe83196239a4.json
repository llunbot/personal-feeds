Google says that it provides a more streamlined, flexible way to work. There is a split view icon in Chrome that can be clicked to enter the new view.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith PDF annotations, the Chrome PDF Viewer can be used to highlight text, insert signatures, and add notes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Save to Google Drive feature is meant to make it easier for users to locate their downloads. PDFs can be saved to Google Drive from Chrome without redownloading and re-uploading them.
