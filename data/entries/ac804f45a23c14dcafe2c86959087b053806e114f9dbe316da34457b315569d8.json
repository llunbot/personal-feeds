Apple added that it has continually made improvements to iPhone battery components and its power management system.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis revelation means that it could take longer for the maximum battery capacity of iPhone 15 models to decline to 80% compared to previous iPhone models. However, Apple said it is \"investigating\" the battery lifespans of older iPhone models, so a comparison based on the latest testing parameters remains to be seen.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn its support document, Apple says the battery lifespan of any iPhone model ultimately depends on how the device is regularly used and charged.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo view an iPhone's battery capacity, open the Settings app and tap Battery â†’ Battery Health &amp; Charging. On iPhone 15 models updated to the latest iOS 17.4 beta, the menu is now simply called Battery Health and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/ios-17-4-iphone-15-battery/\">shows more info at a glance</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis news was <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2024/02/20/iphone-15-battery-lifescyle-span/\">first reported by <em>9to5Mac</em></a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15\">iPhone 15 (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro\">iPhone 15 Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/apple-raises-iphone-15-advertised-battery-lifespan/\">Apple Increases iPhone 15's Advertised Battery Lifespan</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-increases-iphone-15s-advertised-battery-lifespan.2419999/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ac804f45a23c14dcafe2c86959087b053806e114f9dbe316da34457b315569d8","category":"Apple"}
