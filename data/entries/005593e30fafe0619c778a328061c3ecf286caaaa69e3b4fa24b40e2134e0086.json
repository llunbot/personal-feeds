Its T1000 material has extremely high tensile strength and is used in high-stress areas of the rim, such as along the face of its nipple seats.</p>\n<p>The rims are decked out with smart and understated gloss black decals. After being applied, the water transfer decals undergo heat treatment.</p>\n<p>This eliminates a step between the rim and the decal, and increases wear resistance, according to Miche.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Miche Kleos RD wheelsets\" title=\"Miche Kleos RD - closeup - 01\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Unlike many contemporary road bike wheelsets, Miche has stuck with a hooked bead.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Miche</i></span></div>\n<p>Miche has opted to use a retention hook, which meets ETRTO (European Tyre and Rim Technical Organisation) standards for rim and tyre compatibility. This broadens the wheels’ compatibility to all commercially available tubeless and clincher tyres, according to Miche.</p>\n<p>The brand claims that due to the high speeds and relatively high tyre pressures used in road wheels, a hooked bead is the safest technology.</p>\n<p>They are recommended for use with tyres from 25 to 28mm, with 28mm being aerodynamically optimal, and have a maximum pressure rating of 109psi.</p>\n<h3>Hubs</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Miche Kleos RD wheelsets\" title=\"Miche Kleos RD 50 - closeup - 04\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Miche manufacturers its own hubs.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Miche</i></span></div>\n<p>The wheelsets in the Kleos range use all-new Miche hubs.</p>\n<p>These are manufactured using heat-treated 7075 aluminium alloy, with a titanium pawl carrier to save weight and aid durability. The hubs use three pawls and have 30 points of engagement.</p>\n<p>Freehub bodies to fit Campagnolo N3W, Shimano and SRAM XDR are available.</p>\n<p>The Kleos RD hubs utilise bearings from CeramicSpeed, designed to boost smoothness and durability.</p>\n<p>The brand has opted for 30mm and 26mm OD bearings, which are claimed to balance speed and durability. The regular (non-RD) Kleos hubs will use EZO bearings.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Miche Kleos RD wheelsets\" title=\"Miche Kleos RD 50 - closeup - 03\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This shroud is claimed to improve aero performance.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Miche</i></span></div>\n<p>Both front and rear hubs feature an adjustment ring nut, which enables hub-bearing preload to be finely adjusted. This should result in improved hub-bearing life.</p>\n<p>They are serviceable using a 2mm hex key to remove the adjustment nut and a 12mm hex key within the axle.</p>\n<p>The front wheels use what Miche calls ‘Aero-Blade technology’. This shield covers the spoke ends on the disc side of the wheel, which the brand claims reduces aerodynamic performance at low yaw angles.</p>\n<p>As with the rims, these new hubs are designed and manufactured at the Miche factory.</p>\n<h3>Spokes and build</h3>\n<p>Every wheel in the Kleos range is built using 24 straight-pull spokes in a 2:1 lacing pattern.</p>\n<p>This sees 16 spokes laced in a 3x pattern on the driveside of the rear wheel and the disc side of the front wheel. This is paired with eight spokes laced in a radial pattern on the lower-load non-driveside rear and driveside front.</p>\n<p>This is a widely adopted pattern, which is intended to improve the wheels’ stiffness-to-weight ratio.</p>\n<p>The spokes themselves are custom-made by Belgian manufacturer Sapim to meet Miche’s specific design. They are straight-pull, double-butted and feature a bladed profile that differs from front to rear for claimed aerodynamic improvement.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Miche Kleos RD wheelsets\" title=\"Miche Kleos RD 62 - closeup - 02\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Miche sources its spokes from Sapim.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Miche</i></span></div>\n<p>The spokes are mated to the rims using Ergal 7075 aluminium nipples, which are said to provide a modest weight saving over the alternatives.</p>\n<p>The Kleos RD Range makes it clear Miche is serious about rejuvenating and stepping up its high-performance offering.</p>\n<p>The brand describes the Kleos RD wheels as “the first steps in a new dimension that combines past know-how with today’s technology.”</p>","author":"Rob Borek","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"005593e30fafe0619c778a328061c3ecf286caaaa69e3b4fa24b40e2134e0086","category":"Cycling"}
