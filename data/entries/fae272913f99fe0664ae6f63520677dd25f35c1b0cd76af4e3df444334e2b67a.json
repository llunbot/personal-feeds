The next in line may be LG.</p>\n<p>On October 18, a <a href=\"https://launchstudio.bluetooth.com/ListingDetails/136524\">filing</a> was listed with the Bluetooth SIG, the special interest group that awards Bluetooth certifications, for an \"LG Chromebook.\" The listing, spotted by <a href=\"https://chromeunboxed.com/be-still-my-heart-lg-just-entered-the-chromebook-game\">Chrome Unboxed</a>, doesn't give us much further information. The device's model number is \"11TC50Q,\" and the machine should have some version of Bluetooth 5.</p>\n<p>Without any official word from LG, we can't be sure that the product exists. But since the company went through the effort of getting Bluetooth certification from Bluetooth SIG, an LG-branded Chromebook is far from a pipe dream. Plus, it would make sense for LG to release a Chromebook.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1807131#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1807131&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fae272913f99fe0664ae6f63520677dd25f35c1b0cd76af4e3df444334e2b67a","category":"Tech"}
