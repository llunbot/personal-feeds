Now, the app will recognize the Wireless Blip buttons on their own, and the only other component required is an AXS rear derailleur to serve as the “parent” component.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/sram-wireless-blips-mounting-on-aero-bars.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"847\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/sram-wireless-blips-mounting-on-aero-bars.jpg\" alt=\"sram wireless blips on a triathlon bike handlebar\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/sram-wireless-blips-mounting-on-aero-bars.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/sram-wireless-blips-mounting-on-aero-bars-297x140.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/sram-wireless-blips-mounting-on-aero-bars-800x376.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/sram-wireless-blips-mounting-on-aero-bars-120x56.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/sram-wireless-blips-mounting-on-aero-bars-768x361.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/sram-wireless-blips-mounting-on-aero-bars-1536x723.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This opens up easier customization of shifter layouts, particularly for triathlon and TT bikes that previously had to hide a BlipBox somewhere in or on the bike. You can pair up to eight on a single bike, giving you plenty of shift location options.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/stoll-r1-superlight-carbon-hardtail-sram-axs-blip-shifter.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/stoll-r1-superlight-carbon-hardtail-sram-axs-blip-shifter.jpg\" alt=\"stoll r1 superlight carbon hardtail 5.9 kg sram etap axs blip shifter\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/stoll-r1-superlight-carbon-hardtail-sram-axs-blip-shifter.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/stoll-r1-superlight-carbon-hardtail-sram-axs-blip-shifter-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/stoll-r1-superlight-carbon-hardtail-sram-axs-blip-shifter-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/stoll-r1-superlight-carbon-hardtail-sram-axs-blip-shifter-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/stoll-r1-superlight-carbon-hardtail-sram-axs-blip-shifter-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/stoll-r1-superlight-carbon-hardtail-sram-axs-blip-shifter-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/stoll-r1-superlight-carbon-hardtail-sram-axs-blip-shifter-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Mountain bikers can also use it to streamline their cockpit, as long as they don’t need it to control the Reverb AXS dropper. The Wireless Blips are still unable to send a continuous signal with a long press, so they won’t work for the dropper or with Multi-shift.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They retail for $99/pair and come with mounting brackets for drop bars. The Wireless Blips are not rechargeable and need to be recycled with other electronics when they stop working. SRAM estimates their battery life at up to two years, with more frequent riders likely getting a little over a year out of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.sram.com/en/sram/models/ec-blip-b1\" target=\"_blank\">SRAM.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/sram-wireless-blips-can-now-be-paired-w-o-shifters/\">SRAM Wireless Blips Can Now be Paired w/o Shifters</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"8aefec8a7e57f249845872156454473cf38adcf0b8486660572115670607d10b","category":"Cycling"}
