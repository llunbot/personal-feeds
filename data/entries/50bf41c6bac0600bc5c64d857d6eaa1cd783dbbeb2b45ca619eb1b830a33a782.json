Goyer took on the monumental task of adapting Isaac Asimov's hugely influential <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series\"><em>Foundation</em> series</a> of science fiction novels for Apple TV+, he knew it would not be a straightforward matter. As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/09/review-more-remix-than-adaptation-foundation-is-top-notch-storytelling/\">I've written previously,</a> the author himself admitted that he wrote strictly for the printed page, and he always refused invitations to adapt his work for film or TV.</p>\n<p>But Asimov was more than happy to let others adapt his work to a new medium, and he was wise enough to expect that there would—and should—be significant departures from the print version.

To my mind, he did it beautifully, producing more of a remix than a straight adaptation that is compelling and powerful in its own right.</p>\n<p>Another challenge was figuring out how to incorporate science and technology that was reasonably accurate. An astrobiologist and planetary scientist at Jet Propulsion Lab, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Hand\">Kevin Hand</a> had worked with Goyer years before on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krypton_(TV_series)\"><em>Krypton</em></a>, and the two had stayed in touch. So when Goyer needed a scientist with expertise in space, interstellar travel, and planetary dynamics, among other topics, naturally he turned to Hand.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1813890#p3\">Read 28 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1813890&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"50bf41c6bac0600bc5c64d857d6eaa1cd783dbbeb2b45ca619eb1b830a33a782","category":"Tech"}
