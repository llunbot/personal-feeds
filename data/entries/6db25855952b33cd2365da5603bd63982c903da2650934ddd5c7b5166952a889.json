The vote to confirm Gomez was 55-43 and went mostly along party lines.</p>\n<p>Biden's first nominee was Gigi Sohn, a longtime consumer advocate who drew united opposition from Republicans and doubts from more conservative Democrats. Sohn <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/03/bidens-fcc-pick-withdraws-regrets-that-isps-get-to-choose-their-regulators/\">withdrew</a> her nomination in March 2023, blaming the cable lobby and \"unlimited dark money\" for scuttling her appointment. The Senate never scheduled a floor vote on Sohn.</p>\n<p>Biden tried again in May with the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/05/biden-chooses-new-fcc-commissioner-hopes-senate-wont-reject-this-one-too/\">nomination of Gomez</a>, a State Department digital policy official who was previously deputy assistant secretary at the US National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) from 2009 to 2023. A lawyer, Gomez was vice president of government affairs at Sprint Nextel from 2006 to 2009 and before that spent about 12 years at the FCC in several roles.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1966305#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1966305&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6db25855952b33cd2365da5603bd63982c903da2650934ddd5c7b5166952a889","category":"Tech"}
