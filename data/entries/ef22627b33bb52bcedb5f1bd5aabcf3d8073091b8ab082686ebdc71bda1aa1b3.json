But getting wider context on those numbers is a bit difficult because of how Microsoft reports its Xbox sales numbers (i.e., only in terms of quarterly changes in total console hardware revenue). Comparing those annual shifts to the unit sales numbers that Nintendo and Sony report every quarter is not exactly simple.</p>\n<h2>Context clues</h2>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/xbox-quarterly.001.png\"><img alt=\"Significant declines in Xbox hardware revenue for four of the last five quarters stand out relative to competitors' unit sales.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/xbox-quarterly.001-640x480.png\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/xbox-quarterly.001.png 2x\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/xbox-quarterly.001.png\">Significant declines in Xbox hardware revenue for four of the last five quarters stand out relative to competitors' unit sales.</a> (credit: Kyle Orland)</p></div>\n<p>To attempt some direct contextual comparison, we took unit sales numbers for some recent successful Sony and Nintendo consoles and converted them to Microsoft-style year-over-year percentage changes (aligned with the launch date for each console). For this analysis, we skipped over each console's launch quarter, which contains less than three months of total sales (and often includes a lot of pent-up early adopter demand). We also skipped the first four quarters of a console's life cycle, which don't have a year-over-year comparison point from 12 months prior.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020342#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020342&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ef22627b33bb52bcedb5f1bd5aabcf3d8073091b8ab082686ebdc71bda1aa1b3","category":"Tech"}
