The answer has far-reaching implications, as plate tectonics affected everything from the supply of vital nutrients for early life to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/05/the-complicated-history-of-how-the-earths-atmosphere-became-breathable/\">the rise of oxygen</a>. We know Earth’s interior was hotter early in its history, but did plates <a href=\"https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsa/geology/article-abstract/20/11/963/205630/On-the-emergence-of-plate-tectonics\">move faster</a> because the hotter mantle was squishier, or did the hotter mantle <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2003GL016982\">contain less water</a>, which helps mantle minerals flow, slowing plates down?</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301926823001547\">new study</a>, led by Dr. Jennifer Kasbohm of Yale, measured ancient magnetic fields and dated rocks from Western Australia to show that the “Pilbara Craton”—an early continent—moved at quite a clip around 2.7 billion years ago. While today’s fastest plate motion is <a href=\"https://tectonics.rice.edu/calculators/hs3.html\">around 12 cm</a> (4.7 inches) per year, the Pilbara Craton moved as much as 64 centimeters (25 inches) per year.</p>\n<h2>A rare remnant of early Earth</h2>\n<p>In the Archean eon, a time far closer to the formation of our Solar System than to today, basalt oozed over what would later be Western Australia in much the same way it does in <a href=\"https://www.visiticeland.com/article/volcano-info\">Iceland</a> and <a href=\"https://www.usgs.gov/volcanoes/kilauea/news/photo-and-video-chronology-kilauea-august-1-2018\">Hawaii</a> today. Plate tectonics was still <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adf0693\">relatively</a> <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.2012626118\">new</a>, and continents were in the early stages of emerging from what had largely been a <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022RG000789\">water world</a>. The air was devoid of oxygen, and the most advanced life came in the form of microbial communities that are preserved today in hummocky fossils known as “<a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/images/pia24240-tumbiana-stromatolite\">stromatolites</a>.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1961150#p3\">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1961150&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Howard Lee","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"85fd89c64aa60c3eb3a2b81dc6da9321abbd0aca894d0693f460172214bb65d9","category":"Tech"}
