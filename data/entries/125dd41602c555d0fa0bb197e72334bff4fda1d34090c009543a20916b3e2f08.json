But we’ve never seen them as low as this: <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/321564/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-2nd-Generation/604342441&amp;subid1=1-1-2131303-1-0-0\">Walmart has slashed the price on the 2nd-gen AirPods to $69</a>, a savings of $60 and a ridiculously good deal. (<em>Note: You need to be a Walmart+ member to get this deal until 3pm ET.</em>)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple updated its AirPods in 2021 with a 3rd-generation model, but the 2 nd-gen AirPods are still excellent earbuds. They come with a wired case and have Siri on board, tap controls, and 24-hour battery life when used with the wired charging case. The 3rd-gen model has a new design with shorter stems, better battery life, and spatial audio support, but costs $179—for that much more, we think the 2nd-gen model is perfectly fine</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Black Friday season is just getting started, but we doubt we’ll see a price any better than this. So if you want a pair, go grab one right now.</p>\n\nHeadphones</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"125dd41602c555d0fa0bb197e72334bff4fda1d34090c009543a20916b3e2f08","category":"Apple"}
