Where earlier we were surrounded by glowing high-rises, Mauricio’s house teeters alone on a 2,400m precipice in the pitch dark, the only light an occasional flash from a thunderstorm so far away it can’t be heard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like all riders in a country that loves cycling nearly as much as it loves football, this slight man, with a smile nearly as wide as he is tall, is a legend. At his peak Mauricio won the Tour of Britain, rode for Rabobank and nearly joined US Postal (he was rejected because his haematocrit levels were deemed too low), and during that time he had the foresight to build this house and guesthouse, the Casa del Ciclista, which is our base.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-02-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Colombia\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-02-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-02-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-02-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-02-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-02-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-02-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>At first Mauricio would come here – nearest town Santa Elena – with countryman Rigoberto Urán to train between European races. Later Egan Bernal and Esteban Chaves would do the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides me and Ben, who runs PiCO cycle tours and who will ride with me tomorrow, Mauricio has two other guests staying tonight: young pros Dylan and Thomas, who have stayed on after the Tour of Colombia that finished just last week. (They are Swiss, however, so coincidence and Welsh poets are lost on them.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That means tonight is a drinking night, and Mauricio has opened ‘a very special 30-year-old rum’ that could well strip enamel from a radiator, and certainly prompts the ex-pro into regaling several stories in Spanish, which Ben translates for me.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-03-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Colombia\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-03-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-03-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-03-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-03-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-03-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-03-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>A slashed tyre forces us into an impromptu bike shop stop in Las Palmas.</figcaption><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘He says Paolo Savoldelli gave him $25,000 to help him win the Giro in 2005, even though they were on different teams.

Sure enough, it’s the penultimate stage on the gravelly Colle delle Finestre and there’s all 58kg of Mauricio, nursing a knackered-looking Paolo Savoldelli through chalk clouds kicked up by the motorbikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Savoldelli is unmistakeable in pink emblazoned with the logos of the Discovery Channel; Mauricio is in the red of his team Davitamon-Lotto. Apparently the pay-off was all above board because the teams’ sporting directors were old friends.</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>At any rate, that kind of money went a long way in Colombia, enough to buy the land and the buildings we’re in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That Spinergy-wheeled bike now seems quite apt, an embodiment of the meeting of well-heeled Europeans with the realities of a country where bikes mostly mean transport, not professional contracts.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-04-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Colombia\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-04-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-04-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-04-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-04-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-04-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-04-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-04.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Despite being just 20km from Medellín, the tranquillity around Santa Elena couldn’t be further away from the bustle of the jungle metropolis.</figcaption><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>In the morning, there is a case to say my head is a touch sore, but I refuse to make it, and neither does Nena, who runs a nearby restaurant and who has come over to make us breakfast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It consists of fried plantain, fruit salad and what I soon learn is an accompaniment to virtually every meal in Colombia, avocado.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The coffee – or <i>tinto</i> – is strong and acrid but not unpleasant, albeit a far cry from the proudly touted ‘Colombian single origin’ flat whites of London.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-05-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Colombia\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-05-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-05-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-05-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-05-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-05-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-05-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-05-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-05.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>The road from Las Palmas south towards La Ceja is generally well surfaced, occasionally curved and, happily, mostly downhill.</figcaption><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Ben, a Londoner himself once upon a time, explains that while Colombians love coffee even more than they love football and bikes (a hierarchy is emerging here), this is about as good as it gets, a combination of ‘sending the best stuff’ overseas and <i>tintos</i> being a matter of practicality not speciality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outside, condensation has gathered on our bikes, their metal frames cold to the touch.

It’s 7km long at a steady 5% and is something the Colombian veteran does three times on a ride: first at high cadence, second at sustained power and third all out.

Apparently <i>El Patrón</i> rather enjoyed rally-racing his Renault 4.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-16-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Colombia\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-16-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-16-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-16-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-16-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-16-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-16-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-16-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-16-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-16.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>We arrive at the foot of a languid climb back up to Santa Elena, where the road splits. Evidently the old road was deemed too slow for cars, so a tunnel was built through the mountainside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Motor vehicles are siphoned off to leave the old road for the exclusive use of cyclists. It’s all uphill but it’s a tremendously happy uphill, the birds chirruping in the trees, the scent of warm wood and steaming leaves wafting through the air like a natural spa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it is with a sense of disappointment that we reach a crossroads familiar to me from this morning. This points to the end of the ride, and I now realise that today, for the first time, I’ve climbed to nearly 2,600m and I’m not totally breathless.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-17-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Colombia\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-17-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-17-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-17-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-17-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-17-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-17-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-17-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-17-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-17.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Road-side stalls are a common sight, as are little food trucks selling freshly made cornmeal cakes called arepas.</figcaption><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>How great it would be to continue. But Nena has opened her restaurant especially for us and then, to seal the deal, Ben’s bike makes a <i>ping</i> followed by a <i>tink tink tink tink tink</i> – he’s broken a spoke.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We bend the spoke around its neighbour to stop it hitting the frame, loosen the brake slightly so it doesn’t rub and pedal gingerly for home. The slow pace suits the mood, giving us plenty of time to savour the last drops of this unique ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Bring me food</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Because a rider’s got to eat</em></p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-18-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Colombia\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-18-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-18-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-18-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-18-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-18-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-18-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-18-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-18-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-18.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Our host Nena serves up a typical Colombian dish, bandeja paisa, which is plenty to refuel even the hungriest rider.</figcaption><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h3>On the go</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Colombia loves a carbie treat, so saddle up with <i>arepas</i>, cornmeal cakes that resemble an English muffin, and which are often found sizzling away on roadside grills. They come in different forms, but topped with <i>carne</i> (whatever meat is going) or stuffed with cheese – <i>arepas de queso</i> – are among the best. Another favourite with cyclists here is <i>pastel de arequipe</i>, a fried puff-pastry turnover stuffed with the soft toffee <i>dulce de leche</i>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Restaurants</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Good food comes in many forms, from truck-stop grills to picturesque spots overlooking vast country valleys, such as Mirador de Nena. They all serve the <i>menú del día</i> (menu of the day) from noon, and in general you’ll find two options: <i>sencillo</i> (simple), a main plate comprising fish or meat and a host of sides, or <i>ejecutivo</i> (executive), a main plate plus soup and a drink. Prices are incredibly cheap – expect to pay £2-£5 and to leave feeling full.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The rider’s ride</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Scarab Letras, approx £2,700 (£2,000 frameset), <a href=\"https://www.scarabcycles.com/letras\" target=\"_blank\">scarabcycles.com</a></em></p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-19-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Colombia\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-19-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-19-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-19-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-19-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-19-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-19-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-19-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-19-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-19.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>You’d be hard pushed to find a more exclusive bike. Scarab Cycles is one of only two Colombian-based framebuilders, and produces a relative handful of bikes per year. But what it does produce are beautifully brazed steel frames such as this, the Letras, named after what Colombians argue is the longest climb on Earth (we reckon it to be the longest <i>continuously paved</i> climb), the Alto de Letras: 80.7km long up to 3,650m and comprising an aggregate ascent of 3,800m.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of Scarab’s lightest all-steel bikes, with a claimed frame weight of 1.6kg. With a mishmash of Shimano and Sram parts that speak to the frame’s shop-demo life, the whole thing is just over 8kg. But what it lost out in grams, it made up for in ride quality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of Colombia’s roads are like plate glass, while others resemble the floor of a Greek wedding, so the springy nature of the Columbus Spirit and Kaisei tubing (the latter a Japanese company) was a fine trade-off. The Letras was a quietly confident partner I would happily dance with again, albeit I would opt for something different to the school-uniform grey. The frameset price includes custom geometry and custom paint, and these guys can turn out some <i>maravillas</i> (that’s Spanish for ‘humdingers’, I think).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How we did it</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-20-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Colombia\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-20-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-20-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-20-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-20-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-20-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-20-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-20-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-20-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/colombia-big-ride-20.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h3>Travel</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><i>Cyclist</i> flew to Medellín with Avianca on a 14-hour flight from Heathrow with a short stop in Bogotá. The spring is a good time to visit, and in February flights cost around £575. A taxi from the airport to the guesthouse is around £30, although Casa del Ciclista will be happy to arrange transfers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Accommodation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Casa del Ciclista is a private guesthouse that comfortably sleeps up to four, and costs around £160 for two people, including breakfast. Nena comes each day from her restaurant, Mirador de Nena, and is an all-round top chef and wonderful host. Search lacasadelciclistacol on Instagram for the guesthouse and call +57 314 5622614 for the Restaurante Mirador de Nena.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Thanks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many thanks to Mauricio Ardila for his hospitality, company and rum; to Nena for looking after us so well, and to Ben Hitchins, who at the time of our visit ran PiCO bike travel, but for a number of reasons has had to wind down operations – for now. Never say never.
