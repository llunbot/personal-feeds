The 10.9-inch tablet also doesn't have a home button, and shows Apple, under <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/the-clock-is-rapidly-ticking-on-apples-lightning-charger/\">pressure from European Union</a> regulations, moving from a Lightning port to USB-C.</p>\n<p>However, Apple's also doing away with the $329, 9th Generation iPad, effectively increasing the price of entry for an iPad. The $329 iPad hadÂ an old school home button, as well as a Lightning port. The cheaper iPad also supported the 1st Generation Apple Pencil that had a round barrel shape, glossy finish, and also used a Lightning port. Meanwhile, Apple's Pencil lineup has moved toward magnetic charging and other new features.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022463#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022463&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0d22a7c1c8fcd35089e560cfff743a0df43fe3a0bb8077e0de22ce79445fcf6f","category":"Tech"}
