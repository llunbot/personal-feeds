This is also the first Apple Watch to have an IP6X certification for dust resistance in addition to its WR50 water resistance rating.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ is available in aluminum, stainless steel, and titanium, with pricing that starts at $399. Apple is also offering Nike and Hermes models.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ models did not launch alongside the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a> models because of production issues that may result in supply constraints. For that reason, customers hoping for an ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ on launch day should make sure to order early.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nCustomers who pre-order one of the new Apple Watch models can expect to start receiving their devices on Friday, October 15, the official launch date for the Series 7.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 7</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/08/apple-watch-series-7-preorders-live/\">Apple Watch Series 7 Now Available for Pre-Order</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-series-7-now-available-for-pre-order.2315992/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=oVgiX6KV3YE:dp434vIOD6w:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=oVgiX6KV3YE:dp434vIOD6w:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/oVgiX6KV3YE\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"60db7ff4e3ec26ad99411aab3345653329847a29fb803d6cd9394bc66255a0f9","category":"Apple"}
