The exemption applies to products\nentering the United States or removed from warehouses as early as\nApril 5, according to the notice.</p>\n\n<p>The move comes after the Trump administration imposed a minimum\ntariff rate of 145% on Chinese goods imported to the United\nStates. The tariffs would have a major impact on tech giants like\nApple, which make iPhones and other products in China.</p>\n\n<p>Roughly 90% of Apple’s iPhone production and assembly is based in\nChina, according to Wedbush Securities’ estimates. Analysts at\nWedbush on Saturday called the tariff exclusion, “the best news\npossible for tech investors.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZLeaSWY37I\">Here’s Commerce Secretary Emily Litella making the announcement on Weekend Update</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/12/smartphones-computers-tariff-exemptions\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"2ba19d137c2de1e3fe71885610e04401469ee375788a735d253fd2047de30a77","category":"Tech"}
