The sweep is part of security preparations to help first responders pinpoint possible “dirty bombs” and other terrorist activities before they claim any lives.</p>\n<p>The flight started with a thorough scan of the starting line in the western suburb of Hopkinton before flying along the 26.2-mile route to the finish line in Boston, where the helicopter performed another comprehensive survey. The craft flew at low altitude the entire time, dipping below 100 feet on several occasions, according to FlightAware.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-08-at-10.16.58-AM.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-08-at-10.16.58-AM-640x619.jpeg\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-08-at-10.16.58-AM.jpeg\">Flight path for N412DE on the morning of October 8, 2021.</a> (credit: FlightAware)</p></div>\n<p>The twin-engine Bell 412 (tail number <a href=\"https://flightaware.com/live/flight/N412DE\">N412DE</a>) is operated by the National Nuclear Security Administration, a division of the Department of Energy that is responsible for everything from nonproliferation to maintaining the nation’s nuclear stockpile.
