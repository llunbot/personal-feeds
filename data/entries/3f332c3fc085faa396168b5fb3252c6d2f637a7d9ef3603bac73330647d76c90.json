{"title":"Tip of the Day: You Can Select Multiple Tabs, Then Drag Them, in Safari, Chrome, and Firefox","link":"https://mastodon.social/@jackwellborn/111539651190313429","date":1701998368000,"content":"\n<p>Jack Wellborn:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I just recently discovered that you can select and drag multiple \nSafari tabs by holding Shift or Command, just as you would to \nselect and drag multiple items in Finder. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I had no idea you could do this with tabs. Just like making multiple selections in a list view, Shift-click will select an entire range at once, and Command-clicking lets you select (and deselect) noncontiguous tabs. If I’d known you could do this, I probably never would have written <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/12/05/an-applescript-for-safari-split-tabs-to-new-window\">the AppleScript I posted the other day</a> — but if I hadn’t written and posted that script, I don’t think I would learned this trick. Once you have multiple tabs selected, you can drag them together to create a new window, or do things like close them all at once.</p>\n\n<p>This same trick works in Firefox and Chrome (and Chrome-derived browsers like Brave), too. This trick does <em>not</em> work in Safari on iPadOS, because iPads are baby computers where you can’t select more than one thing at a time.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/12/07/safari-chrome-firebox-multiple-tab-selection\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"3f332c3fc085faa396168b5fb3252c6d2f637a7d9ef3603bac73330647d76c90","category":"Tech"}
