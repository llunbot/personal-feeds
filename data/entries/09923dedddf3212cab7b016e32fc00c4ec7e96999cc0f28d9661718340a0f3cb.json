In some cases, the ‌iPhone‌ merely reboots, but in other cases, it turns off for several hours. The shutdown bug appears to impact multiple ‌iPhone‌ models, though many of the complaints have been from <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> users.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYou can tell if your ‌‌iPhone‌‌ turned off at night by opening up the Settings app, navigating to Battery, and checking the charging status over the past 24 hours. If there's a gap, the ‌‌iPhone‌‌ was turned off for a period of time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere is no word on when this issue might be fixed, and Apple has yet to comment.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242\">iPadOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/18/ios-17-1-shutdown-bug-no-fix/\">PSA: iOS 17.1 Doesn't Fix Nighttime iPhone Shutdown Bug</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/psa-ios-17-1-doesnt-fix-nighttime-iphone-shutdown-bug.2408012/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"09923dedddf3212cab7b016e32fc00c4ec7e96999cc0f28d9661718340a0f3cb","category":"Apple"}
