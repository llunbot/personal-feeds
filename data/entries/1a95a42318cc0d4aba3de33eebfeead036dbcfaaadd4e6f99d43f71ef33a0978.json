We already liked the CBD-infused carbon PNW Loam bar when we tested the low-rise version a little over a year ago. And now, more sizes means more options. Since we last caught up with them, PNW even have updated the low- &amp; mid-rise Loams with a 31.8mm clamp option for riders looking to upgrade without swapping stems…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>PNW Loam carbon mountain bike bar adds 50mm hi-rise</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PNW-Loam-carbon-mountain-bike-bar-adds-50mm-hi-rise_riser-bar-detail-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PNW-Loam-carbon-mountain-bike-bar-adds-50mm-hi-rise_riser-bar-detail-jpg.webp\" alt=\"PNW Loam carbon mountain bike bar adds 50mm hi-rise, riser bar detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PNW-Loam-carbon-mountain-bike-bar-adds-50mm-hi-rise_riser-bar-detail-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PNW-Loam-carbon-mountain-bike-bar-adds-50mm-hi-rise_riser-bar-detail-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PNW-Loam-carbon-mountain-bike-bar-adds-50mm-hi-rise_riser-bar-detail-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PNW-Loam-carbon-mountain-bike-bar-adds-50mm-hi-rise_riser-bar-detail-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/PNW)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s keep this simple and straightforward. The carbon PNW Loam handlebar promises the perfect balance between comfort and predictable control. Their secret to that is CBD. Not cannabis, but a Compliant Bore Design. That’s essentially molding the carbon bar over an EPS core during manufacturing to better control internal dimensions &amp; shaping. Thus, better control of how thick the carbon is throughout the bar, so PNW can provide more vertical deflection for comfort while maintaining low horizontal deflection for predictable steering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We tested the 25mm low-rise x 35mm diameter clamp Loam bar <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/pnw-loam-carbon-handlebar-review/\" target=\"_blank\">back in late 2023</a>, and came away with noticeably improved comfort, upgrading from an alloy bar of the same dimensions. Our editor-in-chief says, “<em>The quality is excellent, the geometry is dialed, and visually it looks like an upgrade, as well.</em>“</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PNW-Loam-carbon-mountain-bike-bar-adds-50mm-hi-rise_on-a-trail-bike-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PNW-Loam-carbon-mountain-bike-bar-adds-50mm-hi-rise_on-a-trail-bike-jpg.webp\" alt=\"PNW Loam carbon mountain bike bar adds 50mm hi-rise, on a bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PNW-Loam-carbon-mountain-bike-bar-adds-50mm-hi-rise_on-a-trail-bike-jpg.webp 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PNW-Loam-carbon-mountain-bike-bar-adds-50mm-hi-rise_on-a-trail-bike-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PNW-Loam-carbon-mountain-bike-bar-adds-50mm-hi-rise_on-a-trail-bike-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PNW-Loam-carbon-mountain-bike-bar-adds-50mm-hi-rise_on-a-trail-bike-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PNW-Loam-carbon-mountain-bike-bar-adds-50mm-hi-rise_EFBE-Category-5-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"700\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PNW-Loam-carbon-mountain-bike-bar-adds-50mm-hi-rise_EFBE-Category-5-jpg.webp\" alt=\"PNW Loam carbon mountain bike bar adds 50mm hi-rise, EFBE Cat 5 rated\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PNW-Loam-carbon-mountain-bike-bar-adds-50mm-hi-rise_EFBE-Category-5-jpg.webp 700w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PNW-Loam-carbon-mountain-bike-bar-adds-50mm-hi-rise_EFBE-Category-5-233x300.webp 233w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PNW-Loam-carbon-mountain-bike-bar-adds-50mm-hi-rise_EFBE-Category-5-93x120.webp 93w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>new 50mm hi-rise, available only in 35mm diameter clamp</li>\n\n\n\n<li>25mm low- &amp; 38mm mid-rise now available in either 31.8mm or 35mm clamp</li>\n\n\n\n<li>all bars are 800mm wide, and can be cut down to min 740mm</li>\n\n\n\n<li>5° upsweep and 10° backsweep</li>\n\n\n\n<li>rated for all mountain bike riding, up to DH &amp; eMTB</li>\n\n\n\n<li>EFBE Category 5 Tri-Test certified</li>\n\n\n\n<li>matte black finish with satin PNW logos – cement grey is standard</li>\n\n\n\n<li>8 optional colorful decal sets also available: Safety orange, Moss green, Moto green, Pacific blue, Fruit Snacks (purple), Really red, Seafoam teal, Peanut Butter (brown)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>PNW Loam carbon bar – Pricing, availability &amp; options</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PNW-Loam-carbon-mountain-bike-bar-adds-50mm-hi-rise_gray-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1100\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PNW-Loam-carbon-mountain-bike-bar-adds-50mm-hi-rise_gray-jpg.webp\" alt=\"PNW Loam carbon mountain bike bar adds 50mm hi-rise, gray\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PNW-Loam-carbon-mountain-bike-bar-adds-50mm-hi-rise_gray-jpg.webp 1100w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PNW-Loam-carbon-mountain-bike-bar-adds-50mm-hi-rise_gray-297x122.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PNW-Loam-carbon-mountain-bike-bar-adds-50mm-hi-rise_gray-120x49.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PNW-Loam-carbon-mountain-bike-bar-adds-50mm-hi-rise_gray-768x314.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new 50mm hi-rise x 35mm clamp PNW Loam MTB bar sells for $159 / 189€.
