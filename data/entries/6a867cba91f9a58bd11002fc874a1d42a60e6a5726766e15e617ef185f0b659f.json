And it's no coincidence that the tune is among the most recent: the study also found that harmonic surprise in popular music has been increasing over the decades—a phenomenon the authors have dubbed \"inflationary surprise.\"</p>\n<p>\"Music is culture. Culture evolves over time, so the content of music needs to evolve as time goes by, just to have the same success as previously released music,\" said co-author Scott Miles, a neuroscientist specializing in how music preference forms in the brain. \"This study gets to the heart of what is a dynamic effect within popular culture, in a very concrete and measurable way. These findings [also] help further our understanding of how music is processed in the brain.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1786066#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1786066&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6a867cba91f9a58bd11002fc874a1d42a60e6a5726766e15e617ef185f0b659f","category":"Tech"}
