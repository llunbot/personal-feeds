A key new health-related feature included in the software update is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/10/sleep-apnea-detection-details/\">sleep apnea detection</a>, which is available starting today on the Apple Watch Series 10, Apple Watch Series 9, and Apple Watch Ultra 2 in more than 150 countries and regions, according to Apple.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/sleep-apnea-detection-apple-watch.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nThe list of countries includes the U.S., U.K., France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, and many others, with a <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/watchos/feature-availability/#health-sleep-apnea-notifications\">full list available on Apple's website</a>. A few English-speaking countries where the feature is not yet available are Australia and Canada, as Apple is still seeking regulatory clearance for the feature in some regions. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nSleep apnea is a potentially serious disorder in which a person's breathing repeatedly stops and starts while they sleep. The detection feature uses the Apple Watch's accelerometer to \"monitor small movements at the wrist that are associated with interruptions in normal respiratory patterns,\" according to Apple. If these disturbances occur frequently over multiple nights, they may be associated with sleep apnea, according to Apple.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple Watch users can view their nightly Breathing Disturbances in the Health app on the iPhone, with disturbances classified as \"elevated\" or \"not elevated.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple says the feature was developed using \"advanced machine learning\" and an \"extensive data set of clinical-grade sleep apnea tests,\" and then validated in a \"clinical study.\" Apple's fine print says the feature is intended to detect signs of moderate to severe sleep apnea for people 18 years old or older who have not already been diagnosed with sleep apnea.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple recently <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/16/apple-watch-sleep-apnea-detection-fda-approval/\">received FDA clearance for the feature in the U.S.</a>, and the company <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/health/pdf/sleep-apnea/Sleep_Apnea_Notifications_on_Apple_Watch_September_2024.pdf\">shared a document</a> describing the development and validation of the feature.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new Apple Watch Series 10 launches on Friday, while the Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 were released last year.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch 10</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra\">Apple Watch Ultra (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/16/apple-watch-sleep-apnea-feature-150-countries/\">Apple Watch's Sleep Apnea Detection Feature Now Available in More Than 150 Countries</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watchs-sleep-apnea-detection-feature-now-available-in-more-than-150-countries.2436542/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"64fe725af3c60bd1018c847e50426256be0dce8da01223fe8df9b052a165374e","category":"Apple"}
