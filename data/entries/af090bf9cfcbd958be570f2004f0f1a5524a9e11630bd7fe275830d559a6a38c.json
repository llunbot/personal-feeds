After trying a few different brakes, I eventually got hooked on the Cane Creek Direct Curve brakes. They just felt right and I rode them for years. I finished out the cockpit setup with the Cane Creek bar ends. They were a little different in design and didn’t throw you so far forward while using them. Both components served me well; they were just good quality parts that worked and lasted. Having grown up in Asheville, NC, I always knew I wasn’t far from the Cane Creek factory, but I had never made a stop in to visit the historic space. Until now.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2366.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2366.jpg?w=1800&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2366.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2366.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2366.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2366.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2366.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>I worked at <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/litespeedbikes/\" target=\"_blank\">Litespeed Bicycles</a> in Chattanooga back in 2001 and, in one form or another, cycling has been a consistent part of my life ever since. A few weeks ago, I decided to make the trek from Atlanta up to 355 Cane Creek Road for a factory tour (easy to book <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeKAqCrewfxpLb-M9PEuahU0ZfG9ybGLsnG6Kr-IMOCwTHstg/viewform?vc=0&amp;c=0&amp;w=1&amp;flr=0&amp;_ga=2.99142878.1703415115.1677193755-463159241.1675268184&amp;_gac=1.16666948.1677193910.Cj0KCQiAutyfBhCMARIsAMgcRJSQwciwe80JAdkR5o7xrTxxJ-RAJyRcVxrbo0Sq5fqBSPf82YcDSHEaAiJlEALw_wcB\" target=\"_blank\">online</a>). It was a good reason to visit a friend and to finally see the mythical Cane Creek factory where such industry-shifting designs, like the first threadless headset and early mtb disc brakes, were brought to light.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2353.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2353.jpg?w=1800&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2353.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2353.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2353.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2353.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2353.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2373.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2373.jpg?w=1800&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2373.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2373.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2373.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2373.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2373.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Leading the tour was Peter Gilbert who’s been at Cane Creek for 35+ years and, as a result, has been a firsthand witness to some monumental shifts in cycling technology. Most notably, he was an integral player in bringing the threadless headset to the world in 1992, back when Cane Creek had yet to be born from the brand Dia-Compe USA. That Cane Creek started out as a US-made component line from Dia-Compe was something I hadn’t known. Dia-Compe was the Japanese brake company that I rode with in high school. What I also didn’t know was that Cane Creek/Dia-Compe built the first Rock Shox forks in this same building. You can read a lot of this history on the website, but it felt different hearing these origin stories in the place where they unfolded.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2334.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2334.jpg?w=1800&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2334.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2334.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2334.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2334.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2334.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2260.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2260.jpg?w=1800&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2260.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2260.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2260.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2260.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2260.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Cane Creek assembles and tests all of their forks, shocks, and brakes on site in western North Carolina, where the unruly trails of nearby Pisgah work as their products’ proving grounds. Walking around the facility, what first caught my attention was the crew building the suspension forks and shocks by hand. Here, I met Rufus, a guy with his own t-shirt design that asserts: “You ain’t a man if you can’t can” (In case you’re mentally stumbling over this one, it’s a reference to the install process for Cane Creek’s air shocks where, rather than using an installation tool, Rufus installs the air cans by hand!). Even the tool, a large fixture really, to press in fork seals and steerer tubes is done by hand; you won’t find any blind pneumatic pressed forcing of parts together here. Since 1995, “by hand” has been the Cane Creek way.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1800\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2332.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2332.jpg?w=1200&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2332.jpg?resize=1024,1536&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2332.jpg?resize=768,1152&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2332.jpg?resize=700,1050&amp;quality=75 700w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1800\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2331.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2331.jpg?w=1200&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2331.jpg?resize=1024,1536&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2331.jpg?resize=768,1152&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2331.jpg?resize=700,1050&amp;quality=75 700w\" /></p>\n<p>A constant blur of activity and dyno machines soon had me headed towards the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/?s=eeBrake\" target=\"_blank\">eeBrake</a> assembly section. These insanely light rim brakes are like building an intricate 80 gram puzzle. I also found another 30+ year veteran of Cane Creek named Dianne. She assembles all of the headsets that roll through Cane Creek.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2298.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2298.jpg?w=1800&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2298.jpg?resize=1024,819&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2298.jpg?resize=768,614&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2298.jpg?resize=1335,1068&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2298.jpg?resize=700,560&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/01/DSC2298.jpg?resize=1536,1229&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Her three-plus-decade tenure means that Dianne was likely there when Cane Creek (then Dia-Compe USA) made waves in the cycling world by bringing to market the first threadless headset in 1992, the punnily-named Aheadset.
