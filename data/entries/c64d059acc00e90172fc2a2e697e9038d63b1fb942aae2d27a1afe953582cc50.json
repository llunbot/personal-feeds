The communications to social media companies were not significant enough \"to convert private conduct into government conduct,\" Department of Justice lawyers argued in the case.</p>\n<p>But Judge Terry Doughty, a Trump nominee at US District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.lawd.189520/gov.uscourts.lawd.189520.294.0_2.pdf\">granted the plaintiffs' request</a> for a preliminary injunction imposing limits on the Department of Health and Human Services, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the US Census Bureau, the State Department, the Homeland Security Department, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and many specific officials at those agencies. The injunction also affects White House officials.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1951745#p3\">Read 28 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1951745&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c64d059acc00e90172fc2a2e697e9038d63b1fb942aae2d27a1afe953582cc50","category":"Tech"}
