The constraints will impact ‌iPhone‌ and ‌iPad‌ sales in particular.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIt is not clear if these predicted supply constraints will affect the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a> models that are expected to launch in September.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple CEO <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a> was asked whether the supply constraints will continue into the holiday quarter, but Cook said that he doesn't want to predict that. \"We're going to take it one quarter at a time,\" he said. \"We will do everything we can to mitigate whatever set of circumstances we're dealt.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nCook said that though Apple is expecting supply constraints, component costs in the aggregate have declined, but Apple is currently paying out more for freight than it would like.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/earnings/\">earnings</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/27/iphone-ipad-supply-constraints-september-quarter/\">Apple Expecting iPhone and iPad Supply Constraints in September Quarter</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=RUdMb1IXU28:vRysMlleQc0:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=RUdMb1IXU28:vRysMlleQc0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/RUdMb1IXU28\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c35cf551d957fa6c306341f2b10ac17368c794d1b6630113cfdd24a6c88e4e35","category":"Apple"}
