{"title":"Widespread Problem Has Locked Many Out of Their Apple IDs","link":"https://9to5mac.com/2024/04/26/signed-out-of-apple-id-account-problem-password/","date":1714250579000,"content":"\n<p>Chance Miller, reporting for 9to5Mac:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There appears to be an increasingly widespread Apple ID outage of\nsome sort impacting users tonight. A number of people on social\nmedia say that they were logged out of their Apple ID across\nmultiple devices on Friday evening and forced to reset their\npassword before logging back in…</p>\n\n<p>We received our first tip about this around 8 p.m. ET. In the\nhours since then, the problem has gained significant traction on\nsocial media.</p>\n\n<p>Apple’s <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/\">System Status webpage</a> doesn’t indicate that any of its\nservices are having issues this evening. Still, it’s clear based\non social media reports that something wonky is going on behind\nthe scenes at Apple. A few of us here at 9to5Mac have also been\ndirectly affected by the problem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Apple’s separate <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/system-status/\">Developer System Status dashboard</a> lists “Account” as having undergone maintenance and also having additional maintenance scheduled for later today. Apple ought to provide an explanation for exactly what’s gone wrong here, but has not yet.</p>\n\n<p>The lockout hit Michael Tsai (<a href=\"https://mjtsai.com/blog/2023/10/23/secondary-apple-id-mess-and-inadvertent-password-reset/\">again</a>) and <a href=\"https://mjtsai.com/blog/2024/04/26/janky-apple-id-security/\">he copiously documented the entire experience</a>, including being required to wait an hour before setting a new password because he has Stolen Device Protection enabled — despite the fact that he was at home, which is supposed to be a trusted location.</p>\n\n<p>I just checked on my own iPhone, and the only two “Significant Locations” listed in Settings → Privacy &amp; Security → Location Services → System Services → Significant Locations are “Work” and my favorite (and truly oft-visited) grocery store. But the “Work” location is centered three entire city blocks (~0.2 miles) from my home, which leaves my home just <em>outside</em> the radius that counts as that location. Luckily I wasn’t hit by this account lockout, but this also reassures me that I’m right to not yet have enabled Stolen Device Protection.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/27/apple-id-lockout\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d6fb20c4818d7d55fb01618d96156d861c397c3398f469fbcc3c3c78e29fa96c","category":"Tech"}
