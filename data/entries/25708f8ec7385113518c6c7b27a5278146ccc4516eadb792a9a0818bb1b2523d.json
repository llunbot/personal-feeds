The tower is behind a poultry plant in a forested area, per <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/08/alabama-200ft-radio-tower-stolen\">The Guardian</a>. Once there, a crew member called station manager Brett Elmore, informing him that the 200-foot structure that <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/08/us/stolen-transmitter-radio-tower-jasper-alabama/index.html\">CNN</a> says has been there since the '50s had disappeared.</p>\n<p>\"He said, ‘The tower is gone. There's wires [sic] everywhere, and it's gone,’” Elmore told Action News 5.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2002450#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2002450&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"25708f8ec7385113518c6c7b27a5278146ccc4516eadb792a9a0818bb1b2523d","category":"Tech"}
