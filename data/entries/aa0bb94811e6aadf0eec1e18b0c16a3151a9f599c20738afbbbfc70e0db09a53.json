The production hub could exceed half a million square feet in size since it needs to provide enough space to produce multiple TV shows and movies.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMany of the city's available spaces for production are said to be heavily booked for months in advance by studios that need a constant output of content, prompting companies to acquire space for themselves directly or lock-in locations with leases that reserve the space for several years at a time.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMike Mosallam joined Apple in January this year as a lead production real-estate executive for Los Angeles, apparently looking to oversee the company's soundstage strategy. He previously worked as Netflix's director of production planning and studio leasing.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple is reportedly hoping to deepen its presence in Hollywood by opening the campus. The company currently leases individual soundstages to film for ‌Apple TV+‌ in Los Angeles and other areas around the world, but a dedicated campus could streamline the production process and reinforce Apple's commitment to compete with other video streaming services.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wsj-com/\">wsj.com</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/\">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/20/apple-production-campus-in-los-angeles/\">Apple Looking to Establish a Large Production Campus in Los Angeles for Apple TV+</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-looking-to-establish-a-large-production-campus-in-los-angeles-for-apple-tv.2304855/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=p7uCxyHL1IU:HFca_-1i0oA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=p7uCxyHL1IU:HFca_-1i0oA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/p7uCxyHL1IU\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"aa0bb94811e6aadf0eec1e18b0c16a3151a9f599c20738afbbbfc70e0db09a53","category":"Apple"}
