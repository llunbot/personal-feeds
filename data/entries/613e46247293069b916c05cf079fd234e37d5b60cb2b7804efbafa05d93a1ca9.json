{"title":"LocalSend: Open Source Cross-Platform Alternative to AirDrop","link":"https://localsend.org/","date":1738345566000,"content":"\n<p>Via David Smith on Mastodon, <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@_Davidsmith/113923389557198608\">who writes</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The recent work I’ve been doing has required a lot of sharing\nfiles between testing devices (and my Mac). AirDrop should be the\nideal tool for this but I’ve recently found it to be unreliable.</p>\n\n<p>Instead I’ve been using LocalSend which is an open-source AirDrop\nalternative and it’s been working fantastically. The only real\ndownside is that you have to open the app on both sides for the\nshare to complete, but it has been 100% reliable so that’s a\ntradeoff I’ll happily make.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Somehow I’d never heard of LocalSend before, but I just gave it a quick test drive and it works like a charm. It’s got clients for Mac, iOS, Android, Linux, and Windows — and the Mac client is available both <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/localsend/id1661733229\">in the App Store</a> and <a href=\"https://localsend.org/download\">via the web</a>. No middleman in the cloud — transfers are peer-to-peer, and the whole project is <a href=\"https://localsend.org/community\">open source with an active community on GitHub</a>.</p>\n\n<p>When I dick around with my Android burner phone, I often find myself sorely missing AirDrop and Continuity. Sometimes I just want to move the contents of my clipboard from one device to the other — LocalSend makes that easier than anything else I’ve seen.</p>\n\n<p>I’m not even sure Smith’s “downside” is really a downside. I understand why AirDrop works the way it does (always-on in the background), but I wouldn’t want LocalSend to work that way. I <em>like</em> the explicitness of opening it on both devices.</p>\n\n<p>Just an outstanding project from developer Tien Do Nam. Free of charge, open source, and no ads — the only funding is via an in-app tip jar, which I just gladly dropped some bills in.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/31/localsend\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"613e46247293069b916c05cf079fd234e37d5b60cb2b7804efbafa05d93a1ca9","category":"Tech"}
