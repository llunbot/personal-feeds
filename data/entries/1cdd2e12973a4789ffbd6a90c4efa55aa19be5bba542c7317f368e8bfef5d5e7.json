It is in the same genre, but quite far from, games like <em>Cities: Skylines 2</em> (a choice with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/the-sad-story-of-cities-skylines-2s-launch-and-how-the-game-hopes-to-get-better/\">some proven merit</a>). Your buildings are not 3D-rendered with real-time lighting. Your buildings are colored squares, sometimes with a few disc tokens stacked on them, tabletop-style. Your roads don't have traffic, but they have drivers (tiny squares) that take resources between nodes. When things go wrong, you don't get depressing news about pollution and riots; some people just leave their homes, but they'll come back if you fix what's wrong.</p>\n<div><div></div><p><em>Mini Settlers</em> announcement video. </p></div>\n<p>Mini Settlers is not the game to play to satisfy your long-running suspicion that urban planning was your missed calling. In the (non-progress-saving) Prologue-free demo out this week, the mines and quarries have infinite resources. There is no \"money\" to speak of, so far as I can tell. Apple farms must be placed near apple orchards and water pumps by water, and the rest is up to you. The interface looks like a thought experiment in how far you can get from traditional city sim HUDs, but then someone implemented it.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021093#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021093&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1cdd2e12973a4789ffbd6a90c4efa55aa19be5bba542c7317f368e8bfef5d5e7","category":"Tech"}
