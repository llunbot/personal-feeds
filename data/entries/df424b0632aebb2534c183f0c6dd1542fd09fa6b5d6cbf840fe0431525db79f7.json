The series is adapted from the late <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Jordan\">Robert Jordan</a>'s bestselling <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time\">14-book series</a> of epic fantasy novels, and Ars has been following it closely with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2023/09/things-get-serious-this-week-in-a-really-solid-the-wheel-of-time-episode/\">regular recaps</a> through the first two seasons. Judging from the new teaser, the battle between light and dark is heating up as the Dragon Reborn comes into his power.</p>\n<p><strong>(Spoilers for first two seasons below.)</strong></p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/09/the-wheel-of-time-teaser-is-here-and-it-looks-and-feels-exactly-right/\">previously reported</a>, the series center on Moiraine (<a href=\"https://deadline.com/2019/06/rosamund-pike-the-wheel-of-time-tv-adaptation-amazon-1202634993/\">played by</a> Oscar-nominee Rosamund Pike), a member of a powerful, all-woman organization called the Aes Sedai. Magic, known as the One Power, is divided into male (<em>saidin</em>) and female (<em>saidar</em>) flavors. The latter is the province of the Aes Sedai. Long ago, a great evil called the Dark One caused the <em>saidin</em> to become tainted, such that most men who show an ability to channel that magic go mad. It's the job of the Aes Sedai to track down such men and strip them of their abilities—a process known as \"gentling\" that, unfortunately, is often anything but. There is also an ancient prophecy concerning the Dragon Reborn: the reincarnation of a person who will save or destroy humanity.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/12/the-shadows-roots-take-hold-in-wheel-of-time-s3-teaser/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2024/12/the-shadows-roots-take-hold-in-wheel-of-time-s3-teaser/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"df424b0632aebb2534c183f0c6dd1542fd09fa6b5d6cbf840fe0431525db79f7","category":"Tech"}
