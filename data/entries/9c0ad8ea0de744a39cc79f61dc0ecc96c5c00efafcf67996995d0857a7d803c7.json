Given the same base ROM file and the same set of precisely timed inputs, all those consoles should hopefully give the same gameplay output across individual hardware and across time.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://tas.bot/wiki/Main_Page\">TASBot community</a> relies on this kind of solid-state predictability when creating <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/01/how-a-game-playing-robot-coded-super-mario-maker-onto-an-snes-live-on-stage/\">tool-assisted speedruns</a> that can be <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/inside-tasbots-semi-secret-probably-legal-effort-to-control-the-nintendo-switch/\">executed</a> with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/01/how-a-robot-got-super-mario-64-and-portal-running-on-an-snes/\">robotic precision</a> on <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/07/how-to-beat-super-mario-bros-3-in-less-than-a-second/\">actual console hardware</a>. But on the SNES in particular, the team has largely struggled to get <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/08/accuracy-takes-power-one-mans-3ghz-quest-to-build-a-perfect-snes-emulator/\">emulated speedruns</a> to sync up with demonstrated results on real consoles.</p>\n<p>After significant research and testing on dozens of actual SNES units, the TASBot team now thinks that a cheap ceramic resonator used in the system's Audio Processing Unit (APU) is to blame for much of this inconsistency. While <a href=\"https://snes.nesdev.org/wiki/SNES_Development_Manual\">Nintendo's own documentation</a> says the APU should run at a consistent rate of 24,576 Hz (and the associated Digital Signal Processor sample rate at a flat 32,000 Hz), in practice, that rate can vary just a bit based on heat, system age, and minor physical variations that develop in different console units over time.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/this-small-snes-timing-issue-is-causing-big-speedrun-problems/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/this-small-snes-timing-issue-is-causing-big-speedrun-problems/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9c0ad8ea0de744a39cc79f61dc0ecc96c5c00efafcf67996995d0857a7d803c7","category":"Tech"}
