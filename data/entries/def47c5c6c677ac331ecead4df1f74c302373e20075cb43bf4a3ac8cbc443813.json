OpenAI bills the new store as a way to \"help you find useful and popular custom versions of ChatGPT\" for members of Plus, Team, or Enterprise subscriptions.</p>\n\n<p>\"It’s been two months since we announced GPTs, and users have already created over 3 million custom versions of ChatGPT,\" writes OpenAI in its promotional blog. \"Many builders have shared their GPTs for others to use. Today, we're starting to roll out the GPT Store to ChatGPT Plus, Team and Enterprise users so you can find useful and popular GPTs.\"</p>\n<p>OpenAI <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/openai-introduces-custom-ai-assistants-called-gpts-that-play-different-roles/\">launched GPTs</a> on November 6, 2023, as part of its DevDay event. Each GPT includes custom instructions and/or access to custom data or external APIs that can potentially make a custom GPT personality more useful than the vanilla ChatGPT-4 model. Before the GPT Store launch, paying ChatGPT users could create and share custom GPTs with others (by setting the GPT public and sharing a link to the GPT), but there was no central repository for browsing and discovering user-designed GPTs on the OpenAI website.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1994230#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1994230&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"def47c5c6c677ac331ecead4df1f74c302373e20075cb43bf4a3ac8cbc443813","category":"Tech"}
