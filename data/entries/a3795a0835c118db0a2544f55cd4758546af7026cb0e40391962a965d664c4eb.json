It offers excellent efficiency and really rapid charging, all wrapped up in a shape that exudes late-'80s hatchback vibes. Today, Hyundai revealed details about the Ioniq 5's update for model year 2025 (MY25), and it's noteworthy for a number of reasons.</p>\n<p>For starters, when MY25 Ioniq 5s start appearing on dealer lots in Q4, they'll arrive with J3400 ports concealed underneath their charger port flaps. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/07/the-ars-technica-guide-to-electric-vehicle-charging/3/\">Once known as the North American Charging Standard (NACS</a>), this is the Tesla-style charger plug, which means MY25 Ioniq 5s should be able to fast charge at more than 17,000 Tesla Superchargers throughout the US and Canada.</p>\n<p>The flip side is that a MY25 Ioniq 5 will require an adapter if the driver wants to charge it with a CCS1 charger, although Hyundai will include that dongle with a new car. The automaker says that as it refreshes other EVs in Q4, they will also only come with J3400 ports. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/10/hyundai-is-switching-to-tesla-style-nacs-plugs-for-its-evs-in-late-2024/\">For existing Hyundai EVs with CCS1 ports</a>, J3400 adapters are supposed to be available in Q1 2025.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046798#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046798&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
