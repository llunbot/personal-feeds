To tame every corner, every climb, every cliff-clinging road of this event takes the deepest resolve and resourcefulness. Over the course of this week-long, self-supported expedition, riders will not only be required to climb the equivalent of Everest three times over, they’ll find themselves sleeping under Gaelic football stands, foraging for food and sheltering in hedges, all in the name of conquering Ireland’s wildest roads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Setting out from Derry under the shadow of the Peace Bridge, riders pedal from the tip of Donegal, past the Gaeltacht, through Connemara and around the Ring of Kerry before a final push along the south coast that will (hopefully) see them finish in Kinsale. As ultracycling goes, you’d be hard pushed to find a tougher event anywhere on the British Isles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The TransAtlantic Way offers up two routes. The longer, named after Gaelic folk hero Cú Chulainn, is a 2,400km odyssey that clocks up nearly 30,000m climbing. The shorter – and these things are relative – Sédanta route (Cú Chulainn’s childhood name) comprises 1,600km with 19,000m of climbing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are few rules on the TransAtlantic Way, which prides itself in being an ‘experience’ rather than a ‘race’, however riders must complete the course from start to finish without detours and must be fully self-supported, receiving no private outside assistance. All the organisers arm them with is a GPS tracker and wishes of good luck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the spirit of the old Irish blessing, ‘May the road rise to meet you, may the wind be always at your back,’ <em>Cyclist</em> hears from four participants of this unique cycling event.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Donnacha Cassidy</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"587\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/transatlantic-way-02-970x587.jpg\" alt=\"TransAtlantic Way\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/transatlantic-way-02-970x587.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/transatlantic-way-02-300x181.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/transatlantic-way-02-768x465.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/transatlantic-way-02-750x454.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/transatlantic-way-02-1140x689.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/transatlantic-way-02.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Donnacha Cassidy, 34, from Ireland, 1st in Cú Chulainn</figcaption><figcaption>Fergus Coyle</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘I’m from Ireland so you’d think I would have seen these places before, but it’s the complete opposite. I hadn’t seen the vast majority of the route before riding the TransAtlantic Way – I knew about 20% of it. You end up going to places that you would never even think of driving to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I really liked riding at night – you could see the moon out on the sea. But as beautiful as that was, the area is quite heavily populated with sheep, so you need to watch out for them sleeping in the middle of the road. I don’t like riding right through the night though. You get into a state of almost drunkenness, and you can’t move. No amount of Red Bull can keep you going.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/transatlantic-way-03-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"TransAtlantic Way\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/transatlantic-way-03-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/transatlantic-way-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/transatlantic-way-03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/transatlantic-way-03-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/transatlantic-way-03-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/transatlantic-way-03-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/transatlantic-way-03-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/transatlantic-way-03-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/transatlantic-way-03.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Statues of Jesus – this one in Connemara, County Galway – are a common sight in Ireland.</figcaption><figcaption>Fergus Coyle</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘I found myself constantly planning ahead – where to find lunch or where to sleep – so I didn’t even listen to music until the fourth or fifth day.

This time I finished nearly a day faster by camping and not wasting time in hotels. There aren’t many wooded areas on the west coast of Ireland though, so you’re limited to camping in fields or in a ditch somewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I’m a delivery driver, so I often find myself driving a lot of these roads.

I’m not trying to brag, but I actually can’t believe I did it, especially as in many ways I think it was kind of a dumb thing to even attempt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘One guy I met was an engineer, I think.
