During this time, you'll find a large selection of deals and offers across Amazon's storefront, covering savings on tech, clothing, video games, groceries, and much, much more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/primeday2020_feature3.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running.</small></em>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor our coverage, we're focusing entirely on Apple and Apple-related discounts that can be purchased during this 48 hour event on Amazon. As of today, this includes deals on AirPods, Apple Watch, iPad, iPad mini, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs is typical for Prime Day deals, these markdowns are very time sensitive, so sales listed below may disappear fast, and new ones may appear even faster. With this in mind, we'll keep this article updated throughout the event, and keep an eye on the MacRumors front page as we'll be posting particularly great deals in separate articles this week.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLastly, and perhaps most importantly, Amazon Prime Day requires you to have an <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Famazonprime\"><strong>Amazon Prime membership</strong></a> to take advantage of the discounts. Amazon Prime costs $14.99 per month or $139.00 per year, and it comes with a 30-day free trial for new subscribers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>AirPods</h2>\r<br />\nStarting with AirPods, you'll find a wide selection of solid deals across the AirPods lineup on Amazon during Prime Day. Prices start at <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB07PXGQC1Q%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\"><strong>$89.99</strong></a> for the AirPods 2 ($39 off), then increase to <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BDHWDR12%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\"><strong>$199.00</strong></a> for the AirPods Pro 2 ($50 off).\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/07/airpods-2-prime-day.jpg\" alt width=\"1384\" height=\"776\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis is an overall second-best price on the AirPods 2, but it's a match for the best price we've tracked so far this year on the accessory.
