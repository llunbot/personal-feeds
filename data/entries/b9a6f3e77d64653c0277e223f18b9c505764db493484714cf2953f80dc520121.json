The new third-generation model features a slightly revamped design that veers closer to the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/10/apple-announces-airpods-pro/\" target=\"_blank\">higher-end AirPods Pro</a>, with shorter stems and a similar touch-based \"Force sensor\" control scheme built-in. Their charging case takes after the shorter and wider design of the Pro model well.</p>\n<p>The new AirPods retain their usual hard plastic finish, but Apple says they are now officially sweat- and water-resistant. Battery life is said to be up to six hours via the earbuds alone and up to 30 hours when including the charging case. They support MagSafe and wireless charging, though they do not feature active noise cancellation like the AirPods Pro.</p>\n<p>The third-gen AirPods cost $179 and will begin shipping next week, with preorders starting today. Notably, Apple will continue to sell the existing second-gen AirPods for $129 alongside the new pair.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1794086#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1794086&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b9a6f3e77d64653c0277e223f18b9c505764db493484714cf2953f80dc520121","category":"Tech"}
