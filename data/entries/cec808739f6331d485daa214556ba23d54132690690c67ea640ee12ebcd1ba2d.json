{"title":"Resident Evil Village Now Available on iPhone 15 Pro and M1/M2 iPads","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/resident-evil-village-available-iphone-15-pro-ipad/","date":1698660922000,"content":"Capcom has released <em><a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/resident-evil-village/id6450980545\">Resident Evil Village</a></em> for iPhone 15 Pro models and iPads with M1 or later Apple silicon. The game is available now as a 7.92GB download from the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/resident-evil-village/id6450980545\">App Store</a>. Players can try it for free and unlock the full game for the special price of $15.99 – a 60% discount that runs until November 20.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nThe regular pricing for the base game is $39.99, with a $19.99 in app purchase for the Winters’ Expansion DLC. There is also a $4.99 All Access Voucher DLC. As noted by <em><a href=\"https://toucharcade.com/2023/10/30/resident-evil-village-iphone-15-pro-free-download-now-available-app-store-ipad-m1-launch-discount/\">TouchArcade</a></em>, these DLC packs are the same as the PC and console versions.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>Resident Evil 4 Remake</em> is due later this year for iPhone 15 Pro, iPad (M1 and later) models, and macOS. The App Store still <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/resident-evil-4/id6462360082\">lists the game</a> as \"Coming Soon – Expected December 31, 2023,\" but this is a placeholder and the game could come much sooner (there is speculation it could even be released immediately following Apple's upcoming \"Scary Fast\" event.) \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>Resident Evil 4 Remake</em> and <em>Resident Evil Village</em> were showcased during Apple's ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ announcement in September. The ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ and ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max are powered by an A17 Pro chip that features a brand new GPU with hardware-accelerated ray tracing, enabling ported console games to be played on the iPhone at near-equivalent performance.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDisplayPort support is built into the USB-C port on all iPhone 15 models, meaning that the devices can also output video at up to 4K/60Hz natively to a DisplayPort-equipped external display or TV with a supported USB-C to DisplayPort cable. On previous iPhones with a Lightning port, video mirroring is limited to 1080p with Apple's Lightning-to-HDMI or Lightning-to-VGA adapters.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>Resident Evil 4 Remake</em> will have cross-progression on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. In contrast, <em>Resident Evil Village</em> has cross-progression on iPadOS and iOS only, because it is already available on macOS, while the iOS and iPadOS release is an individual purchase.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air </a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/capcom/\">Capcom</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air\">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro\">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/resident-evil-village-available-iphone-15-pro-ipad/\">Resident Evil Village Now Available on iPhone 15 Pro and M1/M2 iPads</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/resident-evil-village-now-available-on-iphone-15-pro-and-m1-m2-ipads.2409157/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"cec808739f6331d485daa214556ba23d54132690690c67ea640ee12ebcd1ba2d","category":"Apple"}
