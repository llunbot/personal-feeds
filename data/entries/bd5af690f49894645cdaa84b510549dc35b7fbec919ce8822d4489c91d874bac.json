But look closer, and you’ll see the telltale pattern of a 3D-printed structure underneath the cover. That’s because the new Power Expert with Mirror uses the same 3D-printed tech (in spots) as the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/specialized-s-works-power-mirror-saddle-replaces-foam-with-project-black-3d-printing/\" target=\"_blank\">S-Works Power</a>, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/specialized-3d-printed-power-pro-mirror-saddle-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Power Pro</a>, and <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/specialized-s-works-romin-evo-gets-the-mirror-treatment-for-longer-3d-printed-saddle-design/\" target=\"_blank\">Romin EVO </a>with Mirror models, but this one gets a cover. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Power-Expert-with-Mirror-review-3d-printed-5.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Power-Expert-with-Mirror-review-3d-printed-5.jpg\" alt=\"Specialized 3d printed mirror insert\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Power-Expert-with-Mirror-review-3d-printed-5.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Power-Expert-with-Mirror-review-3d-printed-5-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Power-Expert-with-Mirror-review-3d-printed-5-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Power-Expert-with-Mirror-review-3d-printed-5-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Power-Expert-with-Mirror-review-3d-printed-5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Power-Expert-with-Mirror-review-3d-printed-5-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Power-Expert-with-Mirror-review-3d-printed-5-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While some have come to love the look of an airy 3D-printed saddle, others may find it a challenge to keep clean. For those riders who want the added comfort of the optimized 3D-printed matrix without the holes, the new Power Expert with Mirror saddle fits the bill. The 4-way stretch cover is designed to allow the saddle to conform to your body as the other models, only with extra protection on top. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That cover also helps hide the blend of 3D-printed matrix and traditional padding. The other saddles in the Mirror range are fully 3D-printed, but the Power Expert uses “3D-printed inserts” under the sit bones. Around those inserts is more typical PU foam, which is likely responsible for reducing the price tag. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Power-Expert-with-Mirror-review-3d-printed-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Power-Expert-with-Mirror-review-3d-printed-1-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Specialized Power Expert with Mirror saddle actual weight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Power-Expert-with-Mirror-review-3d-printed-1-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Power-Expert-with-Mirror-review-3d-printed-1-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Power-Expert-with-Mirror-review-3d-printed-1-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Power-Expert-with-Mirror-review-3d-printed-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Power-Expert-with-Mirror-review-3d-printed-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Power-Expert-with-Mirror-review-3d-printed-1-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Power-Expert-with-Mirror-review-3d-printed-1.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Power Expert with Mirror drops the price substantially for a Specialized 3D-printed saddle. Priced at $200, the Power Expert model is by far the most affordable while still being respectably light at 214g (143mm). </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Power-Expert-with-Mirror-review-3d-printed-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Power-Expert-with-Mirror-review-3d-printed-2-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Specialized Power Expert with Mirror saddle nose\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Power-Expert-with-Mirror-review-3d-printed-2-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Power-Expert-with-Mirror-review-3d-printed-2-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Power-Expert-with-Mirror-review-3d-printed-2-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Power-Expert-with-Mirror-review-3d-printed-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Power-Expert-with-Mirror-review-3d-printed-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Power-Expert-with-Mirror-review-3d-printed-2-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Power-Expert-with-Mirror-review-3d-printed-2.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Power-Expert-with-Mirror-review-3d-printed-4.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Power-Expert-with-Mirror-review-3d-printed-4-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Specialized Power Expert with Mirror saddle bottom\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Power-Expert-with-Mirror-review-3d-printed-4-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Power-Expert-with-Mirror-review-3d-printed-4-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Power-Expert-with-Mirror-review-3d-printed-4-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Power-Expert-with-Mirror-review-3d-printed-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Power-Expert-with-Mirror-review-3d-printed-4-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Power-Expert-with-Mirror-review-3d-printed-4-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Power-Expert-with-Mirror-review-3d-printed-4.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That weight is partially due to the hollow titanium rails, which are the only rail option here. There are four sizes offered with 130, 143, 155, and 168mm widths. At the back of the saddle, you’ll find SWAT-compatible mounts for accessories. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>First Impressions</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Power-Expert-with-Mirror-review-3d-printed-7.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Power-Expert-with-Mirror-review-3d-printed-7-800x500.jpg\" alt=\"riding Specialized Power Expert with Mirror saddle review\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Power-Expert-with-Mirror-review-3d-printed-7-800x500.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Power-Expert-with-Mirror-review-3d-printed-7-297x186.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Power-Expert-with-Mirror-review-3d-printed-7-120x75.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Power-Expert-with-Mirror-review-3d-printed-7-768x480.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Power-Expert-with-Mirror-review-3d-printed-7-1536x960.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Power-Expert-with-Mirror-review-3d-printed-7.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While I personally haven’t tried any of the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-specialized-s-works-power-mirror-saddle-w-3d-printed-carbon-foam-padding/\" target=\"_blank\">Power with Mirror saddles</a>, I am a big fan of the Power saddle shape overall. The standard S-Works Power saddle has become my favorite for my all-road bike, so what would I think of the Power Expert with Mirror? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At first ride, the saddle felt immediately comfortable. I’m sure a lot of that was familiarity with the shape, but the support and cushion around the sitbones was really nice. I also appreciate the grip-level of the cover. It’s not so tacky that you can’t easily move around on the saddle, but it also keeps your rear from sliding back on hard efforts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would like to compare it to the S-Works Power with Mirror saddle to see if there is a difference in comfort on the edges of the saddle nose. But the difference in comfort would have to be huge to make up for the $250 price difference. Overall, I’ve been very happy with the new saddle, and I think it will permanently replace the standard S-Works Power model I had on there previously. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.specialized.com/us/en/saddle-mirror\" target=\"_blank\">specialized.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/specialized-power-expert-with-mirror-3d-printed-saddle-review/\">Specialized Power Expert with Mirror 3D Saddle Gets Covered Up &amp; Less Expensive</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"bd5af690f49894645cdaa84b510549dc35b7fbec919ce8822d4489c91d874bac","category":"Cycling"}
