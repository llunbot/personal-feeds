{"title":"Curve Seek 430 FM Fork Review: Just What I Needed – Spencer Harding","link":"https://theradavist.com/curve-seek-430-fm-fork-review-just-what-i-needed","date":1771574455000,"content":"<p><em>Spencer was searching for a carbon fork for his Crust Prototype, and after digging as deep as possible, he found the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/tag/curve-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">Curve Cycling</a> Seek 430 FM fork. He needed clearance for 29 x 2.6″ tires, plenty of mounts, boost spacing, a non-suspension corrected axle-to-crown measurement, and most of all: an extra-long steerer. Read on to see why that last requirement was so crucial…</em></p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<p>After that laundry list of requirements in the intro, you’d best believe I was hunting for a very niche fork. Initially I had passed over the post-mount version of the Curve Seek because it only came with a 300 mm steerer, and I needed at least 330 mm for the monumental head tube on my Crust Bush Devil prototype. I hadn’t even looked at the flat mount version because I genuinely dislike flat mount and assumed it would be the same story. Eventually Curve decided to make the Seek FM with a 50 mm longer steerer to accommodate the requests of taller riders and custom framebuilders.</p>\n<p>I designed the Bush Devil specifically with a tapered head tube – unlike the majority of the Crust catalog – so it could be used with a carbon fork. I had found a few forks with the necessary axle-to-crown length (~420–440 mm) before we went to prototyping, but I underestimated how much head tube the desired stack height would require on the XL frame. If you’re of average height, a few other options would have worked, but the Curve Seek 430 FM was my unicorn: 350 mm of steerer. I now understand why most manufacturers stop at 300 mm; forks typically don’t recommend more than 30 mm of spacers below the stem, and in many cases you can’t safely use all that steerer anyway.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-3.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-3.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-2.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-2.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.curvecycling.com/products/seek-430-fork\" target=\"_blank\">Curve Seek 430 FM</a> Quick Hits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><span>$643.00 USD</span></li>\n<li>Carbon construction</li>\n<li>Weight: 740 grams (with axle)</li>\n<li>1 1/8″ – 1.5″ tapered steerer, 350 mm long</li>\n<li>430 mm axle to crown</li>\n<li>55 mm offset</li>\n<li>15 x 110 mm (boost) spacing</li>\n<li>Brake: Flat mount 160/180 mm</li>\n<li>8 x M5 Very Good Mounts</li>\n<li>8 kg load limit (across 3 mounting points) – each side. 16 kg total</li>\n<li>140 KG (~300lbs) system weight limit</li>\n<li>Relaxle thru axle has M5 mounts for rack use</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-6.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-6.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-6.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-6.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-4.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-4.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-4.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-4.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-11.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-11.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-11.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-11.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Fork Details</h3>\n<p>The detailing on the Seek 430 is spectacular, starting with the matte carbon finish. The fork crown has a gentle, smooth curve that creates both massive clearance and clean lines. Each fork leg is dotted with four M5 mounting points for extra flexibility when mounting bags or cages. Curve’s Very Good Mounts are bonded into the leg rather than molded into the carbon layup process, which allows Curve to repair them should something go wrong.</p>\n<p>Each side can hold 8 kg (17 lbs), far more than I would want to weigh down a fork leg anyway. The threading passes through the whole fork leg, which speaks to how robust the mounts are and avoids the issue of a too-long bolt pressing through the backside. Brake cabling is managed by smaller M4 bolts along the left fork leg. As someone who finds partial internal cable routing on forks silly and nearly useless, I love Curve’s approach here.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-17.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-17.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-17.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-17.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-19.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-19.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-19.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-19.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-18.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-18.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-18.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-18.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Something I literally missed until it was recently pointed out to me: the Curve Relaxle has M5 rack mounts in the axle. This immediately got me tinkering, and I managed to hack a rack onto the Seek fork. While I don’t have doubts about the axle mount itself, I am dubious of the rest of my setup; I’ll report back if it holds up (please don’t try to replicate this). Due to the concentric mount at the axle, even my Tumbleweed T rack sat too low to clear the 29 x 2.5″ tire, which led to some finagling to raise the rack, brace it, and improvise a lowrider mount from an errant rack strut. Be aware that unless you’re using a rack designed to mount at the axle, it may be too short to clear, depending on your build. Either way, this is a sweet feature I had been considering adding via something like a Robert Axle – turns out it was already there.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-9.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-9.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-9.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-9.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Flat Mount is Dumb</h3>\n<p>I mentioned that I initially overlooked the flat mount version of this fork in favor of its post mount sibling because flat mount is annoying. This is the second article where I’ve griped about my issues adapting flat mount stuff; I keep saying I should write a Tinker Tantrums about my misadventures with it, so maybe this will finally be the inspiration.</p>\n<p>When I reached out to Curve, I mentioned I’d be running post-mount brakes on the fork, so they sent me an adaptor labeled flat to post mount 160. But when I put all the puzzle pieces together, my 160 mm rotor didn’t even make it into the caliper. I swapped in a 180 mm rotor and found that contacting the caliper too – I just needed the smallest amount of additional clearance. Ace Hardware to the rescue: a single 1 mm washer on each bolt got me right where I needed to be.</p>\n<p>Curve went with flat mount because many OEM suppliers have stopped offering drop bar levers paired to post mount calipers in favor of flat mount. Since this fork was mainly designed for their GMX+ drop bar bike, flat mount made sense – doubly so given that it’s relatively easy to adapt flat to post, but not the other way around. None of this is Curve’s fault; flat mount is just a confusing-ass “standard.” Once I got the puzzle sorted, it was finally time to ride the damn thing.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-1.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Steel Vs Carbon</h3>\n<p>Many on our staff are vocal about their love for steel forks, and they definitely have their merits. I spent a few too many years on Surly steel forks and never enjoyed how much they flexed rearward under braking force, especially when touring loaded. I tend to prefer a more solid-feeling bike for touring. I prefer an aluminum frame for the same reason. The Seek 430 is certainly stiffer than a steel fork, but it still has more than enough compliance. I can see the fork visibly flex under braking and never found it overly harsh – it’s still a rigid bike, which is bumpy no matter what. The flex was pleasant without crossing the line into what I’d found disconcerting in the past: it absorbed enough chatter without being noodly. Some folks prefer that flexy experience (cough, John), but I much prefer the curated feel of the Seek. Curve has done an exquisite job with the layup, balancing weight, compliance, and cargo capacity.</p>\n<p>The big difference between fork materials comes down to weight – the Curve Seek is nearly half the weight of the stock steel fork. Carbon is light, and that’s really all there is to it. While I initially missed the lower rack mounts from my steel fork, it turns out that Curve’s Relaxle features M5 mounts on the interior of the axle, providing a mounting point for racks or fenders. They really nailed the details. I did find that I needed to extend the legs of my trusty Tumbleweed T-Rack, as the axle mount sits just a hair lower than standard dropout braze-on mounts.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-15.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-15.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-15.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-15.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-16.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-16.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-16.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-16.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Tine[sic] to Wrap This Up</h3>\n<p>For many people, spending over $600 on a fork upgrade will sound extravagant, and that is fair. I ride XL frames all the time and seek a way to keep my bike weight in check, so I usually look to carbon forks to cut some heft. In this case, there was literally only a single fork on the market that would work properly with my bike: the Curve Seek 430 FM. I think we are on the cusp of seeing a resurgence of non-suspension-corrected bikes, and Curve  Seek will be ahead of the curve (zing!) if that happens.</p>\n<p>I wanted to make sure people knew just how niche and clutch this fork really was. The Curve Seek 430 FM fork made my whole build come together to complete my dream touring rig. For that, I am thankful Curve decided to extend its steerer tubes!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-14.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-14.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-14.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://images.theradavist.com/uploads/2026/02/2026_Curve_Seek_430_FM_Review-14.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Pros</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>350mm steerer for the tall headtubes!</li>\n<li>Four M5 mounts on each fork blade</li>\n<li>Very Good Mounts are replaceable and robust</li>\n<li>Relaxle features rack mounts in the thru axle</li>\n<li>3.0″ tire clearance</li>\n<li>Lightweight and compliant</li>\n<li>Non-suspension corrected</li>\n<li>Simple and clean design</li>\n<li>Easy external cable routing</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cons</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Adapting flat mount is frustrating, but more importantly, possible</li>\n<li>Carbon is expensive</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/curve-seek-430-fm-fork-review-just-what-i-needed\">Curve Seek 430 FM Fork Review: Just What I Needed</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cms.theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"spencer harding","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"a9545f5547c0ebb475794f177a6833645f843e75a2292e1e10cd1a65453b75f6","category":"Cycling"}
