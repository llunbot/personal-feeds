{"title":"iOS 14.7 Bug May Prevent iPhones With Touch ID From Automatically Unlocking Apple Watch","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/20/ios-14-7-bug-iphone-unlock-apple-watch/","date":1626755785000,"content":"Following the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/19/apple-releases-ios-14-7/\">release of iOS 14.7</a>, watchOS 7.6, and several other operating system updates this week, Apple has acknowledged that <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212615\">a bug in iOS 14.7</a> could prevent users from being able to unlock their Apple Watches by simply unlocking their paired Touch ID-equipped iPhones.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/iphone-unlock-apple-watch.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nApple's temporary workaround for the bug is for the user to type their passcode into their Apple Watch to unlock it rather than relying on their <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, and Apple says the issue will be addressed in a future software update.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nUsers who have forgotten their Apple Watch passcodes will need to reset their Apple Watches. Enterprise users whose iPhones are loaded with MDM profiles that require alphanumeric passcodes will need to work with their MDM administrators to remove the passcode requirement and then unpair, erase, and set up their Apple Watches again.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWe have seen a few signs of iOS 14.7.1 in our site analytics over the past few days, so this will presumably be a relatively short turnaround on a bug fix update rather than a more significant update with an extended beta testing period. We have not seen any sign of a larger iOS 14.8 update in our analytics, and we expect that we will only see minor bug fix updates until Apple officially releases <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a> in a few months.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 6</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-14/\">iOS 14</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-14/\">iPadOS 14</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-14.224\">iOS 14</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/20/ios-14-7-bug-iphone-unlock-apple-watch/\">iOS 14.7 Bug May Prevent iPhones With Touch ID From Automatically Unlocking Apple Watch</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-14-7-bug-may-prevent-iphones-with-touch-id-from-automatically-unlocking-apple-watch.2304817/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=QSjZAyBxgYc:FGk7vrZsuFc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=QSjZAyBxgYc:FGk7vrZsuFc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/QSjZAyBxgYc\" />","author":"Eric Slivka","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"56f66bc031d0678832f8a9964367c1b17efa9fb00f80450a56f29823c7498375","category":"Apple"}
