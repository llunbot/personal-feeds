With less hiring, I’ve made the\ndifficult decision to further reduce the size of our recruiting\nteam. We will let recruiting team members know tomorrow whether\nthey’re impacted. We expect to announce restructurings and layoffs\nin our tech groups in late April, and then our business groups in\nlate May. In a small number of cases, it may take through the end\nof the year to complete these changes. Our timelines for\ninternational teams will also look different, and local leaders\nwill follow up with more details. Overall, we expect to reduce our\nteam size by around 10,000 people and to close around 5,000\nadditional open roles that we haven’t yet hired.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that Facebook’s headcount <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/01/22/apple-avoiding-layoffs\">increased 2.4×</a> (from 36K to 87K) between 2018 and 2022.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/15/facebook-more-layoffs\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"7b53d57286ab4bef0a8141dd39af0da293bcbb93326ab5bc647b5cccb4a8d229","category":"Tech"}
