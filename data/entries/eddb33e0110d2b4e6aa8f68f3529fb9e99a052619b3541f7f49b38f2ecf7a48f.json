alt=\"Broken Shimano crankset\" title=\"Broken Shimano Ultegra 6800 crankset-6\" />                                            <p>A proposed class action lawsuit has been filed against Shimano, Specialized and Trek in the USA in the wake of the massive Hollowtech crankset recall.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://classaction.org/media/erazo-et-al-v-shimano-north-america-bicycle-inc-et-al92.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">The lawsuit</a> alleges the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/opinion/shimano-crankset-recall-analysis/\">crankset recall</a> is “inadequate”, claiming that, by not recalling all Hollowtech cranksets, Shimano is “working hard to limit the cost of fixing the issue at the expense of consumers”.</p>\n<p>The suit also accuses Trek and Specialized of “knowingly and intentionally misrepresenting, omitting, concealing, and/or failing to disclose material facts regarding the quality, reliability, and safety of the cranksets.”</p>\n<h2>“Inadequate recall”</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Broken Shimano crankset\" title=\"Broken Shimano Ultegra 6800 crankset-2\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The lawsuit has been filed after Shimano issued a recall of affected cranksets in the US.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The filing follows a recall of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/shimano-crankset-recall/\">2.8-million cranksets globally</a> after the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission reported 4,519 incidents of cranksets separating, resulting in six injuries.</p>\n<p>Shimano says it will offer riders equivalent replacement cranksets should their cranks fail an inspection process.</p>\n<p>However, riders with cranksets showing no signs of separation are not eligible for a replacement crankset.</p>\n<p>The lawsuit alleges this will leave riders “in the frightening position of having to ride a dangerous bicycle for months or years, waiting on their cranksets to separate and potentially cause a crash before Shimano will give them a new one”.</p>\n<p>Likewise, riders who have already disposed of broken cranksets that they have replaced prior to the recall are not eligible for a replacement crankset or other compensation.</p>\n<h2>Mechanics at risk?</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"The recall programme is being administered by bike shops.\" title=\"BikeRadar_160823_kg0085\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The recall programme is being administered by bike shops.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Kaden Gardener / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>The suit says mechanics are being asked to perform “an important engineering determination” in judging whether a crankset is defective</p>\n<p>It adds: “bicycle mechanics are being asked to make this engineering judgment based solely on a visual inspection, without the benefit of stress testing”.</p>\n<p>The suit alleges mechanics could incur “the potential legal liability in the event a replacement is denied and the Defective Crankset later breaks and causes an injury”.</p>\n<h2>Reduced resale value</h2>\n<p>The suit alleges Shimano and bike brands “fraudulently concealed the Defective Cranksets”.</p>\n<p>This, the suit claims, means riders have been “injured financially” as their bikes “are of a lesser standard, grade and quality than represented”.</p>\n<h2>What happens now?</h2>\n<p>The suit seeks a ruling on, among other things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“A declaration that the Defective Cranksets are defective”</li>\n<li>An award to plaintiffs of “of compensatory, exemplary, and punitive remedies and damages and statutory penalties, including interest, in an amount to be proven at trial”</li>\n<li>A “Defendent-funded program” to reimburse “out-of-pocket and loss-of-use expenses and damages claims associated with the Defective Cranksets”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The suit requests a trial by jury.</p>\n<p>In a statement to BikeRadar, a Shimano spokesperson said the brand “cannot comment on any legal matters at this time”.</p>","author":"Jack
