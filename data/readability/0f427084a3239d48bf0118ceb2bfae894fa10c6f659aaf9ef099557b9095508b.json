That makes it possible to create a full-size bike that folds down into the size of a compact folder with much smaller wheels and tires. But how’d they do it?</p><p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WV7MB3dfh3A?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe></p><p>Tuck Bike’s story starts with its creator, Alex Animashaun drawing on his career in manufacturing and automotive engineering (which includes working on the hybrid Range Rover). As many of these stories go, Alex simply wanted to build a folding bike that he wanted to ride. That meant full-size bike performance but the ability to fold up as small as a traditional folding bike. Clearly, creating a sturdy wheel that could also be folded up would be no easy task.</p><h2>Folding Wheels?</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03094654/Tuck-Bike-folding-full-size-bike-with-folding-wheels-kickstarter-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03094654/Tuck-Bike-folding-full-size-bike-with-folding-wheels-kickstarter-1.jpg\" alt=\"Tuck Bike folding wheel development\" width=\"680\" height=\"433\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03094654/Tuck-Bike-folding-full-size-bike-with-folding-wheels-kickstarter-1.jpg 680w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03094654/Tuck-Bike-folding-full-size-bike-with-folding-wheels-kickstarter-1-297x189.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03094654/Tuck-Bike-folding-full-size-bike-with-folding-wheels-kickstarter-1-120x76.jpg 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"></a></p><p>The design of the wheel itself dates back to 2017 when Alex rode his first folding wheel prototype. To be fair, this isn’t the first folding wheel concept we’ve seen—Revolve teased us with <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2018/01/18/revolve-concept-folds-wheels-not-the-bike-for-compact-commuter/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">folding bike wheels in 2018</a>, but it appears they’ve taken the concept in a different direction, instead creating <a href=\"https://www.revolve-wheel.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wheelchairs with folding wheels</a>.</p><p>After numerous designs, Alex settled on the current design which sort of rotates into thirds rather than “folding”. The rim is reinforced at the ends and they’re held together with locking wedge clamps. Alex claims that the ends of the rim are actually the strongest part of the wheel, and when locked together they’re even stronger. There’s an additional lock at the hub, and the redundancy means that at least three of the four clamps have to be unlocked before any wheel segment can fold up.</p><h2>Airless Rubber Tires</h2><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03094707/Tuck-Bike-folding-full-size-bike-with-folding-wheels-kickstarter-6.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03094707/Tuck-Bike-folding-full-size-bike-with-folding-wheels-kickstarter-6.jpg\" alt=\"Tuck Bike airless gecko tires\" width=\"680\" height=\"378\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03094707/Tuck-Bike-folding-full-size-bike-with-folding-wheels-kickstarter-6.jpg 680w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03094707/Tuck-Bike-folding-full-size-bike-with-folding-wheels-kickstarter-6-297x165.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03094707/Tuck-Bike-folding-full-size-bike-with-folding-wheels-kickstarter-6-120x67.jpg 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"></a></p><p>What about the tires? Well, it seems that the Tuck Bike is equipped with 700c x 27mm airless tires from <a href=\"https://www.geckorubber.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gecko</a>. These are simply cut into thirds, and keep their shape because they’re airless and can’t go flat. Gecko’s patented closed cell rubber tech also means that these tires should grip better than the foam airless tires, and claim to offer all-weather performance from 0°C to 50°C (32°F to 122°F).</p><div id=\"attachment_277247\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03094656/Tuck-Bike-folding-full-size-bike-with-folding-wheels-kickstarter-2.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-277247\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03094656/Tuck-Bike-folding-full-size-bike-with-folding-wheels-kickstarter-2.jpg\" alt=\"Tuck Bike in a skate park\" width=\"1080\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03094656/Tuck-Bike-folding-full-size-bike-with-folding-wheels-kickstarter-2.jpg 1080w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03094656/Tuck-Bike-folding-full-size-bike-with-folding-wheels-kickstarter-2-297x297.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03094656/Tuck-Bike-folding-full-size-bike-with-folding-wheels-kickstarter-2-800x800.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03094656/Tuck-Bike-folding-full-size-bike-with-folding-wheels-kickstarter-2-120x120.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03094656/Tuck-Bike-folding-full-size-bike-with-folding-wheels-kickstarter-2-768x768.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03094656/Tuck-Bike-folding-full-size-bike-with-folding-wheels-kickstarter-2-125x125.jpg 125w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-277247\">Photo c.

Tuck Bike claims that this procedure takes less than two minutes and can be done without tools. In this configuration, the bike will fit in the trunk of compact cars, under your desk, and in other tight spots. Since the wheels are folded, the bike includes caster wheels to roll it around.</p><h2>Geometry, Pricing &amp; Spec</h2><p>https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tuckbike/tuck-bike-the-folding-bike-with-folding-wheels/description</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03094710/Tuck-Bike-folding-full-size-bike-with-folding-wheels-kickstarter-8.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03094710/Tuck-Bike-folding-full-size-bike-with-folding-wheels-kickstarter-8.jpg\" alt=\"Tuck Bike folding geometry\" width=\"680\" height=\"370\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03094710/Tuck-Bike-folding-full-size-bike-with-folding-wheels-kickstarter-8.jpg 680w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03094710/Tuck-Bike-folding-full-size-bike-with-folding-wheels-kickstarter-8-297x162.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/03094710/Tuck-Bike-folding-full-size-bike-with-folding-wheels-kickstarter-8-120x65.jpg 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\"></a></p><p>Currently offered as part of a Kickstarter, Tuck Bikes will be sold in two sizes, medium and large.
