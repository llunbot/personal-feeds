The categories mirror the categories that can be found at the bottom of the app section in the \"Browse Categories\" menu.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe \"Games\" section also has a similar list of categories, such as puzzle, casual, racing, indie, simulation, casino, and adventure. These also mirror the categories at the bottom of the Games tab.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTapping into one of the categories listed in Apps or Games shows apps that are part of that category. Apple previously had these kind of top bar navigation options for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/\">Apple Arcade</a>, but they have been expanded to the other ‌App Store‌ sections.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>New in iOS 17.2: The AppStore now has a tab bar on top of the \"Apps\" and \"Games\" sections with different categories of apps. <br /><br />Spotted by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Johnthenormal?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Johnthenormal</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/AuWqGYmCls\">pic.twitter.com/AuWqGYmCls</a></p>— Aaron (@aaronp613) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1722771032426070186?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 10, 2023</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\nApple is also mirroring the \"Browse Categories\" design first introduced in the ‌Apple Arcade‌ tab. Each category is now a card, with a detailed icon. In <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a> and earlier, categories were just text lists with a simpler icon design.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 17.2 is being beta tested right now and it is expected to see a public release sometime in December.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242\">iPadOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/ios-17-2-beta-app-store/\">App Store in iOS 17.2 Beta Features New Focus on Categories</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/app-store-in-ios-17-2-beta-features-new-focus-on-categories.2410515/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1aa5a4dafe7ee2e7f329f8d3970c077a633494d582526325357668977dab216a","category":"Apple"}
