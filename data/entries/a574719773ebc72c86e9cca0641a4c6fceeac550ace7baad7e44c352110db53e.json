The remastered version of the game continues to be available on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Android.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<b>Update 8:28 pm</b>: As <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/final-fantasy-ios-game-shuts-down-due-to-curious-in-app-purchase-bug.2449335/?post=33735148#post-33735148\">noted by forum member <em>An_mo_</em></a>, Apple made a <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=rzloycgp\">change to the security requirements for App Store receipts</a> that went into effect the day before Square Enix reported receiving complaints, so it appears that may be related to the issue users were experiencing. If so, it still remains unclear why Square Enix was unable to update the app to support the new certificates.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/final-fantasy-in-app-purchase-shutdown/\">Final Fantasy iOS Game Shuts Down Due to Curious In-App Purchase Bug</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/final-fantasy-ios-game-shuts-down-due-to-curious-in-app-purchase-bug.2449335/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a574719773ebc72c86e9cca0641a4c6fceeac550ace7baad7e44c352110db53e","category":"Apple"}
