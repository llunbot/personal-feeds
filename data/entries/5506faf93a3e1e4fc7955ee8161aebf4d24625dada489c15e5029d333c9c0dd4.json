The Quattro Charger Pro 4 is a charging station that boasts four fully fledged 15W Qi2 charging slots.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve reviewed multi-gadget <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668980/best-magsafe-chargers.html\" target=\"_blank\">MagSafe chargers</a> previously, of course, and some could handle four Apple devices. But none wirelessly at the same time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The four charging slots are Qi2 and MagSafe compatible, each with a maximum charging power of 15W. Aside from iPhones from version 12 to 16, the charging slots are also compatible with the Apple AirPods 3 and AirPods Pro 2nd generation and later, as well as with other headphone charging cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Total output is 65W, allowing for each iPhone charging pad to reach its theoretical maximum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our tests, we measured an iPhone 15 reaching a charge of 35% after 30 minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The magnetic hold of the charging stations is excellent, and each is rubberized to protect the resting iPhones. The base of the Quattro Charger Pro 4 is also rubberized, and so stays upright perfectly despite its relatively high weight of 23oz (650g).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has a small footprint for a charging station that can handle four devices at the same time, due to its two-level design. It measures 6.9 x 2.7 x 2.6 inches (17.5 x 6.8 x 6.6cm).</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Zens_QuattroChargerPro4_07.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Zens QuattroChargerPro4 07\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Zens_QuattroChargerPro4_07.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1500w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Zens_QuattroChargerPro4_07.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Zens_QuattroChargerPro4_07.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Zens_QuattroChargerPro4_07.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Zens_QuattroChargerPro4_07.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Zens_QuattroChargerPro4_07.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Thomas Bergbold </p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Price</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The package includes a 65W power supply with connections for EU, U.K., U.S./CA and AU/NZ. The robust connection cable with its fabric coating is 1.5 meters long.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://zens.tech/shop/quattro-charger-pro-4/\">Quattro Charger Pro 4</a> is available in two colors, black and white, for $199.99 / £179.99 / €179.99.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><div><ul><li><figure><img alt=\"Zens Quattro Wireless Charger Pro 4 iPhones 1\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Zens-Quattro-Wireless-Charger-Pro-4-iPhones-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Zens Quattro Wireless Charger Pro 4 AirPods\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Zens-Quattro-Wireless-Charger-Pro-4-AirPods.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li></ul><a></a><a></a><a></a><div></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Verdict</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, a charging manufacturer that thinks about families. Whether it’s the iPhones of a family of four or the AirPods in a central place in the living room, the Quattro Charger Pro 4 solves every charger dispute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Quattro Charger Pro 4 is not only as fast as you would expect from a Qi2 charger, but it also saves space and cable clutter. The system of distributing the charging stations over two floors is something any interior designer would appreciate. The only downside is the relatively high price, which is reflected in the high-quality workmanship and robust design.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"5506faf93a3e1e4fc7955ee8161aebf4d24625dada489c15e5029d333c9c0dd4","category":"Apple"}
