Over the next eight years, Paul set to work and built a small cabin, including a workshop with a modest propane kiln.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Great-Basin-Camp-and-Go-Slow-13.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Great-Basin-Camp-and-Go-Slow-13.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Great-Basin-Camp-and-Go-Slow-13.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Great-Basin-Camp-and-Go-Slow-13.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Great-Basin-Camp-and-Go-Slow-23.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Great-Basin-Camp-and-Go-Slow-23.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Great-Basin-Camp-and-Go-Slow-23.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Great-Basin-Camp-and-Go-Slow-23.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>In the late 1990s, potter Joe Winter moved five miles from Paul Herman, and the two of them began scheming to build a kiln together. With some research and a lucky lead on fire brick, they started building the Anagama-style kiln in 1999. Construction was completed in the spring of 2000, and since then, the kiln has been fired every spring and fall.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Manzanita-Rigid-29er-Klunker-47.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Manzanita-Rigid-29er-Klunker-47.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Manzanita-Rigid-29er-Klunker-47.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Manzanita-Rigid-29er-Klunker-47.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Casey met Paul and Joe in 2004, while still a student. After attending college in 2008, completing a ceramics residency program, and firing kilns around the West, Casey returned to Reno to fire alongside his friends and mentors Paul and Joe and learned to wood fire under their guidance. With Paul’s passing in 2019, Casey took stewardship of Great Basin Pottery.</p>\n<p><em>If you want a deeper dive into Great Basin Pottery, check out <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/pottery-stickers-and-the-eastern-sierra-dream-with-casey-clark-spencer-harding/\" target=\"_blank\">Spencer’s Shop Visit</a> from 2018!</em></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Great-Basin-Camp-and-Go-Slow-39.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Great-Basin-Camp-and-Go-Slow-39.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Great-Basin-Camp-and-Go-Slow-39.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Great-Basin-Camp-and-Go-Slow-39.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Casey and his partner Sarah give Great Basin Pottery a vibe. The two of them are the stewards of the land and the brand. When he’s not slingin’ pots, glazing, or firing, he’s thinking of the next big thing for Campandgoslow…</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Fixed-Gear-Scorcher-Gravel-Bike-43.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Fixed-Gear-Scorcher-Gravel-Bike-43.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Fixed-Gear-Scorcher-Gravel-Bike-43.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Fixed-Gear-Scorcher-Gravel-Bike-43.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Campandgoslow Trout Bar Tape</h3>\n<p>A few years ago, I hit up Casey and told him something I’m sure he had thought about before: “Dude, you need to do a trout tape before someone else does!” Casey lamented something along the lines of, “Yeah, man, I know, but getting the pattern right is hard. I’ve been thinking about doing this for a while, but nothing has inspired me yet. It’ll happen.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Fixed-Gear-Scorcher-Gravel-Bike-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Fixed-Gear-Scorcher-Gravel-Bike-3.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Fixed-Gear-Scorcher-Gravel-Bike-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Fixed-Gear-Scorcher-Gravel-Bike-3.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Then one day, Sarah was in a grocery store, and she spotted a tin of canned fish. The vintage pattern on the can looked interesting, and Sarah snapped a photo of it. Later that night, she showed Casey, and it all just clicked. Casey modified the pattern to make it his own and added some color inspired by Brown Trout to the tape, and viola! The <a href=\"http://www.campandgoslow.com/product/trout-tape-brown\" target=\"_blank\">Campandgoslow Trout Tape</a> was born. The colors were selected to play nice with your favorite leather saddle as well as previously-released Campandgoslow Rattler bags and accessories.</p>\n<p><strong>Trout Tape Specs:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>$44.00 USD</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.campandgoslow.com/product/trout-tape-brown\" target=\"_blank\">Campandgoslow.com</a></li>\n<li>3300 mm length per roll (enough for 62 cm wide bars)</li>\n<li>1.5 mm foam padding</li>\n<li>No plugs, “finishing tape” or other junk included</li>\n<li>Comes packaged in a high-quality mesh drawstring bag</li>\n<li>Tape manufactured in Taiwan, bag cut and sewn in Seattle</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Fixed-Gear-Scorcher-Gravel-Bike-9.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Fixed-Gear-Scorcher-Gravel-Bike-9.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Fixed-Gear-Scorcher-Gravel-Bike-9.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Fixed-Gear-Scorcher-Gravel-Bike-9.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Scorcher</h3>\n<p>The thing I love about Casey is his ability to stay stoked on bikes through all the industry’s pitfalls. Take his Scorcher for instance. Inspired by the original fixed gears of the 1950s, a Scorcher is a drop bar, fat tire, fixed gear bike meant to be ridden on gravel roads. They were huge in the UK and called “Path Racers” back in the late 1890s and throughout the early 1900s. These bikes were ridden on cobbles and dirt roads en route to the velodrome, where they were then raced and ridden home. Oftentimes, these bikes had a single brake caliper, and a toe strap was used to pull on it.</p>\n<p>The term “scorcher” was used by Ibis Cycles to describe the brand’s fixed gear path racer they launched in 1993.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Fixed-Gear-Scorcher-Gravel-Bike-46.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Fixed-Gear-Scorcher-Gravel-Bike-46.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Fixed-Gear-Scorcher-Gravel-Bike-46.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Fixed-Gear-Scorcher-Gravel-Bike-46.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Fixed-Gear-Scorcher-Gravel-Bike-45.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Fixed-Gear-Scorcher-Gravel-Bike-45.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Fixed-Gear-Scorcher-Gravel-Bike-45.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Fixed-Gear-Scorcher-Gravel-Bike-45.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Fixed-Gear-Scorcher-Gravel-Bike-25.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Fixed-Gear-Scorcher-Gravel-Bike-25.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Fixed-Gear-Scorcher-Gravel-Bike-25.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Fixed-Gear-Scorcher-Gravel-Bike-25.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I reached out to Casey to deliver the 411 on this super sweet fixed gear:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Matt Raker (the guy who built this frame) and I were shop mates back in the early aughts, and we worked for a guy who was a former mechanic for the U.S. Olympic Track team. That’s how we were introduced to fixed gears and where I cobbled together my first conversion out of parts bin cast-offs. Old steel frame, suicide lock ring, the whole bit. ‘Fixie’ wasn’t a thing yet, at least around here, and our boss called these fixed-gear road bikes ‘winter trainers’ to differentiate them from proper track bikes. He was always talking up the benefits of riding them in the off-season to stay in shape when the days and rides got shorter. I still use the term.”</p></blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Fixed-Gear-Scorcher-Gravel-Bike-35.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Fixed-Gear-Scorcher-Gravel-Bike-35.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Fixed-Gear-Scorcher-Gravel-Bike-35.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Fixed-Gear-Scorcher-Gravel-Bike-35.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Fixed-Gear-Scorcher-Gravel-Bike-15.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Fixed-Gear-Scorcher-Gravel-Bike-15.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Fixed-Gear-Scorcher-Gravel-Bike-15.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Fixed-Gear-Scorcher-Gravel-Bike-15.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Fixed-Gear-Scorcher-Gravel-Bike-22.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Fixed-Gear-Scorcher-Gravel-Bike-22.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Fixed-Gear-Scorcher-Gravel-Bike-22.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/Fixed-Gear-Scorcher-Gravel-Bike-22.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p> </p>\n<blockquote><p>“20 years later, Matt and I are still tight – bikes are so fucking cool that way) – and he designed this frame for me loosely around the geo of my Black Mountain Cycles Monstercross.
