Musk <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/11/elon-musk-fights-secs-twitter-stock-probe-claims-it-reeks-of-mccarthyism/\">responded in November</a> by asking the court to block the SEC's subpoena, claiming the agency is \"harassing\" him, exceeding its authority to investigate, and making \"overly burdensome\" demands for \"irrelevant evidence.\"</p>\n<p>Musk's arguments were rejected during a hearing yesterday in US District Court for the Northern District of California. No formal ruling has been issued yet, but a magistrate judge made it clear she will rule in the SEC's favor if Musk doesn't appear for testimony.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1991415#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1991415&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"017dda692b496bf8e4929faa41ebd07792a06f781e5700ad01b8071cc920642e","category":"Tech"}
