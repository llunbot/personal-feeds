{"title":"DC Rainmaker Open House 2023 Recap!","link":"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2023/12/rainmaker-open-house-recap.html","date":1703077420000,"content":"<p>Two weekends ago we held the 8th annual DC Rainmaker Cave Open House, where a couple hundred people descended upon the DCR Cave for an evening of sports tech geekery. As usual, they could explore the entire DCR Cave/Studio, and we supplied the free beer, other drinks, food, and even sweet gift bags to everyone in attendance.</p>\n<p>The day was divided up into two parts. First was the morning run, usually about an 8-10KM, looping around some portion of Amsterdam. Then the main event is held in the evening, at the DCR Cave. The idea being that many folks make a weekend out of it, giving reason to visit Amsterdam as a city during the holidays. The whole day is then free for someone to do touristy things (or, just drink beer). In fact, there were people this year flying in from Australia, South Africa, Namibia, India, United States, Canada, and countless more within Europe. All to visit the Netherlands, despite the lack of tulip fields this time of year.</p>\n<p>With that, let’s get into the recap!</p>\n<h3><span><strong>The Morning Run:</strong></span></h3>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_0282.jpeg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/12/IMG_0282-2.jpeg\" width=\"719\" height=\"479\" /></p>\n<p>As has been the case since the first Amsterdam Open House, we’ve met at <a href=\"https://all4running.nl/\">All4Running</a>, a running shop, just at the end of Vondelpark. The store is the perfect spot to start the run, especially in cases like winter where someone needs to add a forgotten pair of gloves or hat. As has also been the case every single year, the weather in Amsterdam got downright cold for the open house weekend. Obviously, this isn’t Finland cold, but each year the weather is perfectly functional till the week of the Open House, then it freezes everyone, before getting warm again the following week (which also happened).</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_0284.jpeg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/12/IMG_0284.jpeg\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" /></p>\n<p>In any case, a quick game plan overview inside, and then out we went for the group photo. This is the first of many tests in ‘not blocking the bike path’, which runs directly in front of the All4Running door. Thankfully, nobody got clipped this year – at least during this portion.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_7703.JPG\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/12/IMG_7703.jpg\" width=\"719\" height=\"479\" /></p>\n<p>From there it was into Vondelpark as one giant group. This part works out fairly well space-wise, as obviously it’s super-wide. For the morning run we had about 50 people or so brave the elements, which is one of the higher run turnouts we’ve had. Again, planning for the win here!</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_7721.JPG\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/12/IMG_7721-1.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" /></p>\n<p>It was a no-drop run, so we kept it together as one big group, banana included:</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_7723.JPG\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/12/IMG_7723.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" /></p>\n<p>Paul, the banana, picks up trash on the ground along the way, with thousands of kilograms picked up each year. You can <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/wayeoflife/?hl=en\">follow along on his adventures on Instagram</a>.</p>\n<p>From there we meandered into the pretty canal areas a bit, sadly, I didn’t take many good photos on this run.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_0294.jpeg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/12/IMG_0294-1.jpeg\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" /></p>\n<p>After that we backtracked towards the Rijksmuseum for a group photo:</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_7743.JPG\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/12/IMG_7743.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p>The iAmsterdam sign is long-gone (<a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2018/12/dcr-open-house-amsterdam-2018-recap-photos-and-videos.html\">we lucked out in 2018, as they removed it the day after that run</a>), but the museum still works as a good backdrop!</p>\n<p>From there we meandered through quieter areas of Amsterdam, attempting to avoid tight sidewalks/paths, but mostly failing. Don’t worry, we only required one Urban Arrow cargo-bike ambulance pickup, when one runner attempted to fly. It was a very short-lived flight, albeit, she enjoyed the Des cargo bike ride back.</p>\n<p>Oh, and it’s critical to point out Harry was once again in attendance! He has made every single Open House run since the first one Paris back in 2014.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_0316.jpeg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/12/IMG_0316.jpeg\" width=\"360\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p>All in we <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/10314949428\">clocked up about 9KM, per Strava</a>. Sometimes we do a loop around the stadium (inside or outside), but with the larger group I tweaked the path a bit earlier in the run to divert off of some of the skinner paths to connect those two areas, thus skipping that this year.</p>\n<p>Oh, and again, a huge thanks to the All4Running crew for both the space and their hospitality.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_0324.jpeg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/12/IMG_0324.jpeg\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" /></p>\n<p>Definitely <a href=\"https://all4running.nl/\">give them a visit</a> if you’re in town (or, if you’re a local), for all your running-goody needs!</p>\n<h3><span><strong>Evening Open House:</strong></span></h3>\n<p>This was easily the biggest DCR Open House we’ve had to date – largely on account of opening it up a bit earlier, and then probably also better update/managing of the registration/waitlist/etc on our part – letting more people get a spot.</p>\n<p>In any event, the…well…event, started around 7PM at the DCR Cave. Folks were free to wander around and check out the tech, including jumping on the various trainers and bikes sitting in the main studio area. Essentially the downstairs of the DCR Cave is a big open space (which I mainly use for long term storage/events/treadmills), and the upstairs is the main studio/office/storage area. Here’s the downstairs portion.</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_0380.jpeg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/12/IMG_0380.jpeg\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" /></p>\n<p>We had a bar setup in the back near the gondola, with both regular beer/wine/soda/water, but also more importantly, a custom IPA made by one of our brewmaster friends. It was officially named “IP-rAy” (obviously, I don’t come up with these things, that’s the territory of my wife).</p>\n<p><img title=\"DSC_9440.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/12/DSC_9440.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p>And to top it off, we also had custom DC Rainmaker beer glasses:</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_0408.jpeg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/12/IMG_0408.jpeg\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" /></p>\n<p>Here’s a closer look:</p>\n<p><img title=\"DSC_0370.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/12/DSC_0370.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p>Also downstairs was a giant Spanish ham leg, which both DesFit and our friend Julio volunteered to ‘carve’ for many many hours.</p>\n<p><img title=\"DSC_9488-Enhanced-NR.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/12/DSC_9488-Enhanced-NR.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p>Here’s what it looked like when Des first started:</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_0361.jpeg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/12/IMG_0361.jpeg\" width=\"360\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p>And of course – just lots of good conversation, about both tech and non-tech things alike!</p>\n<p><img title=\"DSC_0361-Enhanced-NR.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/12/DSC_0361-Enhanced-NR.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p>Meanwhile, upstairs was all about the gadgets – with folks able to try a number of bikes and trainers. This here being the KICKR BIKE SHIFT, running Fulgaz:</p>\n<p><img title=\"DSC_9414.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/12/DSC_9414.jpg\" width=\"719\" height=\"479\" /></p>\n<p>As well as the Zwift Hub One (the new one with the Zwift Cog). And then also the KICKR Bike V2, in case you wanted to compare the more expensive BIKE V2 to the less expensive but newer BIKE SHIFT.</p>\n<p><img title=\"DSC_9594.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/12/DSC_9594.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p>Of course, plenty of conversation as well – including chats with fellow sports tech YouTuber’s Des &amp; Matt Legrand:</p>\n<p><img title=\"DSC_9582-Enhanced-NR.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/12/DSC_9582-Enhanced-NR-1.jpg\" width=\"719\" height=\"479\" /></p>\n<p>Speaking of which, here’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@mlegrand\">Sports Tech YouTuber Matt Legrand</a>, he was hanging out on the stairs – deciding his next move, when caught by the camera.</p>\n<p><img title=\"DSC_0035-Enhanced-NR.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/12/DSC_0035-Enhanced-NR.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p>Also upstairs was the wall of bikes. As always, the Canyon Grail handlebars get quite a bit of attention, even these many years later. Or, maybe it’s all the bike computer mounts on them.</p>\n<p><img title=\"DSC_9437.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/12/DSC_9437.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p>Soon though it was time for the Q&amp;A and prize giveaways. So, this photo was as we were rounding people up downstairs before we started the good stuff!</p>\n<p><img title=\"DSC_9602-Enhanced-NR.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/12/DSC_9602-Enhanced-NR.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p>We alternated a slate of prizes/giveaways we had, along with doing what is essentially a podcast-style Q&amp;A from attendees. We even recorded it this year, albeit, I haven’t gotten around to editing it.</p>\n<p><img title=\"DSC_9666-Enhanced-NR.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/12/DSC_9666-Enhanced-NR.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><img title=\"DSC_9962-Enhanced-NR.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/12/DSC_9962-Enhanced-NR.jpg\" width=\"355\" height=\"237\" /> <img title=\"DSC_0002-Enhanced-NR.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/12/DSC_0002-Enhanced-NR.jpg\" width=\"355\" height=\"237\" /></p>\n<p>On the prize goodness, we had a few awesome companies step-up and provide boatloads of items. Both major prize bags, but also goodie bags for everyone as they left.</p>\n<p>First up is <a href=\"https://www.precisionhydration.com/eu/en/\">Precision Fuel &amp; Hydration</a>. They make the various hydration/nutrition products that both my wife and I use for our endurance training and racing (see our Gear I Use lists). And yes, we still buy all our own stuff! They’ve sponsored a few DCR Open House events over the past few years, and we’re super grateful to them!</p>\n<p><img title=\"DSC_9500-Enhanced-NR.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/12/DSC_9500-Enhanced-NR.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p>Then we’ve got <a href=\"https://assmagic.com/\">Ass Magic</a>. They make chamois cream which my wife swears by for her riding. She loves it, and has entirely changed her outlook on riding (whereas before she didn’t entirely love long rides). Ass Magic also contributed to our gift bags for all attendees, everyone get travel snap packs of both chamois cream and anti chafe cream. The Girl stashed both of said snap-pack products her transition bags this year while racing. Good stuff!</p>\n<p><img title=\"DSC_9504-Enhanced-NR.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/12/DSC_9504-Enhanced-NR.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p>And lastly, thanks to <a href=\"https://www.brooksrunning.com/\">Brooks Running</a> as well, who also provided a bunch of giveaway items for prizes!</p>\n<p><img title=\"DSC_0116.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/12/DSC_0116.jpg\" width=\"720\" height=\"624\" /></p>\n<p>Again, I’ll try and get that 75-minute or so Q&amp;A session edited up somewhere. At least for <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/support\">DCR Supporters</a>, if not everyone. Especially this moment here with some women’s-only giveaways (involving throwing of things) that ended…hilariously.</p>\n<p><img title=\"DSC_0278-Enhanced-NR.jpg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/12/DSC_0278-Enhanced-NR.jpg\" width=\"719\" height=\"479\" /></p>\n<p>Finally, I need to do a huge thanks to <a href=\"https://instagram.com/p1edra\">Jonas</a>, who volunteered to grab one of my DSLR cameras and take the vast majority of these photos. In fact, about 1,100 photos in total! Insanity, but also amazing. Almost as amazing as our near identical shirts we both independently selected:</p>\n<p><img title=\"IMG_0417.jpeg\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/12/IMG_0417.jpeg\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\" /></p>\n<p>Now, if you missed the behind the scenes tour that tech YouTuber Matt Legrand did, he came by after the event as well, and we poked and prodded at the DCR Cave:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Thanks again to everyone that came out, we really appreciate it!
