{"title":"NSO Group iMessage Zero-Click Exploit Captured in the Wild, Patched by Apple","link":"https://citizenlab.ca/2021/09/forcedentry-nso-group-imessage-zero-click-exploit-captured-in-the-wild/","date":1631722804000,"content":"\n<p>Citizen Lab:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In March 2021, we examined the phone of a Saudi activist who has\nchosen to remain anonymous, and determined that they had been\nhacked with NSO Group’s Pegasus spyware. During the course of the\nanalysis we obtained an iTunes backup of the device.</p>\n\n<p>Recent re-analysis of the backup yielded several files with the\n“.gif” extension in Library/SMS/Attachments that we determined\nwere sent to the phone immediately before it was hacked with NSO\nGroup’s Pegasus spyware.</p>\n\n<p>Because the format of the files matched two types of crashes we\nhad observed on another phone when it was hacked with Pegasus, we\nsuspected that the “.gif” files might contain parts of what we are\ncalling the FORCEDENTRY exploit chain.</p>\n\n<p>Citizen Lab forwarded the artifacts to Apple on Tuesday, September\n7. On Monday, September 13, Apple confirmed that the files\nincluded a zero-day exploit against iOS and MacOS. They designated\nthe FORCEDENTRY exploit CVE-2021-30860, and describe it as\n“processing a maliciously crafted PDF may lead to arbitrary code\nexecution.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The files with the “.gif” extension weren’t actually GIF files — they were carefully-crafted malformed PSD and PDF files that triggered image processing bugs. What makes attacks like this particularly dastardly is that the victim apparently doesn’t even see anything. It’s invisible.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/15/nso-group-imessage-exploit\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"c15302fb1c41e82fe0ddac80cf1b4827925efb2b282be96c6573f08285c26f5e","category":"Tech"}
