While we primarily cover cycling, my interests don’t stop there. Many of my favorite springtime activities surround the Colorado Plateau’s canyons and rivers; two places you cannot take a bike, or rather, including a bike in those activities seems unnecessary. I love bikerafting and incorporating a bicycle in lieu of a car for shuttling, but sometimes nothing beats a bipedal venture into those wild and vast places.</em></p>\n<p><em>Walking in canyons is my detox from the sometimes stressful job of talking about, photographing, living, breathing, and eating bikes. It’s a tangential experience, but when you do enough, you quickly realize the best places in the American West, particularly Canyon Country, are only accessible by foot.</em></p>\n<p><em>Last week Cari and I brought along our friends Jay and Carrie on a backpacking trip down the Paria River Canyon. Jay and Carrie had never been to the Colorado Plateau, much less in a canyon, and had never backpacked in the desert. Widening our friends’ perspectives has been a real joy being closer to these places living in Santa Fe, and the trip provided equal parts  beauty, tough terrain, and ideal weather.<span></span></em></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-38.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-38.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-38.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-38.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-38.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-38.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-38.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-38.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Wild and Vast Places by Foot</h3>\n<p>While bicycle touring and bikepacking require thousands of dollars of gear, backpacking is an arguably more accessible activity, particularly with the abundance of second-hand gear stores. Due to the proliferation of backpacks and equipment, you can easily get everything you need for a three- or four-day trek for well under $1000. For this reason, backpacking is a wildly popular activity with a lower barrier to entry than bike touring. There’s no bike to maintain, just your feet and an adequately packed kit.</p>\n<p>The same equipment I use on these trips is what I bring on my bike tours: my tent, sleeping bag, pad, stove, and food are all lightweight, and my apparel is comfortable yet ideal for multiple back-to-back 12-hour days: trail runners instead of hiking boots, lightweight UV hoodies over jerseys, and running shorts over riding shorts. Add trekking poles for stability when crossing rivers and scrambling on slickrock escarpments, and you’ve got a great kit to meander along the map.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-33.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-33.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-33.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-33.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-33.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-33.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-33.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-33.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><em>On this and every trip in Canyon Country, we had to pack our human waste with wag bags. Don’t go to Canyon Country if you don’t want to use wag bags. <a href=\"https://lnt.org/why/7-principles/?gad=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjwsIejBhDOARIsANYqkD1ChA_rqopK3kvRMOr-evPSCaPCBNzh1wgKghv4K7vd0BhUhj3TD3caAu_8EALw_wcB\" target=\"_blank\">Leave no trace principles</a> differ in these parts, and federal law often requires it on many hikes. </em></p>\n<p>What is most important to me with backpacking is the rate at which you travel. Fifteen miles is a big day in rugged terrain. Throughout those miles, you form an intimate experience with flora and fauna, taking in vistas, spotting petroglyphs on the cliffs, and identifying flowers, cacti, lizards, and geologic shifts. Most canyon hikes follow a river, and as such, you lose elevation, taking a literal carved path through geologic layers, exposing the rich history of sedimentary layers like a sliced cake.</p>\n<p>My favorite part about walking wild places is your connection with the landscape. I’ve written about <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/a-discussion-about-wilderness-backpacking-and-fly-fishing-in-northern-new-mexico/\" target=\"_blank\">colonization and how we describe the land</a> before and throughout many of our canyon treks over the years; ancestral sites are very present with cliff houses, story panels, and the like scattered throughout the landscape as evidence of human civilization.</p>\n<p><em>What these places and drawings mean isn’t as important to me as the fact that they are still here for us to behold.</em></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-35.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-35.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-35.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-35.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-35.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-35.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-35.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-35.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Paria Canyon</h3>\n<p>In 1984 Congress created the Paria Canyon–Vermilion Cliffs Wilderness to keep these lands forever protected for all to enjoy. When permits open yearly, we scramble to get our hands on multi-day hikes in canyons. We’ve completed several trips over the years, but Paria has been on our list for some time. We finally nabbed four permits this year between the runoff and monsoon season and crossed our fingers for ideal weather. This hike traverses the Paria Canyon-Vermilion Cliffs Wilderness Area and follows the Paria River. There are three entry points via Buckskin, Wire Pass, or White House. Due to rain, quicksand, and our time window, we opted for White House to be our entry into the canyon.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-7.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-7.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-7.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-7.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-7.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-7.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-7.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-7.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Paria Canyon’s overpowering scenery, diverse and lively desert wildlife, and geologic wonders are just a few reasons this hike is in high demand.

It is a strike valley aligned with the Echo Cliffs monocline.  This northwest-trending monocline has over a mile of abrupt uplift, rising from the Paria River, a perennial stream. The river starts in Bryce Canyon and eventually dumps into the Colorado River at Lees Ferry.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1333\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-15.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-15.jpg?w=1333&amp;quality=75 1333w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-15.jpg?resize=1024,1536&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-15.jpg?resize=768,1152&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-15.jpg?resize=700,1050&amp;quality=75 700w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1333\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-23.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-23.jpg?w=1333&amp;quality=75 1333w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-23.jpg?resize=1024,1536&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-23.jpg?resize=768,1152&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-23.jpg?resize=700,1050&amp;quality=75 700w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1333\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-22.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-22.jpg?w=1333&amp;quality=75 1333w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-22.jpg?resize=1024,1536&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-22.jpg?resize=768,1152&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-22.jpg?resize=700,1050&amp;quality=75 700w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1333\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-24.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-24.jpg?w=1333&amp;quality=75 1333w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-24.jpg?resize=1024,1536&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-24.jpg?resize=768,1152&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-24.jpg?resize=700,1050&amp;quality=75 700w\" /></p>\n<h3>Trip Reportage</h3>\n<p>Knowing that <a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/sports/2023/03/16/even-before-utah-slot-canyon/\" target=\"_blank\">a few people died on this hike a few months ago</a> and a dozen were air-evacuated, our eyes were peeled on the weather.

As such, paying attention to the weather is paramount, as is asking the rangers about any potential flash flooding risk and listening to your gut. If it looks like a storm is coming, seek higher ground. Don’t wait for the water to come rushing…</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-66.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-66.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-66.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-66.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-66.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-66.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-66.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-66.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><strong>We’ve spent a lot of time in the desert canyons and have followed some simple principles:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Never camp in a wash or low-lying areas.</li>\n<li>Try to camp in designated spots, at least 200′ away from water or on solid surfaces like rock escarpments. In canyons, this isn’t easy, but be mindful.</li>\n<li>Pack out human waste in wag bags.</li>\n<li>Bring a Garmin InReach with the ability to receive a daily weather report. Ping the weather each night.</li>\n<li>Filter all drinking water.</li>\n<li>Read the ranger station literature, as many springs are contaminated with uranium.</li>\n<li>Always bring enough food for an extra day or two.</li>\n<li>Don’t camp directly on water sources, as canyon animals drink from them too.</li>\n<li>Test surfaces before stepping on them. Quicksand, rock crumbles, and mud can lead to injuries.

Camping close to springs makes everything easier. <em>“But you’re right by a river; why do you need a spring?”</em> The thing about the Paria River is it rarely is clear enough to filter. Silt will clog filters, so it’s best to bring a waterproof bag or even a bear box to fill and let the silt settle before filtering. Or, in this case, look for springs…</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-47.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-47.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-47.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-47.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-47.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-47.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-47.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-47.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-130-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-130-scaled.jpg?w=2560&amp;quality=75 2560w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-130-scaled.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-130-scaled.jpg?resize=2000,1333&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-130-scaled.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-130-scaled.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-130-scaled.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-130-scaled.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-130-scaled.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-130-scaled.jpg?resize=2048,1365&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-51.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-51.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-51.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-51.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-51.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-51.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-51.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-51.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Springs can be found by looking for plants growing from the canyon walls. The water typically runs down the rock face and pools along the wall. Sometimes, these pools are big enough to filter from, and other times, you have to make a little trough and line it with rocks to make a pool so you can filter. Also, be wary of quicksand as it typically surrounds these freshwater springs. Luckily, from mile ten through mile twenty-five, freshwater springs are abundant and are also marked on most maps. Some are big enough to wade into for filtering.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-48.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-48.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-48.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-48.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-48.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-48.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-48.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-48.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>When we encountered people who don’t typically hike in these dry and arid places, they seemed overwhelmed with the “lack of water”–this is not the case. If there are cottonwood trees or willows, there is water to be had. One spring we used was deep enough to wade through to filter from the source directly. On this trip, we carried up to 6L of water when it got scarce towards the end, just to be sure. For the days when it was in abundance, 3L sufficed.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-61.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-61.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-61.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-61.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-61.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-61.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-61.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-61.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-56.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-56.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-56.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-56.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-56.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-56.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-56.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-56.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-77.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-77.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-77.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-77.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-77.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-77.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-77.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/PariaCanyon-77.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>We encountered several Desert Spiny Lizards, numerous Whiptails, Collared Lizards, and Leopard Lizards.

Remember, though; this is Cougar country! Keep your wits about you.
