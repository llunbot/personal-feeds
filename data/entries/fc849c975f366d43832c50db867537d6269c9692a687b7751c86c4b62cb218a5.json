However, the quantity\nand taxonomy of bacteria found on the wristbands in this\nexperiment show that there is a need for regular and popular\nsanitation of these surfaces. Generally, it was found that rubber\nand plastic wristbands had higher bacterial counts, while metal\nones, especially gold and silver, had little to no bacteria.\nBacteria found were common skin residents, of the genera\nStaphylococcus and Pseudomonas, and intestinal symbionts, like of\nthe genera Escherichia. The ability of many of these bacteria to\nsignificantly affect the health of immunocompromised hosts\nindicates a special need for healthcare workers and others in\nhospital environments to regularly sanitize these surfaces. Common\nhousehold disinfectants, such as Lysol Disinfectant Spray, 70%\nEthanol, and Heinz Apple Cider Vinegar all proved at least\nsomewhat effective on all materials (rubber, plastic, cloth, and\nmetal), although antibacterial efficacy was significantly\nincreased at two minutes compared to thirty seconds.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>“Apple” appears 14 times in the report; all 14 are references to using apple cider vinegar as a cleanser. Yet here’s how the New York Post ran with it: “<a href=\"https://nypost.com/2023/08/17/apple-watch-fitbit-wristbands-carry-shocking-levels-of-bacteria-experts/\">Apple Watch, Fitbit Wristbands Carry Shocking Levels of Bacteria: Experts</a>”.
