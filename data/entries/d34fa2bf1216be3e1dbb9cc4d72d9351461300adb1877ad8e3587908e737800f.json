{"title":"Apple’s Phil Schiller Refuses to Fix App Review and “Needs to Get His Meaty Paws Off the App Store” - Mobilegamer.biz","link":"https://mobilegamer.biz/apples-phil-schiller-refuses-to-fix-app-review-and-needs-to-get-his-meaty-paws-off-the-app-store/","date":1687568874000,"content":"\n<p>Neil Long, writing at Mobilegamer.biz, has an interesting interview with Phillip Shoemaker, who ran App Store review at Apple from 2009 to 2016:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple’s app review process remains a huge problem for mobile\ngame-makers as they navigate vague guidelines and inconsistent\nrulings. So we asked Shoemaker for his thoughts on how Apple\ncan fix it:</p>\n\n<p>“The way to solve that inconsistency — and I hate to say it — is: let’s take a page from Google,” he told us. “Especially now\nwith the AI tools that are out there. You can do probably 80% of\nthe work the review team does.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the era of app stores, it’s seemed pretty clear that Apple’s has had <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/03/teabot-data-steal-google-play/\">fewer problems with malware slipping through</a> than <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/android-password-stealing-malware-infects-100-000-google-play-users/\">Google’s</a>. I’m not aware of a single iOS developer who doesn’t think the App Store, especially review, can and should be improved in numerous ways. But neither “<em>make it more like the Play Store</em>” nor “<em>use AI for review</em>” sound right to me.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Schiller appears to be the last holdout when it comes to\nautomating app review compared to Apple SVPs Eddy Cue, Greg ‘Joz’\nJoswiak and App Store VP Matt Fischer.\n“I think the way to radically improve the App Store is have Phil\nbe an Apple fellow and get his hands off the App Store,” says\nShoemaker. “That’s what they really need to do. Eddy’s more\nprogressive, Joz is more progressive, and we know Matt is as well.\nPhil just needs to get his meaty paws off the App Store.”</p>\n\n<p>“If Phil doesn’t step back, it’ll absolutely be the courts making\nchanges,” Shoemaker continues.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If I worked at Apple I’d print up a “Meaty Paws” sign and tape it to Schiller’s door.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Phil needs to step back, I think that’s the main thing — new\nblood needs to come in there and make some changes because cutting\nthe price and opening up the guidelines to allow new interesting\nthings is going to be critical.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Phil Schiller, of course, is the executive <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2021/06/app_store_the_schiller_cut\">who suggested decreasing Apple’s rake in a memo back in 2011</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“It was tough working for Phil…he was one of those guys that would\nlove to throw insults at people, right? I mean he had no\nboundaries — he’d insult your children and you’re like: ‘Why am I\nworking at this company again?’”</p>\n\n<p>Shoemaker would regularly get feedback from his kids on apps and\ngames and use that feedback in the ERB meetings. “Phil would say\nthings like, oh, that’s a stupid thing to say, are your kids that\ndumb? And you’re like, are you freaking kidding me?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Seems like the two Phils did not get along. No word from Shoemaker on whether <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2010/08/apple-fart-apps/\">iWiz is coming back to the App Store</a>, either.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/23/shoemaker-schiller\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d34fa2bf1216be3e1dbb9cc4d72d9351461300adb1877ad8e3587908e737800f","category":"Tech"}
