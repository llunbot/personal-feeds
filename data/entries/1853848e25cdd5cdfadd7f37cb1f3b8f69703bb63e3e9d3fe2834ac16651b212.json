                      <p>With the 2023 Giro d’Italia in its mountainous third week, the climbers are, unsurprisingly coming to the fore.</p>\n<p>One such rider is Movistar Team’s Colombian climber, Einer Rubio.</p>\n<p>Having already won a stage at <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/how-to-watch-giro-ditalia/\">this year’s opening Grand Tour</a>, Rubio is sitting just outside the top ten in the general classification.</p>\n<p>With more mountains to come in the final days of racing, Rubio will likely be hoping to take full advantage of his prowess on the climbs and improve his overall position in the race, or to take another prestigious stage victory.</p>\n<p>To help facilitate that, his team sponsors have pulled out all the stops to create a bike that’s light, aero and fit for long days in the mountains.</p>\n<h2>An aero road bike fit for a climber</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"SRAM Red eTap AXS groupset on Einer Rubio's Movistar Team Canyon

href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/canyon-ultimate-cfr-di2-2023-review/\">Canyon Ultimate CFR</a>), Rubio has instead opted to use the German brand’s aero road bike, the Aeroad CFR.</p>\n<p>Though we weren’t able to weigh the bike, given the feathery, 7.3kg weight of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/canyon-aeroad-cfr-di2-review/\">size M Aeroad CFR we reviewed in 2021</a>, we can likely assume Rubio’s size 2XS bike weighs very close to the UCI’s minimum weight limit of 6.8kg, perhaps even with pedals and accessories.</p>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"SRAM Red eTap AXS front derailleur on Einer Rubio's Movistar Team Canyon Aeroad CFR at the 2023 Giro d'Italia\"

extreme lengths we saw during the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/tour-down-under-prologue-time-trial-tech/\">prologue time trial at the 2023 Tour Down Under</a>,

terms of rolling stock, Rubio has the good fortune of being able to choose from Zipp and Continental’s ranges of wheels and tyres.</p>\n<p>For stage 18, which included more than 4,000 metres of climbing over its 161km length, Rubio opted for a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/wheels/wheel-sets/zipp-353-nsw-wheelset-review/\">Zipp 353 NSW</a> wheelset, shod with 700x28c

Media</i></span></div>\n<p>These flagship carbon wheels use a sawtooth rim shape inspired by the tubercles found on humpback whale fins.</p>\n<p>According to Zipp, this helps improve the aerodynamic efficiency of the rims without impacting handling or weight to the same extent as a uniform increase in rim depth.</p>\n<p>At just 1,304g a pair and with an RRP of £3,200, it’s a super light and super expensive wheelset – not that the latter matters much to a pro rider such as Rubio, of course.</p>\n<h2>Light finishing kit… and mid-range pedals?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\"

a mid-range model, which sits below the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/pedals/look-keo-blade-aero-road-pedals-review/\">Keo Blade</a> in Look’s range of <a
