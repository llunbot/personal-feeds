{"title":"Tactic Racing launches with featherweight 215g hubs","link":"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/tactic-racing-hubs/","date":1639747277000,"content":"<img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/12/Tactic-Racing-hubs-8-7ecdcaf.jpg?quality=45&amp;resize=620,413\" />                                            <p>Are these some of the lightest, stiffest and fastest hubs around? Tactic Racing, an offshoot of Princeton CarbonWorks, has launched a new hub set with a claimed weight of 215g, ceramic bearings and a new freehub design said to improve engagement.</p>\n<p>Princeton CarbonWorks is best known for its wavy rims, used by <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/tour-de-france-2021-tech-round-up/\">Team Ineos-Grenadiers at times during the 2021 season</a>, and the company has branched out into making its own hubs.</p>\n<p>The 215g headline weight is for the pair (64g front, 151g rear for the disc version), which Tactic says is more than 50g lighter than DT Swiss’s latest 180 flagship hubs.</p>\n<p>The freehub, meanwhile, offers 45-point engagement and a patent-pending conical design that apparently results in a larger contact area than any other freehub on the market.</p>\n<p>The price? £1,000 / $1,300 / €1,150 / AU$1,850 for the pair.</p>\n<h2>How light?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tactic Racing’s new disc brake hubs come with a claimed weight of only 215g.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tactic Racing</i></span></div>\n<p>The hub shells are the key to the feathery overall weight, with each CNC-machined from a solid billet of aluminium using a 5-axis machining process that takes more than three hours per hub. The result looks impressive in Tactic’s photos, at least.</p>\n<p>Tactic tells us the design is engineered to combine high strength and low weight, so the hubs have no rider weight limit, can be used on- or off-road, and are rated for day-to-day use.</p>\n<p>All of this makes the claimed weight of 64g for the front hub and 151g for the rear even more impressive – if, as ever, they stand up to abuse.</p>\n<h2>Freehub fans</h2>\n<div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/12/Tactic-Racing-hubs-2-9657224.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The freehub uses a conical ratchet mechanism said to improve engagement.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Tactic Racing</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/12/Tactic-Racing-d92a003.jpeg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The ratchet is backed by a spring.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Tactic Racing</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>The freehub comes with a new patent-pending design, which also contributes to weight reduction while improving engagement, according to Tactic.</p>\n<p>Instead of a traditional setup of gear and pawls, the simplified design uses a powerful spring and two conical gear faces that, Tactic claims, offer a larger contact area.</p>\n<p>The concentrically aligned design also ensures the mating components always engage smoothly, according to Tactic, and will apparently extend the lifetime of the component parts.</p>\n<h2>Bearing down</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tactic has opted for ABEC 7 ceramic bearings.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tactic Racing</i></span></div>\n<p>Tactic’s hubs come with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/ceramic-bearings/\">ceramic bearings</a> with a tungsten disulphide low-friction coating (apparently used on Mars rovers, if that’s your thing, although we’re not sure it’s entirely relevant here!).</p>\n<p>The bearings are ABEC 7 graded, which may not mean a lot, unless you enjoy skateboarding, where ABEC bearing arguments have been rife for decades.</p>\n<p>The ABEC scale was developed by the Annular Bearings Engineering Committee as the standard for the tolerance of a ball bearing, rated in odd numbers from 1 to 9, with 9 offering the tightest tolerances.</p>\n<p>Now, a lower grade isn’t necessarily a grade of quality, it’s just for some applications closer tolerances aren’t necessarily what’s required. At the top end of the scale, an ABEC 9 bearing has an accuracy of 0.0012mm (compared to 0.0075mm for ABEC 1).</p>\n<h2>Specs and prices</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tactic Racing is an offshoot of Princeton CarbonWorks.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tactic Racing</i></span></div>\n<p>Tactic hubs will be available in 24/24 and 28/28 spoke configurations initially, with 16/20-hole options coming down the line for the front and 24 for the rear.</p>\n<p>The brand will offer disc and rim brake variants, with SRAM XDR, Shimano 11-speed and Shimano 12-speed freehubs available at launch. Campagnolo options are coming soon, according to Tactic.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> There are SRAM XDR, Shimano 11-speed and Shimano 12-speed freehub options available at launch, with Campagnolo to come.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tactic Racing</i></span></div>\n<p>They won’t come cheap, however, with the price set at £1,000 / $1,300 / €1,150 / AU$1,850 for a pair.
