Bloomberg reports the company is <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-05-22/wearable-ai-startup-humane-is-said-to-explore-potential-sale\">seeking a sale</a> after its first and only product launch was a big flop. Despite seemingly having nothing else in the pipeline and the AI Pin being dead on arrival, Bloomberg reports the company is \"seeking a price of between $750 million and $1 billion in a sale.\" Humane was founded by two ex-Apple employees, Imran Chaudhri and Bethany Bongiorno, in 2018 and has raised $230 million from some big-name investors like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.</p>\n<p>The Humane AI Pin <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/humane-ai-pin-a-700-voice-command-box-definitely-wont-replace-your-phone/2/\">immediately seemed</a> like an idea that only made sense in a VC pitch room. The device is a wearable voice command box and camera that you magnetically clip onto a shirt, sort of like a Star Trek communicator. It wanted to replace your smartphone yet had no traditional display, and the company bragged in the launch video: \"We don't do apps.\" That means you're left with mostly voice commands for whatever the voice command system can process. You could press on the front and ask a question. The camera could also be involved in a \"what's this thing?\" capacity.</p>\n<p>While there was no onboard display, it did have a one-color 720p laser projection system that would project onto your hand. The UI looked just like a smartwatch, and you controlled it with the same hand you're using as a projection screen. You could tilt your palm around to select something and tap your fingers together to confirm, all the while distorting and moving the \"display\" being projected onto your hand. The smartwatch-like UI raises the question: \"Why not just wear a smartwatch instead?\" Then you'd have real apps, a real display, a less-weird form factor, better input, and better voice commands, and it would probably cost less. Oh, yeah, about that price: The Humane AI Pin was $700 <em>plus</em> a $24-a-month subscription fee, while an Apple Watch Series 9 is $400.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026234#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026234&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cea4f3cbe86c3f5a668dc60b84f35c75a63a4d4b2ee75752a638532abe0f50e2","category":"Tech"}
