Silicon transistors are either conducting or they're not, and so we've developed a whole world of math and logical operations around those binary capabilities. And, for the most part, quantum computing has been developing along similar lines, using qubits that, when measured, will be found in one of two states.</p>\n<p>In some cases, the use of binary values is a feature of the object being used to hold the qubit. For example, a technology called dual-rail qubits takes its value from which of two linked resonators holds a photon. But there are many other quantum objects that have access to far more than two states—think of something like all the possible energy states an electron could occupy when orbiting an atom. We can use things like this as qubits by only relying on the lowest two energy levels. But there's nothing stopping us from using more than two.</p>\n<p>In Wednesday's issue of Nature, researchers describe creating qudits, the generic term for systems that hold quantum information—it's short for quantum digits. Using a system that can be in three or four possible states (qutrits and ququarts, respectively), they demonstrate the first error correction of higher-order quantum memory.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/beyond-qubits-meet-the-qutrit-and-ququart/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/beyond-qubits-meet-the-qutrit-and-ququart/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"900447d5644f8d7be91c6c3dc3c46415419e7547a68a4235f816a4db6c68790a","category":"Tech"}
