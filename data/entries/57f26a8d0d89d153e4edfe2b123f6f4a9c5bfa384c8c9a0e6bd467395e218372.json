We spoke about budget issues, Artemis Program timelines, and NASA's role as a soft power in global diplomacy. What follows is a very lightly edited transcript of the conversation between Senior Space Editor Eric Berger and Nelson.</p>\n<p><strong>Ars Technica</strong>:<em> I wanted to start with NASA's budget for next year. <a href=\"https://www.planetary.org/space-policy/nasas-fy-2025-budget\">We've now seen the numbers</a> from the House of Senate, and NASA is once again facing some cuts. And I'm just wondering, what are your big concerns as we get into the final budgeting process this fall</em>?</p>\n<p><strong>Administrator Bill Nelson</strong>: Well, the big concern is that you can't put 10 pounds of potatoes in a five-pound sack. When you get cut $4.7 billion over two years, and when $2 billion of that over two years is just in science, then you have to start making some hard choices. Now, I understand the reasons for the cuts. Had I still been a member of the Senate I would've voted for it simply because they were held hostage by a small group in the House to get what they wanted. Which was reduced appropriations in order to raise the artificial, statutory budget debt ceiling in order for the government not to go into default. That's part of the legislative process. It's part of the compromises that go on. It happened over a year ago, and it was called the Fiscal Responsibility Act. The price for doing that wasn't cuts across the entire budget. Remember, two-thirds of the budget is entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare, and it certainly wasn't in defense. So, all the cuts came out of everything left over, including NASA. I'm hoping that we're going to get a reprieve come fiscal year '26 when we will not be in the budgetary constraints of the Fiscal Responsibility Act. But who knows? Because lo and behold, they've got another artificial debt ceiling they're going to have to raise next January.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042859#p3\">Read 31 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042859&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"57f26a8d0d89d153e4edfe2b123f6f4a9c5bfa384c8c9a0e6bd467395e218372","category":"Tech"}
