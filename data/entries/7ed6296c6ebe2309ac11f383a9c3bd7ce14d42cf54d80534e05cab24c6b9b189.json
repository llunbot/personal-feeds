So what does the new port mean for new iPhone users? Here’s everything you need to know.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When will the iPhone 15 arrive?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone 15 was announced at <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/831417/apple-september-iphone-event-date-time.html\">Apple’s “Wonderlust” event</a> on September 12, 2023. The phones will be available in stores beginning Friday, September 22, 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Will all four models have USB-C ports?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, Apple has moved the entire iPhone 15 lineup to USB-C. However, the implementation isn’t quite the same throughout the lineup–the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max support faster data transfers (10Gbps) while the iPhone 15 and 15 Plus support USB 2 speeds (480Mbps).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Will my old iPhone cables work?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No, you’ll need a new USB-C-to-USB-C cable to charge the iPhone 15.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Will I need to buy a new cable?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple will supply a USB-C-to-USB-C cable in the box. You can also <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-2043520-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MU2G3AM/A/240w-usb-c-charge-cable-2-m\">buy a 2m charging cable from Apple</a> for $29.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Will I need to buy a new charger?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It depends. Apple began using a USB-C-to-Lightning cable with the iPhone 12, the same model that also dropped the charger. So if you’re upgrading from an iPhone 12 or later, you likely bought your own 20W or higher USB-C charger, which his what Apple recommends for the iPhone 15. If you have one of the old 5W chargers with a USB-A port, you’ll need to buy a new one.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/iPhone-14-Pro-Max_7.webp?w=1200\" alt=\"Parte inferior del iPhone 14 Pro Max\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/iPhone-14-Pro-Max_7.webp?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/iPhone-14-Pro-Max_7.webp?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/iPhone-14-Pro-Max_7.webp?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/iPhone-14-Pro-Max_7.webp?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/iPhone-14-Pro-Max_7.webp?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/iPhone-14-Pro-Max_7.webp?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/iPhone-14-Pro-Max_7.webp?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" /><figcaption><p>Unlike the old Lightning port, the iPhone 15 Pro’s charging port will deliver faster data transfer speeds.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Will charging be faster?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the tech specs, all iPhone 15 models will provide “up to 50 percent charge in 30 minutes with a 20W or higher charger. The the same language used in the iPhone 14 tech specs, though in practice, the iPhone 14 Pro models charged slightly faster than the non-Pro models when using 30W chargers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What about data transfers?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are capped at 480Mbps like Lightning, but the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max support faster USB 3 speeds of up to 10Gbps. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Will I need to buy a Thunderbolt cable?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No, but you’ll need to buy a USB-C cable that supports USB 3 speeds to transfer data at 10Gbps. The one Apple supplies with the iPhone 15 doesn’t.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Do the older iPhones Apple sells have USB-C, too?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No, the iPhone 13, iPhone 14, and iPhone 14 Plus still support Lightning, as does the iPhone SE.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What about AirPods and other accessories?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is in the process of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1341317/lightning-usb-c-iphone-ipad-airpods-magic-mouse-earpods.html\">transitioning all of its remaining products</a> away from Lightning. Apple launched a new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2065533/airpods-pro-2-case-usb-c-iphone-15-charging.html\">AirPods Pro Charging Case with USB-C</a> alongside the iPhone 15 as well as a USB-C pair of EarPods. However, it’s not clear when the other devices, including AirPods Max, Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad, and Magic Keyboard will lose their Lightning port.</p>\n\niPhone</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"7ed6296c6ebe2309ac11f383a9c3bd7ce14d42cf54d80534e05cab24c6b9b189","category":"Apple"}
