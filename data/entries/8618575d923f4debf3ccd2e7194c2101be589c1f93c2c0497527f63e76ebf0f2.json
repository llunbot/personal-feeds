{"title":"Hollywood Actors to Strike, Setting Off Industrywide Shutdown","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/07/13/business/actors-strike-sag","date":1689286942000,"content":"\n<p>The New York Times:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>About 160,000 television and movie actors are going on strike at\nmidnight, joining screenwriters who walked off the job in May and\nsetting off Hollywood’s first industrywide shutdown in 63 years.\nThe leaders of the union, SAG-AFTRA, approved a strike on\nThursday, hours after contract talks with a group of studios broke\ndown. Actors will be on the picket line starting on Friday.</p>\n\n<p>“What’s happening to us is happening across all fields of labor,”\nsaid Fran Drescher, SAG-AFTRA’s president. “When employers make\nWall Street and greed their priority and they forget about the\nessential contributors who make the machine run, we have a\nproblem.” [...]</p>\n\n<p>It’s been even longer — since 1960, when Marilyn Monroe was\nstill starring in films — since actors and screenwriters were\non strike at the same time. The dual strikes pit more than\n170,000 workers against old-line studios like Disney, Universal,\nSony and Paramount, as well newer juggernauts like Netflix,\nAmazon and Apple.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Labor is clearly on the upswing, and there’s no higher-profile union than the Screen Actors Guild, whose members are <em>literal</em> movie stars.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/13/hollywood-actors-strike\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"8618575d923f4debf3ccd2e7194c2101be589c1f93c2c0497527f63e76ebf0f2","category":"Tech"}
