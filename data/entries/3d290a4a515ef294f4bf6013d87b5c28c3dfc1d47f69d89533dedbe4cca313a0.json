Typically, putting a greater emphasis on one of those will mean sacrificing a bit on the other.</p>\n<p>But e-bikes offer the possibility to sidestep some of that trade-off, boosting aspects of cycling performance without adding much in the way of added bulk. And the <a href=\"https://fave.co/3Iir4Xk\" target=\"_blank\">Gocycle G4</a> provides an excellent demonstration of how well that formula can work out, offering excellent performance in a thoughtfully designed package that is easy to pick up and lug around. It's not so good that it will completely replace a regular bike, but it comes a lot closer than I expected, and it has a number of brilliantly designed features.</p>\n<p>All that said, the bike still has a couple of issues that temper my enthusiasm a bit.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1937068#p3\">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1937068&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3d290a4a515ef294f4bf6013d87b5c28c3dfc1d47f69d89533dedbe4cca313a0","category":"Tech"}
