According to Apple, Backtrack is designed to be used in remote settings, away from familiar places like your home or workplace, and outside densely populated areas without Wi-Fi, but there's nothing stopping you from using it anywhere you need it. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe following steps show you how to use the feature. Note that Backtrack doesn't account for external conditions, such as changes in elevation or objects in the environment.\r<br />\n<ol><li>Open the <strong>Compass</strong> app on your Apple Watch.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Tap the <strong>Backtrack button</strong> in the bottom-right of the screen, then tap Record Path to begin recording your route.\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/backtrack-apple-watch1.jpg\" alt=\"compass\" width=\"1260\" height=\"940\" />\r<br />\n</li><li>When you're ready to retrace your steps, tap the now-highlighted<strong> Backtrack button</strong> in the bottom-right of the screen, then tap <strong>Retrace Steps</strong>. </li>\r<br />\n<li>The path back to the location where you first tapped the Backtrack button will appear on the screen, while the initial location appears as a white dot at the beginning of the path.
