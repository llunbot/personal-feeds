While we knew the Kia EV4 was coming, first unveiled as a concept at the brand's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/10/kia-ev3-ev4-concepts-look-like-the-future-will-soon-be-a-reality/\">EV Day Korea two years ago</a>, the automaker just now confirmed that the all-electric sedan will be sold in the US. While Kia will make both traditional and hatchback body styles of the EV4, only the former is coming our way.</p>\n<p>As Kia's first electrified sedan, the EV4 has a tall order to fill as sedans wane in the North American market. All the brands in the Hyundai Motor Group have signaled a commitment to the four-door family car; <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/09/the-2023-genesis-g80-electrified-blends-good-efficiency-with-great-style/\">Genesis</a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/04/the-2023-hyundai-ioniq-6-a-streamlined-look-equals-serious-range/\">Hyundai</a>, and Kia now all offer all-electric sedans. With a low center of gravity, lighter-weight bodies than their SUV cousins, and solid aerodynamics, sedans appear to be far from dead at Kia.</p>\n<p>The super-compact EV2 concept has a lot going for it: city dimensions, coach doors, and high-tech seats. However, the EV2 is not headed to America, at least for now. The same goes for the modular PV5, which is part of Kia's PBV (platform beyond vehicle) platform. Kia boss Ho Sung Song offered some hints that this could change in the future.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/kias-ev-strategy-smaller-cheaper-cars-like-ev3-hatch-and-ev4-sedan/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/kias-ev-strategy-smaller-cheaper-cars-like-ev3-hatch-and-ev4-sedan/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kristin Shaw","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"96a5c2fb5ab0cd15fa21c26c69dbdb1c619add6b7b588e56bc37245391442a2a","category":"Tech"}
