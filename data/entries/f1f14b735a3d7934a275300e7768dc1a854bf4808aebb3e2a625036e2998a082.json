In a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-21/sonos-plans-400-500-headphones-tv-set-top-box-video-roam-2-new-sound-bar#xj4y7vzkg\">report</a> published Tuesday, Gurman revealed that Sonos is months away from releasing a competitor to high-end wireless headphones after years of vague rumors.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Sonos is reportedly working on a Roku Ultra- or Apple TV 4K-like set-top box that would allow users to watch video from a wide range of streaming TV apps.</p>\n<p>The Bloomberg article says the device will cost between $150 and $200 and will be a small black box. We've seen some prior reports that flesh this out a bit; Sonos has been working on something called Home Theater OS (which would be Android-based) for some time, and voice control is said to be a key feature. Sonos is also considering launching its own streaming video service. The device will support Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision, and it will seamlessly work with Sonos' existing home theater speakers.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1986124#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1986124&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f1f14b735a3d7934a275300e7768dc1a854bf4808aebb3e2a625036e2998a082","category":"Tech"}
