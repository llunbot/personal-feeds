The private Crew Dragon mission will be led by a Chinese-born cryptocurrency entrepreneur named Chun Wang, and he will be joined by a polar explorer, a roboticist, and a filmmaker whom he has befriended in recent years.</p>\n<p>The \"Fram2\" mission, named after the <a href=\"https://frammuseum.no/polar-history/vessels/the-polar-ship-fram/\">Norwegian research ship Fram</a>, will launch into a polar corridor from SpaceX's launch facilities in Florida and fly directly over the north and south poles. The three-to-five day mission is being timed to fly over Antarctica near the summer solstice in the Southern Hemisphere, to afford maximum lighting.</p>\n<p>The four-person crew will fly, fittingly, aboard Crew Dragon <em>Endurance</em>, which is named after Ernest Shackleton's famous ship that was trapped in the Antarctic ice and eventually sunk there about a century ago. The spacecraft will be fitted with a cupola for both photography and filming.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042678#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042678&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c3d4f535d710dbb04bfcd7dced9ca2adfbd8b54879b126ff9bbc153574e0ee47","category":"Tech"}
