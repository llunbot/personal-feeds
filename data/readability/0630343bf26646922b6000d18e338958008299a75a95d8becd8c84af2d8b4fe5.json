With the top riders all fairly evenly matched, luck played a major role on the tricky Belgian terrain.</p><p>A problem for Hermans saw the Tormans rider tumble off the virtual podium and require a change of shoe, and then everything changed at the front of the race as Aerts suffered a front wheel puncture on the cobbled climb, a long way from the pits. This allowed <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/12/tom-pidcock-makes-history-at-world-cup-rucphen-with-a-spectacular-victory/\">Saturday’s winner Pidcock</a> to close the few-second gap and fly up the climb, with Vanthourenhout on his case.</p><p>The young Brit put the hammer down to stretch out his advantage, but disaster delivered another blow on the infamous offcamber section less than a lap later, opening the door to Vanthourenhout.</p><p>The 28-year-old carried a 12-second lead into the final lap, and under pressure from Pidcock, he put everything into the early climb to give himself a good buffer going into the technical sections. Both Vanthourenhout and Pidcock had to overcome mechanicals and/or crashes on the way to the finish, but the Belgian came out on top for an emotional first World Cup victory of the season.</p><p>Pidcock ended the weekend strong as runner-up 36 seconds down, and Aerts had to settle for third after an explosive start was ended by misfortune.</p></div></div>","author":"Kit Nicholson","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"0630343bf26646922b6000d18e338958008299a75a95d8becd8c84af2d8b4fe5","category":"Cycling"}
