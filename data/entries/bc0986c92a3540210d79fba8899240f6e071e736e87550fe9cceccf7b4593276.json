{"title":"Trump Claims to Extend TikTok Deadline for Another 75 Days","link":"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/04/trumps-extends-tiktok-second-time.html","date":1743799399000,"content":"\n<p>CNBC:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>President Donald Trump on Friday extended a deadline requiring China-based ByteDance to sell the U.S. operations of TikTok or face an effective ban in the country, marking the second time he has taken such action.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Trump, on Truth Social, which is by far the most popular social network in the world:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>My Administration has been working very hard on a Deal to SAVE\nTIKTOK, and we have made tremendous progress. The Deal requires\nmore work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed, which is\nwhy I am signing an Executive Order to keep TikTok up and running\nfor an additional 75 days. We hope to continue working in Good\nFaith with China, who I understand are not very happy about our\nReciprocal Tariffs (Necessary for Fair and Balanced Trade between\nChina and the U.S.A.!). This proves that Tariffs are the most\npowerful Economic tool, and very important to our National\nSecurity! We do not want TikTok to “go dark.” We look forward to\nworking with TikTok and China to close the Deal. Thank you for\nyour attention to this matter!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Those are the remarks of the most powerful man in the world.</p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind, too, that there is no mechanism in the law for the president to issue any such extension. What he’s saying is <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/npr_trump_tiktok\">what he said the last time</a>: he’s instructing Attorney General Pam Bondi not to enforce the law, and pinky-swearing that U.S. companies that are breaking the law to keep TikTok available (Akamai, Oracle, Google, Apple) <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/my_spitball_theory_on_tiktoks_current_semi-reprieve_in_the_us\">won’t be held responsible for it</a>. It’s just a complete abdication of the rule of law.</p>\n\n<p>Not a peep from Republican Tom Cotton, who, on the cusp of Trump taking office again, <a href=\"https://www.cotton.senate.gov/news/press-releases/cotton-ricketts-statement-on-tiktok-being-removed-from-app-stores\">was crowing about the PAFACA Act coming into effect to shut TikTok down in the US</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/04/trump-claims-to-extend-tiktok-deadline-for-another-75-days\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"bc0986c92a3540210d79fba8899240f6e071e736e87550fe9cceccf7b4593276","category":"Tech"}
