If you are not currently a subscriber to Apple Music, and you have never previously subscribed to Apple Music or Apple One, or had access to Apple Music through a Family plan, you are eligible for this offer.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/deals/apple-music-is-currently-offering-new-subscribers-three-months-free-185834470.html?src=rss\">Engadget</a></em> spotted the offer, which is running until September 23. After the trial ends, the service will automatically renew for $11 per month, so it's a good idea to set a reminder in case you don't want to continue paying for access.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo redeem the offer, open the Apple Music app on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac and sign in with your Apple ID. If the offer doesn't appear immediately after launching the app, go to the Home tab where it will appear, then tap Accept Now.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/20/apple-music-free-three-month-trial/\">Apple Music Offering Free Three-Month Trial for a Limited Time</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-music-offering-free-three-month-trial-for-a-limited-time.2433983/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"54f9317479595558f48393fbc4f32181fc8b49cdb2a9783a7ed2b3aae1bac304","category":"Apple"}
