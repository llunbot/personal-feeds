[...] </p>\n\n<p>According to the 54-count lawsuit, Meta violated a range of \nstate-based consumer protection statutes as well as the Children’s \nOnline Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA), which prohibits companies \nfrom collecting the personal information of children under 13 \nwithout a parent’s consent. Meta allegedly did not comply with \nCOPPA with respect to both Facebook and Instagram, even though \n“Meta’s own records reveal that Instagram’s audience composition \nincludes millions of children under the age of 13,” and that \n“hundreds of thousands of teen users spend more than five hours a \nday on Instagram,” the court document states. </p>\n\n<p>One Meta product designer wrote in an internal email that the \n“young ones are the best ones,” adding that “you want to bring \npeople to your service young and early,” according to the lawsuit. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Not a good look.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The unsealed complaint also alleges that Meta knew that its \nalgorithm could steer children toward harmful content, thereby \nharming their well-being. According to internal company \ncommunications cited in the document, employees wrote that they \nwere concerned about “content on IG triggering negative emotions \namong tweens and impacting their mental well-being (and) our \nranking algorithms taking [them] into negative spirals &amp; feedback \nloops that are hard to exit from.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On that last point, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jason_kint/status/1727603279243485530\">Jason Kint posted a long thread</a> on Twitter/X highlighting previously redacted details from the lawsuit.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/11/28/instagram-meta-unsealed-lawsuit\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"56b9531e536b8c9057b841736ef71c832dc874f5e901247e8f739db1fe0e8e33","category":"Tech"}
