Today, Kia took the wraps off the production version, which goes on sale in the second half of this year. The production EV9 is definitely an evolution of the show car but with some of the concept's more outrageous design details toned down a bit.</p>\n<p>It's a large three-row SUV that uses Kia and Hyundai's advanced new electric vehicle platform called <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/12/everything-we-know-about-hyundai-and-kias-new-electric-vehicle-platform/\">E-GMP</a>, which has already impressed us and many others in new EVs like the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/12/the-hyundai-ioniq-5-is-the-best-ev-weve-driven-in-2021/\">Hyundai Ioniq 5</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/01/kias-new-ev6-electric-crossover-goes-straight-to-the-head-of-the-pack/\">Kia's EV6</a>.

It's a little shorter than the Kia Telluride but with a much longer wheelbase.
