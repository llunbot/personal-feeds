According to Knight, Cook is a man of \"wisdom\" and \"excellent judgment.\"<blockquote>One of his most difficult challenges was the change of leadership at Apple after Steve Jobs passed away, the Steve Jobs who was beloved and recognized around the world as a genius.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThis almost impossible transition was handled with amazing dignity and grace, and announced to the world in his own quiet way: \"I am not the second Steve Jobs. I am the first Tim Cook.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAnd by the way, in the 10 years since... Apple stock has gone up 1,000%, making it the most valuable company in the world.</blockquote>Other notable names who made <a href=\"https://time.com/collection/100-most-influential-people-2021/\">this year's list</a> include Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, Naomi Osaka, Billie Eilish, \"Ted Lasso\" star Jason Sudeikis, Joe Biden, and Elon Musk.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nEarlier this year, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/27/apple-leader-influential-companies-for-2021/\">was listed</a> as one of <em>TIME</em>'s 100 Most Influential Companies of 2021 thanks to its record breaking holiday quarter and ever increasing product lineup.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/15/tim-cook-time-most-influential-people-2021/\">Apple CEO Tim Cook Makes TIME's List of 100 Most Influential People of 2021</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-ceo-tim-cook-makes-times-list-of-100-most-influential-people-of-2021.2311090/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=mnBhysf5wGE:ECHmVZLW26U:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=mnBhysf5wGE:ECHmVZLW26U:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/mnBhysf5wGE\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7bb50ffcc7c0cac5bf52eaa4422edc4e92d14bae213fe43ddd048a71ab09ad16","category":"Apple"}
