Santa Cruz has stayed true to its roots since it first launched the bike in 1997. It remains a do-it-all thrasher, from long-distance tourer to city-going single-speed, limited only by your imagination.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Santa Cruz Chameleon should take you wherever you want to go.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Mason Mashon </i></span></div>\n<p><span>Following wider industry trends, the geometry of the new Chamelon has got a little bit longer, lower and slacker. </span></p>\n<p><span>It is now also only available with a 29er front wheel, but the bike is still officially compatible with a 27.5″ rear wheel if you want to try out a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/what-is-faster-mullet-bike-29er/\" target=\"_blank\">mullet setup</a>. The new Santa Cruz Chameleon is only available with an aluminium frame for now.</span></p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The new Chameleon should be ready to blend into any adventure you take it on.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p><span>Reach has increased by 8mm on small, medium and large frames, while the extra-large gets a more subtle 3mm increase. </span></p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The head tube on the new Santa Cruz Chameleon has slacked by 2.3 degrees to a capable 65 degrees.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Santa Cruz</i></span></div>\n<p><span>The most significant change is the head tube angle, which shaves off 2.3 degrees and now sits at a shred-ready 65 degrees. The seat tube angle has been steepened to 74.3 degrees, an increase of 1.5 degrees over the outgoing model.</span></p>\n<p><span>More subtle changes see the bottom bracket on the 29er Chameleon drop by 1mm to a 56mm bb drop. On the mullet version of the bike ( and there’s a 40mm bb drop on the MX bike (mixed wheels).</span></p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The changeable dropouts let you tune the rear-end geometry and set up the Chameleon single speed.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Santa Cruz</i></span></div>\n<p><span>While the Chameleon keeps its changeable dropouts, the chainstay lengths have been increased on the new bikes, with the option of running them at 425mm or 437mm. That should give the bike more stability and help keep the weight distribution balanced with the longer reaches.</span></p>\n<p><span>Finally, seat tubes have shorted, a benefit meaning you should be able to run longer dropper posts. The size small loses 5mm and now measures 380mm. There’s 10mm taken off the medium, 20mm off the large and 30mm from the extra-large, measuring 405mm, 430mm and 460mm, respectively.</span></p>\n<h2>2022 Santa Cruz Chameleon frame details</h2>\n<p><span>Many of the details remain the same for the new frame, and you can still choose to set it up single speed thanks to the changeable dropouts or tune the rear centre geometry to your preference.</span></p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The triple cargo mounts under the down tube add to the bike’s versatility, as do the chain guide mounts.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Santa Cruz</i></span></div>\n<p><span>There’s a standard water bottle mount inside the front triangle, while the triple cargo mounts under the down tube add the option to attach whatever you need if you plan to get off the beaten track and venture further afield.</span></p>\n<p><span>There’s semi-internal cable routing and 1X drive train only with ISGC O5 tabs to mount a chain guide if you wish.</span></p>\n<h2>2022 Santa Cruz Chameleon models and pricing</h2>\n<p><span>Santa Cruz is producing three models of this new aluminium Chameleon, the D, R and S, all available in MX or 29in wheel options and in the four sizes: small, medium, large and extra-large.</span></p>\n<h3>Santa Cruz Chameleon D MX/29</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Santa Cruz Chameleon D 29.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Santa Cruz</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Frame</strong> Aluminium 29/MX Hardtail</li>\n<li><strong>Fork</strong> RockShox Recon RL, 130mm</li>\n<li><strong>Drivetrain </strong>SRAM X1 Eagle DUB, 30t cranks, SRAM SX Eagle mech, SRAM NX Eagle shifter, SRAM PG1230, 12spd, 11-50, cassette, SRAM SX Eagle chain</li>\n<li><strong>Dropper</strong> SDG Tellis Dropper</li>\n<li><strong>Brakes </strong>SRAM Level, 180mm rotors</li>\n<li><strong>Wheelset</strong> WTB ST i30 TCS 2.0 29″ rims, SRAM MTH hubs, Sapim Race spokes, Maxxis Minion DHF 29″x2.5in, 3C, MaxxGrip, EXO, TR (f), Maxxis Aggressor, 29″x2.5in WT, EXO, TR ® tyres</li>\n<li><strong>Price</strong> £2,399 / $2,399 / €2,449</li>\n</ul><h3>Santa Cruz Chameleon R MX/29</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Santa Cruz Chameleon R MX.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Santa Cruz</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Frame</strong> Aluminium 29/MX Hardtail</li>\n<li><strong>Fork</strong> Fox 34 Rhythm, 130mm</li>\n<li><strong>Drivetrain </strong>SRAM Descendant Eagle DUB 30t cranks, SRAM NX Eagle mech, SRAM NX Eagle shifter, SRAM PG1230, 12spd, 11-50, cassette, SRAM NX Eagle chain</li>\n<li><strong>Brakes </strong>SRAM Guide T, 180mm rotors</li>\n<li><strong>Dropper</strong> SDG Tellis Dropper</li>\n<li><strong>Wheelset</strong> RaceFace AR Offset 30 rims, SRAM MTH hubs, Sapim Race spokes, Maxxis Minion DHF 29″x2.5in, 3C, MaxxGrip, EXO, TR (f), Maxxis Aggressor, 29″/27.5×2.5in WT, EXO, TR ® tyres</li>\n<li><strong>Price</strong> £2,999 / $2,949 / €3,099</li>\n</ul><h3>Santa Cruz Chameleon S MX/29</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Santa Cruz Chameleon S 29.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Santa Cruz</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Frame</strong> Aluminium 29/MX Hardtail</li>\n<li><strong>Fork</strong>, Fox 34 Performance, 130mm</li>\n<li><strong>Drivetrain </strong>SRAM GX Eagle</li>\n<li><strong>Brakes </strong>SRAM G2 R, 180mm rotors</li>\n<li><strong>Dropper</strong> RockShox Reverb Stealth</li>\n<li><strong>Wheelset</strong> RaceFace AR Offset 30 rims, DT Swiss 370 hubs, Sapim Race spokes, Maxxis Minion DHF 29″x2.5in, 3C, Maxx-Grip, EXO, TR (f), Maxxis Aggressor, 29″/27.5×2.5in WT, EXO, TR ® tyres</li>\n<li><strong>Price</strong> £3,499 / $3,749 / €3,749</li>\n</ul>","author":"Luke Marshall","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"581888709af2977a88bffe87cbcdf426fd5f53324c00b26210f6788de72084c8","category":"Cycling"}
