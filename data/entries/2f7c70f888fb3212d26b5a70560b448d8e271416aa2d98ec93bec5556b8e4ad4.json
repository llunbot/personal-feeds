If all else fails, the user can enable a \"Lost mode\" intended to display their phone number when a finder scans the missing AirTag.

This oversight opens the door for AirTags to be used in a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watering_hole_attack\">drop attack</a>. Instead of seeding a target's parking lot with USB drives loaded with malware, an attacker can drop a maliciously prepared AirTag.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1799798#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1799798&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2f7c70f888fb3212d26b5a70560b448d8e271416aa2d98ec93bec5556b8e4ad4","category":"Tech"}
