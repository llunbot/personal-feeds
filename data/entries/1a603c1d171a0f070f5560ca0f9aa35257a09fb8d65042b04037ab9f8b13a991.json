From there, everyone in the DM group is able to participate.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Blend will include Reels that users in the group are interested in, based on what they've browsed individually and what's been shared in the DM thread. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DIjbqOGqjse/\">Instagram chief Adam Mosseri</a> said that it's a way for users to share their interests with their friends, and to start new conversations.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBlend feeds will refresh with new content each day as a way to keep participants coming back to the conversation.
