In a letter, the company formerly known as\nTwitter thanked Hwang for his loyalty and offered him a selection\nof X merchandise and a tour of X’s HQ, as a “reflection of our\nappreciation.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One way or another, X Corp was going to get the @x handle. But this was, unsurprisingly, a pretty shitty way to do it. Kudos to Hwang for taking it all in good spirit.
