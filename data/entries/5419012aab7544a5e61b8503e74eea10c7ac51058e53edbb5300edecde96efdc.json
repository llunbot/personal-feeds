Designed to reduce manual effort and improve accuracy, it streamlines the migration process, helping teams adopt HCP Terraform and Terraform Enterprise with confidence.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Why Terraform migrate?</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Terraform migrate is a command-line tool that simplifies the process of migrating your Terraform state and configuration to HCP Terraform and Terraform Enterprise. It addresses the key challenges of migration:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Automating state transfer:</strong> Migrate your state files seamlessly and reliably, minimizing manual intervention and reducing the risk of errors.</li>\n<li><strong>State refactoring:</strong> Adapt your existing Terraform workspaces to align with evolving organizational requirements by handling necessary changes automatically.</li>\n<li><strong>Validation and verification:</strong> Validate your migration process and verify the integrity of your state in the new environment.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><strong>Whatâ€™s new in GA?</strong></h2>\n\n<p>The GA release of Terraform migrate introduces enhanced automation, security, and efficiency, making it easier than ever to transition from Terraform Community Edition to HCP Terraform (TFC) and Terraform Enterprise (TFE).</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Expanded features</strong></h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Variable management and migration:</strong> Users can now migrate workspace variables and their values to HCP Terraform and Terraform Enterprise, reducing the need for manual reconfiguration.</li>\n<li><strong>GitLab integration:</strong> Added Git operations support for GitLab, allowing users to incorporate Terraform migrate seamlessly into their CLI-driven workflows.</li>\n<li><strong>Security and validation:</strong> Improved security by adding validation checks on Git personal access tokens (PAT) during the <code>prepare</code> and <code>execute</code> commands.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><strong>Workflow enhancements</strong></h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Refined directory skipping:</strong> The <code>--skip-dir</code> flag has been enhanced to eliminate the need for manual changes in template files, streamlining migrations.</li>\n<li><strong>Dry-run mode:</strong> A <code>--dry-run</code> option has been introduced for the <code>execute</code> step, enabling users to preview migration changes before applying them.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><strong>Stability and performance</strong></h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Improved target branch naming:</strong> Target branch names now dynamically reflect the current branch, enhancing traceability in version control workflows.</li>\n<li><strong>Optimizations:</strong> Enhanced error handling, improved logging for better debugging and audit trails, and an optimized <code>prepare</code> command for faster execution, reducing migration time.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><strong>Get started</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Terraform migrate is generally available and ready for download.
