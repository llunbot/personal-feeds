Sliding the panel down shuts off airflow into the helmet, which Kask says can increase the temperature of a rider’s head by 1.5˚C.</p>\n<div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/11/kask_wasabi_5-4facf45.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Open… </span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Warren Rossiter / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/11/kask_wasabi_6-99eeb9d.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>…close. </span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Warren Rossiter / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>If that doesn’t keep your head warm enough, the Wasabi comes with a Merino wool lining, which is said to help with temperature regulation.</p>\n<p>As this is a pro-level lid, Kask stresses the aerodynamic performance of the Wasabi, stating wind-tunnel testing shows it comes second only to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/team-sky-and-kask-launch-new-aero-helmet-at-tour-down-under/\">Kask Utopia</a> in terms of slipperiness.</p>\n<p>Wind-tunnel testing is also said to have shown opening the vent loses you less than one watt at 50kmph, which might be quite a redundant stat for many.</p>\n<p>On our scales, the helmet weighed 318.3g for a size large.</p>\n<ul><li>£269 / $350 / €300</li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Camelbak MULE Commute 22</h2>\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Camelbak’s new commuter line includes this urbanised version of its classic MULE MTB pack.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tom Marvin / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Camelbak is well known in mountain biking for some of the best thought-out riding packs around, and has become the ‘Hoover’ of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-hydration-packs/\">hydration pack</a> world.</p>\n<p>The brand has turned its attention to the gritty streets with a pair of new packs, based loosely on two of its longest-serving MTB packs, the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/accessories/hydration-packs/camelbak-mule-hydration-pack-review/\">MULE</a> and the HAWG, with the MULE Commute 22 (as seen here) and HAWG Commute 30.</p>\n<div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/11/camelbak-mule-commute-22-top-2dbaa4b.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Waterproof zips secure the top-loading main cargo hold, as well as a soft-lined sunnies pouch.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Tom Marvin / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/11/camelbak-mule-commute-22-back-8970c91.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The sculpted and padded shoulder straps have stretchy phone pockets sewn in place.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Tom Marvin / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>The MULE Commute 22 has many urbanite features, such as sturdy abrasion-resistant 330D Cordura exterior materials with a PU coating, weatherproof zips and stretchy ‘Command Centre’ pockets for fast access to your electronics.
