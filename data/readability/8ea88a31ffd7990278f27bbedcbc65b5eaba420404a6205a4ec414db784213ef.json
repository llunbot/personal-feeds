That’s no longer an issue,” Bombeke said. “That was a problem of an accumulation over years. Mountain biking, cyclocross, racing on the road, stress, his fall at the [Olympic] Games, the Tour… Actually, we never saw it as something alarming. We were just never able to deal with the problem thoroughly because he could never really take a rest. So it was a form of overload.”</p><p>It’s common practice for professional riders to be physically and medically screened in the off-season, with particular attention given to heart health and existing injuries. With his back in mind, Van der Poel’s physical condition is being thoroughly explored.</p><p>“We screened him from scratch,” Bombeke explained. “We treated him like a new patient and looked at how we can address his weaknesses. He has done exercises for the past two years, but more for maintenance. Mathieu lives on adrenaline and we are not going to be able to change that right away. So he had to pay the price for that with his back.”</p></div></div>","author":"Kit Nicholson","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"8ea88a31ffd7990278f27bbedcbc65b5eaba420404a6205a4ec414db784213ef","category":"Cycling"}
