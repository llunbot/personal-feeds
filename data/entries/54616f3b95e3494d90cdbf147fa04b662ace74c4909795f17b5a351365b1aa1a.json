Following that review, SpaceX received approval to conduct up to five Starship launches from South Texas annually.</p>\n<p>SpaceX has since launched Starship four times from its launch site in South Texas, known as Starbase, and is planning a fifth launch within the next two months. However, as it continues to test Starship and make plans for regular flights, SpaceX will need a higher flight rate. This is especially true as the company is unlikely to activate additional launch pads for Starship in Florida until at least 2026.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039734#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039734&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"54616f3b95e3494d90cdbf147fa04b662ace74c4909795f17b5a351365b1aa1a","category":"Tech"}
