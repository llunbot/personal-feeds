{"title":"22 states sue to block new NIH funding policy—court puts it on hold","link":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/twenty-two-states-sue-to-block-new-nih-funding-policy/","date":1739222426000,"content":"<p>On Friday, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/new-nih-policy-will-slash-support-money-to-research-universities/\">announced a sudden change</a> to how it handles the indirect costs of research—the money that pays for things like support services and facilities maintenance. These costs help pay universities and research centers to provide the environment and resources all their researchers need to get research done. Previously, these had been set through negotiations with the university and audits of the spending. These averaged roughly 30 percent of the value of the grant itself and would frequently exceed 50 percent.</p>\n<p>The NIH announcement set the rate at 15 percent for every campus. The new rate would start today and apply retroactively to existing grants, meaning most research universities are currently finding themselves facing catastrophic budget shortfalls.</p>\n<p>Today, a coalition of 22 states <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.280590/gov.uscourts.mad.280590.1.0.pdf\">filed a suit</a> that seeks to block the new policy, alleging it violated both a long-standing law and a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rider_(legislation)\">budget rider</a> that Congress had passed in response to a 2017 attempt by Trump to drastically cut indirect costs. The suit seeks to prevent the new policy or its equivalent from being applied—something that Judge Angel Kelley of the District of Massachusetts <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25517849-nihtro021025/#document/p2\">granted later in the day</a>. While that injunction only applies to research centers located in the states that have joined the suit, a separate suit was filed in the same district by a group of medical organizations, some of them (such as the Association of American Medical Colleges), have members throughout the country. As a result, Judge Kelley issued a separate ruling that <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2025/02/11/judge-orders-nationwide-halt-trump-nih-research-indirect-costs/\">extended the injunction to the remaining states</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/twenty-two-states-sue-to-block-new-nih-funding-policy/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/twenty-two-states-sue-to-block-new-nih-funding-policy/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"62d4fccdad0dcaef538807368cfd0d9837ab9de7de90b9824c052f80b716ac6e","category":"Tech"}
