But as the company launches <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/microsofts-surface-duo-2-gets-better-specs-an-even-bigger-1499-price-tag/\">a second generation</a> of the Surface Duo and the company's first Android phone turns a year old, so far Microsoft has failed to impress.</p>\n<p>The Surface Duo 1 shipped in September 2020 with Android 10, which was a full year old at the time, and Android 11 had already launched. The hope was that Microsoft would quickly update the Duo to the latest version of Android, but that never happened. Today the device is <em>still</em> running Android 10, which is now two years old, and Android 12 is about to ship. Microsoft has finally broken its silence about Surface Duo 1 updates, and the company tells <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690003/microsoft-surface-duo-android-11-update-release-date\">The Verge</a> it plans to update the device to Android 11 \"before the end of this year.\"</p>\n<p>Assuming Microsoft follows through on its promise, the company's $1,400 flagship device will be updated from a two-year-old operating system to a one-year-old operating system. Microsoft <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366636/microsoft-surface-duo-android-updates-three-years-support-security\">committed</a> to three years of updates, and it has been delivering monthly security updates. But this is still worst-in-class update support, especially for the price. Samsung usually rolls out Android to its latest flagship <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/12/samsung-finally-starts-its-android-11-rollout-three-months-after-release/\">three months</a> after Google's release, while OnePlus usually takes <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/10/the-oneplus-8-finally-gets-an-always-on-display-oh-yeah-and-android-11/\">around a month</a>—Microsoft's one-year timeframe is really bad.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1798192#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1798192&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b3d71cf5548787d2d5c66e035f94bee24a3ac9ca9255f7afbe26b9b0e537c5ea","category":"Tech"}
