While adjusted from the road-going SuperSix, the SE sports a similarly racy geometry – it has short chainstays for extra punch under acceleration and OutFront Steering Geometry for enhanced control and agility on technical descents, depsite having clearance for tyres up to 45mm.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/10013/cannondale-supersix-evo-se-and-cx-images#21\"><p><span>Image 22 of</span> 47</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/08/c21_supersix_evo_se_beauty_08.jpg?itok=zniTNZmn\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 22 of </span>47</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<p>It comes equipped with the wireless Sram Rival Etap AXS groupset and hydraulic disc brakes as well as a HollowGram 27 SL KNØT carbon seatpost, DT Swiss CR1600 Spline wheels and Vittoria Terreno Dry TNT tyres.</p>\n<p>The SuperSix EVO CX – seen on course recently in a secretive blacked-out design – shares many of the same qualities as the SE. It's built around the same frame so also has aero tubes, hidden cables and aggressive geometry.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/10013/cannondale-supersix-evo-se-and-cx-images#26\"><p><span>Image 27 of</span> 47</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/08/uci_world_cup_overijse_2021_48_-_ctfmuzzi.png?itok=WE1Kx6Be\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 27 of </span>47</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<p>Cannondale says that with the CX it wanted to 'push the boundaries of performance further' from its previous SuperX cross bike and by bringing the EVO design off-road the brand says it was able to save weight and watts.</p>\n<p>While clearance is the same as the SE, being a cyclocross bike the CX is limited to 33mm tyres as per UCI rules, but Cannondale points out that means the frame creates a 13mm gap on each side. That should prevent mud, grass and the rest getting stuck in the system. </p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/news/10013/cannondale-supersix-evo-se-and-cx-images#44\"><p><span>Image 45 of</span> 47</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/08/c21_supersix_evo_cx_beauty_11.jpg?itok=9oAwwdvh\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 45 of </span>47</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<p>The CX comes with a 1x Sram Force 1 groupset and that same HollowGram seatpost, though the cheaper DT Swiss R470 rims have use Formula CL-712 hubs and come with Vittoria's Terreno Mix TNT tyres.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/2104/vuelta-a-espana-route-race-reports-tv-guide-and-all-you-need-to-know\">Vuelta a Espana 2021: Route, start list, live TV guide and all we know so far</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/10017/flanders-uci-road-cycling-world-championships-2021-key-information\">Flanders UCI Road Cycling World Championships 2021: Key information</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/913/tour-of-britain-route-riders-live-tv-guide-all-you-need-to-know\">Tour of Britain 2021: Route, teams and all you need to know</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/6463/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 117: on sale now!</a></div>    </div></div><h3>One step forward, setting you back</h3>\n<p>It's not a surprise to anyone that there's a large pricetag on both bikes, given the territory. </p>\n<p>The gravel SE will cost you a cool £4,600 while for the CX you'll have to cough up £3,800.
