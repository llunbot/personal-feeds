Technically the Twelve South ButterFly 2-in-1 MagSafe Charger can’t be beaten: it is fully Apple-certified, so wirelessly fast-charges the Watch at 5W and the iPhone at 15W.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Twelve-South-ButterFly-2-in-1-MagSafe-Charger.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Twelve South ButterFly 2-in-1 MagSafe Charger Apple Watch and iPhone\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Twelve-South-ButterFly-2-in-1-MagSafe-Charger.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Twelve-South-ButterFly-2-in-1-MagSafe-Charger.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Twelve-South-ButterFly-2-in-1-MagSafe-Charger.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Twelve-South-ButterFly-2-in-1-MagSafe-Charger.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Design</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>But the Butterfly’s wonder is its clever, dinky foldable size and MacBook-like aluminum styling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfurl the elegant charger and the two wireless charging pads are revealed: one MagSafe for iPhone 12/13/14/15; and the other an adjustable Apple Watch charging module.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Twelve-South-ButterFly-2-in-1-Charger-fold-Watch.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Twelve South ButterFly 2-in-1 MagSafe Charger Nightstand Watch\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Twelve-South-ButterFly-2-in-1-Charger-fold-Watch.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1542w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Twelve-South-ButterFly-2-in-1-Charger-fold-Watch.jpg?resize=300%2C156&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Twelve-South-ButterFly-2-in-1-Charger-fold-Watch.jpg?resize=768%2C398&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Twelve-South-ButterFly-2-in-1-Charger-fold-Watch.jpg?resize=1200%2C623&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Twelve-South-ButterFly-2-in-1-Charger-fold-Watch.jpg?resize=1536%2C797&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"623\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>You can fold the charger 180 degrees and place the Watch in Nightstand mode.

You won’t need to buy one, though, as it ships with a compact 30W charger that comes with interchangeable international plug heads for US/CA, UK, EU, and AU/NZ.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In travel mode, it’s a little larger than an AirPods Pro case. You can swap the Apple Watch for a wireless AirPods case, so all your non-Mac Apple products are catered for.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Twelve-South-Butterfly-Charger-and-AirPods-Case.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Twelve South Butterfly Charger and AirPods Pro Case\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Twelve-South-Butterfly-Charger-and-AirPods-Case.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Twelve-South-Butterfly-Charger-and-AirPods-Case.jpg?resize=300%2C189&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Twelve-South-Butterfly-Charger-and-AirPods-Case.jpg?resize=768%2C484&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"645\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Price</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Twelve South ButterFly 2-in-1 MagSafe Charger isn’t cheap, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.twelvesouth.com/products/butterfly-2-in-1-magsafe-charger&amp;xcust=1-1-2190224-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">retailing at $129.99</a>. It isn’t yet available to buy outside of North America, despite those international plugs, although we expect a worldwide release early in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe the closest Watch/iPhone charger we’ve tested is the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://zens.tech/shop/2-in-1-magsafe-watch-travel-charger/&amp;xcust=1-1-2190224-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Zens 2-in-1 MagSafe + Watch travel charger</a>, which is cheaper but not as flexible as the Twelve South ButterFly, and doesn’t fast-charge the Watch. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2146632/journey-swiv-3-in-1-wireless-charging-station-review.html\">Journey SWIV 3-in-1 Foldable Wireless Charging Station</a> can fast-charge a Watch but is slower at wirelessly charging an iPhone (7.5W vs 15W). It is larger, though still pocketable, and that allows it to charge iPhone/Watch/AirPods all at the same time. But if you can wait to charge those AirPods, the ButterFly wins out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more options, take a look at our list of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668468/best-apple-watch-chargers-stands-docks.html\">best Apple Watch chargers</a>, complete with in-depth testing and recommendations.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Twelve-South-ButterFly-2-in-1-MagSafe-Charger-flexible.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Twelve South ButterFly 2-in-1 MagSafe Charger flexible options\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Twelve-South-ButterFly-2-in-1-MagSafe-Charger-flexible.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Twelve-South-ButterFly-2-in-1-MagSafe-Charger-flexible.jpg?resize=300%2C143&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Twelve-South-ButterFly-2-in-1-MagSafe-Charger-flexible.jpg?resize=768%2C365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"487\" /></figure><p>Twelve South</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Verdict</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While expensive, the Twelve South ButterFly 2-in-1 MagSafe Charger is clever, elegant and functional enough to justify this. It is a super-compact certified fast charger that should be winning design awards, and will certainly win you over if you can afford the price tag.</p>\n\nAccessories, Mobile Phone Accessories, Power</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"6339753015ff1b7a9eb49bfc9f1885b35a5f774489e5dd3fc5499c8a2eafefd3","category":"Apple"}
