At first glance, it looks like this is just a new year’s spec refresh, which it is really. But still, a few careful component updates help refine the all-rounder status of this bike, giving you lighter &amp; higher-performance options, while also incrementally improving control &amp; descending ability at a couple of different levels…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2024 Canyon Neuron all-rounder trail bike refresh</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Canyon-Neuron-all-rounder-trail-bike_in-carbon-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Canyon-Neuron-all-rounder-trail-bike_in-carbon-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Canyon Neuron all-rounder trail bike, in carbon\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Canyon-Neuron-all-rounder-trail-bike_in-carbon-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Canyon-Neuron-all-rounder-trail-bike_in-carbon-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Canyon-Neuron-all-rounder-trail-bike_in-carbon-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Canyon-Neuron-all-rounder-trail-bike_in-carbon-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Canyon-Neuron-all-rounder-trail-bike_in-carbon-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Canyon-Neuron-all-rounder-trail-bike_in-carbon-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Canyon)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Canyon calls it a refresh… all things considered, a new set of Neuron CF and AL “adventure mountain bikes” freshly updated for the end of 2024 and the upcoming 2025 riding season. This is their version of a do-it-all mountain bike. It’s not nearly as burly as Santa Cruz’s revamped <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?p=368372\" target=\"_blank\">Hightower</a> also out today, but instead is a trail bike for the masses. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Light, comfortable, confidence-inspiring,130mm of travel out back, 140mm forks, and a plenty slack 66° headtube angle to take on the type of riding most mountain bikers actually do. Fire road climbs, twisting backcountry mountain tracks, and flowy local singletrack. Most mountain bikers undeniably don’t really need an enduro bike. And Canyon’s Neuron is that kind of trail bike that you can just hop on and ride all day.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-Canyon-Neuron-CF-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_new-Neuron-photo-by-Markus-Greber_Sierra-Nevada-riding.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-Canyon-Neuron-CF-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_new-Neuron-photo-by-Markus-Greber_Sierra-Nevada-riding.jpg\" alt=\"2023 Canyon Neuron CF carbon trail mountain bike, new Neuron photo by Markus Greber, riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-Canyon-Neuron-CF-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_new-Neuron-photo-by-Markus-Greber_Sierra-Nevada-riding.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-Canyon-Neuron-CF-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_new-Neuron-photo-by-Markus-Greber_Sierra-Nevada-riding-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-Canyon-Neuron-CF-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_new-Neuron-photo-by-Markus-Greber_Sierra-Nevada-riding-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-Canyon-Neuron-CF-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_new-Neuron-photo-by-Markus-Greber_Sierra-Nevada-riding-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-Canyon-Neuron-CF-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_new-Neuron-photo-by-Markus-Greber_Sierra-Nevada-riding-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-Canyon-Neuron-CF-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_new-Neuron-photo-by-Markus-Greber_Sierra-Nevada-riding-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-Canyon-Neuron-CF-carbon-trail-mountain-bike_new-Neuron-photo-by-Markus-Greber_Sierra-Nevada-riding-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(Photo by Markus Greber/Canyon)<br /></em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2023-canyon-neuron-cf-carbon-trail-mountain-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">rode one of these</a> for across the Spanish Sierra Nevada mountains for a couple of days before the line was launched last year, and I can attest to its versatility. It did a good job reminding me that sometimes you just need a mountain bike that we can take mountain biking, on mountain bike trails… This is kind of the opposite of an N+1 bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s new?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Canyon-Neuron-all-rounder-trail-bike_alloy-MTB-upgrade-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Canyon-Neuron-all-rounder-trail-bike_alloy-MTB-upgrade-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Canyon Neuron all-rounder trail bike, in alloy\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Canyon-Neuron-all-rounder-trail-bike_alloy-MTB-upgrade-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Canyon-Neuron-all-rounder-trail-bike_alloy-MTB-upgrade-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Canyon-Neuron-all-rounder-trail-bike_alloy-MTB-upgrade-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Canyon-Neuron-all-rounder-trail-bike_alloy-MTB-upgrade-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Canyon-Neuron-all-rounder-trail-bike_alloy-MTB-upgrade-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So it’s only a spec update, actually. But that’s not entirely to be dismissed. The updates essentially boil down to new SRAM T-type Transmission derailleurs, new wide trail-ready DT Swiss wheels, and some longer travel droppers.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Canyon-Neuron-all-rounder-trail-bike_rear-end-detail-transmission-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Canyon-Neuron-all-rounder-trail-bike_rear-end-detail-transmission-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Canyon Neuron all-rounder trail bike, with transmission\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Canyon-Neuron-all-rounder-trail-bike_rear-end-detail-transmission-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Canyon-Neuron-all-rounder-trail-bike_rear-end-detail-transmission-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Canyon-Neuron-all-rounder-trail-bike_rear-end-detail-transmission-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Canyon-Neuron-all-rounder-trail-bike_rear-end-detail-transmission-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Canyon-Neuron-all-rounder-trail-bike_rear-end-detail-transmission-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, Canyon has actually pared down their maybe too complicated 11-model lineup to just 6. Solid electronic specs on carbon frame models, plus one affordable mechanical option. And then, a couple of no-nonsense alloy frame builds.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2024/25 Canyon Neuron CF – Pricing, availability &amp; options</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Canyon-Neuron-all-rounder-trail-bike_carbon-CF-LTD-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Canyon-Neuron-all-rounder-trail-bike_carbon-CF-LTD-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Canyon Neuron all-rounder trail bike, CF LTD\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Canyon-Neuron-all-rounder-trail-bike_carbon-CF-LTD-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Canyon-Neuron-all-rounder-trail-bike_carbon-CF-LTD-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Canyon-Neuron-all-rounder-trail-bike_carbon-CF-LTD-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Canyon-Neuron-all-rounder-trail-bike_carbon-CF-LTD-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Canyon-Neuron-all-rounder-trail-bike_carbon-CF-LTD-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>2024 Canyon Neuron CF LTD</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The slightly bad news is that prices are a bit more expensive. Thanks inflation. But at the same time, there are a wider range of options in a smaller number of total builds, and still plenty of affordability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are 4 carbon models that share the top 2440g CF frame.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new top-spec Neuron CF LTD goes from old school X01, now to a direct mount SRAM XX Eagle AXS transmission, shedding grams along the way. At 6300€ it’s 5% more pricey, which seems a small price to pay for the T-Type upgrade. On paper, the wheels seem like a downgrade in number, but these lightweight DT Swiss XMC1501 wheels now actually use the latest 240 36T Ratchet EXP hubs &amp; 30mm internal carbon rims taking advantage of DT’s <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/dt-swiss-1200-series-revamped-carbon-mountain-bike-wheels/\" target=\"_blank\">recently upgraded tech</a>. And then, Canyon moves to their own Iridium dropper seatpost, with longer travel for better control of the steepest descents (200mm L/XL, 170mm S/M &amp; 150mm XS).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Canyon-Neuron-all-rounder-trail-bike_carbon-CF9-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Canyon-Neuron-all-rounder-trail-bike_carbon-CF9-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Canyon Neuron all-rounder trail bike, CF9\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Canyon-Neuron-all-rounder-trail-bike_carbon-CF9-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Canyon-Neuron-all-rounder-trail-bike_carbon-CF9-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Canyon-Neuron-all-rounder-trail-bike_carbon-CF9-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Canyon-Neuron-all-rounder-trail-bike_carbon-CF9-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2024-Canyon-Neuron-all-rounder-trail-bike_carbon-CF9-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Canyon Neuron CF 9 </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The 5000€ Canyon Neuron CF 9 doesn’t change in price compared to last year’s CF 9 SL, but upgrades from the GX AXS <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2023-canyon-neuron-cf-carbon-trail-mountain-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">that I tested</a>, now to a direct mount SRAM XO AXS transmission.
