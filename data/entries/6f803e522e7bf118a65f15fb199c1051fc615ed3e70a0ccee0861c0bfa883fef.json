Way back then, it was a mountain bike; before this newest version, it was kind of a rugged touring bike. In its most recent incarnation, it shows some of both strains of that heritage, while adding in some adventure-bike ethos. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It “invites you to chase your own life experiences out on those unexplored passes, winding roads, and endless trails,” a mission statement which inspires more than a little wanderlust in me in the midst of another COVID lockdown. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Let’s talk tech</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Like most Ritchey framesets, this one is built from the company’s heat-treated, TIG-welded and triple-butted ‘Logic’ steel tubing. There are mounts all over the thing – rack and fender mounts, bottle cage mounts inside and outside of the main triangle – and for ease of access and trail-side maintenance, everything is routed externally, with an external seat collar keeping the 27.2 mm seatpost in place. The frame weighs in at 2,400 g in a size large.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/frame_Ascent_V2_side-1340x727.jpg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new steel fork follows the practical theme, with mounts on the side, fender mounts, and a dynamo mount. Fork weight is 1,125 g, uncut, and the frameset is supplied with one of Ritchey’s excellent press-in WCS headsets.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ascent has massive tyre clearance in either 29” (700C) or 27.5” (650B) wheel sizes, clearing up to a 2.6”-wide tyre. Those dimensions are much more ‘mountain bike’ than ‘gravel bike’, and some of the other standards on the frameset follow in that direction – although Ritchey says that you can run it with a flat bar or a drop bar, and has helpfully provided pictures to help you visualise it in either guise.  Here, take a look:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><ul><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ascent-2021-action-03-1-1340x893.jpg\" /><figcaption>Drop bars and bar bags …</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ascent-2021-action-07-1-1340x893.jpg\" /><figcaption>… flat bars and getting zoomy. </figcaption></figure></li></ul></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The bottom bracket is English threaded, and 73 mm in width. The rear hub is Boost 148 mm spaced, and the brakes are post-mount rather than the flat-mount standard that’s the norm on gravel bikes nowadays. While that’s arguably less discreet-looking, it’s also much less fussy to get and keep aligned. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The whole thing’s dressed up in a hard-wearing, understated and handsome orange-ish ‘Sierra Red’ paintjob, with a vibe that leans much more ‘flannies and baggy shorts’ than ‘lycra and aero optimisation’. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would not kick one out of the garage. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A place in the Ritchey range</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the release of a new Ascent, there’s the question of where it fits in with other bikes in the Ritchey line-up, which already includes a couple of gravel bikes and a hardtail mountain bike (along with beloved classics like the <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2020/04/bikes-of-the-staff-bunch-iain-treloars-ritchey-road-logic/\">Ritchey Road Logic</a>). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ritchey’s adventure-oriented gravel bike, <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2020/08/new-ritchey-outback-break-away-models-are-dreaming-of-adventure/\">the Outback</a>, is probably the closest, and the two are reasonably close in terms of geometry. However, the Ascent is a little longer in the chainstays (463 mm) than the already-long Outback (453 mm), and the head tube angle is half a degree slacker at 70.5°. That contributes to a wheelbase of 1092.4 mm (size L), which sounds lovely and stable, especially if you’re on rough terrain or if you’re hauling a load. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to the Outback, the reach of the Ascent is within a couple of millimetres – although, obviously, run your sums depending on whether you’re considering a flat bar or a drop bar. The stack is a few centimetres taller due to the length of the fork. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-23-at-1.44.13-pm.png\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Any similarity to the Ritchey Outback can only be a good thing, in my book. We <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/01/ritchey-outback-break-away-review-the-zen-machine/\">reviewed that bike early this year</a> and I fell in love, buying it at the conclusion of the review period and selling the near-new gravel bike that I already owned. It was truly better than the sum of its parts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the Ascent manages to combine the gorgeous ride quality of the Outback with a more rugged, adventurous personality, it should be an appealing option indeed for those looking for a bike to ride off into the wilderness on. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><ul><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ascent-2021-Hero-03-1-1340x893.jpg\" /><figcaption>Thru-axles, rack and fender mounts, and a handsome dropout.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ascent-2021-Hero-04-1-1340x893.jpg\" /><figcaption>Post-mount brakes keep things simple. </figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ascent-2021-Hero-05-1-1340x893.jpg\" /><figcaption>The Ascent’s sloping top tube improves standover height when you’re shredding gnar.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ascent-2021-Hero-06-1-1340x893.jpg\" /><figcaption>External routing and mounting points for another bottle or an anything cage.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ascent-2021-Hero-07-1-1340x893.jpg\" /><figcaption>Like all of Ritchey’s steel frames, this is built out of the company’s proprietary Logic tubing …</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ascent-2021-Hero-08-1-1340x893.jpg\" /><figcaption>… and bears this iconic little emblem.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ascent-2021-Hero-09-1-1340x893.jpg\" /><figcaption>Tyre clearance for daaaaaays.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ascent-2021-Hero-01-1-1340x893.jpg\" /><figcaption>In flat bar mode, it looks like a fun, unpretentious bike for zipping about on. </figcaption></figure></li></ul></figure>\n\n\n    <div>\n    <div>\n\t\n\n\n\n<p><em>The Ascent frameset is available now, and retails for US$1,299 / EU€1,299 / AU$TBC.
