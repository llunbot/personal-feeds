Apple says that the ‌M1‌ Max chip uses 70% less power at peak graphic performance than a PC laptop with a discrete graphics card. Apple also claims that the ‌M1‌ Max chip offers \"similar performance\" to a \"pro laptop with high-performing discrete GPU\" while using 100 watts less power. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/apple-m1-max-graphics-claim.png\" />\r\n<br />\r\nTo make the claims, Apple tested the 16-inch MacBook Pro with the ‌M1‌ Max chip, featuring a 10-core CPU, 32-core GPU, and 64GB of RAM compared to the MSI GE76 Raider and the Razer Blade 15 Advanced. For a further breakdown of the GPU performance, <em><a href=\"https://www.notebookcheck.net/Apple-s-M1-Max-GPU-is-as-powerful-as-an-Nvidia-RTX-2080-desktop-GPU-and-the-Sony-PS5-gaming-console.573846.0.html\">Notebookcheck</a></em> estimated how many teraflops the new ‌M1‌ Pro and ‌M1‌ Max chips can handle based on Apple's information about the new chips. These are their findings: \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<ul>\r\n<br />\r\n\t<li>‌M1‌ 8-core = 2.6 TF</li>\r\n<br />\r\n\t<li>‌M1‌ Pro 14-core = 4.5 TF</li>\r\n<br />\r\n\t<li>‌M1‌ Pro 16-core = 5.2 TF</li>\r\n<br />\r\n\t<li>‌M1‌ Max 24-core = 7.8 TF</li>\r\n<br />\r\n\t<li>‌M1‌ Max 32-core = 10.4 TF</li>\r\n<br />\r\n</ul>On paper, the ‌M1‌ Max chip maxed out with 32-cores of GPU can tackle more teraflops of graphics than Sony's PlayStation 5, which maxes out at 10.28 teraflops. <em>Notebookcheck's</em> numbers are based on estimations and not real-world testing, but until the new laptops begin arriving in the hands of customers next week, they are all we have to rely on. As noted by YouTuber ZoneOfTech <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ZONEofTECH/status/1450398087600611330\">on Twitter</a>, the ‌M1‌ Max chip can also read up to 7.4GB per second, higher than the PlayStation 5's 5.5GB read speed.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe new MacBook Pros cost more than the PlayStation 5, but nonetheless, Apple's ability to make claims about a portable laptop that rivals a high-end gaming console is impressive. As stated above, these claims are just on-paper, and proper performance and speed tests will surely come shortly after the new MacBook Pros start arriving for customers next week.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro-13/\">13\" MacBook Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">14\" and 16\" MacBook Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/october-2021-apple-event/\">October 2021 Apple Event</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_13\">13\" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">16\" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/19/m1-max-chip-graphic-power-playstation-5/\">M1 Max Chip May Have More Raw GPU Performance Than a PlayStation 5</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m1-max-chip-may-have-more-raw-gpu-performance-than-a-playstation-5.2317903/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=-VxoVHnPaS8:kC9QiMyp-eg:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=-VxoVHnPaS8:kC9QiMyp-eg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/-VxoVHnPaS8\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"880b333810208472ccc4aeee6e4a5afbd5cf7d0086c85ffe1778a31e5658d991","category":"Apple"}
