The spiraled microbe is a relative of the more well-known <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em> spirochete<em>,</em> the bacterium that causes Lyme disease. But <em>B.</em><em> miyamotoi</em> has many notable differences from its cousin, including its inconspicuous spread.</p>\n<p>While Lyme disease was <a href=\"https://irp.nih.gov/accomplishments/discovery-of-the-disease-agent-causing-lyme-disease\">first reported in 1975</a> in the US and <em>B. burgdorferi</em> <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7043737/\">first identified in 1982</a>, <em>B. miyamotoi</em> was only identified in ticks in 1995 in Japan. But once discovered, it was soon found in many other places, including Europe and many parts of North America. Ticks collected in California <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4205013/#pone.0110853-CDPHVBDS1\">as early as 2000</a> were found to carry the new spirochete, for example. Yet, <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26053877/\">the first cases</a> of disease caused by <em>B. miyamotoi</em> in the US were only first confirmed in 2013 in the Northeast. Until now, no confirmed cases have been reported in the western part of the country, despite <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4205013/\">the bacterium's prevalence</a> in adult black-legged ticks (<em>Ixodes pacificus</em>) being similar to that of <em>B. burgdorferi</em>, the Lyme disease spirochete.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1931570#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1931570&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"931ca48d896f33995a1b1c99ebf67afa39d858e33a0f9b23d59e711eaf214277","category":"Tech"}
