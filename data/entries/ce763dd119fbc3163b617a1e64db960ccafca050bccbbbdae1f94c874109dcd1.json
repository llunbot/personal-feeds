{"title":"Chris King 6-Bolt MTB Hubs Are Back!","link":"https://bikerumor.com/chris-king-6-bolt-mtb-hubs-are-back/","date":1679668047000,"content":"<p>If you’re a die-hard Chris King fan and only run 6-bolt rotors, you’re likely painfully aware of the absence of those hubs in the lineup. According to Chris King, they were capacity-limited during the pandemic, and they made the tough call of discontinuing 6-bolt mountain hubs. They also figured that since centerlock-to-6-bolt adapters existed, riders would still be able to use their hubs with 6-bolt rotors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But fans of 6-bolt rotors are generally also fans of keeping it simple and adding another adapter to the mix doesn’t qualify. Chris King knows this, and is happy to announce the return of their 6-bolt Boost mountain hubs!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Chris-King-6-bolt-hubs-are-back3.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"526\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Chris-King-6-bolt-hubs-are-back3-800x526.jpg\" alt=\"Chris King 6 bolt mountain boost hubs\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Chris-King-6-bolt-hubs-are-back3-800x526.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Chris-King-6-bolt-hubs-are-back3-297x195.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Chris-King-6-bolt-hubs-are-back3-120x79.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Chris-King-6-bolt-hubs-are-back3-768x505.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Chris-King-6-bolt-hubs-are-back3-1536x1011.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Chris-King-6-bolt-hubs-are-back3.jpg 2044w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Available only in Boost spacing, you’ll have the typical CK options of steel or ceramic bearings, Shimano HG, Micro Spline, or SRAM XD freehubs, and 28 or 32h drilling.
