Here’s everything you need to know.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>ICYMI: Watch the event</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure><h2>Everything Apple released at ‘Unleashed’</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>HomePod mini and Apple Music Voice Plan</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple started the event with <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/545351/apple-music-voice-plan-homepod-mini-colors.html\">two surprise announcements</a>: new colors for the HomePod mini (orange, yellow, and blue) that match the back of the iMac, and a new voice-only Apple Music tier for $4.99. You’ll have to use Siri to play music, but you’ll have access to the entire Apple Music catalog of 90 million songs, including playlists and radio stations. You’ll also get algorithmic personalized playlists.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/airpods-3rd-gen-driver.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" /></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>AirPods (third generation)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple unveiled <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/545298/apples-third-generation-airpods-are-finally-here.html\">the third reversion of its entry level AirPods</a> that have a new design and new audio features, including spatial audio. They also have better sound and battery life, and a new case that supports MagSafe with the iPhone magnetic charger. They’re a bit cheaper than before: $179 versus $199 for the previous model with the wireless charging case.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>M1 Pro and M1 Max</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The next phase of the Apple silicon transition officially commenced with the launch of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/350372/apple-silicon-m1-m1x-m2-processor-cpu-gpu.html\">M1 Pro and M1 Max processors</a> for the new MacBook Pro. Built on the same 5nm process, the M1 Pro has up to a 10-core CPU, 16-core GPU, and support up to 32GB of unified memory. The M1 Max has a 10-core CPU with up to 32GB GPU and support up to 64GB of RAM. Apple says the CPU is up to 70 percent faster than the M1 with graphics up to 4 times faster.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The star of the “Unleashed” event was the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/346129/2021-macbook-pro-14-inch-16-inch-mini-led-m1x-touch-bar-price-release.html\">MacBook Pro</a>, which is a complete overhaul of the previous machine. Available in 14-inch and 16-inch sizes, it brings a slew of changes: The Touch Bar is gone, the bezels have shrunk, the ports have been expanded to include HDMI and an SD card slot, and MagSafe is back. It’s the most significant redesign in many years and with the M1 Pro and M1 Max processors should fulfill professionals’ wildest dreams.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>macOS Monterey</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple will unveil <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/353470/macos-monterey-superguide-features-tips-tricks-updates.html\">macOS Monterey</a> on October 25 with several new features.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>‘Unleashed’ as it happened </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s <strong>opening video makes a song out of Mac sounds</strong>, including the iconic chime that was briefly removed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is focusing on two important areas: <strong>Music and the Mac.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple Music getting new playlists for <strong>hundreds of moods</strong>. Siri can play different playlists based on what you’re doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>New Apple Music subscription plan: <strong>Voice Plan for $5</strong>.
