But, its pivot was basically inline with the spacer that slid over your fork’s steerer tube.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/k-edge-race-stem-mount-2025-1.webp\"><img width=\"1900\" height=\"1425\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/k-edge-race-stem-mount-2025-1.webp\" alt=\"k-edge race stem mount shown flipped downward, from the top.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/k-edge-race-stem-mount-2025-1.webp 1900w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/k-edge-race-stem-mount-2025-1-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/k-edge-race-stem-mount-2025-1-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/k-edge-race-stem-mount-2025-1-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/k-edge-race-stem-mount-2025-1-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>That’s a new top cap, too…</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This new Race Stem Mount has an offset pivot, sitting higher or lower depending on what you need and how your cockpit is arranged. For folks with slammed one-piece handlebars like those from Bontrager, Roval, Syncros, and FSA, put the pivot up top to keep the mount flush with the slope of he handlebar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This layout should work well with slim, negative rise stems for XC bikes, as well as road and gravel bikes (or that new <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/sage-droptimator-is-a-shreddy-drop-bar-mountain-bike/\">Sage Droptimator!</a>). Even better, the spacer part that slides over your steerer is slimmer than ever at just 3mm (down from 5mm), keeping total stack height as low as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/k-edge-race-stem-mount-2025-7.webp\"><img width=\"1900\" height=\"1425\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/k-edge-race-stem-mount-2025-7.webp\" alt=\"k-edge race stem mount shown flipped upward.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/k-edge-race-stem-mount-2025-7.webp 1900w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/k-edge-race-stem-mount-2025-7-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/k-edge-race-stem-mount-2025-7-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/k-edge-race-stem-mount-2025-7-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/k-edge-race-stem-mount-2025-7-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For short stems with a taller faceplate to fit 35mm OD handlebars, flip it the other way and put the pivot bulging downward so it doesn’t hinder your ability to angle your cycling computer upwards.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/k-edge-race-stem-mount-2025-5.webp\"><img width=\"2025\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/k-edge-race-stem-mount-2025-5.webp\" alt=\"k-edge race stem mount shown centered over steerer tube.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/k-edge-race-stem-mount-2025-5.webp 2025w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/k-edge-race-stem-mount-2025-5-297x196.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/k-edge-race-stem-mount-2025-5-1536x1011.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/k-edge-race-stem-mount-2025-5-120x79.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/k-edge-race-stem-mount-2025-5-768x506.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And if none of that works for you, just mount the whole thing upside down and flip the front over to get the computer mount centered over your steerer. Three mounting spots, one part. Very clever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MSRP is $49.95 for the mount alone, and $59.95 with that new top cap. Speaking of, they say that top cap is the lightest such part at just 5g. The mount is 18g. Those will be sold separately for $14.95 if you’d like a little K-Edge finishing kit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Available starting April 10 in Black and Red, other colors to follow later. It comes with mounting pucks to fit Garmin or Wahoo cycling computers, and you can swap in for the Hammerhead Karoo puck separately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://k-edge.com\" target=\"_blank\">K-Edge.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/k-edge-race-mount-computer-mount/\">K-Edge Race Stem Mount Now Flips Three Ways</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Staff","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"ea0fad26eceb48a07b58913bf07dc9835d3660257731397eb5969eafeccd45d2","category":"Cycling"}
