There are options, sure, but if you're after a numpad, a decent price, or different color options, the pool gets small. But an unlikely ally has emerged in the battle for more wireless mechanical options: pricey peripheral-maker Razer, which is now entering the productivity space with fewer RGB lights or snake logos.</p>\n<p>The Razer Pro Type Ultra, <a href=\"https://www.razer.com/gaming-keyboards/razer-pro-type-ultra/RZ03-04110200-R3U1\" target=\"_blank\">announced this week for $160</a> and set to ship in Q4, can connect to three devices via Bluetooth (you switch between them using keyboard shortcuts). It also features a wireless dongle and a cable for wired connections, so it's ready for today's multi-device world. Razer's Synapse software lets users reprogram the Pro Type Ultra's buttons and even create macros to make work more efficient.</p>\n<p>However, the Pro Type Ultra isn't a solution for everyone. For one thing, it adds to the already high price of the original Razer Pro Type, which currently has an MSRP of $126 (though <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2ZVJYQO\" target=\"_blank\">it's sometimes cheaper</a>). The new keyboard offers much better battery life, dampening foam for a quieter sound profile, and a wrist restâ€”at the cost of some extra cash.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1809648#p3\">Read 50 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1809648&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bfbb0590b1e086dbba49ecf7a05d8096c03a72af878db443a53f2a8f329d5365","category":"Tech"}
