Nothing was stolen from the coffee shop, but it will cost $1,500 to replace locks and repair the bathroom wall.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNo employees were at the â€ŒApple Storeâ€Œ when the theft happened as the Alderwood Mall had closed for the night. An Alderwood spokesperson said they were working with the police to solve the incident, but Apple has not yet commented.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/\">Apple Store</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/06/washington-apple-store-theft/\">Thieves Tunnel Through Coffee Shop Wall to Steal $500,000 in iPhones From Washington Apple Store</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/thieves-tunnel-through-coffee-shop-wall-to-steal-500-000-in-iphones-from-washington-apple-store.2386121/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"073d7d0e44b6567fc05ffaf3173a7b3120f0132c6f4514200d41caf527c7b5cb","category":"Apple"}
