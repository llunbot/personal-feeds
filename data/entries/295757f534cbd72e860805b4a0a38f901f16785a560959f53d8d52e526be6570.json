This marks the first time Microsoft has developed an in-house AI model of this magnitude since investing <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/01/openai-and-microsoft-reaffirm-shared-quest-for-powerful-ai-with-new-investment/\">over $10 billion</a> in OpenAI for the rights to reuse the startup's AI models. OpenAI's GPT-4 powers not only <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/chatgpt-was-the-spark-that-lit-the-fire-under-generative-ai-one-year-ago-today/\">ChatGPT</a> but also Microsoft Copilot.</p>\n\n<p>The development of MAI-1 is being led by Mustafa Suleyman, the former Google AI leader who recently served as CEO of the AI startup Inflection before Microsoft <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/03/deepmind-cofounder-mustafa-suleyman-will-run-microsofts-new-consumer-ai-unit/\">acquired the majority of the startup's staff</a> and intellectual property for $650 million in March. Although MAI-1 may build on techniques brought over by former Inflection staff, it is reportedly an entirely new large language model (LLM), as confirmed by two Microsoft employees familiar with the project.</p>\n<p>With approximately 500 billion parameters, MAI-1 will be significantly larger than Microsoft's previous open source models (such as Phi-3, which <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/microsofts-phi-3-shows-the-surprising-power-of-small-locally-run-ai-language-models/\">we covered</a> last month), requiring more computing power and training data. This reportedly places MAI-1 in a similar league as OpenAI's GPT-4, which is <a href=\"https://the-decoder.com/gpt-4-architecture-datasets-costs-and-more-leaked/\">rumored</a> to have over 1 trillion parameters (in a mixture-of-experts configuration) and well above smaller models like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/meta-releases-chatgpt-like-ai-site-and-open-weights-llama-3-model/\">Meta</a> and Mistral's 70 billion parameter models.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022157#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022157&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"295757f534cbd72e860805b4a0a38f901f16785a560959f53d8d52e526be6570","category":"Tech"}
