Apple's credit card uses the Mastercard network, and that might have prevented an American Express takeover.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGoldman Sachs is in the process of winding down its consumer lending business, which has lost billions of dollars in recent years. On a recent earnings call, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said the company is contracted to be the Apple Card's lender until 2030, but he said there is a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/15/goldman-sachs-apple-card-partnership-end-early/\">\"possibility\" that the partnership will end earlier</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn 2023, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> reported that Goldman Sachs <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/apple-goldman-sachs-partnership-ending/\">wanted out of the Apple Card partnership</a>, but it has yet to part ways with Apple.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLast year, the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/23/apple-responds-to-apple-card-fine/\">fined Apple and Goldman Sachs nearly $90 million</a> combined after finding the companies mishandled transaction disputes and misled iPhone users about interest-free payment options.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"Apple Card is one of the most consumer-friendly credit cards available, and was specifically designed to support users' financial health,\" said Apple, in response to the fine. \"Upon learning about these inadvertent issues years ago, Apple worked closely with Goldman Sachs to quickly address them and help impacted customers.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf the Apple Card does eventually get a new financial partner, it is unclear if there would be any major changes to the card's features and policies.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLaunched in 2019, Apple's credit card remains available in the U.S. only.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/\">Apple Card</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/reuters-com/\">Reuters</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/16/apple-card-new-partner-talks/\">Three Companies Are Now in the Running to Take Over the Apple Card</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/three-companies-are-now-in-the-running-to-take-over-the-apple-card.2447518/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4d9776dfdc59ec3466a51f84fc62ef80a5e8d4cc909ba832260528cc3f593495","category":"Apple"}
