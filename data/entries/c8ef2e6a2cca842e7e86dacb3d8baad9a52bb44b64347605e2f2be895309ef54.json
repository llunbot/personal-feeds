The ‘Z’ refers to Cervélo’s mountain bike range, with the ‘FS’ indicating it is full-suspension and the ‘5’ meaning it sits at the top of the model’s hierarchy.</p>\n<p>As is becoming ever more popular for cross-country bikes, the ZFS-5 is available with 100mm or 120mm of rear suspension to deal with evolving race circuits and more consumer-orientated riding.</p>\n<p>There is no difference in the frame, with the longer-travel option achieved by swapping in a longer stroke shock.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Cervélo ZFS-5 XX SL AXS linkage\" title=\"Cervélo ZFS-5 XX SL AXS linkage\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The ZFS-5 only uses a single pivot, which should reduce maintenance time.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Scott Windsor / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>A single-pivot, flex-stay suspension design is used on the rear of the bike, with a link driving the top-tube mounted shock.</p>\n<p>Flex-stay suspension systems use flex built into the rear triangle to articulate the suspension travel rather than a conventional pivot.</p>\n<p>We are seeing this on many of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cross-country-bikes/\">best cross-country bikes</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2023-pinarello-dogma-xc/\">Pinarello’s unreleased Dogma XC</a>. Cervélo says the design allows for greater weight saving, reduced maintenance and increased stiffness.</p>\n<p>For the ZFS-5, Cervélo appears to have borrowed heavily from its sister brand, Santa Cruz. The ZFS-5 shares a similar frameset design with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/santa-cruz-blur-xc-x01-axs-rsv-review/\">Santa Cruz’s Blur</a> mountain bike.</p>\n<p>The ZFS-5 also features shapely seatstays that are more in tune with the design language Cervélo has developed on its road and gravel bikes.</p>\n<div>\n    \n
