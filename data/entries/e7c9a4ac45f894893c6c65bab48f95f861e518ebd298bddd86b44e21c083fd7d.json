As it amassed well over 100 million crypto-trading users globally, it openly told the United States government that, as an offshore operation, it didn't have to comply with the country's financial regulations and money-laundering laws.</p>\n<p>Then, late last month, those <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/06/sec-sues-binance-says-it-evaded-us-law-with-extensive-web-of-deception/\">years of brushing off US regulators</a> caught up with the company in the form of one the most punitive <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/usa-binance-money-laundering-charges/\">money-laundering criminal settlements</a> in the history of the US Justice Department. The crackdown doesn't just mean a chastened Binance will have to change its practices going forward. It means that when the company is sentenced in a matter of months, it will be forced to open its <i>past</i> books to regulators, too. What was once a haven for anarchic crypto commerce is about to be transformed into the opposite: perhaps the most fed-friendly business in the cryptocurrency industry, retroactively offering more than a half-decade of users' transaction records to US regulators and law enforcement.</p>\n<p>When the Department of Justice <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/11/binance-ceo-changpeng-zhao-admits-to-money-laundering-in-plea-deal/\">announced on November 21</a> that Binance's executives had agreed to plead guilty to criminal money-laundering charges, much of the attention on that settlement focused on founder <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/binance-cz-ceo-quits-pleads-guilty-breaking-law/\">Changpeng Zhao giving up his CEO role</a> and on the company's record-breaking $4.3 billion fine. But Binance's settlement agreements with the DOJ and the US Treasury Department also stipulate a strict new regime of data-sharing with law enforcement and regulators. The company has agreed to comply with regulators' \"requests for information\"—a term that carries none of the evidence or suspicion requirements necessary for obtaining a warrant or even a subpoena—to the point of producing any \"information, testimony, document, record, or other tangible evidence.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1989378#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1989378&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e7c9a4ac45f894893c6c65bab48f95f861e518ebd298bddd86b44e21c083fd7d","category":"Tech"}
