That’s pretty unique as this growing standard hasn’t really trickled down to affordable steel bikes, but you’ll need it if you want to build up a bike with the latest wireless SRAM AXS Transmissions. Plus, it looks like Nordest also reshaped the new Bardino 3.5 to better fit how people actually ride…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Nordest Bardino 3.5 affordable steel enduro hardtail with UDH</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Nordest-Bardino-v3-5_affordable-steel-enduro-hardtail-with-UDH_classic-blue-and-yellow.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Nordest-Bardino-v3-5_affordable-steel-enduro-hardtail-with-UDH_classic-blue-and-yellow.jpg\" alt=\"Affordable Nordest Bardino v3.5 steel enduro hardtail gets UDH, angled frame\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Nordest-Bardino-v3-5_affordable-steel-enduro-hardtail-with-UDH_classic-blue-and-yellow.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Nordest-Bardino-v3-5_affordable-steel-enduro-hardtail-with-UDH_classic-blue-and-yellow-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Nordest-Bardino-v3-5_affordable-steel-enduro-hardtail-with-UDH_classic-blue-and-yellow-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Nordest-Bardino-v3-5_affordable-steel-enduro-hardtail-with-UDH_classic-blue-and-yellow-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Nordest-Bardino-v3-5_affordable-steel-enduro-hardtail-with-UDH_classic-blue-and-yellow-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Nordest-Bardino-v3-5_affordable-steel-enduro-hardtail-with-UDH_classic-blue-and-yellow-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Nordest-Bardino-v3-5_affordable-steel-enduro-hardtail-with-UDH_classic-blue-and-yellow-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Nordest)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Bardino 3.5 is the latest iteration of Nordest’s affordable steel enduro hardtail. First introduced in 2017 in <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/nordest-bardino-new-steel-enduro-hardtail-trail-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">steel</a> and then <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/nordest-back-affordable-titanium-bardino-enduro-mountain-bike-hardtail/\" target=\"_blank\">titanium</a>, the Bardino was a hardtail a bit ahead of its time. Starting with big tire clearance and slack geometry designed around long travel forks, Pedro Jerónimo created an affordable hardtail meant to tame the toughest, steepest enduro trails out there. It’s an interesting bike category – there are those who love it or hate it. But riding a big travel hardtail can be a lot of fun, but does require some extra skill and attention, because no matter how slack it starts out, the bike’s handling gets steeper the bigger the hits keep coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this update is a direct response to those customers who love the way the bike rides…</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s new?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Nordest-Bardino-v3-5_affordable-steel-enduro-hardtail-with-UDH_detail.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Nordest-Bardino-v3-5_affordable-steel-enduro-hardtail-with-UDH_detail.jpg\" alt=\"Affordable Nordest Bardino v3.5 steel enduro hardtail gets UDH, universal derailleur hanger detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Nordest-Bardino-v3-5_affordable-steel-enduro-hardtail-with-UDH_detail.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Nordest-Bardino-v3-5_affordable-steel-enduro-hardtail-with-UDH_detail-297x186.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Nordest-Bardino-v3-5_affordable-steel-enduro-hardtail-with-UDH_detail-1536x960.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Nordest-Bardino-v3-5_affordable-steel-enduro-hardtail-with-UDH_detail-120x75.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Nordest-Bardino-v3-5_affordable-steel-enduro-hardtail-with-UDH_detail-768x480.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There aren’t a lot of steel bikes that use the SRAM Universal Derailleur Hanger. This new standard seems to have really been designed around the thicker dropouts of carbon mountain bikes. And to recreate that in steel kinda requires a heavy bulky dropout, that doesn’t always seem well-suited for thin steel tubes. Yet, Nordest has created a pretty light-looking hollowed-out hooded dropout to do the trick.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Nordest-Bardino-v3-5_affordable-steel-enduro-hardtail-with-UDH_black-angled-non-driveside.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Nordest-Bardino-v3-5_affordable-steel-enduro-hardtail-with-UDH_black-angled-non-driveside.jpg\" alt=\"Affordable Nordest Bardino v3.5 steel enduro hardtail gets UDH, black frame NDS\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Nordest-Bardino-v3-5_affordable-steel-enduro-hardtail-with-UDH_black-angled-non-driveside.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Nordest-Bardino-v3-5_affordable-steel-enduro-hardtail-with-UDH_black-angled-non-driveside-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Nordest-Bardino-v3-5_affordable-steel-enduro-hardtail-with-UDH_black-angled-non-driveside-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Nordest-Bardino-v3-5_affordable-steel-enduro-hardtail-with-UDH_black-angled-non-driveside-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Nordest-Bardino-v3-5_affordable-steel-enduro-hardtail-with-UDH_black-angled-non-driveside-768x461.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The other interesting update appears to be the removal of the small downtube-to-toptube strut that the 3rd generation bike added to boost max fork travel to 180mm. I’d have to guess that so few riders strapped on such long-travel forks, that Nordest just didn’t see the benefit to adding the extra tube. Anyway, with the gusseted downtube, you can still run a 140-170mm fork. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2022-Nordest-Bardino-3-affordable-steel-enduro-MTB-hardtail_new-geometry.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2022-Nordest-Bardino-3-affordable-steel-enduro-MTB-hardtail_new-geometry.jpg\" alt=\"2022 Nordest Bardino 3 affordable steel enduro MTB hardtail mountain bike, geometry\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2022-Nordest-Bardino-3-affordable-steel-enduro-MTB-hardtail_new-geometry.jpg 1000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2022-Nordest-Bardino-3-affordable-steel-enduro-MTB-hardtail_new-geometry-297x119.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2022-Nordest-Bardino-3-affordable-steel-enduro-MTB-hardtail_new-geometry-800x320.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2022-Nordest-Bardino-3-affordable-steel-enduro-MTB-hardtail_new-geometry-120x48.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2022-Nordest-Bardino-3-affordable-steel-enduro-MTB-hardtail_new-geometry-768x307.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Geometry-wise, the mk3.5 Bardino is the same as the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/nordest-bardino-3-reshapes-tougher-still-affordable-steel-enduro-hardtail-mtb/\" target=\"_blank\">mk3 bike</a> that debuted a few years ago. And 160mm forks seem to be the sweet spot to soak up big hits at a 64.5° head angle, but still be efficient to pedal up or downhill. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t mess with success, they say.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Nordest-Bardino-v3-5_affordable-steel-enduro-hardtail-with-UDH_side-view.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Nordest-Bardino-v3-5_affordable-steel-enduro-hardtail-with-UDH_side-view.jpg\" alt=\"Affordable Nordest Bardino v3.5 steel enduro hardtail gets UDH, blue frame\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Nordest-Bardino-v3-5_affordable-steel-enduro-hardtail-with-UDH_side-view.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Nordest-Bardino-v3-5_affordable-steel-enduro-hardtail-with-UDH_side-view-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Nordest-Bardino-v3-5_affordable-steel-enduro-hardtail-with-UDH_side-view-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Nordest-Bardino-v3-5_affordable-steel-enduro-hardtail-with-UDH_side-view-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Nordest-Bardino-v3-5_affordable-steel-enduro-hardtail-with-UDH_side-view-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Nordest-Bardino-v3-5_affordable-steel-enduro-hardtail-with-UDH_side-view-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>double-butted 4130 chromoly steel frame made in Taiwan, 2850g claimed (M/L)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>29 x 2.6″ max tire clearance (or even 27.5 x 3″)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>short 425mm chainstays with a bent seattube</li>\n\n\n\n<li>low standover height with straight toptube into seatstays &amp; seattube brace</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Boost spacing</li>\n\n\n\n<li>73mm BSA threaded BB</li>\n\n\n\n<li>44mm headtube for 1.5″ tapered headset/forks</li>\n\n\n\n<li>3-pack cage mounting inside the main triangle, plus cage mount under the downtube</li>\n\n\n\n<li>external cable routing</li>\n\n\n\n<li>31.6mm seatpost with internal dropper routing</li>\n\n\n\n<li>UDH hanger &amp; SRAM T-type Transmission compatible</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Nordest Bardino 3.5 – Pre-order, pricing, options &amp; availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Nordest-Bardino-v3-5_affordable-steel-enduro-hardtail-with-UDH_black-or-blue.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Nordest-Bardino-v3-5_affordable-steel-enduro-hardtail-with-UDH_black-or-blue.jpg\" alt=\"Updated affordable Nordest Bardino v3.5  steel enduro hardtail adds UDH universal derailleur hanger for SRAM T-type transmission compatibility, in black or blue\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Nordest-Bardino-v3-5_affordable-steel-enduro-hardtail-with-UDH_black-or-blue.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Nordest-Bardino-v3-5_affordable-steel-enduro-hardtail-with-UDH_black-or-blue-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Nordest-Bardino-v3-5_affordable-steel-enduro-hardtail-with-UDH_black-or-blue-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Nordest-Bardino-v3-5_affordable-steel-enduro-hardtail-with-UDH_black-or-blue-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Nordest-Bardino-v3-5_affordable-steel-enduro-hardtail-with-UDH_black-or-blue-768x461.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Their longest-running bike in an updated version, the steel Bardino 3.5 hardtail will sell for 750€ (almost the same price the Bardino 2 &amp; 3).
