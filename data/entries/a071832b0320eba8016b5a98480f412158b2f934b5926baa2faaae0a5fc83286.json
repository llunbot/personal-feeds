Even the wheels, which never seem to get as much attention, are great. Here’s my long-term review…</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Setup &amp; Install Notes</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-07.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-07.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of shimano ultegra R8100 12-speed road bike crankset\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-07.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-07-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-07-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-07-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-07-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-07-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I installed the Ultegra group on a <a href=\"https://www.pursuitcycles.com/the-all-road\" target=\"_blank\">Pursuit Allroad</a>, an excellent bike that made my <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/editors-choice-awards-2022-tylers-favorite-bikes-gear/\">2022 Editor’s Choice</a> list. Everything went as it should with one catch that’s important to note if you’re installing it yourself, and this includes shop folks… make sure to use the correct spacers on the BB spindle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you read the next five paragraphs, know that I’m not knocking anyone. This is a simple mistake that anyone can make, and it caused a lot of head-scratching grief. Shimano installed the group in their SoCal HQ and commented about how front shifting seemed off. The front derailleur couldn’t move the chain far enough down to reliably shift onto the small chainring.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shimano-ultregra-12-speed-R8100-fd-trim-error-.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shimano-ultregra-12-speed-R8100-fd-trim-error-.jpg\" alt=\"shimano ultegra install\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shimano-ultregra-12-speed-R8100-fd-trim-error-.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shimano-ultregra-12-speed-R8100-fd-trim-error--297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shimano-ultregra-12-speed-R8100-fd-trim-error--800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shimano-ultregra-12-speed-R8100-fd-trim-error--120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shimano-ultregra-12-speed-R8100-fd-trim-error--768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shimano-ultregra-12-speed-R8100-fd-trim-error--1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So they sent it back to Pursuit thinking that it was a frame tolerance issue. Carl Strong, co-founder of Pursuit and amazing frame builder, checked, re-checked, and confirmed the frame was exactly to spec.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shimano-ultregra-12-speed-R8100-fd-trim-error-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shimano-ultregra-12-speed-R8100-fd-trim-error-1.jpg\" alt=\"shimano ultegra front derailleur troubleshooting\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shimano-ultregra-12-speed-R8100-fd-trim-error-1.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shimano-ultregra-12-speed-R8100-fd-trim-error-1-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shimano-ultregra-12-speed-R8100-fd-trim-error-1-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shimano-ultregra-12-speed-R8100-fd-trim-error-1-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shimano-ultregra-12-speed-R8100-fd-trim-error-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shimano-ultregra-12-speed-R8100-fd-trim-error-1-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Even so, he heated and molded a small divot into the downtube to add clearance for the front derailleur’s cage pivot, and that helped, but didn’t entirely fix it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I received the bike and had the local Shimano rep visit to replace the front derailleur, thinking maybe that was the issue, and then re-check everything. The new part was identical to the original, and that wasn’t the problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/tyler-working-on-bike.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/tyler-working-on-bike.jpg\" alt=\"tyler working on a road bike with shimano ultegra\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/tyler-working-on-bike.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/tyler-working-on-bike-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/tyler-working-on-bike-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/tyler-working-on-bike-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/tyler-working-on-bike-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/tyler-working-on-bike-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption>Sometimes even the brightest minds get stumped.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Turns out, we needed a 1-2mm (<em>I forget which, exactly</em>) spacer on the crank spindle on the driveside to push the chainrings out. That tiny amount of additional offset solved the problem. It’s something so simple, with no other warning signs to suggest it, that it eluded Shimano, Pursuit, and myself until we just tried it on a whim.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The point? Try the simple stuff first, and try to think of other solutions. Once the spacer was installed, shifting was perfect and has been for the 18+ months I’ve been riding the bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shimano-ultregra-12-speed-R8100-wire-cradle.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shimano-ultregra-12-speed-R8100-wire-cradle.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shimano-ultregra-12-speed-R8100-wire-cradle.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shimano-ultregra-12-speed-R8100-wire-cradle-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shimano-ultregra-12-speed-R8100-wire-cradle-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shimano-ultregra-12-speed-R8100-wire-cradle-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shimano-ultregra-12-speed-R8100-wire-cradle-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shimano-ultregra-12-speed-R8100-wire-cradle-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The front derailleur comes with a small wire guide that gives it a 90º angle while also protecting it from bending too sharply. This also keeps it from looping so wide it rubs your rear tire. It’s tiny and best installed with your rear wheel <em>off the bike</em>, trust me.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shimano-ultregra-12-speed-R8100-derailleur-chain-setup-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1050\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shimano-ultregra-12-speed-R8100-derailleur-chain-setup-1.jpg\" alt=\"shimano road bike group chain length and rear derailleur setup\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shimano-ultregra-12-speed-R8100-derailleur-chain-setup-1.jpg 1400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shimano-ultregra-12-speed-R8100-derailleur-chain-setup-1-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shimano-ultregra-12-speed-R8100-derailleur-chain-setup-1-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shimano-ultregra-12-speed-R8100-derailleur-chain-setup-1-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shimano-ultregra-12-speed-R8100-derailleur-chain-setup-1-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Shimano has easy guides for setting chain length…</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shimano-ultregra-12-speed-R8100-derailleur-chain-setup-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shimano-ultregra-12-speed-R8100-derailleur-chain-setup-2.jpg\" alt=\"shimano road bike group chain length and rear derailleur setup\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shimano-ultregra-12-speed-R8100-derailleur-chain-setup-2.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shimano-ultregra-12-speed-R8100-derailleur-chain-setup-2-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shimano-ultregra-12-speed-R8100-derailleur-chain-setup-2-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shimano-ultregra-12-speed-R8100-derailleur-chain-setup-2-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/shimano-ultregra-12-speed-R8100-derailleur-chain-setup-2-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>…and rear derailleur B-tension settings.

If you’re building a bike or upgrading, it’s a great choice not only amongst Shimano’s drivetrains but a great choice in general.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Shifting is as quick as ever, to me feeling slightly faster than SRAM. It’s also very quiet, and feels smooth and effortless, even for an electronic group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you haven’t watched this video yet, please do, there’s a lot more to it than just speed…it also slightly overshifts every cog to ensure the chain gets where it needs to go, then trims back. It’s really cool!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-08.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of shimano ultegra R8100 12-speed road bike front derailleur\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-08.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-08-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-08-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-08-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-08-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-08-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The front shifting is powerful and direct, as I expected. I’ve also owned Dura-Ace Di2 and GRX Di2 11-speed groups, and the new 12-speed front shifting seems slightly smoother.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-16.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-16.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of shimano ultegra R8100 12-speed road bike crankset\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-16.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-16-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-16-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-16-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-16-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-16-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>SIDEBAR:</strong> I can’t review this group without talking about <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/shimano-11-speed-road-crankset-inspection-recall/\">Shimano’s 11-speed crankarm recall</a>. The 12-speed cranks are made using the same hollow forged and bonded construction, so I asked Shimano what changed with these new ones to prevent them from having the same problem. Their response was:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>Shimano has made numerous changes, improvements, and enhancements in response to the market information we received. This is standard practice at Shimano.</em>“</p>\n\n\n\n<p>…which is about what I expected. I’d love a more technical explanation, but they’re very secretive about their processes. I got a look at that process during <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/shimano-factory-tour-this-is-why-theyre-masters-of-the-metal/\">my factory tour for the XTR launch</a> if you’d like to see it. FWIW, they’re not the only brand using this construction method, and I haven’t had any problems with these (or my prior DA) cranks.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-04.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-04.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of shimano ultegra R8100 12-speed road bike rear derailleur\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-04.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-04-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-04-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-04-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-04-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-04-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The rear derailleur is interesting. There’s no clutch or spring damping for the pulley cage, and the spring tension is very light. I applaud having derailleurs that can cover everything from road to rough gravel, but I also appreciate a part that’s purpose built to excel at one thing. I believe this is what allows Shimano’s shifting to feel so light and fast, which is especially noticeable on their mechanical groups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is allows the chain to bounce, but not how you might think. As the two action shots (and dust) suggest, a lot of my road rides end up on stretches of gravel, sometimes with lots of stutter bumps and potholes. Despite these mini adventures, I never noticed that lack of chain management and never dropped a chain.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-05.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-05.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of shimano ultegra R8100 12-speed road bike cassette\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-05.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-05-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-05-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-05-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-05-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-05-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption>That’s not grit, it’s wax. I highly recommend switching to wax lubes.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Where I notice it is when I backpedal quickly, particularly in the small chainring. I do this to adjust crankarm position for a corner, or shuffle around on my saddle. A quick, exaggerated backpedal often yanks the pulley cage forward, creating a big swoop of chain slack, followed by a rapid retraction. It feels weird, a little disconcerting, and is diminished by increasing B-screw tension.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I considered shortening the chain slightly, but the setup is dialed according to spec and a shorter chain would likely cause issues getting into the largest cogs from the big chainring (<em>I know, you don’t have to say it, but we all do it</em>). Ultimately, it hasn’t affected performance, but I wanted to mention it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-11.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-11.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of shimano ultegra R8100 12-speed road bike shifters\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-11.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-11-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-11-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-11-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-11-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-11-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Hood shapes are great, with nice ridges on top for grip. The pronounced bump at the front is reassuring on spirited climbs, and finger clearance is adequate when braking from the hoods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The larger shift paddles are easy to use, and the differing textures make them easy to identify even with full finger gloves. The wireless design is nice, decluttering the cockpit, and shifting is as fast as ever…I couldn’t tell any difference between reaction speed from prior wired versions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The charging port is on the rear derailleur, which is a big upgrade from the tiny junction port and having to wire it somewhere. It’s still a single wire to charge the group, which is convenient, though you’ll need to put your bike near an outlet.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-12.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-12.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of shimano ultegra R8100 12-speed road bike shifters\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-12.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-12-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-12-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-12-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-12-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-12-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption>That’s good luck, right?</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>SIDEBAR:</strong> Shimano often sends review groups with a full PRO cockpit, and their <a href=\"https://www.pro-bikegear.com/us/road/handlebars/plt-ergo-carbon-handlebar\" target=\"_blank\">PRO PLT Ergo Carbon Handlebar</a> deserves a shout-out. It has an exceptionally good shape. The flattened tops get deeper at the corners where my hands often rest, creating a huge platform for my palms. It’s stiffer than most carbon bars I’ve ridden, so it transmits a bit more vibration, but I plan on swapping to a gel-backed bar tape to mitigate that because its ergonomics are worth keeping.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.pro-bikegear.com/us/road/stems/plt-stem\" target=\"_blank\">PLT stem</a> is also great, with surprisingly good torsional stiffness for its girth and faceplate width.

It’s a good mix, and I like the extra modulation the larger rotor provides.

They simply don’t hype them enough, but they’re really good. They’re aero without making a bunch of aero claims, and Ultegra shares the same rim profile as the Dura-Ace wheels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They roll very smoothly thanks to cup-and-cone bearings. The 21mm internal width rims held everything from 28mm to 36mm-ish tires with easy tubeless setup. And they’re reasonably light (628g front, 872g rear, 1500g total) for the C50 model (50mm deep rims, also available in 36mm and 60mm depths).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-09.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-09-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of shimano ultegra R8100 12-speed road bike wheels\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-09-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-09-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-09-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-09-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-09-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-09.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-18.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-18-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of shimano ultegra R8100 12-speed road bike hubs\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-18-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-18-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-18-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-18-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-18-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-closeup-details-18.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The hubs have a gray anodizing to match the rest of the group and come with a standard HG freehub body.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-riding-gravel-01.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-riding-gravel-01.jpg\" alt=\"riding action on shimano ultegra R8100 12-speed road bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-riding-gravel-01.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-riding-gravel-01-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-riding-gravel-01-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-riding-gravel-01-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-riding-gravel-01-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/shimano-ultegra-di2-R8100-review-riding-gravel-01-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For high performance road riding, Ultegra Di2 12-speed leaves nothing to be desired.
