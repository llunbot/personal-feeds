He spoke earlier this week at theÂ 35th National Youth Science and Technology Innovation Competition in China. The full video can be <a href=\"https://castic.cyscc.org/35/lectures/lecture1.html\">found here</a>.</p>\n<p>During Lehao's speech, he said one of these large rockets would launch a lunar lander into orbit around the Moon, and the second would send the crew to meet it. The crew would then transfer to the lander, go down to the Moon's surface, and spend about six hours walking on its surface. Then part of the lunar lander would ascend back to meet the spacecraft and return to Earth.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1791535#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1791535&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4d04d422b38c7736d228879cc0a79bd0ffe7c958f612d1c5955dab2e010fdafe","category":"Tech"}
