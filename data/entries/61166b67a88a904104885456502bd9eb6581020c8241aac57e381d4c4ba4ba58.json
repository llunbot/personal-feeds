They are a boutique-ish style carbon wheel company that produces wheels for on and off-road riding. Their designs are focused on lightweight builds, with their own hubs and rim designs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For 2025, Dandy Horse is upping the ante on gravel, road, and all-road riding (but curiously not MTB) with three new wheelsets. The new lineup includes the Hyperion 45 GRV, Hyperion 30, and Positron 30, all featuring a unique “Double Hook” rim design. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Did you just say double hook?</em></strong> Yes, Dandy Horse says the new double hook design will give riders maximum tire security and stability at any pressure. Here’s the lowdown on what a double-hook rim offers.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dandy-Horse-Double-Hook-rims-design-.png\"><img width=\"1196\" height=\"706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dandy-Horse-Double-Hook-rims-design-.png\" alt=\"Dandy Horse Double Hook rims design\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dandy-Horse-Double-Hook-rims-design-.png 1196w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dandy-Horse-Double-Hook-rims-design--297x175.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dandy-Horse-Double-Hook-rims-design--120x71.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dandy-Horse-Double-Hook-rims-design--768x453.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is <strong>Double Hook Rim Technology</strong>?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Dandy Horse claims to be the only manufacturer currently offering carbon rims with this Double Hook design. The design integrates an outer hook to complement the traditional inner hook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Why Double Hooked? </em></strong>Dandy Horse says the new tech will improve safety and durability, particularly when riding over rough terrain with low-pressure tires—a common scenario in gravel cycling. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Is anyone else doing this? </em></strong>Not exactly, but there are some brands with similar concepts. Both <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/zipp-1zero-hi-top-carbon-xc-wheels/\">Zipp</a> and <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/enve-m-series-mountain-bike-wheels/\">ENVE</a> have used rim profiles with extra wide rim edges that are meant to prevent pinch flats and rim damage. Both of these designs were hookless though, so it seems like Dandy Horse is combining that concept with a hooked internal to create a hooked rim that could be as durable as hookless. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dandy-Horse-Double-Hook-rims-front-hubs-.png\"><img width=\"1374\" height=\"904\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dandy-Horse-Double-Hook-rims-front-hubs-.png\" alt=\"Dandy Horse Double Hook rims front hubs\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dandy-Horse-Double-Hook-rims-front-hubs-.png 1374w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dandy-Horse-Double-Hook-rims-front-hubs--297x195.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dandy-Horse-Double-Hook-rims-front-hubs--120x79.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dandy-Horse-Double-Hook-rims-front-hubs--768x505.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Is Dandy Horse on the edge of an industry breakthrough? </em></strong>Maybe, though, the fact that this new tech isn’t on their carbon mountain bike line is curious. We hope to get a set in for review and see for ourselves. Until then, we’ll have to take it at what it is: a cool-sounding design that could be a game changer or the result of smart marketing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Double Hook design is standard across all models in the 2025 Hyperion lineup. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Dandy Horse Double Hook Rim Lineup </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dandy-Horse-Double-Hook-rims-wheels-.png\"><img width=\"1264\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dandy-Horse-Double-Hook-rims-wheels-.png\" alt=\"Dandy Horse Double Hook rims wheels\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dandy-Horse-Double-Hook-rims-wheels-.png 1264w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dandy-Horse-Double-Hook-rims-wheels--297x211.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dandy-Horse-Double-Hook-rims-wheels--120x85.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Dandy-Horse-Double-Hook-rims-wheels--768x547.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Hyperion 45 GRV: High-Profile Power for Gravel</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Leading the off-road charge is the Hyperion 45 GRV, Dandy Horse’s premier high-profile gravel wheelset.
