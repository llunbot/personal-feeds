Before various literature began characterizing them as mischievous, they were thought of as helpful in taking care of simple tasks while human inhabitants remained largely oblivious. Similarly, a well-designed hip pack takes care of carrying supplies for its wearer and is helpful in providing easy access to its contents while hopefully going mostly unnoticed.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-3.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-3.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-3.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-3.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-3.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-3.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-3.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-3.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>There is certainly no shortage of hip packs on the market these days, many designed specifically for cyclists with varying closure types, belts, buckles, and pockets/lashing mechanisms. I’ve used many of these over the years, as I mostly ride in warmer temperatures and prefer to keep airflow across most of my back rather than wearing a full backpack. Plus, they tend to be very convenient for commuting, hiking, and general gear transport.</p>\n<p>When I visited Harry, Ve, <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/wizard-works-bikepacking-bags-shop-visit/\" target=\"_blank\">and their team of sewers last year in London</a> we chatted about our mutual proclivities for hip packs and I volunteered John and myself to test their first foray into producing a technical wearable bag. We spent last year putting in lots of miles with prototype Hobgobs, carrying everything from our hefty full-frame cameras during photoshoots to every ride essentials on after-work rides. Let’s take a look at the Hobgob in its final form and our thoughts on how it turned out.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-12.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-12.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-12.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-12.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-12.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-12.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-12.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-12.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-1.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-1.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-1.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-1.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-1.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-1.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-1.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-4.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-4.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-4.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-4.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-4.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-4.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-4.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-4.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Hobgob Hip Pack Details</h3>\n<p>First off, the Hobgob features two zippered pockets – a large primary cavity and a smaller external compartment. This is, of course, in contrast to other packs that utilize roll-top closures and are special to the Wizard Works design. The main pocket is 4.8 liters, which is just large enough to accommodate my Sony Alpha full-frame mirrorless camera with the Tamron 28-75 lens. There are two elastic drop pockets on the interior with a key clip.</p>\n<p>The outer pocket is sized to fit larger phones and has an elastic daisy chain internal organizer for small items like tools and snacks. While the pack isn’t considered “waterproof,” the main pocket is sealed with a water-resistant YKK Aquaguard zipper, and the outer pocket with a nylon flap made from the same construction as the pack itself, which is a dual-layer treated nylon Cordura.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-9.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-9.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-9.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-9.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-9.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-9.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-9.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-9.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-10.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-10.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-10.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-10.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-10.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-10.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-10.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-10.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-20.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-20.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-20.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-20.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-20.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-20.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-20.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-20.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Personally, I don’t enjoy hip pack use being a decision between packing my camera/large items <em>OR</em> water. Wizard Works considered this and provided a molle attachment point on the bag’s right wing panel for an optional water bottle pocket. The <a href=\"https://www.wizard.works/shop/accessories/accessories-brands/wizard-works/quick-draw-bottle-pocket/\" target=\"_blank\">Bottle Pocket</a>, which will be available as an add-on soon, has a simple elastic chord lash for one-handed use. Pocket attachment, which is relatively quick to release but quite secure, comes by way of two BlackHawk clips that slide into the molle panels on the pack wing.</p>\n<p>The right pack wing also has a ladder lock buckle with an extended tab for quick loosening and tightening of the nylon belt. This is what I use to quickly spin the pack around to access its contents. The Fidlock side stays set and the ladder lock buckle is for quick adjustment.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-5.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-5.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-5.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-5.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-5.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-5.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-5.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-5.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>On the exterior of the pack, there are tensioning straps on each side to keep contents snug if not fully loaded. The underside features a tensionable elastic chord with a quick-release buckle for storing larger lightweight items like an extra layer or rain jacket. Rather than a central waist location, the pack’s buckle is located to the side on the left wing. This is opposite the molle panel to eliminate conflict with the optional bottle pocket and for added comfort while in a riding position. The magnetic Fidlock Hook buckle itself is quick to release and attach. The bag comes standard with a 1.5″ wide and 55″ long webbing strap. Custom Hobgobs will be available with 45″, 55″ or 65″ straps (in addition to custom fabric colors!). Mine came with a super long strap and I cut it down to my desired length. I haven’t had time to mend the cut end with a speedy stitcher yet, but I did melt it back with a small flame. The back panel is made of a thick 9mm Spacer Mesh with an airflow channel and layer of 10mm EVA foam.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-18.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-18.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-18.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-18.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-18.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-18.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-18.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-18.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Hobgob in Use</h3>\n<p>As I mentioned above, I’ve used a lot of hip packs over the years and I would consider the Hobgob one of the best yet. Its organizational elements allow me to carry everything I need for short and long rides, hikes, or around-town use. The wide hip wings and thicc back padding add comfort while the Fidlock buckle’s side positioning reduces interference with my pants belt and my belly when in pedaling position.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-14.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-14.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-14.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-14.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-14.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-14.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-14.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-14.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-19.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-19.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-19.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-19.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-19.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-19.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-19.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/Wizard-Works-Hobgob-19.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>I think it’s also important to mention this is not what I would consider a “professional” camera pack. While it carries the weight and bulk of my full-frame camera just fine, the opening is hardly large enough to fit it along with any tools or snacks in there as well. So, to say it would fit most models of full-frame cameras with a standard zoom lens would be disingenuous. However, it’s plenty spacious enough to toss in a point-and-shoot or crop sensor camera with other supplies. Though, eventually, I’d like to see Wizard Works apply the form and styling of the Hobgob to a hip pack that is specifically designed for larger cameras. Cmeras aside, the pack is large enough for whatever you’d need to carry on a day’s ride or quick access to tools and gear while on tour.
