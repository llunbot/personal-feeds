And now it’s super-cheap too: Surfshark has kicked off its Black Friday sale a month early and is offering <a href=\"https://get.surfshark.net/aff_c?offer_id=115&amp;aff_id=1351&amp;source=macworldcouk\" target=\"_blank\">a 28-month subscription for just $1.99/£1.49 a month</a> (that’s a total cost of $55.72/£41.58 for two years and two months).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The small catch is that you’ll be charged the full price plus tax up front and then the renewal price of $12.95 a month will kick in 28 months later. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The deal is for the basic Surfshark Starter plan with the VPN and an ad blocker. If you want more features, SurfShark One, which adds real-time breach alerts, personal data security reports, antivirus, and other malware protection, is currently $2.49/£1.89 a month ($69.72/£52.87 plus tax).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668084/surfshark-for-mac-review.html\">four-star review</a>, we praised Surfshark as “a remarkably privacy-focused, secure VPN that’s easily capable of getting around geo-blocked content.” And with this deal, it’s a fantastic bargain too.
