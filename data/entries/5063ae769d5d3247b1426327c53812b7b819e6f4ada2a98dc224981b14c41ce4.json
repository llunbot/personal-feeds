The trial—a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial—specifically enrolled people with existing cardiovascular disease who also were overweight or obese but did not have diabetes. In all, the trial included 17,604 people from 41 countries. Seventy-two percent of them were male, 84 percent were white, and the average age was about 62 years old.</p>\n<p>Last year, researchers <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2307563\">published the trial's primary results</a>, which showed that semaglutide reduced participants' risk of heart attack, stroke, and cardiovascular-related deaths <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2023/11/obesity-drug-wegovy-reduces-cardiovascular-risks-for-those-at-high-risk/\">by 20 percent</a> over the span of a little over three years.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024518#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024518&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5063ae769d5d3247b1426327c53812b7b819e6f4ada2a98dc224981b14c41ce4","category":"Tech"}
