But waiting could be a wise decision. We have an article that goes over the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/546040/macos-monterey-update-now-or-wait.html\">reasons why you should upgrade now and why you should wait</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS Monterey: All of the new features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The macOS Monterey operating system update comes with lots of new features, design changes, and improvements. We’ve compiled a list of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/348192/macos-12-monterey-features-release-compatibility-how-to-install.html\">all the major new features</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS Monterey: Universal Control delayed until spring</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s announced a groundbreaking new macOS Monterey feature called Universal Control, which lets can now use a single mouse and keyboard between your Mac and iPad. If you’re using a MacBook, its keyboard and trackpad can be used with the iPad. You can even drag and drop files between devices and perform gestures on the MacBook trackpad to navigate the iPad. However, this feature isn’t ready for macOS Monterey’s initial release and we don’t know when it will be. Apple <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/559260/universal-control-macos-monterey-ipados-15-delayed-spring-2022.html\">delayed Universal Control to Spring 2022</a> with the release of macOS 12.1 in December.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS Monterey: Get to know the latest features</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Shortcuts</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Shortcuts on iOS and iPadOS has become a popular tool to create automations. In macOS Monterey, Shortcuts for Mac will be available, bringing over the same powerful functionality. Any shortcuts that you make are available system-wide, so you can run them from just about anywhere on the Mac. It’s easy to share shortcuts, and any shortcuts you make sync across all your devices. If they are compatible, iPhone and iPad shortcuts can run on M1 Macs or on Intel-based Mac systems with Catalyst apps.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Safari tabs</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Tabs are a major user interface element in Safari but they become unwieldy and hard to manage. Apple hopes to address those problems in Safari 15 with a new tab implementation and features. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/349519/safari-15-macos-12-monterey-big-sur-tab-bar-groups-design-sidebar-how-to.html\">Here’s how tabs work in Safari 15 and how to make tab groups</a>. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/safari-15-new-tab-ui.gif?w=1200\" /><figcaption><p>Safari 15 has new options for how Tabs are displayed.</p></figcaption></figure><p>IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>SharePlay</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The new SharePlay support allows people to share an experience while watching video, listening to music, or even an app window while on a FaceTime call. The people on the call can control the media that’s playing, and the callers can even make a playlist. SharePlay works with Apple TV and Apple Music; support for other services will depend on those services adopting the SharePlay API and updating their services with support. SharePlay will arrive on Macs this fall with Monterey 12.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Quick Note</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Quick Note is a fast way to create a note file. When you trigger it, the Notes app quickly opens to a new file that you can start using immediately. It’s a fantastic feature but might not be so obvious <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/351264/macos-monterey-quick-note-hot-corners-how-to.html\">if you don’t know it’s there</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Focus</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Focus is basically an expansion of options that were originally available in the Do Not Disturb feature that’s already in macOS. To make Focus suitable for your situation, you can adjust its preferences, which we’ll go over in <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/353477/how-to-macos-monterey-set-up-customize-focus-modes-mac.html\">this article</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Live Text and Look Up</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can now select the text in a photo, copy it, and then paste it into a document. You can also lookup that text on the web or in Maps.<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/351669/macos-monterey-how-to-live-text-look-up-photos-quick-look-safari.html\"> Here’s how you’ll use it on your Mac</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/macos-monterey-live-text.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" /><figcaption><p>Live Text allows you to select text in an image and look it up on the web.</p></figcaption></figure><p>IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>AirPlay to Mac</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With AirPlay to a Mac, you can now take the media from your iPhone and iPad and use AirPlay to stream on your Mac. You can also stream from an app; for example, you can draw using your iPad, and use AirPlay to stream your activity onto a Mac so others can watch.  AirPlay to Mac works wirelessly or over a USB connection.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Low Power Mode</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Low Power Mode reduces energy consumption by automatically turning down the screen brightness and system clock speed to save battery life and make your Mac run more quietly. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/348837/macos-monterey-low-power-mode-system-preferences-how-to-enable.html\">Here’s how to turn it on</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Finder and windows changes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Finder in macOS Monterey has a few changes. When you’re copying a file, the progress window is now in the form of a pie chart, and you can now pause long file copies and resume them later. Go to Folder has a new design, and Apple improved the auto-completion engine to make it easier to find the file or folder you need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Monterey also has a few new ways to manage windows. You can swap out apps in Split View and change a Split View window to full screen. Windows automatically resize when moving a window to a secondary display, another Mac, or an iPad. And if you’re in full-screen mode, you can have an always-on menu bar.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Change the cursor color</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/353647/how-to-macos-monterey-change-cursor-color.html\">Change the color of the Mac cursor</a> to make it easier to find or to reflect your personality.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Enable Full Keyboard Access</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With Full Keyboard Access, you can rely less on the mouse or trackpad to navigate the user interface and instead use Tab and other keyboard keys to select items. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/351823/macos-monterey-full-keyboard-access-accessiblity-navigation-hardware-viewer-how-to.html\">Get the details on this powerful new feature</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Reset without reinstalling</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A new option in System Preferences will let you erase all user data and user-installed apps just like on an iOS device. That means you can essentially “reset” a Mac running Monterey without having to do a complete reinstall.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Memoji</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a lot more options to customize your Memoji. Monterey offers more outfits and colors, multicolored headwear, new glasses, accessibility features, and the ability to have two different eye colors. You can choose your Memoji for your Mac login, and it has animations that react to you, such as a log-in greeting or a head shake if you enter the wrong password.</p>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"ed630ee9e63ac68cd401ae04808c102de03f071c7dfeb09cd0b64d86bf1cf66a","category":"Apple"}
