It's the first excavation of the site in nearly three decades, and Herculaneum Archaeological Park Director Francesco Sirano expects to find even more victims' remains as the excavations continue.</p>\n<p>Eagle-eyed excavators spotted a couple of leg bones sticking out of the edge of an escarpment; a prior excavation had chopped the skeleton off at the feet. Experts estimate that the man was between 40-45 years old. The remains were found lying with the head pointing back in the direction of the sea and surrounded by carbonized wood, including a roof beam that could have crushed the man's skull. The victim’s bones were a reddish color, which Sirano identified as stains left by the man’s blood.</p>\n<p>“We can learn many things from his bones: his exact age, what jobs he may have done, whether he had any illnesses,” Domenico Camardo <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/01/world/europe/vesuvius-victim-herculaneum-ruins.html\" target=\"_blank\">told reporters</a>. Camardo is chief archaeologist of the <a href=\"https://www.herculaneum.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Herculaneum Conservation Project</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1817432#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1817432&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"883d49fc9fd653c1303327a8197fd3b447813eca725b53e329c1967dc37b3d90","category":"Tech"}
