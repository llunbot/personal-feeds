Until recently, it would not allow customers who leased its EVs to purchase them at the end of the lease. Instead, the leases stated that it \"plan[s] to use those vehicles in the Tesla ride-hailing network.\"</p>\n<p>Tesla instituted that policy for Model 3 leases <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradtempleton/2019/04/12/teslas-hypothetical-robotaxi-service-with-off-lease-cars-is-brilliant/\">starting in 2019</a> and later expanded it to the Model Y until changing the policy <a href=\"https://electrek.co/2024/11/27/tesla-now-offers-lease-buyouts-after-saying-it-would-keep-cars-as-robotaxis/\">last November</a>. But Tesla is not currently sitting on a fleet of several hundred thousand ex-lease autonomous Models 3 and Y, and as of today there exists no actual Tesla ride-hailing network.</p>\n<p>Instead, it has been spiffing up the ex-lease cars with software updates and then selling them to new customers, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/musk-took-leased-cars-back-so-tesla-could-use-them-robotaxis-instead-tesla-sold-2025-05-15/\">according to Reuters</a>. And that has made some former leasers a little unhappy that their old EVs weren't pressed into service making money for Tesla on an ongoing basis but rather just as a one-time transaction.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/tesla-changes-lease-policy-didnt-use-old-cars-as-robotaxis/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/tesla-changes-lease-policy-didnt-use-old-cars-as-robotaxis/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
