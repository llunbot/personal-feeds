Despite this setback, Apple maintained strong growth in emerging markets like Latin America.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile overall sales declined, Apple saw increased demand for its premium models. Counterpoint senior analyst Ivan Lam reported that consumers are increasingly choosing ultra-premium devices, with Pro and Pro Max models gaining significant traction in China. The share of these high-end models is expected to surpass 50% in the Chinese market for Q4 2024.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSamsung maintained its lead in the global smartphone market, buoyed by strong demand for its AI-equipped S24 series and A-series devices. Meanwhile, Chinese manufacturers Huawei, Honor, and Motorola emerged as the fastest-growing brands among the top 10 smartphone makers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/counterpoint-research-global-smartphone-sales-2024.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"985\" height=\"674\" />\r<br />\nApple has been rolling out Apple Intelligence features since October via software updates, but there are indications that this is not pushing people to upgrade their devices. A report <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/10/apple-intelligence-not-driving-iphone-upgrades/\">just last week</a> from Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested Apple Intelligence \"appeal has significantly declined\" compared to cloud-based services like ChatGPT.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMeanwhile, a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/16/survey-users-uninterested-in-apple-intelligence/\">December survey</a> suggested that many iPhone users feel Apple Intelligence has added little or no value to their iPhone experience, but that could always change as Apple Intelligence matures. There are still Apple Intelligence features that have not been implemented, including major changes to Siri that are rumored to be coming in April. <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/counterpoint/\">Counterpoint</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/13/iphone-market-share-drops-2024/\">Apple's Global Smartphone Share Slips as Chinese Rivals Surge</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-global-smartphone-share-slips-as-chinese-rivals-surge.2447301/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"14af9df1b68bc3f8b84af0aae02d77d0011e9a8c467ef3eac01595b29330f7fe","category":"Apple"}
