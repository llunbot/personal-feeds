We're only about a month away from the official release, so Apple should be firming things up shortly.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/top-stories-10aug2024.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nIn another news, we've known for a while that Apple is planning to update its entire Mac lineup with variants of the M4 chip, but we learned this week that the Mac mini is apparently set to get a redesign as part of its update, so read on below for details on this and all of our other top stories from this week!\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Hands-On With Safari's New Distraction Control in the iOS 18 Beta</h2>\r<br />\nApple has released the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/apple-seeds-ios-18-beta-5-to-developers/\">fifth developer beta</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/06/apple-seeds-ios-18-public-beta-3/\">third public beta of iOS 18</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/safari-distraction-control-hands-on/\">key new feature in the latest betas is Distraction Control</a>, which gives you the option to hide distracting elements on a website, such as newsletter sign-up fields and embedded video players. Apple said the feature is not designed to be an ad blocker, and it cannot permanently hide ads.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/iOS-18-Beta-ft.-Distraction-Control-2.5.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nWe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/safari-distraction-control-hands-on/\">went hands-on with Distraction Control in a recent video</a> shared on our YouTube channel, so check that out for a closer look at the feature.

As a result, Apple has been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/ios-18-beta-5-photos-app/\">making some tweaks</a> to the app's user interface while the software update remains in beta testing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/icloud-photos.jpg\" width=\"836\" height=\"470\" />\r<br />\nFor instance, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/ios-18-beta-5-photos-app/\">latest iOS 18 beta removes the carousel from the Photos app</a> for a more simplified experience.

He said there will be two models of the computer, including one with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/07/apple-debuts-m4-chip/\">M4 chip that debuted in the iPad Pro</a>, and one with an all-new M4 Pro chip.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Next Apple Watch SE Could Be Made From Plastic</h2>\r<br />\nIn his latest newsletter, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said it is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/apple-watch-se-plastic/\">increasingly likely that the next Apple Watch SE will have a plastic casing</a>, whereas the current model of the device has an aluminum casing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/09/apple-watch-se-gen-2.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nGurman said a plastic casing could allow for the Apple Watch SE to have a lower price, and a more kid-friendly design with colorful options. The next Apple Watch SE is expected to be announced in September.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>15+ New Features Coming to the iOS 18 Messages App</h2>\r<br />\niOS 18 includes <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-messages/\">many new features for the Messages app</a> on the iPhone, and we provided an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-messages/\">in-depth look at these changes</a> in a guide shared this week.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-Messages-Feature-1.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nYou can now use any emoji as a Tapback, send messages over a satellite connection in certain locations, add text effects to individual words in a message, schedule messages to be sent later, and much more. iOS 18 also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/\">adds RCS support to the Messages app</a> for an improved messaging experience between iPhones and Android devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>MacRumors Newsletter</h3>\r<br />\nEach week, we publish an email newsletter like this highlighting the top Apple stories, making it a great way to get a bite-sized recap of the week hitting all of the major topics we've covered and tying together related stories for a big-picture view.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSo if you want to have <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/macrumors/aug-8-2024\">top stories</a> like the above recap delivered to your email inbox each week, <b><a href=\"http://eepurl.com/OHdUX\">subscribe to our newsletter</a></b>!<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/top-stories/\">Top Stories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/10/top-stories-ios-18-beta-5/\">Top Stories: iOS 18 Beta 5 Features, Ultra-Tiny Mac Mini Rumor, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/top-stories-ios-18-beta-5-features-ultra-tiny-mac-mini-rumor-and-more.2433325/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"MacRumors Staff","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0a8d44e3da4a69c1f76722e6aeb321a3084c7d427337a723269270cb65f93785","category":"Apple"}
