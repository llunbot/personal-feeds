The new ENVE M Series ushers in a simplified naming structure, keeping the specificity for each wheel, but dropping complicated numbers. The new wheel line follows a four-year development project with the world’s top athletes. The line covers the mountain bike spectrum, ranging from cross-country to enduro, e-bike, and gravity.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M-series-2024-M5PRO_AREAR_SIDE-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"8342\" height=\"6258\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M-series-2024-M5PRO_AREAR_SIDE-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"ENVE M5 Pro wheels \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M-series-2024-M5PRO_AREAR_SIDE-jpeg.webp 8342w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M-series-2024-M5PRO_AREAR_SIDE-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M-series-2024-M5PRO_AREAR_SIDE-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M-series-2024-M5PRO_AREAR_SIDE-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(All Images: ENVE)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is it? ENVE M Series Wheels</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The revamped ENVE M Series results from years of research and work with ENVE athletes. The design team focused on finding elegant solutions to minimize flats and get the most out of each wheel. Whether you ride cross-country or downhill, there is something to drool over in the new ENVE lineup. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M-Series-M6-decal-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"9286\" height=\"5223\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M-Series-M6-decal-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Close up ENVE M5 Pro wheels logo \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M-Series-M6-decal-jpeg.webp 9286w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M-Series-M6-decal-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M-Series-M6-decal-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M-Series-M6-decal-120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M-Series-M6-decal-768x432.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The updated M Series rims feature unique front and rear rim shapes and new carbon layups. As for the hubs, the new M Series rolls on ENVE’s own INNERDRIVE mountain hubs. The new hub boasts customizable engagement (via engagement rings) and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M-Series-front-hub-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"9286\" height=\"5223\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M-Series-front-hub-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"ENVE M5 Pro wheels hub front \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M-Series-front-hub-jpeg.webp 9286w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M-Series-front-hub-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M-Series-front-hub-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M-Series-front-hub-120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M-Series-front-hub-768x432.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>ENVE M Series Wheel Lineup</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It appears that if you ride a flat-bar bike (or drop-bar MTB), there’s an ENVE M Series wheel option for you. The range escalates in the gnarly-ness of the terrain by going up in number: M5 denotes cross country and the lightest of the bunch, and M9 is for Enduro/Gravity Race/E-MTB.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a

The in-house design put in time with riders like the downhill World Cup team Commencal/Muc-Off by Riding Addiction, champions Amaury Pierron, and Myriam Nicole. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Did the athlete input pay off? </em>Well, with the rim’s new shapes, layups, and ENVE’s patented Protective Rim Strip, 19 World Cup downhill wins were tallied during the development project.

The front rims are designed to offer more flex for better traction and comfort, while the rear rims are stiffer for power transfer and impact resistance. ENVE says this updated front-to-rear differentiation “optimizes tire shape, traction, and compliance.” Each wheel has its specific front and rear rim shape, helping it perform its best in the intended discipline. Check out the details below. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M5-rim-shape.png\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"836\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M5-rim-shape-1536x836.png\" alt=\"ENVE Rim shape m5\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M5-rim-shape-1536x836.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M5-rim-shape-297x162.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M5-rim-shape-120x65.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M5-rim-shape-768x418.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M5-rim-shape.png 1756w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M6-rim-shape.png\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"846\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M6-rim-shape-1536x846.png\" alt=\"ENVE Rim shape m6 \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M6-rim-shape-1536x846.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M6-rim-shape-297x164.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M6-rim-shape-120x66.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M6-rim-shape-768x423.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M6-rim-shape.png 1754w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M8-rim-shape.png\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"807\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M8-rim-shape-1536x807.png\" alt=\"ENVE Rim shape m8\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M8-rim-shape-1536x807.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M8-rim-shape-297x156.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M8-rim-shape-120x63.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M8-rim-shape-768x403.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M8-rim-shape.png 1748w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M9-rim-shape-.png\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M9-rim-shape--1536x800.png\" alt=\"ENVE Rim shape m9\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M9-rim-shape--1536x800.png 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M9-rim-shape--297x155.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M9-rim-shape--120x63.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M9-rim-shape--768x400.png 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M9-rim-shape-.png 1720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“They wanted the damped ride feel of alloy rims without sacrificing the durability of carbon.

The hubs feature an oversized ratchet mechanism and customizable engagement.

Build-wise, the M5 and M6 models feature straight-pull center lock hub shells, while the M8 and M9 models use a j-bend hub shell, available in both center lock and 6-bolt.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M-series-2024-M9_DECAL-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"9286\" height=\"6966\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M-series-2024-M9_DECAL-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"ENVE Rim close up \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M-series-2024-M9_DECAL-jpeg.webp 9286w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M-series-2024-M9_DECAL-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M-series-2024-M9_DECAL-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ENVE-M-series-2024-M9_DECAL-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Still Handmade in Utah </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>ENVE produces the updated M Series with an improved manufacturing process, resulting in cost reductions that are passed on to the customer.
