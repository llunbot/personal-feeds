For those asking for a one-hand device, this 146.5 mm×68.1mm×9.4 mm phone is one of the smallest on the market, and it has flagship specs. It's not quite the size of the iPhone SE (138.4 mm×67.3 mm×7.3 mm) or the microscopic iPhone 13 Mini (131.5 mm×64.2mm×7.7 mm) but on Android, this is as small as you're going to get.</p>\n<p>With those<a href=\"https://www.asus.com/mobile-handhelds/phones/zenfone/zenfone-10/techspec/\"> flagship specs</a>, you get a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 gen 2 SoC, a baseline of 8GB of RAM with an option for 16GB, and UFS 4.0 storage options of 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB. The big downside to a small phone is the battery, which here is only 4300 mAh. Asus somehow found room to pack in a 3.5-mm headphone jack, along with 15 W wireless charging (wired is 30 W), stereo speakers, NFC, IP68 dust and water resistance, Wi-Fi 7, and Bluetooth 5.3.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1951351#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1951351&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6de6e19e9a8841e6f32b9964cecf6fb7182fb40dae9952e4ce481feeba694273","category":"Tech"}
