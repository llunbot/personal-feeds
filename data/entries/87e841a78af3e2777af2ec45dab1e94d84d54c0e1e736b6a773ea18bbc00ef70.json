Image: Jordan Villella </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Why a new brand? </em></strong>If you’re encouraging your children to ride, you should have a dependable machine yourself. Don’t think you’re pulling out the rusty 10-speed (the one you haven’t tuned since high school) either. Chances are it needs more work than it’s worth, and if you’re stopping every minute to fix something, you’re not going to have a productive outing with family or friends (we’ve all been there). </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-full-bike--scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-full-bike--1536x1152.jpeg\" alt=\"EagleBear black full bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-full-bike--1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-full-bike--297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-full-bike--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-full-bike--768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-full-bike--2048x1536.jpeg 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>Image: Jordan Villella </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The EagleBear bike line aims to equip riders with everything they need for a great day exploring the trails or gaining fitness. The complete bike retails $1,300 and has some extra add-ons parents will dig into. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Whats EagleBear? </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-team--scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-team--1536x1152.jpeg\" alt=\"EagleBear black team\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-team--1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-team--297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-team--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-team--768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-team--2048x1536.jpeg 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>Image: Jordan Villella </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides an awesome band name, EagleBear is the brainchild of the crew at Prevelo Bikes. There is a gap in the market for parents rejoining the bike world. Especially for affordable/dependable machines, and double for ones that can take many kid-centric accessories.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>EagleBear looks to fill that gap with affordable, long lasting bikes that can be a gateway to cycling. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Designed for Fun and Utility</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-bars--scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-bars--1536x1152.jpeg\" alt=\"EagleBear black bars\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-bars--1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-bars--297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-bars--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-bars--768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-bars--2048x1536.jpeg 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>A comfy cockpit with a short stem and a full Shimano Deore groupset. Image: Jordan Villella </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The EagleBear Black is designed to be easy and fun to ride. The specs are thoughtful, much like those of the Prevelo bike line. EagleBear’s ethos is to give the customer the most bang for their buck without unwanted extras that will never be noticed. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-fork-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-fork-1536x1152.jpeg\" alt=\"EagleBear black fork\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-fork-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-fork-297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-fork-120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-fork-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-fork-2048x1536.jpeg 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>Image: Jordan Villella </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The frame is a full alloy with a kickstand mount (excellent) and a full carbon fork. The EagelBear Black rolls on 700c wheels and can fit a 700c x 45mm tire if needed. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-headset--scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-headset--1536x1152.jpeg\" alt=\"EagleBear black headset\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-headset--1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-headset--297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-headset--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-headset--768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-headset--2048x1536.jpeg 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>Internal cable routing, dropper compatible and built to be ridden.

Don’t look for snappy responsiveness like a road race bike; look for predictability and comfort. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sizes:</strong> Small, Medium, Large and Extra Large</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>So Much Room for Activities </h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-full-bike-with-rack-and-kid-holder-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1050\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-full-bike-with-rack-and-kid-holder-1536x1050.jpeg\" alt=\"EagleBear black full bike with rack and kid holder\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-full-bike-with-rack-and-kid-holder-1536x1050.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-full-bike-with-rack-and-kid-holder-297x203.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-full-bike-with-rack-and-kid-holder-120x82.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-full-bike-with-rack-and-kid-holder-768x525.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-full-bike-with-rack-and-kid-holder-2048x1400.jpeg 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>Image: Jordan Villella </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I think of the Black as a transformer-style bike. It can do a lot of things, and with the right assortment of accessories, it’s unstoppable. For family riding and adventuring, the Black is easy to outfit with a front rack that can carry luggage, gear, or a smaller bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-kids-stuff--scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"984\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-kids-stuff--1536x984.jpeg\" alt=\"EagleBear black kids stuff\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-kids-stuff--1536x984.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-kids-stuff--297x190.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-kids-stuff--120x77.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-kids-stuff--768x492.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/EagleBear-black-kids-stuff--2048x1312.jpeg 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>Image: Jordan Villella </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Add a Mac Ride child seat, and a small rider can hop aboard if they tire of pedaling independently.
