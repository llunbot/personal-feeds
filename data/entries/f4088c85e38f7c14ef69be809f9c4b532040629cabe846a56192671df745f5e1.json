After a career spanning three decades and numerous sprinting generations, he remains self-aware in his pre-Tour soliloquies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Only you are in charge of your own destiny,’ he told the crowd in Mâcon before Stage 6 of the 2024 Tour, just one day after breaking Eddy Merckx’s Tour de France stage wins record.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The dramaturgy of Cavendish’s career could only be dictated by the man himself. Rainbows, gold medals, sorrow and <em>savoir-faire </em>direct the Cavendish narrative, from his debut in 2007 to his 35th stage win in Saint Vulbas this year. Bluntly, simplicity and concision cannot be associated with Cavendish’s 17-year-long tussle with the Tour de France.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n

Cavendish’s Tour de France career began in 2007 with a time-trial around central London. His debut Tour came at a time when the youngster was hoping for Olympic medals on the track rather than road glory. For the T-Mobile rider, a top ten in a hectic sprint on Stage 3 into Compiègne helped elevate his freshly found name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, with the Beijing Olympics to follow in 2008, his second Tour came with more success. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the roads of Châteauroux in the west of France, Cavendish launched early in the blue of his Columbia team. Looking around, he was shocked to see no one else close to him by the 50m marker. With a boyish flair Cavendish posted up with his hands against his head, in a state of pure jubilation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rivals that have earned their places in the history books, such as Robbie McEwen and Thor Hushovd, were left stunned as the 23-year-old Brit claimed the stage win.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"606\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/02223205/cavendish_comeback_8-970x606.jpg\" alt=\"cavendish_comeback_8\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/02223205/cavendish_comeback_8-970x606.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/02223205/cavendish_comeback_8-300x187.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/02223205/cavendish_comeback_8-768x480.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/02223205/cavendish_comeback_8-1536x959.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/02223205/cavendish_comeback_8-750x468.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/02223205/cavendish_comeback_8-1140x712.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/02223205/cavendish_comeback_8.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As the race drew on, momentum started to build, much like it would for the rest of his career. Three more stage wins fell his way before Cavendish abandoned on Stage 15 to focus on the Olympics. He had firmly established himself as one of the top sprinters in the pack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cavendish’s third Tour in 2009 only reinforced his status. From start to finish, he was <em>the</em> sprinter to beat, claiming six stage wins. This tally in a single Tour has not been matched since.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"635\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/02223150/cavendish_comeback_3-970x635.jpg\" alt=\"cavendish_comeback_3\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/02223150/cavendish_comeback_3-970x635.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/02223150/cavendish_comeback_3-300x197.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/02223150/cavendish_comeback_3-768x503.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/02223150/cavendish_comeback_3-1536x1006.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/02223150/cavendish_comeback_3-750x491.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/02223150/cavendish_comeback_3-1140x747.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/02223150/cavendish_comeback_3.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now pioneers of the new ‘sprint train phenomenon’, Cavendish’s HTC-Highroad squad rewrote the rules on how to prepare for a sprint. Again and again, Bert Grabsch, Mark Renshaw and Bernie Eisel proved a winning formula for the Manx Missile. Together, this team was unstoppable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At 25 years old, Cavendish had laid the groundwork for his record-breaking tally. He already had 14 stage wins to his name. In today’s terms, that’s three more than <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tadej-pogacar\" target=\"_blank\">Tadej Pogačar </a>at the same age.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Every shade of the rainbow</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-119763419-970x646.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-119763419-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-119763419-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-119763419-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-119763419-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-119763419-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-119763419-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-119763419-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-119763419-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-119763419-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-119763419-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Bryn Lennon/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>No one could come close to Cavendish in the early 2010s. Victories poured in from all four corners of France, from Bordeaux to Montpellier, Brignoles and, of course, Paris. During his prime, he made the Champs-Elysées his own. Four times he won the Parisian finale, in his team jersey as well as green and rainbow. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2011, the points classification was reformed with the intent of favouring sprinters. The race organisers’ wishes were Cavendish’s command. The Brit claimed another impressive haul from the 2011 Tour, including a win in Châteauroux once again, paving the way to his first Tour de France <em><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/history-of-the-tour-de-france-jerseys\" target=\"_blank\">maillot vert</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a golden year, also Cavendish bagged a World Championships victory, pushing British Cycling’s story of success even further into the stratosphere.

Three wins came his way in 2012, including one of his most emphatic victories in Brive-la-Gaillarde on Stage 18 and a yellow jersey leadout on the Champs-Elysées to secure a fourth consecutive win on the boulevard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2013, Cavendish had increased competition in the sprint finales as the rise of German sprinters Marcel Kittel and André Greipel threatened his supremacy.

A crash in his mother’s hometown of Harrogate in 2014 proved disappointing, but a comeback in Fougères 12 months later saw him return to the top step of a Tour de France stage podium.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However the presence of fellow fast man Kittel on the books at QuickStep weighed heavily, and the German phenom would effectively force Cavendish out of the team, as the Manxman decided to switch to the newly promoted Dimension Data team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leading the African team at the 2016 Tour de France, Cavendish showed that the new pretenders of the sprinting discipline were no stronger than him in a fair fight, with victory coming as early as day one on the D-Day beaches of Normandy, earning him the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/in-celebration-of-the-yellow-jersey\" target=\"_blank\">yellow jersey</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-458370877-970x645.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-458370877-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-458370877-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-458370877-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-458370877-1536x1021.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-458370877-2048x1362.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-458370877-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-458370877-1140x758.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-458370877-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-458370877-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-458370877-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Tim de Waele/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking more like the Mark Cavendish of 2010, the Brit claimed three further victories, cementing his name as the best sprinter at that year’s Tour de France, even if Peter Sagan took home the green jersey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of Sagan, Cavendish’s rivalry with the Slovak would turn sour the following year as a crash into Vittel on Stage 4 sent the Tour into frenzy. In a hectic sprint finale, Cavendish and Sagan locked elbows on the barriers, forcing the Manxman to hit the deck. As commissaires rushed to the rulebook, Sagan was sent home from the Tour as Cavendish emerged from hospital with a sling around his arm. As he had in 2014, he abandoned the race with no wins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thus, his tally would remain unchanged at 30 stage wins for quite some time. 2018 saw an underwhelming comeback sparse of any top five results, and his top speed looked to be wavering against younger sprinting opposition. His days at the top were looking long gone.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Black Dog</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/240628_Cyclist_TDF_0077-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/240628_Cyclist_TDF_0077-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/240628_Cyclist_TDF_0077-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/240628_Cyclist_TDF_0077-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/240628_Cyclist_TDF_0077-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/240628_Cyclist_TDF_0077-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/240628_Cyclist_TDF_0077-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/240628_Cyclist_TDF_0077-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/240628_Cyclist_TDF_0077-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/240628_Cyclist_TDF_0077-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/240628_Cyclist_TDF_0077-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>His previous sprinting edge having deserted him, in the summer of 2018, Cavendish was diagnosed with clinical depression. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It’s a nightmare to live with,’ he said. ‘You’re just empty. The sense of worthlessness. I’d lost any get-up that I ever had. I was too consumed in self-pity to care about what anyone thought of me.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Professional cyclists, particularly men, rarely discuss mental health struggles in the media, even despite the sport’s prickly past with mental illness.

The Manxman had only once placed in the top five of a sprint all season, and his Dimension Data were split over whether to include him in their Tour lineup. Ralf Aldag, the team’s head of performance, supported Cavendish and championed his Tour inclusion. However, the team’s owner Doug Ryder disagreed. After the in-fighting, it was decided that he was not in a position to strengthen the team’s chances at the Tour, meaning that he would miss the Tour for the first time since his debut in 2007.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cavendish took to Twitter to declare that he was ‘heartbroken’ and that his form was ‘in the perfect place’, even if his battle with chronic fatigue as a result of Epstein Barr virus had hampered his progress.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"771\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1183215241-771x970.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1183215241-771x970.jpg 771w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1183215241-238x300.jpg 238w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1183215241-768x966.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1183215241-1221x1536.jpg 1221w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1183215241-1627x2048.jpg 1627w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1183215241-750x944.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1183215241-1140x1435.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1183215241-scaled.jpg 2034w\" /><figcaption>Alex Davidson/Getty Images</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Left in the doldrums by Dimension Data, Cavendish’s future seemed uncertain.

In this moment, it became clear that the boy-racer had never left.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two more stage wins followed the following week, drawing Cavendish level with the legendary Eddy Merckx’s tally of 34 Tour stage wins.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1327833955-970x646.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1327833955-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1327833955-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1327833955-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1327833955-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1327833955-2048x1363.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1327833955-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1327833955-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1327833955-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1327833955-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1327833955-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Tim de Waele/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But while fate seemed to dictate that Cavendish was destined to claim the record outright with a fifth success on the Champs-Elysées, it was not to be as he would only manage third behind Belgian pair Wout van Aert and Jasper Philipsen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The euphoria of Cav’s Tour heroics would be short-lived, however. His relationship with team boss Lefevere grew rocky and it was clear his days at QuickStep were running out. Despite taking a stage win at the Giro d’Italia in 2022, he had lost the support of the Belgian squad in favour of younger stars and was left out of the team’s Tour lineup before his contract ran out at the end of the season.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A Kazakh prophecy</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/mark-cavendish-tirreno-adriatico-2-970x647.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/mark-cavendish-tirreno-adriatico-2-970x646.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/mark-cavendish-tirreno-adriatico-2-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/mark-cavendish-tirreno-adriatico-2-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/mark-cavendish-tirreno-adriatico-2-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/mark-cavendish-tirreno-adriatico-2-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/mark-cavendish-tirreno-adriatico-2-750x500.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/mark-cavendish-tirreno-adriatico-2-1140x760.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/mark-cavendish-tirreno-adriatico-2-465x310.jpeg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/mark-cavendish-tirreno-adriatico-2-620x413.jpeg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/mark-cavendish-tirreno-adriatico-2-350x233.jpeg 350w\" /><figcaption>Tirreno-Adriatico</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point, Cavendish’s future looked just as uncertain as it was back in 2020. In January 2023, however, rumours started stirring surrounding a potential lifeline from Alexander Vinokourov’s Astana squad. Historically a GC team, the marriage between the two was met with surprise and apprehension.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a team bare of sprinting support, he started his tenure at Astana with little success. But that all changed at the Giro d’Italia, where Cavendish won the final stage in Rome for his 17th Giro stage win. ‘I had some help from old friends,’ Cavendish said afterwards, a reference to Ineos Grenadiers’ Geraint Thomas joining his leadout in the run for the line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cavendish had confirmed in a teary press conference during the Giro that he would retire at the end of the 2023 season. The question was: could he follow up a stage win at his final Giro with similar success at his final Tour de France? </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1514163867-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1514163867-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1514163867-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1514163867-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1514163867-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1514163867-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1514163867-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1514163867-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1514163867-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1514163867-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/GettyImages-1514163867-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Thomas Samson, AFP via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>He looked like the record was his on Stage 7 as he stretched ahead with the line in sight, only for mechanical issues to allow Jasper Philipsen to overhaul him on the line. The next day, on an uninspiring stretch of road in northwestern France, the TV directors cut to the back of the peloton to show a helpless Mark Cavendish lying on the blazing asphalt. A few minutes later, Cavendish was sat in the back of the medical car, his race over. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The assumption of Mark Cavendish</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-94-970x647.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-94-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-94-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-94-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-94-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-94-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-94-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-94-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-94-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-94-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-94.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Charly Lopez</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It was no way to end such a stellar career, and sure enough, Cavendish would change his mind to give it one last go in 2024. The so-called ‘Project 35’ was born and Astana fine-tuned their setup in support of Cavendish’s bid for the record. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A team of mismatched riders soon became a cohesive leadout who collectively lived and died by Cavendish’s sword, with a hit squad of friends and colleagues from his winning past jumping aboard for one last song.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘You can’t finish a career like that,’ Vinokourov told us before the start of the race. As for Cavendish himself, he had seldom seemed so happy and content as he prepared for his last shot – and this time, it really was his final chance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Echoes of the late 2010s rang out on Stages 1 and 2 as he found himself off the back struggling to keep his stomach at ease. Through the early mountains, the time cut was a constant looming threat. Astana Qazaqstan’s own riders had to be pulled back to support the Brit’s quest just to remain in the fight.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-93-970x647.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-93-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-93-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-93-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-93-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-93-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-93-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-93-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-93-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-93-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-93.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Charly Lopez</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>However, on Stage 5 from Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne to Saint Vulbas, the Methusaleh re-emerged. Regardless of the previous downfalls, he will always be a man who knows how to win a sprint. Living long in the memory of every cycling fan, Cavendish’s 35th Tour de France win came in an exhalation that felt equally cathartic and historic. All the talk and pressure from before felt like hot air in the moment he lifted his arms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The formula Astana Qazaqstan had worked on had been executed in clinical style. The characters behind the scenes were forgiven for foolishly believing that a 39-year-old could win a Tour de France sprint against riders considered to be among the fastest men of all-time. There were no handouts given by his colleagues, let that be known. Instead, Cavendish called on his decades of sprinting expertise, gliding between wheels, squeezing his way through the pack and emerging a bikevlength ahead of his nearest rival.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Achieving the remarkable milestone of most Tour stage wins ever is as much a story of determination and strength of character as it is one of physical strength. Longevity in this sport is hard to come by nowadays, particularly in this era of hyper-specialisation and sporting optimisation. Mark Cavendish will always stand tall as a man who chose his own destiny, even if forces around him tried to tell a different story.
