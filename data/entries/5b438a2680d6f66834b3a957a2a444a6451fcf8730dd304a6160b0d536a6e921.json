{"title":"DJI Neo vs The Gauntlet: ActiveTrack Sports Follow-Me Testing","link":"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/09/dji-neo-gauntlet-activetrack-testing.html","date":1725664211000,"content":"<p><span>﻿</span></p>\n<p>It’s that time of year again, when I go out and see how many times I can crash a drone in a set period of time. And it’s quite likely I set a record this time, both cycling and running. Still, at times the results can be impressive (and other times, disappointed held back).</p>\n<p>The new $199 DJI Neo is aiming to edge out the new sports fan favorite Hover X1 drone. Both drones are tiny, weigh less than a GoPro action cam, and can mostly fit in your pocket. Neither require a separate controller, nor even need your phone to track you. Of course, neither has obstacle avoidance sensors. As such, it ends up being a bit of a crash derby, but – with just the right amount of tech, it’ll still manage to get the shot. Sometimes.</p>\n<p>In this video, I dive into how well it actually works in real life, on real runs and real rides. All in an attempt to see what might eventually work to replace the Hover X1 on my rides/runs. As before, there’s no better way to do that than testing it against what has become The Gauntlet for testing the autonomous tracking capabilities of drones.</p>\n<p>To see how well this drone holds up (and in this case, many times over), hit the play button up above. Even if you don’t care about drones, I suspect you’ll find it entertaining.</p>\n<p>Thanks for watching!</p>","author":"Ray Maker","siteTitle":"DC Rainmaker","siteHash":"32f541eec2062fbf675b0daf837db78b41cd6160cf993de3c4b5e9b44a978706","entryHash":"5b438a2680d6f66834b3a957a2a444a6451fcf8730dd304a6160b0d536a6e921","category":"Cycling"}
