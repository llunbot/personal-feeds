Gen AI Alexa is expected to come with a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/amazon-wants-to-charge-a-subscription-fee-for-alexa-eventually/\">subscription fee</a>, as Alexa has reportedly lost Amazon tens of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/alexa-had-no-profit-timeline-cost-amazon-25-billion-in-4-years/\">billions of dollars</a> throughout <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/11/amazon-alexa-is-a-colossal-failure-on-pace-to-lose-10-billion-this-year/\">the years</a>.

Early versions of gen AI Alexa based on Amazon’s AI models “struggled for words, sometimes taking six or seven seconds to acknowledge a prompt and reply,” Reuters said, citing one of its sources. Without specifying versions or features used, Reuters' sources said <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/anthropics-latest-best-ai-model-is-twice-as-fast-and-still-terrible-at-dad-jokes/\">Claude</a> outperformed proprietary software.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046432#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046432&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"432567cd78a7ae9155af9f16f552031741b1e7b798c55477f4bfdb39c7dc03d0","category":"Tech"}
