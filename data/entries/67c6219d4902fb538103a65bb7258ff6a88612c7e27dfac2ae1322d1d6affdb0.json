All critical seams are bonded, keeping weight and bulk down.</p>\n<p>The low-cut neck sits well and does away with the need for a zip garage. The simple three-pocket setup is in keeping with the minimalist design, but they do sit a little higher than some. Hot-weather performance is right up there and the stylish Pro SL Lite punches above its price tag.</p>\n<p>Those looking for a women’s-specific option might consider Endura’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/clothing/jerseys/endura-wms-pt-wave-s-s-jersey-limited-edition-review/\">WMS PT Wave S/S Jersey Limited Edition jersey</a>.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Giro Chrono Elite Short Sleeve Jersey</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Giro Chrono Elite Short Sleeve Jersey for road cyclists\" title=\"Giro Chrono Elite Short Sleeve Jersey - 01\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Giro’s premium jersey is elite in name and nature.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ashley Quinlan / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Colours: </strong>‘Phantom blue’, black, ‘charcoal’</li>\n<li><strong>Sizes: </strong>S-XL</li>\n<li><strong>Price</strong>: £120/$140/€140/AU$160 as tested</li>\n</ul><p>The Giro Chrono Elite Short Sleeve Jersey saves you weight but not money compared to the brand’s highly-rated Chrono Expert Short Sleeve Jersey.</p>\n<p>Giro’s premium jersey costs £40 more.

If so, a properly fitted cycling jersey is going to serve you best.</p>\n<p>If you’re more interested in taking it easy and staying casual, or you’re looking to stop off in shops and towns mid-ride, then there’s nothing wrong with wearing your normal clothes, or a mix of cycling-specific clothes and non-cycling-specific clothes.</p>\n<p>Just be mindful that if it rains or you get sweaty, everyday clothes aren’t designed to be as breathable or quick-drying as cycling-specific kit.</p>\n<h3>Fit, fabrics and aerodynamics</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Liam Cahill wearing Le Col x McLaren Project Aero Speedsuit in the Silverstone Sports Engineering Hub wind tunnel\" title=\"Best value aero upgrades\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A snug jersey will save you watts over baggy alternatives.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Joseph Branston / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Tight, close-fitting kit is more aerodynamically efficient than loose, baggy clothing. Indeed, our wind tunnel testing found an aero jersey is one of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/tech/best-value-aero-upgrades/\">best aero upgrades</a>.</p>\n<p>It’s also easy enough to test yourself – just go out in a baggy top, the increased air resistance is obvious.</p>\n<p>What’s less well known is that both the type of fabric and the placement of seams can also have an effect on the aerodynamic efficiency of cycling jerseys.</p>\n<p>These jerseys are often more complex and expensive to design and manufacture than standard jerseys though, so you’ll likely need to cough up some extra cash to get your hands on them.</p>\n<p>They arguably represent a good-value performance upgrade though, because aero jerseys can have a relatively large effect on how aerodynamic you are but cost much less than <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-aero-road-bike/\">aero road bikes</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/10-of-the-best-deep-aero-wheels-lab-tested/\">aero wheels</a>.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Oscar Huckle wearing Cascada Land Wool Shirt and Cargo shorts\" title=\"cascada\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> There’s no need to wear a tight-fitting jersey if you prefer a more casual look.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Dave Caudery / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>On the other hand, if you’re not fussed about optimising your aerodynamic efficiency, a light looser jersey might be more comfortable and offer a little more breathability in hot weather.</p>\n<p>Just be wary when sizing up that if a jersey is too big for you, the rear pockets might sag a bit when full of stuff.</p>\n<p>Other than the fact that it doesn’t look amazing, it’s not a huge problem. But it will likely make the pockets a bit harder to reach while riding.</p>\n<h3>How much money do I need to spend on a cycling jersey?</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Endura Pro SL Race Jersey for road cyclists\" title=\"Endura Pro SL Race Jersey - 06\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Some brands, such as Endura, make quality jerseys for less than £100.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ashley Quinlan / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>It depends on your goals. Lower-priced jerseys tend to be perfectly functional but are most often targeted at non-racers, so if you’re looking for a very tight fit you may need to size down.</p>\n<p>Higher-priced jerseys have usually been subject to more in-depth research and development, possibly using wind tunnel or real-world testing to refine the fit and aerodynamics. You may also get more advanced fabrics with features such as protection from UV rays.</p>\n<p>Styling also tends to improve as the price increases because premium brands invest more in design. This is subjective, so we’ll leave it up to you to make the call.</p>","author":"Ian Osborne","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"67c6219d4902fb538103a65bb7258ff6a88612c7e27dfac2ae1322d1d6affdb0","category":"Cycling"}
