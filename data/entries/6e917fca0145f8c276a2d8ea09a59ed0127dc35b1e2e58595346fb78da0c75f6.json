In a prestreaming era when Saturday morning cartoons and after-school kids' programming still meant reliable ratings, a wave of pop culture born in Japan was brought over to the US in the hope of finding a new audience. Many, <em>many</em> of these things became timeless hits for a generation: <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Rangers\">Power Rangers</a></em>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Ball_Z\"><em>Dragon Ball Z</em></a>, <em><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/09/arent-you-a-little-too-old-for-that-14-years-of-playing-pokemon/\">Pokémon</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_Bebop\">Cowboy Bebop</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor_Moon\">Sailor Moon</a></em>, yet another <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraman\">Ultraman</a></em> syndication, etc.</p><aside><h2>Ars at Fantastic Fest</h2>\n\t<ul><li><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/09/ike-boys-review-a-mighty-morphin-homage-to-90s-tvs-japanese-imports/\"><em>Iké Boys</em> review: If you love kaiju so much, why not just be one?</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/05/the-vast-of-night-is-a-masterclass-in-small-budget-sci-fi/\"><em>The Vast of Night</em> is an alien encounter film like no other</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/04/self-isolate-1890s-style-with-the-lighthouse-now-on-amazon-prime/\">Mermaids, mayhem, and masturbation: <em>The Lighthouse</em> is now on Amazon Prime</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/justin-long-pieces-together-a-fractured-timeline-to-solve-a-mystery-in-the-wave/\"><em>The Wave</em> takes us on a trippy, surreal journey through a fractured timeline</a></li>\n      <li><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/11/night-has-come-is-remarkable-work-of-genuine-found-footage-horror/\"><em>Night Has Come</em> is remarkable work of genuine found-footage horror</a></li>\n    </ul><span><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/series/ars-at-fantastic-fest/\">View more stories</a></span>\n</aside><p></p>\n<p>Depending on where you grew up, getting really into any of that may have meant getting really left out of some social circles.

But filmmaker McEver has a clear, feel-good message with <em>Iké Boys</em>: <em>Be you</em>. After all, humanity may someday need someone with a very special set of skills to save us—and those skills may involve an encyclopedic knowledge of Japanese kaiju stories.</p>\n<h2>They listen to the Flaming Lips, too</h2>\n<p>If anyone knows about hard-to-find cult anime films worth seeking out, it's Shawn (<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2051265?ref_=tt_cl_t_1\">Quinn Lord</a>), a mild-mannered high schooler in late '90s Oklahoma. He and his pal Vik (<a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6687295/?ref_=tt_cl_t_2\">Ronak Gandhi</a>) have grown up as outcasts amidst their Zack Morris-lookin' schoolmates while consuming a steady stream of kaiju and mecha fiction. So when Shawn finally acquires a copy of once-believed-lost 1960s title <em>Go! Great Decisive Battle at the End of the Century with Rainbows</em>, they are watching it immediately <em>no matter what</em>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1798309#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1798309&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Nathan Mattise","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6e917fca0145f8c276a2d8ea09a59ed0127dc35b1e2e58595346fb78da0c75f6","category":"Tech"}
