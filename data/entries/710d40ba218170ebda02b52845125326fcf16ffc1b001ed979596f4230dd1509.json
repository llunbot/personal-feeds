The move is designed to raise the profile of ‌Apple TV+‌ in Hollywood, attract subscribers, and create \"cultural events.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is believed to have already approached several third-party distributors about collaborating to release ‌Apple TV+‌ titles in theaters this year, including Martin Scorsese's \"Killers of the Flower Moon,\" Matthew Vaughn's \"Argylle,\" and Ridley Scott's \"Napoleon.\" The movies are expected to be in theaters around the world for at least a month. Apple is purportedly looking to third-party studios owing to its lack of expertise in movie distribution across thousands of cinemas worldwide, but it has concerns around the hefty fees and marketing budgets that such partners would demand.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/\">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/23/apple-planning-to-release-movies-in-theaters/\">Apple Reportedly Planning to Release Movies in Theaters and Increase Spend to $1 Billion Per Year</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reportedly-planning-to-release-movies-in-theaters-and-increase-spend-to-1-billion-per-year.2384545/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"710d40ba218170ebda02b52845125326fcf16ffc1b001ed979596f4230dd1509","category":"Apple"}
