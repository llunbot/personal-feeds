It implies limited throughput associated with an HDMI 2.0 port instead of the most recent HDMI 2.1 standard, though there are other possible explanations for the limitation besides the port itself, and we don't yet know which best describes the situation.</p>\n<p>There aren't many monitors and TVs that do 4K at 120 frames per second, and those that do are expensive. But theyÂ <em>do</em> exist, and they're only going to get more common. In fact, it seems a safe bet that after a few years, 4K@120 Hz may become the industry standard.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1805810#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1805810&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0a86558859904c426fe6c2153f9f46ff8058781b85c546e566cdc42892ec7910","category":"Tech"}
