But that doesn’t mean the rest of the year is barren. Not by a long shot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, according to <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/apple-spring-2025-releases-2/\" target=\"_blank\">9to5Mac</a>, we have a lot to look forward to next spring. Everything from smartphones and MacBooks to new smart-home products are on the radar for spring 2025. Here are the key launches we can expect.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4th-gen iPhone SE</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest news could be the 4th-gen edition of Apple’s most affordable iPhone. Based on current information this will be the biggest upgrade to the SE model since it was first launched in 2016. The design is expected to be similar to the iPhone 14, with USB-C and no Home button, and it will also be Apple’s first iPhone with a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2478796/leak-claims-the-iphone-se-4-will-have-an-apple-made-5g-modem.html\">proprietary 5G modem</a>, which could dramatically increase battery efficiency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the latest info, check out our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1354114/iphone-se-4-design-specs-features-release-date.html\">iPhone SE 4</a> superguide.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.techadvisor.com/cmsdata/reviews/3815358/review-iphone-se-2022.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"iPhone SE 2022\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>11th-gen iPad</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The cheapest iPad is expected to get its first update in more than two years. The focus is likely to be on adding support for Apple Intelligence, and the tablet may also be equipped with an A18 chip. However, the design is expected to remain unchanged. Check out our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2158175/ipad-11th-gen-2024-release-date.html\">11th-gen iPad</a> guide for the latest news and rumors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>MacBook Air with M4</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is understood to be planning an update to the MacBook Air with the new M4 chip some time between January and March next year, which should deliver a moderate bump in performance from the current <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2259608/15-inch-macbook-air-m3-review.html\">M3 model</a>. Beyond that, no major changes are expected. Stay up to date on the latest developments with our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2303200/m4-macbook-air-design-price-specs-release.html\">M4 MacBook Air</a> guide.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPad Air with M3</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A minor upgrade of the iPad Air is expected. The new model will be equipped with the M3 chip (a worthwhile performance upgrade from the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2365408/11-inch-ipad-air-m2-review.html\">current M2</a>, pictured below) and a new Magic Keyboard design adapted to its specifications.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3141.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Baksidan av iPad Air M2\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3141.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 5712w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3141.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3141.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3141.jpeg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3141.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1152&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3141.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1536&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Petter Ahrnstedt</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Smart display for the home</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the perennial Apple rumors could finally come to fruition with the launch of the first <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676817/homepod-with-screen-rumours-and-release-date.html\">HomePod with a display</a> in 2025. The product, which will reportedly give you the option of using a wall mounting an iPad-like tablet or attaching it to a speaker base, will have a 6-inch screen and support for Apple Intelligence. It will be Apple’s first HomePod-like device with a screen and a major step in the company’s plans to target the smart-home market.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>But wait! There’s more</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is only the tip of the iceberg. Other products expected to be launched this spring include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>2nd-gen AirTag</strong>: A <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2523902/a-new-airtag-is-coming-next-year-with-enhanced-privacy-security-features.html\">new version of the AirTag</a> with updated ultra wideband technology.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iOS 18.4</strong>: Likely to arrive this spring, with the final Apple Intelligence features unveiled at WWDC 2024. In April, Apple Intelligence will be rolled out in the EU.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Products such as the new Mac Studio and Mac Pro are not expected until mid-2025. But there should be more than enough for us to enjoy a bumper spring.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"d72f89e792ab2e8e79b7e77992ef51998a1898497f1795f092bf344581c1247c","category":"Apple"}
