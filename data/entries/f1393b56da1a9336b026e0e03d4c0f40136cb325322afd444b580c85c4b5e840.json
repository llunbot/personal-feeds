Now, Pivot has switched up the front end, adding a 29er front wheel across the entire Mach 6 range. You can still order it with 27.5″ wheels front and rear, but everything listed is MX.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They say the mixed wheel size build combines the stability of their Firebird 29er with the playful character of 27.5″ wheels. We say it should offer better rollover and a faster feeling bike for bigger riders, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/pivot-mach-6-mx-29er-275-wheels-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/pivot-mach-6-mx-29er-275-wheels-1.jpg\" alt=\"rear triangle of pivot mach 6 mountain bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/pivot-mach-6-mx-29er-275-wheels-1.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/pivot-mach-6-mx-29er-275-wheels-1-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/pivot-mach-6-mx-29er-275-wheels-1-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/pivot-mach-6-mx-29er-275-wheels-1-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/pivot-mach-6-mx-29er-275-wheels-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/pivot-mach-6-mx-29er-275-wheels-1-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/pivot-mach-6-mx-29er-275-wheels-1-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“People have asked if we would ever offer the Mach 6 in a mixed wheel setup for a while and it has been a favorite setup among Pivot employees,” Pivot’s marketing manager told us. “So, we decided to make it available to consumers as well. We swapped in a 160mm Fox 36 and a 29er front wheel for all those that like to get rowdy!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to the full 27.5″ model, the MX build has a 1.7º slacker head angle, but the bottom bracket height increases by 11mm. The wheelbase grows by about 10mm, and stack is about 14mm taller.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/pivot-mach-6-team-transmission-mx.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"851\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/pivot-mach-6-team-transmission-mx.jpg\" alt=\"pivot mach 6 MX Team with SRAM XX Transmission\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/pivot-mach-6-team-transmission-mx.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/pivot-mach-6-team-transmission-mx-297x168.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/pivot-mach-6-team-transmission-mx-800x454.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/pivot-mach-6-team-transmission-mx-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/pivot-mach-6-team-transmission-mx-768x436.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It has the same flip chip for High/Low suspension settings. Other than the front wheel, tire, and fork, it comes in all of the same spec and build options as the full 27.5″ bike. Suspension is 158mm in the rear, 160mm up front. Prices range from $6,299 up to $11,999 with air and coil rear shocks. Too much?

It gets an SLX/XT drivetrain mix with SRAM Code R brakes and Race Face Aeffect cranks. So, definitely not a watered down build, just more affordable. The Brunch Ride Air bumps that to $5,199 with a Fox Factory Fload X2 rear shock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://global.pivotcycles.com/products/mach-6\" target=\"_blank\">PivotCycles.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/pivot-mach-6-switches-to-mixed-wheel-builds-all-around/\">Pivot Mach 6 Switches to Mixed-Wheel Builds All Around</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"f1393b56da1a9336b026e0e03d4c0f40136cb325322afd444b580c85c4b5e840","category":"Cycling"}
