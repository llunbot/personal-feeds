Microsoft's <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/b/buy-surface-laptop\">retail pages for both devices</a> list only 512GB and 1TB configurations, with regular prices starting at $1,199. Though not technically a price hike—the 512GB versions of both devices also cost $1,199 before—it does amount to an effective price increase for last year's Surface hardware, especially given that both devices have user-replaceable storage that can easily be upgraded for less than the $200 that Microsoft charged for the 256GB-to-512GB upgrade.</p>\n<p>The upshot is that the new Surface PCs make more sense now than they did on Tuesday in relative terms, but it's only because you'll pay more to buy a Surface Pro 11 or Surface Laptop 7 than you would before. The 15-inch version of the Surface Laptop 7 still lists a 256GB configuration and a $1,299 starting price, but the 256GB models are currently out of stock.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/echoing-xbox-prices-are-going-up-for-high-end-surfaces-and-some-accessories/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/echoing-xbox-prices-are-going-up-for-high-end-surfaces-and-some-accessories/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5cc1f3c814fbda6b26ea3e77f8a74500e27970cb5886a2b1a53429fc1ab258dd","category":"Tech"}
