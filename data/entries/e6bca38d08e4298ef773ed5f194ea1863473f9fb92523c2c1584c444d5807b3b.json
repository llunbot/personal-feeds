I type this with the sun in my eyes, suncream on the forehead and clothes on the line, but a base layer resolutely still on under my clothes. The <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-classics-monuments-cobbles\">spring Classics</a> are finally upon us. Rubber has started to hit cobblestone and shudder through posteriors across northern Europe, as it has done in these transitional months for as long as I can remember. It was just over a week ago that Ewan Wilson and I were doing our own poor impression of Classics riders, thundering over Roubaix cobbles at around half the speed Mathieu and the gang will expect to tear it up. That experience shapes a few of the below selections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But before that, there are some essentials to update you on. Will and James got mic’d up to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/aron-dsouza-enhanced-games\">record the latest instalment of the Cyclist Magazine Podcast</a>, speaking to Dr Aron D’Souza, the brains behind the Enhanced Games. Like or loathe the idea, it’s impossible not to have an opinion. I’d say it’s one of the most captivating podcasts we’ve put out of late and manages to transcend two wheels and asks us what we value as human beings, what is worth valuing, and how we even compute value. Get stuck in!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a few days time, things start to really kick off, including the stage race Paris-Nice. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/paris-nice-preview\">Everything you need to know is here </a>thanks to Robyn Davidson, who has also put together an exhaustive guide to the dusty white lanes of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/strade-bianche-all-you-need-to-know\">Strade Bianche</a>. Meanwhile, Ewan virtually hopped over into Italy and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tirreno-adriatico-preview\">gave us the lowdown on Tirreno-Adriatico</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t forget about our<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cyclist-track-days-information\"> Cyclist Track Days</a>. A lot goes into getting everything prepared for these events, and we have some fantastic brands lined up this year. We’ve previewed some of the different models on offer, including the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cyclist-track-days-2025-bikes-specialized-tarmac-sl8\">Specialized Tarmac SL8</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cyclist-track-days-2025-bikes-trek-madone-slr\">Trek Madone SLR</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cyclist-track-days-2025-bikes-scott-addict-rc\">Scott Addict RC</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cyclist-track-days-2025-bikes-6-condor-leggero\">Condor Leggero</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cyclist-track-days-2025-bikes-orbea-orca\">Orbea Orca</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, there’s plenty more on the Cyclist website, but for now, let’s get into the drops.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>HT PK02 pedals</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/pedal-2-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/pedal-2-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/pedal-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/pedal-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/pedal-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/pedal-2-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/pedal-2-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/pedal-2-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/pedal-2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/pedal-2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/pedal-2-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>More well known in mountain biking tech, HT has launched an updated road pedal called the PK02, which promises light weight, an extremely competitive price (£99.99) and hard-wearing durability. To that end, the reinforced carbon fibre pedals use sealed cartridge bearings – which should minimise the risk of water ingress – and DU bushings, which are known for surviving with relatively little maintenance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Handily for me, as well as arriving with proprietary cleats, they also accept Look Keo cleats. In terms of numbers, the overall claimed weight is 226g for the pair, which is a shade less than the Look Keo Blade Ceramics I normally use (231g), but with a far larger contact plate (760mm<sup>2</sup> vs. 705mm<sup>2</sup>). They share an identical 53mm Q-factor, which is essentially the gap between pedal and crank, so there is no adjustment when I switch between the two. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/pedal-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/pedal-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/pedal-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/pedal-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/pedal-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/pedal-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/pedal-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/pedal-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/pedal-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/pedal-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/pedal-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ll be honest, I haven’t always been particularly impressed by the longevity of some pedals from leading brands, so I am always keen to try alternatives and give them an absolute pasting. It doesn’t get more pasty (especially if you’re <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/blockhaus-cycling\">Ewan Wilson</a>) than the Paris-Roubaix course, and that’s exactly where I took them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a couple of hours grinding along tracks that were not fit even for the tyres of support cars, the PK02s were absolutely filthy with organic waste. Aided by a few brushdowns, they stood up admirably without too many clip in slips, and they have earned the right to accompany me on a few more clement rides back here in the UK.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://biketart.avln.me/c/ZGgOGzctHLyk\" target=\"_blank\">Biketart (£99.99)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+4\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-4-970x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-4-970x300.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-4-300x93.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-4-768x238.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-4-1536x476.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-4-2048x634.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-4-750x232.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/Subs-flash-161-for-web-4-1140x353.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Velocio One Jacket</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03089-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03089-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03089-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03089-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03089-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03089-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03089-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03089-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03089-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03089-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03089-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A few cycling brands are going down the route of creating kit that acknowledges people’s lack of interest in riding in bad weather these days. In 2010 you couldn’t look out the window, asses the thickening cloud, and decide to hop on the turbo instead. In 2025, I can’t do that anyway because I live in London and there’s barely space for <em>me </em>in my flat, let alone a stationary Zwift setup – but I understand the premise as, unless I’m specifically testing wet-weather kit, I’d rather not ride in the rain.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03087-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03087-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03087-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03087-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03087-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03087-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03087-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03087-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03087-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03087-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03087-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To that end, I’m a big fan of the Velocio One, which has decent enough rain repellant qualities, but focusses more on being a jacket that does everything pretty well, all the while looking damn smart.

Maybe it’s that bewitchingly toxic aroma that invades your nostrils when you open the box. Or perhaps it’s just the transient perfection writ large on the blemishless surface of an unused tread. Whatever it is, their mere aura – not to mention their function – gives me a lot of pleasure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This month, an embargo-busting set of hookless-compatible Hutchinson Blackbird Race Tyres makes it into my In The Drops. It’s already proven itself at the highest level, with gold medallist Alex Yee – that triathlete who just ran and ran and never seemed like slowing down – riding a prototype in the Paris Olympics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hutchinson has called it ‘an uncompromising race tyre’. If there’s one thing I cannot stand about tyres, it’s their innate diplomacy.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03085-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03085-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03085-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03085-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03085-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03085-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03085-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03085-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03085-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03085-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03085-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The weight of the rubberised casing is down by 22% and the central cross-section of the tyre is also 23% more slender, resulting in a 240g 28mm tyre. The three parts – bead, puncture strip and 127TPI casing – are then bonded together to create a tubeless seal. Hutchinson says the three sidewall layers and the double central layer improve ride feel and reduce rolling resistance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These new Blackbrid Race tyres benefit from the Mach Tread Ultimate, what Hutchinson says is its faster ever tread compound. Overall, the Blackbird Race tyres are claimed to be 10% more efficient than their predecessors. Interestingly, Hutchinson says the 30mm are quicker than the 28mms but those claims lack the context of a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/road-gravel-bike-rim-width\">rim width</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A more sturdy All Season version has been released concurrently, which features similar technology. And at £69.99, they’re pretty decent value too. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Lake CX239 road shoes</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/DSC03057-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/DSC03057-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/DSC03057-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/DSC03057-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/DSC03057-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/DSC03057-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/DSC03057-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/DSC03057-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/DSC03057-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/DSC03057-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/DSC03057-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Continuing the crate-digging theme, you might not be able to find them on the internet right now, but Lake’s off-premium CX239 road shoes are a welcome addition to its lineup. The CX333s are in my heavy rotation during the off-peak months, and the CX239s are channelling a lot of the same energy but at a lower price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, £295 is still decent coin for a pair of cycling shoes, but with Lake you do really know you’re in for the long haul. My friend is still wearing a pair of CX238s that were, allegedly, once white. More recently they look like they’ve been involved in a species-ending event and come out functioning on the other side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can read all about the changes Lake has made <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/lake-cx239-road-cycling-shoes-review?_thumbnail_id=192796\">here</a>, but in short they are benefiting massively from having an excellent elder sibling. If weight is a deal breaker then maybe you’ll be drawn to something more slight, but personally I’m willing to accept a gram penalty if I can give my feet the best chance of staying fresh and lively.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Giro Regime</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03077-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03077-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03077-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03077-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03077-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03077-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03077-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03077-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03077-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03077-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/DSC03077-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And a quick mention for the ever-reliable Giro Regime road shoes.

That also means if one of your group isn’t up for the whole ride (there are also e-bikes available) they can jump in the car to get to the end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Toro Blanco’s first tour option is an eight-day, seven-night VIP holiday that includes five days cycling and two or three additional trips to make sure you get to experience the best that the region has to offer. It includes five guides, four support vehicles, a bike mechanic and a masseuse, and there’s even an optional extra visit to an olive oil factory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second option is five days, four nights with three days cycling and two extra trips. It has all the perks of the bigger tour but there’s a bit less cycling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what are you waiting for?</p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div><a href=\"https://guidedcyclingholidays.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Book your trip</strong></a></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Ad feature ends</strong></em></p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>What we’re into this week: Pub bikes</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"548\" height=\"384\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/image.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/image.png 548w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/image-300x210.png 300w\" /><figcaption><em>Happier times with my Reynolds Falcon (this one got stolen too)</em></figcaption><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Or I was into them until this morning when I went downstairs and realised some absolute <s>bast…</s> scamp had hopped into our back garden and made off with one of ours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me give you a potted history of this very simple, single-speed Pinnacle (not pictured). I bought it for my girlfriend about five years ago from Ebay and it was basically brand new. It was a size 54, so far too small for me, but I bought a new massive seatpost and was able to make it fit me if needed, for very quick journeys around the local area. Everyone’s a winner. I also had my own pub bike, which I used most often.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pinnacle blew a puncture on the hottest day of the year in 2024, merely from being sat in the sun. We heard it blow. This was when I realised that the bolts had also been shorn off by a shoddy mechanic at some point. Since then, it’s not been needed (blame the baby), so it’s been left (unlocked) behind our garden shed for over six months. Yesterday I finally got my act together to go and get the shorn-off bolt removed at a bike shop, cleaned it up, lubed the chain, and it was purring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Woke up this morning and it’s gone. Either that scamp was playing an incredibly long game, waiting for me to fix that bike, or they got incredibly lucky, going to have a snoop on the first day there’s been a functioning bike there in months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way we’re looking for a new old pub bike, so hit me up…</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/hutchinson-blackbird-race-tyres\">In The Drops: Brand new Hutchinson tyres, Lightweight pedals, Velocio jacket, Lake CX239 shoes, trusty Giro Regimes and pub bikes</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Laurence Kilpatrick &#124; Staff Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"e6bca38d08e4298ef773ed5f194ea1863473f9fb92523c2c1584c444d5807b3b","category":"Cycling"}
