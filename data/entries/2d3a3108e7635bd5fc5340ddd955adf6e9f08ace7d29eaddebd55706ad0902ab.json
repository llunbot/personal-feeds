The <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/surface-pro-11-and-laptop-7-review-an-apple-silicon-moment-for-windows/\">latest Surface Pro and Surface Laptop</a> (and the other Copilot+ PCs) benefit from extensive work done to Windows 11’s x86 translation layer, a wider selection of native apps, and most importantly, Snapdragon X Pro and X Elite chips from Qualcomm that are as good as or better than Intel’s or AMD’s current offerings.</p>\n<p>The main problem with these computers is that they’re all on the expensive side. The cheapest Snapdragon X PC right now is <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/snapdragon-dev-kit-for-windows-is-a-next-gen-mini-desktop-with-snapdragon-x-elite/\"><span>probably this $899 developer kit mini-desktop</span></a>; the cheapest laptops start around the same $1,000 price as the entry-level MacBook Air.</p>\n<p>That’s a problem Qualcomm hopes to correct next year.
