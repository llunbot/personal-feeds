{"title":"OpenAI Debuts GPT-4o ‘Omni’ Model","link":"https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/13/openais-newest-model-is-gpt-4o/","date":1715651796000,"content":"\n<p>Kyle Wiggers, reporting for TechCrunch:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>OpenAI announced a new flagship generative AI model on Monday that\nthey call GPT-4o — the “o” stands for “omni,” referring to the\nmodel’s ability to handle text, speech, and video. GPT-4o is set\nto roll out “iteratively” across the company’s developer and\nconsumer-facing products over the next few weeks.</p>\n\n<p>OpenAI CTO Mira Murati said that GPT-4o provides “GPT-4-level”\nintelligence but improves on GPT-4’s capabilities across multiple\nmodalities and media.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You should watch at least some of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQacCB9tDaw\">the 25-minute live-streamed announcement today</a>, to see — and especially <em>hear</em> — some of the demos. GPT-4o is extraordinarily conversational, and the female voice they used is remarkably emotive. Response times seem very impressive, and in conversation GPT-4o allows you to interrupt it when it’s going in the wrong direction or just blathering.</p>\n\n<p>But my first impression is that it’s <em>too</em> emotive — too cloying, too saccharine. It comes across as condescending, like the voice of a kind kindergarten teacher addressing her students. I suspect, though, that they turned that dial up for the demo, and that it could easily be dialed back. And it really is impressive that I can complain that it might be <em>too</em> emotive. Also impressive: GPT-4o will be made available to all users, including those on the free tier.</p>\n\n<p>OpenAI also announced a <a href=\"https://help.openai.com/en/articles/9275200-using-the-chatgpt-macos-app\">ChatGPT Mac app</a>, a sort of Spotlight / LaunchBar / Alfred / Raycast type thing that they’re even calling a “launcher”. It’s supposedly available now to a limited number of users, and rolling out to everyone in the coming months.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/05/13/openai-gpt-4o\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"9e47698f0867bf0a4974c25713b3efb7dfeb805ea78f0bb95abfc34c032ae3f6","category":"Tech"}
