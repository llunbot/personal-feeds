After the leak rate doubled early this year during a two-week period, the Russians experimented with keeping the hatch leading to the PrK module closed intermittently and performed other investigations. But none of these measures taken during the spring worked.</p>\n<p>\"Following leak troubleshooting activities in April of 2024, Roscosmos has elected to keep the hatch between <em>Zvezda</em> and Progress closed when it is not needed for cargo operations,\" a NASA spokesperson told Ars. \"Roscosmos continues to limit operations in the area and, when required for use, implements measures to minimize the risk to the International Space Station.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029436#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029436&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ed1a19a7184c0f6c57940fdfd0fa3a7bd12a7923fe595d0b1f3a4b12dad2c043","category":"Tech"}
