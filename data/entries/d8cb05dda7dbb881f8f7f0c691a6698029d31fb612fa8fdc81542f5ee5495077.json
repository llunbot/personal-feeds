What was then just a concept is now a functional app that only became possible after Apple launched the Vision Pro. LePore is also known for working with Marvel Studios to create futuristic interfaces and gadgets for movies like Iron Man and Black Panther.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/barrycollins/2024/10/02/this-incredible-f1-app-is-the-best-reason-yet-to-buy-a-vision-pro/\">Forbes</a></em> highlighted a demonstration video from a Vision Pro user, and called the app \"the best reason yet to buy a Vision Pro.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nLapz is available as a TestFlight beta right now, and those who want to try out the app can sign up for the TestFlight <a href=\"https://www.lapz.io\">on the Lapz website</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro\">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/18/lapz-formula-1-app-vision-pro/\">Lapz App Lets You Watch Formula 1 Races on Apple Vision Pro</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/lapz-app-lets-you-watch-formula-1-races-on-apple-vision-pro.2440420/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d8cb05dda7dbb881f8f7f0c691a6698029d31fb612fa8fdc81542f5ee5495077","category":"Apple"}
