{"title":"Nvidia Is Crushing It","link":"https://www.wsj.com/business/earnings/nvidia-nvda-q4-earnings-report-2024-cc7c257d?mod=djemTechThings","date":1708814987000,"content":"\n<p>Asa Fitch, reporting for the WSJ:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Chief Executive Jensen Huang described AI as hitting “the tipping \npoint” and indicated demand for the computing power that underlies \nAI remained astronomical. “Demand is surging worldwide across \ncompanies, industries and nations,” he said. </p>\n\n<p>That demand showed up in the company’s results Wednesday. Sales \nmore than tripled in the company’s fiscal fourth quarter from a \nyear earlier and are projected to do so again in the current \nperiod. Earnings surged more than eightfold. The results exceeded \nanalyst expectations. </p>\n\n<p>Shares in the company rose 9% in off-hours trading. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That’s a big move for a company with a roughly $2 trillion cap.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In addition to ChatGPT, a number of other popular AI products have \nstarted to hit the market in recent months, including digital \nassistants for coding and business from Microsoft. Nvidia has \ntransformed itself in the space of three years from a company \nfocused on chips that help videogames run faster to the red-hot \ncenter of the AI boom. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sometimes a company is in the right place at right time for a pivot/industry shift. Apple was doing great in the 2000s, with the iPod and the Mac (especially after the switch from PowerPC to Intel) — and then the iPhone happened. Nvidia was (and remains) undeniably the leader in high-end gaming video cards, but now, truly suddenly, their gaming business is dwarfed by their data center AI hardware business.</p>\n\n<p>Do great work and great things tend to happen. Or in the words of Louis Pasteur, “Chance favors only the prepared mind.”</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/02/24/nvidia\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"de6adb349709348cf3e95497fd3fc327ef117bc7ddd3e3f123ae97066694f265","category":"Tech"}
