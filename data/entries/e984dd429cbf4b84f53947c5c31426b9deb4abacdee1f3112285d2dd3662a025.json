It soothes rough roads and presents great value, while Bosch’s Gen 4 motor is powerful and the drivetrain is superb. Our testing was consistent with Canyon’s claimed 100km range.</p>\n<p>The battery slots into the down tube and comes out at the click of a key. Its charger is easy to carry in a rucksack, which is a bonus for commuting. Mudguards and integrated lights add to its ride-to-work credentials.</p>\n<p>Where the Pathlite:ON 5 stands out from the field is off-road. Its handling, gearing, suspension fork and tyres make it at home on mountain bike trails, but it has an upright riding position for urban riding and bike paths.</p>\n<p>The Bosch motor is discrete when you’re pedalling unassisted. A welcome boost comes on steep inclines. You switch between off, Eco, Tour, eMTB and Turbo modes using the Bosch’s Purion display.</p>\n<p>Since it weighs 23kg, one place you won’t want to take the Pathlite:ON 5 is up a flight of stairs.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/electric-bikes/canyon-pathliteon-5-review/\">Read our full Canyon Pathlite:ON 5 review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Specialized Turbo Tero X 4.0</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Specialized Turbo Tero X 4.0 city urban off-road eBike\" title=\"Specialized Turbo Tero X 4.0 - 03\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Tero X is definitely not your average urban ebike option.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li>£4,000/$4,500/€4,200/AU$7,200 as tested</li>\n<li>Comfortable ride</li>\n<li>Off-road focus may not appeal</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Specialized Turbo Tero X 4.0 sits between bike categories.

It’s controlled via a phone app rather than a separate controller, which also reduces clutter, although we found it a little hard to read in bright sunlight.</p>\n<p>It’s a really nice bike to ride, with the characteristic feel of a steel frame. The motor helps, rather than taking over, although its 40Nm of torque is enough to get you up hills at a good pace. The gearing is basic but works, while Cooper has specced quality grips and saddle.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/electric-bikes/cooper-cg-7e-review/\">Read our full Cooper CG-7E </a><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/electric-bikes/cooper-cg-7e-review/\">review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Genesis Smithfield</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pack shot of the Genesis Smithfield electric commuter bike\" title=\"Genesis Smithfield - 01\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A comfy ride and attractive looks come with a raft of commuter features.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Dave Caudery / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li>£3,000</li>\n<li>Stylish urban option</li>\n<li>Steady handling</li>\n<li>Disappointing drivetrain</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Genesis Smithfield is a sleek urban ebike that rides nicely with a sizeable 150km claimed range and all you need for commuting, such as metal mudguards, a nurse’s lock and bosses for bottle cages or racks.</p>\n<p>Although the price tag calls for a better drivetrain than the nine-speed Shimano Acera, the Smithfield does boast a capable Shimano STEPS motor, long-lasting battery and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/road-disc-brakes-everything-you-need-to-know/\">disc brakes.</a></p>\n<p>The Smithfield might not be the snappiest given it weighs 23kg, but it has the range and compliance for you to incorporate off-road sorties into your route home.</p>\n<p>Our tester managed an undulating 81.5km using the variety of modes and found the battery recharged to 80 per cent in two hours and full charge in four.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/electric-bikes/genesis-smithfield-e-bike-review/\">Read our full Genesis Smithfield review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>GoCycle G4</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pack shot of the GoCycle G4 eBike for commuters\" title=\"GoCycle G4 - 01\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The GoCycle is a folding bike, ebike and commuter in one.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Dave Caudery / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li>£3,999/$4,999 as tested</li>\n<li>Clever design</li>\n<li>Nimble ride</li>\n<li>Expensive</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The GoCycle G4 is a class-leading collapsible bike with an excellent motor and reasonable range.

The LeMond Prolog is lightweight and sleek-looking, but one of its biggest surprises is its dynamic ride.</p>\n<p>Unlike many electric hybrid bikes, which look to mountain bikes for their relaxed, upright designs, the Prolog is much sportier and consequently has faster handling.</p>\n<p>The stiff and responsive carbon frame has wide tyres and comfortable contact points to cushion your ride.</p>\n<p>The bike has a 1x Shimano GRX drivetrain and an oversized rear hub that houses a 250W motor, putting out 40Nm of power. We found the battery life to be decent in testing, with the bike only running out of power after 60 miles / 100km of riding.</p>\n<p>At over £4,000 / $4,500, the Prolog is at the pricier end of the electric hybrid spectrum. But if you’re looking for a sporty assisted bike, we reckon it should be high on your list.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/electric-bikes/lemond-prolog-review/\">Read our full LeMond Prolog review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Mango Dee Dee</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Mango Dee Dee commuter e-bike\" title=\"Mango Dee Dee - 01\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> You don’t have to get the Mango Dee Dee in hot pink, it’s a custom option.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudery / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li>£2,528 as tested</li>\n<li>Powerful, lightweight Bafang motor</li>\n<li>Options to customise the build and colour</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Mango Dee Dee is available as a range of standard models, but we specced a custom build, which included a rack and lights, as well as the bright pink paintwork.</p>\n<p>The Dee Dee mixes stable handling at speed with low-speed manoeuvrability that makes getting around town a breeze.

They’ll usually have <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mudguards-fenders-a-buyers-guide/\">mudguards</a> (or mudguard mounts, at the very least), often come equipped with lights, and there will probably be mounts for a rack, so you can carry extra stuff.</p>\n<p>But there are more specialist machines such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/canyon-pathlite-on/\">Canyon Pathlite:ON</a>, where not only do you get lights, mudguards and a rack, but the higher-spec machines come with a second 500Wh battery for long-distance trekking.</p>\n<p>There are also flat-bar versions of sporty drop-bar road ebikes, such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/electric-bikes/orbea-gain-d10-e-bike-first-ride-review/\">Orbea Gain</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/electric-bikes/focus-paralane2-9-7-review/\">Focus Paralane2</a>.</p>\n<p>Other variants we’ve reviewed include the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/load-carrying-bikes/tern-gsd-review/\">Tern GSD</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/electric-bikes/rad-power-radwagon-review/\">Rad Power RadWagon</a> electric cargo bikes, and the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/electric-bikes/orbea-katu-first-ride-review/\">Orbea Katu-E</a>, an e-shopper.</p>\n<h3>Hybrid ebike motor systems</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"The bike is built around the considerably more powerful Bosch Active Plus motor\" title=\"carrera-crossfuse-2-1508422721338-dmomzn3sq0e3-c9c12c3\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Bosch’s mid-mounted Active Line Plus motor gives plenty of power output.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Mid-mounted motors are a popular choice for hybrid electric bikes. These have a motor mounted between the cranks that powers the rear wheel when you’re pedalling. It’s a position that provides plenty of stability because it puts the motor’s weight low down and centrally on the frame.</p>\n<p>Look out for systems from Bosch and Shimano. A rear-hub motor is another option, but front-wheel motors are less common on hybrids.</p>\n<p>Batteries are typically mounted low on the down tube, also for stability, although some hybrid electric bikes stash the battery out of sight within the frame or have it mounted under the top deck of a rear luggage rack.</p>\n<p>More expensive models tend to have larger-capacity batteries for additional range and there may be the option to plug in a second battery, if you want to go further.</p>\n<p>There’s usually a controller on the handlebar, where it’s within easy reach, that enables you to select assistance level and keep an eye on your battery status as you ride.</p>\n<h3>Range</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"A Powerpack 400 battery powers the Bosch Active line plus motor\" title=\"Carrera Crossfuse 06\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This power-pack battery locks to the bike, so no fear of theft here.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Some quoted ranges are pretty accurate or even conservative, but look out for exaggerated claims if you’re planning to use your ebike for anything more than local excursions, or don’t have access to convenient charging.</p>\n<p>In general, you’ll want a battery capacity of 250Wh or more for a decent range. Most hybrid electric bike motors will push out a maximum of 250 watts, so that would give you an hour if you were using the motor at full power, though in reality that will rarely happen.</p>\n<p>In practice, the motor will be working less hard than this, but your real range will depend on where you’re riding, the assistance level selected and other factors.</p>\n<h3>Added extras</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Ribble Hybrid AL e pannier rack\" title=\"Ribble Hybrid AL e pannier rack\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Mudguards and lights are useful extras on the best electric hybrid bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon von Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>For practicality, it’s nice to have mudguards, and front and rear lights as part of the package, giving you all-weather rideability.</p>\n<p>Also look out for a rear rack or rack mounts, so you can use your hybrid electric bike with panniers or other <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/cycling-luggage/\" target=\"_blank\">cycling luggage</a> for shopping or longer excursions.</p>\n<p>And if you’re planning on longer rides on your ebike, the option to add a second battery will more or less double your range.</p>\n<h3>What if you’re not sure a hybrid electric bike is for you?</h3>\n<p>If you’re not sure where to start on your electric bike journey, read our explainer on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/what-is-an-electric-bike/\">how an electric bike works</a> and our guide to the most popular <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/electric-bike-motors/\">electric bike motors</a>.
