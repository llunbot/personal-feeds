The <a href=\"https://howl.me/cjNQqCO2Xj5\" target=\"_blank\">$400</a> RTX 3060 Ti <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/12/nvidia-announces-the-399-rtx-3060-ti-and-weve-tested-it/\">could match or beat</a> a $700 RTX 2080 Super from the previous generation. The 4060 Ti... well, it can definitely beat a 3060 Ti.</p>\n<p>It's a very capable mid-range graphics card that's great at 1080p and can often stretch to 1440p. It gives you more performance and lower power consumption at the same price you'd pay for a 3060 Ti yesterday. And it does all of the Ada Lovelace architecture's special tricks, like DLSS Frame Generation and hardware-accelerated AV1 video encoding. But it doesn't bring last generation's high-end performance down to a more reasonable price the way older Nvidia cards have.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1940093#p3\">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1940093&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ce490e5b2b2a2b54f74bb5a5f088eb9ac9ab31c59a13a50b11d57082148587a2","category":"Tech"}
