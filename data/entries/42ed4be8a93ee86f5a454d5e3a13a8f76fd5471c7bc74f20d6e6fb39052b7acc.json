Continuity Camera works wirelessly or wired in FaceTime, Zoom, and other apps, and delivers video directly from a user's nearby ‌iPhone‌ camera, which has significantly better quality than the built-in camera on Macs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAnother function of Continuity Camera is the ability to use a nearby iPhone as the microphone input for your Mac. As long as the iPhone is running iOS 16 or later and signed into the same Apple Account, you can speak into it and the audio will be seamlessly delivered to your Mac, sans video.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe following steps show you how to set it up in macOS Ventura and later.\r<br />\n<ol><li>On your Mac, click the Apple () symbol in the menu bar and select <strong>System Settings...</strong>.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Click <strong>Sound</strong> in the sidebar.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Under \"Output &amp; Input,\" click the <strong>Input</strong> tab.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Select the name of your nearby iPhone, listed as Type \"Continuity Camera.\"</li></ol><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/sound-mac-settings.jpg\" alt=\"settings\" width=\"1430\" height=\"436\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYour nearby iPhone will ping with a sound and show a \"Connected to...\" Screen indicating that it has successfully connected.
