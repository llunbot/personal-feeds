But doctors have begun to suspect that this year's flu season—<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/02/sick-right-now-flu-is-resurging-to-yet-a-higher-peak-this-season/\">the most severe in over 15 years</a>—has taken a yet darker turn for children. On February 14, for instance, health officials in Massachusetts released <a href=\"https://www.mass.gov/doc/influenza-neurologic-complications-advisory-february-14-2025/download\">an advisory for clinicians</a> to be on alert for neurological complications in pediatric flu patients after detecting a \"possible increase.\"</p>\n<p>With the anecdata coming in, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention analyzed all the data it has on neurological complications from flu this year and seasons dating back to 2010. Unfortunately, existing surveillance systems for flu do not capture neurological complications in pediatric cases overall—but they do capture such detailed clinical data when a child dies of flu.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/02/the-flu-may-be-attacking-more-childrens-brains-than-usual-this-year/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/02/the-flu-may-be-attacking-more-childrens-brains-than-usual-this-year/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b4e3aa073223b1b7bc0639fe5a03671eae0021a1b03ea066348a0d4f70acba10","category":"Tech"}
