The Jamjake stylus is designed to work seamlessly with a wide range of iPad models. Whether you own an iPad, iPad Pro, iPad Air, or iPad Mini released after 2018, this stylus is for you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s important to note that it won’t function with older models or the latest 2024 iPads, for which you’ll still need the Apple Pencil Pro. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Jamjake stylus will provide the accuracy you need when writing or drawing because it features a 1.5mm tip, which is slightly larger than the original Apple ones but still similar enough that you shouldn’t feel much of a difference. The tips are super easy to change, and there are plenty of extras in the package. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite being super affordable, it functions like an Apple Pencil, with an ergonomic design, precision writing, and palm rejection so you’ll be able to rest your hand on the screen without any accidental touches on the screen. The Jamjake stylus’s battery life is also comparable to that of Apple’s original models. A full charge takes about 15-20 minutes, and you can use it for upwards of 10 hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While we haven’t had the opportunity to test this model ourselves, the product has garnered close to 87,000 reviews on Amazon alone, with an impressive 4.4/5 stars. The majority of users praise the quality of the product and its ease of use. One recent purchaser shared their experience, expressing their initial hesitation about using a stylus with their iPad. However, they were pleasantly surprised by the Jamjake stylus and concluded that there was no need to invest in the more expensive Apple originals. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s models are also on sale if you’re still unsure about getting the Jamjake stylus for $20.
