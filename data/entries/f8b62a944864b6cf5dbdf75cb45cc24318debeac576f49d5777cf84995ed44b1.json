When that time comes, it’s really easy to change the battery. AirTag uses a CR2032 battery, the kind of battery often found in remote controls and other handy devices. You can <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Energizer-CR2032-Batteries-Lithium-Battery/dp/B0002RID4G/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">find them at Amazon</a> and most stores that sell AA or AAA batteries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has posted a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211670&amp;xcust=1-1-345768-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">support document</a> that points out that CR2032 batteries with bitterant coating may not work with AirTag. (Bitterant is added to some CR2032 batteries to discourage small children from handling them.) Check the battery’s packages before you make a purchase as some will indicate that they’re compatible with AirTag.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the video above, you’ll learn how to change the AirTag battery. The instructions are listed below.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Open the AirTag by holding the AirTag with the white base facing downward and the Apple logo facing up..</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use two fingers, press down on two points beside the logo, and turn the cap counterclockwise. It might take a few attempts to get it right as the cap is designed to be fairly child-proof. Once you feel the cap turn, try prying it off to remove the metal backing. If it does easily pop off, you’ll need to turn it more.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Take the old battery out and out the new one in with the plus (+) side facing uo</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Put the cap back on and turn the cap in the clockwise direction to close it. You will hear a small sound to let you know the battery is recognized.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Head over to the Find My app and make sure the battery icon is gone.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information about AirTag, read our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/343664/airtags-price-release-date-specs-features-privacy.html\">AirTag FAQ</a> and watch a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/344932/how-to-set-up-apples-airtag.html\">video on how to set it up</a>.
