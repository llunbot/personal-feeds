Please keep reading. </p>\n\n<p>The games:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Conlextions:</strong> Inspired by NYT’s Connections<br />\n<strong>Lexicogs:</strong> Solve crossword-style clues by assembling letter “cogs”<br />\n<strong>By a Vowel:</strong> A word jumble game with missing vowels<br />\n<strong>Six Appeal:</strong> Wordle with six-letter words</p>\n\n<p>There’s also a daily <strong>Mini Crossword</strong>; a <strong>Full-Size Crossword</strong>; and <strong>Mind Control</strong>, which is a whole lot like Mastermind and not actually a word game at all; don’t sue me.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and if you only counted seven games here, the eighth is iOS-only. It’s called Letter Opener, and it’s my favorite.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2025/03/lexgames_free_daily_word_games\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"Daring Fireball Department of Commerce","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"fe8d38f52ef69ce21e388ed3fda515641af090e387d2184c8d1291c916b5df0a","category":"Tech"}
