With the full rebranding later this year, the term Apple ID is expected to be completely phased out, over two decades after the company started using it. Apple's reasoning behind the decision is not known, but \"Apple Account\" would be more straightforward branding.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple will preview iOS 18 and its other major software updates at its developers conference WWDC in June, and the rebranding to \"Apple Account\" will likely be announced then. The updates should be widely released in September.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/\">Apple ID</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/17/apple-id-rebrand-to-apple-account-ios-18/\">'Apple ID' Expected to Change to 'Apple Account' Starting With iOS 18</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-id-expected-to-change-to-apple-account-starting-with-ios-18.2422155/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8407208e2ad3835ba2a4b992480da97d7cb2276b2b7ca58e39b771e7539ea491","category":"Apple"}
