{"title":"GoPro Hero 13 Black vs iPhone 16 Pro: Ultimate Camera (Action) Test!","link":"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/09/iphone-16-pro-ultimate-gopro-hero-13-black-camera.html","date":1727709522000,"content":"<p><span>﻿</span></p>\n<p>It’s that time of year again, for the iPhone vs GoPro test, focused on action. Or, video scenarios in all sorts of fun ways. As always, the reality of 2024 (or the last numbers of years), is the line between action camera and phone camera continues to blur. This year, Apple added 4K @ 120FPS (used for slow-motion footage) to match GoPro’s existing 4K/120. Of course, GoPro added 5.3K @ 120FPS (although, in a more limited custom mode for just 5 seconds).</p>\n<p>And that’s all in addition to the previous Action Mode that Apple has had, that stabilizes the image with impressive results. Thus I put the cameras side-by-side through a slate of different tests, including:</p>\n<p>0:00 Quick Intro<br />\n0:41 Cannonball Test (4K/120FPS)<br />\n1:56 Running Sprint (Stabilization Test)<br />\n3:26 Underwater Footage Comparison<br />\n4:22 Mountain Biking Comparison<br />\n5:35 Driving &amp; Vehicle Comparison<br />\n6:15 Flying atop a drone Test!<br />\n8:35 Night footage Comparison<br />\n9:04 Final Comparison Thoughts</p>\n<p>As always, the camera you have on you is your best camera. But as these tests show, the winner depends a little bit on how you judge each bit of footage, and the use cases. In many scenarios, the results are incredibly similar, but facts like mounting and durability become more critical.</p>\n<p>Anyway, just enjoy and have fun watching!</p>","author":"Ray Maker","siteTitle":"DC Rainmaker","siteHash":"32f541eec2062fbf675b0daf837db78b41cd6160cf993de3c4b5e9b44a978706","entryHash":"f0b484d161e7e24e55171bfc96a404660ff9e5f1ea69772766b5fb945f2be90e","category":"Cycling"}
