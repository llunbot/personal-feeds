The spacecraft was in an orbit of less than 400 miles (600 kilometers) over the lunar surface Thursday, with the final descent maneuvers set to begin early Friday.</p>\n<p>SLIM will fire its thrusters to lower the closest point of its orbit to the Moon down to an altitude of just 9 miles (15 kilometers). Then the spacecraft will commence its 20-minute final descent using its two hydrazine-fueled engines, culminating in a landing at 10:20 am EST (15:20 UTC) adjacent to a nearly 900-foot (270-meter) crater named Shioli in a region called the Sea of Nectar on the near side of the Moon.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1997302#p3\">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1997302&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c7f729ffd27552e0e14975c354bbb2b79888aa39c3aa196b0b34ec96b37456c1","category":"Tech"}
