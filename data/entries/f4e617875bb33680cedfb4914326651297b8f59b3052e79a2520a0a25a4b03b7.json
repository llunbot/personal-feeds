[credit:\n                              Microsoft                            ]\n                      </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n\n<p>If at first you don't succeed, try, try again.</p>\n<p>Microsoft has announced a pair of new devices powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Plus and X Elite processors. They're far from Microsoft's first PCs with Arm processors in them—2012's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/10/microsofts-first-stab-at-a-pc-surface-reviewed/\">original Surface</a>, the Surface Pro X, and the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/surface-pro-9-comes-in-both-intel-and-arm-flavors-absorbing-the-surface-pro-x/\">Surface Pro 9 with 5G</a> have all shipped with Arm's chips instead of Intel's or AMD's. But today's new Surface Pro and Surface Laptop are the first Arm devices to be the <em>primary</em> Surface offerings rather than a side offering, and they're the first to credibly claim that they can both outperform comparable Intel- and AMD-designed chips while offering better battery life, a la Apple's M1 chip in 2020.</p>\n<p>One caveat that I hadn't seen mentioned in Microsoft's presentation or in other coverage of the announcement, though: Microsoft says that both of these devices have fans. Apple still uses fans for the MacBook Pro lineup, but the MacBook Air is totally fanless. Bear that in mind when reading Microsoft's claims about performance.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025365#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025365&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f4e617875bb33680cedfb4914326651297b8f59b3052e79a2520a0a25a4b03b7","category":"Tech"}
