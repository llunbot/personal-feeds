{"title":"Wired: ‘Perplexity Is a Bullshit Machine’","link":"https://www.wired.com/story/perplexity-is-a-bullshit-machine/","date":1718854758000,"content":"\n<p>Dhruv Mehrotra and Tim Marchman, reporting for Wired (<a href=\"https://apple.news/AiMoghRK4RzKHbhLrJkYniw\">News+ link</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A Wired analysis and <a href=\"https://rknight.me/blog/perplexity-ai-is-lying-about-its-user-agent/\">one carried out by developer Robb Knight</a>\nsuggest that Perplexity is able to achieve this partly through\napparently ignoring a widely accepted web standard known as the\nRobots Exclusion Protocol to surreptitiously scrape areas of\nwebsites that operators do not want accessed by bots, despite\n<a href=\"https://docs.perplexity.ai/docs/perplexitybot\">claiming</a> that it won’t. Wired observed a machine tied to\nPerplexity — more specifically, one on an Amazon server and\nalmost certainly operated by Perplexity — doing this on wired.com\nand across other Condé Nast publications.</p>\n\n<p>The Wired analysis also demonstrates that despite <a href=\"https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/perplexity-raises-series-b-funding-round\">claims</a> that\nPerplexity’s tools provide “instant, reliable answers to any\nquestion with complete sources and citations included,” doing away\nwith the need to “click on different links,” its chatbot, which is\ncapable of accurately summarizing journalistic work with\nappropriate credit, is also prone to <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10676-024-09775-5\">bullshitting</a>, in the\ntechnical sense of the word.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This paints Perplexity as, effectively, an IP theft engine, and its CEO, Aravind Srinivas, as a degenerate liar. None of this is an oversight or just playing fast and loose. It’s a scheme to deliberately circumvent the plain intention of website owners not to have Perplexity index their sites. Liars and <a href=\"https://x.com/JohnPaczkowski/status/1799135156051255799\">thieves</a>. Utterly shameless.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/19/perplexity-bullshit-machine\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"c8d03600b725288d556b59a30ef52099c20ab0c1b78f87cdcc56effa3db22aac","category":"Tech"}
