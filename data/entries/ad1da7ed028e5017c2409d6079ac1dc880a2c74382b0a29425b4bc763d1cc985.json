All that is needed is to build hardware capable of implementing the theorists' work.</p>\n<p>The situation was essentially reversed when it came to <a href=\"https://docs.dwavesys.com/docs/latest/c_gs_2.html\">quantum annealing</a>. D-Wave started building hardware that could perform quantum annealing without a strong theoretical understanding of how its performance would compare to standard computing hardware. And, for practical calculations, the hardware has sometimes been outperformed by more traditional algorithms.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, however, a team of researchers, some at D-Wave, others at academic institutions, is releasing a paper comparing its quantum annealer with different methods of simulating its behavior. The results show that actual hardware has a clear advantage over simulations, though there are two caveats: errors start to cause the hardware to deviate from ideal performance, and it's not clear how well this performance edge translates to practical calculations.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1933111#p3\">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1933111&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ad1da7ed028e5017c2409d6079ac1dc880a2c74382b0a29425b4bc763d1cc985","category":"Tech"}
