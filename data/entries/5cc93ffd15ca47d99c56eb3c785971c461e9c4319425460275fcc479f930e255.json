Owners of the older Apple Watch currently have to face an unpleasant experience when updating their device to newer versions of watchOS, including resetting and repairing their watch to their <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> due to little available storage. Apple is aiming to address these and other concerns with ‌iOS 15‌ and ‌watchOS 8‌ this fall.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe third beta of ‌iOS 15‌ also includes plenty of other changes, including refinements to the controversial Safari design, with a relocated address field.
