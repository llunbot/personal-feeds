The 2024 version comes in Bug Zapper Blue, Purple Haze, and Galaxy Black, sold as a frame only or in two complete bike builds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This 5th generation is still built with full external cable routing and carries over the same geometry as before. The news here is the new colors, and that they’re open for pre-order now. This model is made in small batches, so it’s not always in stock.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-canfield-nimble-9-steel-hardtail-mtb-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-canfield-nimble-9-steel-hardtail-mtb-2.jpg\" alt=\"2024 canfield nimble 9 hardtail mtb shown in three colors\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-canfield-nimble-9-steel-hardtail-mtb-2.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-canfield-nimble-9-steel-hardtail-mtb-2-297x156.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-canfield-nimble-9-steel-hardtail-mtb-2-800x420.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-canfield-nimble-9-steel-hardtail-mtb-2-120x63.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-canfield-nimble-9-steel-hardtail-mtb-2-768x403.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The frame is 4130 chromoly steel with radial-bent seatstays to add more compliance.
