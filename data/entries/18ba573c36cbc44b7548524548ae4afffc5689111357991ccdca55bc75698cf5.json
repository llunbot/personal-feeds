Going forward, she will supervise the heads of retail for Europe and the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and the Americas East regions. The new, simplified structure for retail affords Trigub more responsibility. She started out at Apple as an intern around the launch of the original <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, and has since held roles in finance, mergers and acquisitions, and retail operations.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple retail continues to be ultimately overseen by senior executive Deirdre O'Brien. She will now have fewer direct reports and is still reshuffling the HR organization after Carol Surface's departure. Individuals involved in Apple's retail group reportedly believe that the company is preparing Trigub to be O'Brien's successor, who has now worked at Apple for over three decades.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has not yet officially announced the changes. This is the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/20/siri-leadership-shakeup/\">second significant change</a> in Apple's management in recent times; last week the company moved <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> from AI chief John Giannandrea to Vision Pro leader Mike Rockwell.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/retail/\">Retail</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/27/apple-appoints-new-global-head-of-stores/\">Apple Leadership Reshuffle Continues as Company Appoints New Global Head of Stores</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-leadership-reshuffle-continues-as-company-appoints-new-global-head-of-stores.2454143/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"18ba573c36cbc44b7548524548ae4afffc5689111357991ccdca55bc75698cf5","category":"Apple"}
