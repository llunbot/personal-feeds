I'd much rather get some fresh air and watch the world drift past me as I cycle or hike somewhere than watch a screen while sweating away on something stationary.</p>\n<p>To get a bit more of what I like, I've invested in a variety of gear that has extended my cycling season deeper into the winter. But even with that, there are various conditions—near-freezing temperatures, heavy rains, Canada catching fire—that have kept me off the roads. So, a backup exercise plan has always been on my to-do list.</p>\n<p>The company LifeSpan offers exercise equipment that fits well into a home office and gave me the chance to try its <a href=\"https://www.lifespanfitness.com/products/ampera-under-desk-bike\">Ampera model</a>.

Overall, the hardware is well-designed, but some glitches, software issues, and design decisions keep it from living up to its potential.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005793#p3\">Read 25 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005793&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a4ca5188e75ac60e19de433b5fac4eb1f20362efbbcbdfe1a2a9b739244c3a6c","category":"Tech"}
