The author himself admitted that he wrote strictly for the printed page, and he always refused invitations to adapt his work for film or TV. But Asimov was more than happy to let others adapt his work to a new medium, and he was wise enough to expect that there would—and should—be significant departures from the print version.</p>\n<p>That's just what showrunner David S. Goyer (<em>Dark Knight</em> trilogy, <em>Da Vinci's Demons)</em> has done with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/06/apple-drops-first-teaser-trailer-for-tv-adaption-of-asimovs-foundation-series/\"><em>Foundation</em></a>, Apple TV+'s visually stunning, eminently bingeable new series. Goyer describes it as more of a remix than a direct adaptation, and to my taste, it is a smashing success in storytelling. This series respects Asimov's sweeping visionary ideas without lapsing into slavish reverence and over-pontification. That said, how much you like Goyer's vision might depend on how much of a stickler you are about remaining faithful to the source material.</p>\n<p><strong>(Some spoilers below, but no major reveals.)</strong></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1797337#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1797337&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d592a5d2fc571d35c1d14e17ab88f89f707d9ce777da323ff7f37aee74fc1645","category":"Tech"}
