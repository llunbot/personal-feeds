This includes refining training techniques, building honesty guardrails, expanding pre-deployment testing, and enhancing evaluations to prevent similar issues.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe company also plans to give users more control over ChatGPT's behavior, including new ways to provide real-time feedback and the option to choose from multiple default personalities in the future.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chatgpt/\">ChatGPT</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/30/chatgpt-excessive-flattery-openai-roll-back-update/\">ChatGPT's Excessive Flattery Prompts OpenAI to Roll Back Update</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/chatgpts-excessive-flattery-prompts-openai-to-roll-back-update.2456228/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ca288abeb435f118e4c29313f3d2a8703cad642537ff435cb07c34271cfd9a11","category":"Apple"}
