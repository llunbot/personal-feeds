In addition to filtering water, the cut flowers can generate income via the <a href=\"https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/gallery/chart-detail/?chartId=106472\">multibillion-dollar floral market</a>.</p>\n<p>In our trials of various flowers, giant marigolds stood out as the most successful, producing long, marketable stems and large blooms. Their yield matched typical <a href=\"https://www.lsuagcenter.com/articles/page1662131594449\">flower farm production</a>.</p>\n<h2>Why it matters</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/nps/basic-information-about-nonpoint-source-nps-pollution\">Water pollution</a> is caused in large part by runoff from farms, urban lawns, and even septic tanks. When it rains, excess phosphorus, nitrogen, and other chemicals wash into lakes and rivers.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2004198#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2004198&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"The Conversation","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6d54071671796028d06a179a65d927c3b2f2974840817d9f702af7c553a9838e","category":"Tech"}
