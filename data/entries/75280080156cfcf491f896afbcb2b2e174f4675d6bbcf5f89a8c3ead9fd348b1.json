The device will have a \"notch like the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a>,\" according to Young, which contradicts a recent leak that depicted a ‌Dynamic Island‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/iPhone-SE-4-Thumb-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nEarlier this month, leaker Evan Blass <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/08/iphone-se-dynamic-island-rumor/\">shared images</a> said to feature the ‌iPhone SE‌ 4's design, but those images featured an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> with a ‌Dynamic Island‌ rather than the notch that had been previously rumored for new low-cost ‌iPhone‌. A <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/08/iphone-se-dynamic-island-rumor/\">sketchy leak</a> from February 2024 also suggested that the ‌iPhone SE‌ 4 would get the ‌Dynamic Island‌, but most other information has suggested that Apple will go with the notch design.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMultiple rumors have indicated that the ‌iPhone SE‌ 4 is modeled after the ‌iPhone 14‌, and will therefore have an ‌iPhone‌ 14-style design. The ‌iPhone 14‌ had a notch and not a ‌Dynamic Island‌, so the notch makes more sense if Apple is using an ‌iPhone 14‌ body for the ‌iPhone SE‌ 4. Alleged screen protectors for the ‌iPhone SE‌ 4 also appear to have a design for a notch rather than the ‌Dynamic Island‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/iphone-se-4-screen-protector.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"810\" height=\"1080\" /><em><div>Image via <a href=\"https://sonnydickson.com\">Sonny Dickson</a></div></em>\r<br />\nWith the launch of the ‌iPhone SE‌ 4, Apple will sunset <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a> in the ‌iPhone‌ lineup, and all iPhones will have <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/\">Face ID</a>. The ‌iPhone SE‌ 4 is also expected to feature a 6.1-inch display, a single-lens rear camera, 8GB RAM, and an A17 Pro chip capable of supporting <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCurrent rumors suggest that the ‌iPhone SE‌ 4 will be introduced in the spring, likely in April.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE\">iPhone SE (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/28/iphone-se-4-notch/\">iPhone SE 4 to Have Notch Instead of Dynamic Island</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-se-4-to-have-notch-instead-of-dynamic-island.2448296/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"75280080156cfcf491f896afbcb2b2e174f4675d6bbcf5f89a8c3ead9fd348b1","category":"Apple"}
