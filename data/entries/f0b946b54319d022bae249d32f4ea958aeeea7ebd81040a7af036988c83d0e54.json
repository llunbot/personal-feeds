{"title":"Meet the audaxers","link":"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/audax-stories","date":1708349881000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/audax-stories\">Meet the audaxers</a></p>\n\n<p>There’s luggage but this isn’t touring; there’s sleeping on the floor but this isn’t bikepacking. There’s a time limit but this isn’t a sportive; there are awards but this isn’t a race. This is audax, a discipline as old as the hills, one on which early editions of the Tour de France were based, where riders traversed huge distances on two wheels with little more than a checkpoint map and their wits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The event photographed here by Fergus Coyle was the 2022 <a href=\"https://www.pedalution.co.uk/events/moonrakers-sunseekers-300-23/\" target=\"_blank\">Moonrakers and Sunseekers</a> audax run in November. The ride is 300km, starting out from Bristol at 10pm, turning round at Poole and then heading back to Bristol, with riders needing to get their brevet cards stamped at checkpoints to prove their long-distance mettle. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As per the official rules, each rider has 20 hours to complete the event, requiring a minimum speed of 15kmh (for distances over 600km that figure drops to a kinder 13.3kmh). If you see a pattern emerging here, you’re right. Distance is the name of the game, with completion being the aim.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These audaxers were captured halfway around Moonrakers and Sunseekers, in a Sea Scout hut in Poole. While today there are entry level audaxes under 200km, which are aimed at increasing the sport’s appeal, the traditional distances are 200km, 300km, 400km, 600km and 1,000km, so rides tend to take place overnight. They can be even longer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The marquee audaxes in the calendar are London-Edinburgh-London (1,500km), which will run in 2025, and Paris-Brest-Paris (1,200km), once upon a time a professional race too. For these, audax riders will have to qualify, making certain time cuts and completing certain combinations of rides. But we’ve already said too much. Let’s hand you over to the audaxers themselves…</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/ultracycling-ride-around-the-world\">So you want to ride around the world?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/diot-paris-brest-paris-1951\">Race history: Diot outsprints Muller to claim Paris-Brest-Paris in 1951</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/london-to-tunisia-cycling-route\">Tunisia Diaries: This is the route I took to cycle from London to Tunisia</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Corinna O’Connor, 19,200km per year</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"728\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-02-728x970.jpg\" alt=\"The audaxers\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-02-728x970.jpg 728w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-02-225x300.jpg 225w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-02-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-02-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-02-750x1000.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-02-1140x1520.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-02.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Fergus Coyle</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>I did my first audaxes when I was training for Land’s End to John O’Groats, and I ended up meeting what I call the wrong type of people – a bad crowd that can convince you that riding London-Edinburgh-London is perfectly normal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I rode LEL in 2022. It’s 1,500km and it took me five days and 30 minutes. My strategy was very basic: just do 300km every 24 hours and sleep whenever I wanted. Sleep mostly happens at checkpoints, which are places like school halls. Just a mattress on the floor and a blanket and you tell them what time you want to be woken up – otherwise alarms would be going off continually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You get points for the audaxes you ride in a year; 200km is worth two points then it’s one for each 100km going up from there. Last audax year – which runs from November to October – I won the women’s trophy. I rode just over 10,000km of audaxes. But I also ride my bike in between.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Dai Harris, 13,600km per year</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"728\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-03-728x970.jpg\" alt=\"The audaxers\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-03-728x970.jpg 728w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-03-225x300.jpg 225w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-03-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-03-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-03-750x1000.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-03-1140x1520.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-03.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Fergus Coyle</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Why do I ride audaxes? Well, it’s the personal challenge at the end of the day. Just the satisfaction of finishing. But they can be really hard. Pride carries you a long way, you know, but not always all the way. Last week I entered the Double Creamed [27th December], which was 1,000km out of Bristol, but I only did half. Around Ironbridge the wind was howling, the trees were bending over and you think, gosh, this is hard work and there’s still 500km to go. I stopped on that occasion, but I was a bit annoyed at myself in the morning as the wind had died down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mostly ride fixed gear. I don’t know why, it’s just nice to be part of a cycling niche. I did LEL on a fixed; it was really hard work. I think it’s just to prove I’m not getting past it, you know?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Felix Smith, 6,000km per year</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"728\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-04-728x970.jpg\" alt=\"The audaxers\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-04-728x970.jpg 728w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-04-225x300.jpg 225w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-04-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-04-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-04-750x1000.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-04-1140x1520.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-04.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Fergus Coyle</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Without sounding too dramatic, I felt a little out of body when this picture was taken. I had just eaten dinner and I actually found it hard to stand up – my body just wanted to slump into itself. It’s not just fitness but fortitude that keeps you going on an audax.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel a real sense of achievement when I finish, and I find it one of audax’s most charming things that you see a lot of the older generation still being able to go the distance too, defying what others might think about them by just keeping on going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The audax scene isn’t as Mason-like as it can seem, though I’m sympathetic to those who might think so. There are the sometimes bizarre bike setups, the obsession with Carradice bags, the audax nomenclature, the sewn-on patches, but there’s nothing quite like queuing at a 24-hour McDonald’s at 1am with hundreds of other audaxers and a guy with the post-night-out munchies live-streaming the chaos on his phone.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Liam FitzPatrick, 12,000km per year</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"728\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-05-728x970.jpg\" alt=\"The audaxers\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-05-728x970.jpg 728w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-05-225x300.jpg 225w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-05-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-05-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-05-750x1000.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-05-1140x1520.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-05.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Fergus Coyle</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Audaxes are tracked – there are electronic versions now but I’m an old git so I like the brevet card. You get it stamped or signed at checkpoints along a route, which are usually church halls where you get food and a cup of tea. But for a longer ride – I organise London-Wales-London, which is 400km – the stops might just be cafes you know are open, so you get a receipt to prove you’ve been there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It takes a sort of secret knowledge to plan these things, like knowing there’s a motorway services at Membury on the M4 that you can access on a bike through an industrial estate. I swear most nights it’s full of audaxers as lots of rides go through there, and they’re completely unfazed by a bunch of cyclists turning up in the middle of the night, drinking their coffee. It doesn’t matter what 24-hour petrol station it is, though – you turn up on your bike at 3am, put a chocolate milk, an egg sandwich and a KitKat down and the bloke behind the counter goes, ‘Any petrol?’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Carl Henrik Ek, 10,000km per year</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"728\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-06-728x970.jpg\" alt=\"The audaxers\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-06-728x970.jpg 728w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-06-225x300.jpg 225w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-06-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-06-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-06-750x1000.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-06-1140x1520.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-06.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Fergus Coyle</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>My longest ride was Paris-Brest-Paris, which is 1,200km. You do the first 600km at an average speed of at least 15kmh, then the second 600km is a minimum 12kmh. To qualify you have to do two Super Randonneurs [SRs] in the two years before, which means doing a 200km, 300km, 400km and 600km audax in one year. You don’t really get anything for an SR but you can write to Audax UK and they will send you a badge. It’s a funny sport.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To me the big attraction is the way audax simplifies things. You’ve done hundreds of kilometres and you’re still riding at 4am, and your body starts breaking down. I mean, not <em>breaking</em> but it’s like these shields you build up to protect yourself from the complicated world – they start to break down. Then when I see the sunrise I feel like what I believe a kid feels seeing the sun rise for the first time. I just feel like I can feel everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Richard French, 10,000km; Jackie Townsend, 19,000km per year</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"728\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-07-728x970.jpg\" alt=\"The audaxers\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-07-728x970.jpg 728w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-07-225x300.jpg 225w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-07-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-07-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-07-750x1000.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-07-1140x1520.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/audaxers-07.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Fergus Coyle</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><strong>Richard:</strong> On the Moonrakers we arrived at 3am in Poole, then left about 5am after a rest and an early breakfast. I was feeling pretty happy but there’s a certain apprehension. There’s still the same distance to go, and while you get good support from the other riders, you still have to be self-sufficient. There’s no being rescued by the organisers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jackie:</strong> Because everyone’s going through the same experiences there’s a bond, but there’s not that huge competitiveness. Some people like to be ahead, but most people are in it for the personal challenge, to finish. And then you get the full-value riders, whose aim is to take the maximum time but no more. I met one chap who had done Paris-Brest-Paris – that’s 90 hours, and he finished it with 25 minutes to spare. I think these are some of the reasons you find more and more women doing audax; it’s a great way of achieving more than you thought possible without it being competitive.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/audax-stories\">Meet the audaxers</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"f0b946b54319d022bae249d32f4ea958aeeea7ebd81040a7af036988c83d0e54","category":"Cycling"}
