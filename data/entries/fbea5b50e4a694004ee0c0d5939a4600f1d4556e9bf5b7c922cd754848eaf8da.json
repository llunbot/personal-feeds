{"title":"The Best Simple USB-C Microphone: Audio-Technica’s ATR2100x-USB","link":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B07ZPBFVKK/?tag=df-amzn-20","date":1713544098000,"content":"\n<p>Joe Fabisevich <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@mergesort/post/C54D3acubu9\">asked a common question on Threads</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What’s the go to simple USB-C podcast mic that sounds good, but \ndoesn’t have to be top of the line or super expensive? Think more \n“I need to sound professional on a podcast or two”, not “I make my \nmoney by recording podcasts.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My answer: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B07ZPBFVKK/?tag=df-amzn-20\">Audio-Technica’s ATR2100×-USB</a>. It costs just $50 at Amazon. (That’s an affiliate link that will make me rich if you buy through it.) Spend an extra $4 and get <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ANI6VQ?tag=df-amzn-20\">a foam windscreen cap</a>. I mean just look at it — it literally looks like the microphone emoji: 🎤. You can just plug it into a USB-C port and it sounds great. No need for an XLR interface, but it does support XLR if you ever have the need.</p>\n\n<p>My main podcasting microphone <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2015/09/15/marco-arment-mics\">remains</a> the $260 <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002BACBO/?tag=df-amzn-20\">Shure BETA 87A Supercardioid Condenser</a>, which I connect to a $180 <a href=\"https://amzn.to/44dMKxC\">SSL 2 audio interface</a>. But that stays in my podcast cave in the basement. I keep the ATR2100× in my carry-on suitcase, so it’s with me whenever I’m away from home. My <a href=\"https://dithering.fm/\">Dithering</a> co-host Ben Thompson uses the same ATR2100× when he’s away from home, too. It’s a great simple mic and a fantastic value at just $50.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/19/atr2100x-usb-microphone\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"fbea5b50e4a694004ee0c0d5939a4600f1d4556e9bf5b7c922cd754848eaf8da","category":"Tech"}
