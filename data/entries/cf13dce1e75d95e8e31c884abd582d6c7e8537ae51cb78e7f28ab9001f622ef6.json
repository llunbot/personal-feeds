Those who survive are often left with severe neurological outcomes, including blindness, paralysis, loss of coordination, seizures, cognitive impairments, and brain atrophy.</p>\n<p>The parasitic roundworm behind the infection, called <em>Baylisascaris procyonis</em>, spreads via eggs in raccoons feces. Adult worms live in the intestines of the masked trash scavengers, and each female worm can produce nearly 200,000 eggs per day. Once in the environment, those eggs can remain infectious for years. They can survive drying out as well as most chemical treatments and disinfectants, including bleach.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051594#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051594&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cf13dce1e75d95e8e31c884abd582d6c7e8537ae51cb78e7f28ab9001f622ef6","category":"Tech"}
