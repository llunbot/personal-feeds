Well, this <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Lamicall-Car-Headrest-Tablet-Holder/dp/B0BRRPP5KH/r?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">$18 car headrest tablet holder from Lamicall</a> will solve all problems since no one will be technically holding the tablet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Usually available for $25, this tablet holder can be set in three different positions thanks to the extendable arm. Twisting the arm at different angles makes it easy to change the view distance or to place the tablet between seats so everyone can watch. Since it has a 360-degree rotating ball, you can find the best view angle in a jiffy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tablet holder will fit just about any model, from tiny 4.7-inch models to 11-inch models, including the iPad, iPad Mini, iPad Air, or smaller iPad Pro. While we haven’t tested this particular model ourselves, we don’t hesitate to recommend adding it to your cart. The product has 4.5/5 stars on Amazon out of over 4.5K reviews with customers enjoying the ease of installation and mobility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So go ahead and save yourself the regret of leaving on vacation by making all your little ones happy with some screen time thanks to the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Lamicall-Car-Headrest-Tablet-Holder/dp/B0BRRPP5KH/r?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Lamicall car headrest tablet holder for just $18</a>.</p>\n\n\n<span>Snatch the Lamicall car tablet holder for $18</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Lamicall-Car-Headrest-Tablet-Holder/dp/B0BRRPP5KH/r?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">View deal at Amazon</a></div>\nTablet Accessories</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"1c5a42095af79396bd412ee7e1ff293159e1202e73d7438f8d3869947c8f98c7","category":"Apple"}
