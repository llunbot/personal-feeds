Since then, he has rebranded the platform as X, and banking regulators in eight US states have approved his applications for money-transmitting licenses.</p>\n<p>Now, as X continues filing for money-transmitting licenses—<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/03/fast-moving-musk-makes-very-slow-progress-turning-twitter-into-everything-app/\">in pursuit of turning X into an \"everything app,\"</a> a one-stop destination where users bank, shop, communicate, and basically spend all their time online—US banking regulators are being urged to reconsider approving X's applications to provide financial services, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/08/twitter-saudi-arabia-human-rights-abuses\">The Guardian reported</a>.

They alleged that X is unfit for banking due to its alleged treatment of users’ personal data and \"intentional complicity\" in human rights violations. These grievances, The Guardian reported, also call into question whether X \"can be trusted to abide by federal and state laws protecting consumer data and records.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1966584#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1966584&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d4297b416ec0e9aceee3ccb87df3e1a68d17edcd5a57c6b9adaaa520a0ce38b3","category":"Tech"}
