We understand that your initial purchase attempt with Apple Card was declined and you didn’t earn 3% Daily Cash. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWe apologize for the inconvenience you experienced and want to make it up to you. We are providing you a credit for the Daily Cash on the initial payment of your iPhone 13. You’ll see this appear as a Balance Adjustment in the Wallet app. This will also appear on your October monthly statement. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIf you would like to continue earning Daily Cash back on future iPhone payments with your Apple Card, please visit citizensoneloan.com to update your payment method.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIf you have any questions, contact an Apple Card Specialist.</blockquote>The 3% Daily Cash credits are already going through, with users <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zmknox/status/1445510027129671680\">able to check the Wallet app</a> to confirm their credit has been received.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/\">Apple Card</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/05/apple-card-daily-cash-iphone-13-credit/\">Apple Crediting 3% Daily Cash to Apple Card Users Who Experienced Issues With iPhone 13 Purchases</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-crediting-3-daily-cash-to-apple-card-users-who-experienced-issues-with-iphone-13-purchases.2315566/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=oCW8LYVgLLY:0dubOMo5s4I:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=oCW8LYVgLLY:0dubOMo5s4I:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/oCW8LYVgLLY\" />","author":"Eric Slivka","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"67fd6e3aac1c20b7ab5e59d76be8ef92065bf4a9b0f6a5604de466007e243a2b","category":"Apple"}
