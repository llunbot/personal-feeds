Seriously though, many gravel &amp; adventure racers have been using various hydration packs and vests for the last few years, but Apidura was confident that they could do it better than adapting running or MTB packs. And they figured they could do it more comfortably too, especially important for the longest, most-grueling gravel adventure races.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/19080512/Apidura-Racing-Hydration-Vest-lightweight-adventure-race-pack-backpack_bikepacking.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/19080512/Apidura-Racing-Hydration-Vest-lightweight-adventure-race-pack-backpack_bikepacking.jpg\" alt=\"Apidura Racing Hydration Vest lightweight adventure race pack backpack,&nbsp;bikepacking\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/19080512/Apidura-Racing-Hydration-Vest-lightweight-adventure-race-pack-backpack_bikepacking.jpg 2000w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/19080512/Apidura-Racing-Hydration-Vest-lightweight-adventure-race-pack-backpack_bikepacking-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/19080512/Apidura-Racing-Hydration-Vest-lightweight-adventure-race-pack-backpack_bikepacking-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/19080512/Apidura-Racing-Hydration-Vest-lightweight-adventure-race-pack-backpack_bikepacking-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/19080512/Apidura-Racing-Hydration-Vest-lightweight-adventure-race-pack-backpack_bikepacking-768x576.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/19080512/Apidura-Racing-Hydration-Vest-lightweight-adventure-race-pack-backpack_bikepacking-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\"></a></p><p>Designed for cyclists taking on long gravel races like Unbound, or ultra-long gravel+ races like Badlands or the Atlas Mountain Race, the Apidura Racing Hydration Vest hopes to be “the most comfortable hydration vest possible for the widest range of riders possible”. It’s been in development for two years at this point, pulling details from several Apidura bikepacking bags, their current backpacks, and then reimagining several new details. The result is a form-fitting vest with lots of versatile storage options on the front straps, a 2L hydration bladder out back, and “absolutely no chafing or restricted movement even after a really long day in the saddle”.</p><h3>Tech details</h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/19080516/Apidura-Racing-Hydration-Vest-lightweight-adventure-race-pack-backpack_all-angles.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/19080516/Apidura-Racing-Hydration-Vest-lightweight-adventure-race-pack-backpack_all-angles.jpg\" alt=\"Apidura Racing Hydration Vest lightweight adventure race pack backpack,&nbsp;side views\" width=\"2000\" height=\"833\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/19080516/Apidura-Racing-Hydration-Vest-lightweight-adventure-race-pack-backpack_all-angles.jpg 2000w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/19080516/Apidura-Racing-Hydration-Vest-lightweight-adventure-race-pack-backpack_all-angles-297x124.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/19080516/Apidura-Racing-Hydration-Vest-lightweight-adventure-race-pack-backpack_all-angles-800x333.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/19080516/Apidura-Racing-Hydration-Vest-lightweight-adventure-race-pack-backpack_all-angles-120x50.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/19080516/Apidura-Racing-Hydration-Vest-lightweight-adventure-race-pack-backpack_all-angles-768x320.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/19080516/Apidura-Racing-Hydration-Vest-lightweight-adventure-race-pack-backpack_all-angles-1536x640.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\"></a></p><p>The Apidura Racing Hydration Vest comes in two sizes – S/M offers 3.5L of total storage and L/XL has 5L of total storage, combining front &amp; rear pockets.
