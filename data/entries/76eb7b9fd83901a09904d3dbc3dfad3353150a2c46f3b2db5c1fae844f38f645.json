The leaker added that a Touch ID sensor is included on the side of the device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDigital Chat Station has made accurate claims in the past. For example, in 2023 they revealed that the ‌iPhone 15‌ and ‌iPhone 15‌ Plus would feature a slightly <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/27/iphone-15-still-to-have-smaller-sensor-than-pros/\">smaller 48-megapixel sensor</a> than the ‌iPhone 15‌ Pro and ‌iPhone 15‌ Pro Max, as well as the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/27/5-4-inch-iphone-12-display-images/\">display panel design</a> of the ‌iPhone‌ 12 back in 2020. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe leaker's latest claim corroborates a previous rumor from the Korean news aggregator yeux1122, who said in April that Apple had opted for a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/16/iphone-fold-camera-setup-outer-display/\">hole-punch front-facing camera</a> on the outer display. The Naver blog account claimed that the design is almost identical to current foldables on the market, such as Google's Pixel 9 Pro Fold.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt remains unclear whether the hole-punch will be visible during active use or encased in a smaller Dynamic Island, but Face ID is not expected to be part of the equation. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nExpected to launch next year, Apple's book-style foldable is rumored to feature a 7.8-inch crease-free internal display and a 5.5-inch external screen. According to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/kuo-apple-foldable-iphone-book-style-2000/\">industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, the device will include a dual-lens rear camera along with front-facing cameras usable in both folded and unfolded states, ensuring comprehensive camera functionality in any configuration.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKuo has also said that Apple has <a href=\"https://mingchikuo.craft.me/84AOn3Ll8Zah6f\">integrated Touch ID into the side button</a>, in order to conserve internal space for other components. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nKuo says final hardware specifications will be locked in during the second quarter of this year (April 1 - June 30), suggesting some elements are still subject to change. However, analyst Jeff Pu claims that the device has already entered the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/16/apple-foldables-mass-production-2026/\">New Product Introduction (NPI) phase</a> at Foxconn – a critical stage in Apple's product development cycle – indicating that key specs may already be finalized.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMass production is reportedly scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2026, with a release expected late next year. The first-generation foldable iPhone is expected to carry a price tag between <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/24/foldable-iphone-to-launch-next-year/\">$2,000</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/15/foldable-iphone-to-cost-1000-more-than-pro-max/\">$2,300</a>. <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digital-chat-station/\">Digital Chat Station</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/\">Foldable iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/15/foldable-iphone-outer-display-hole-punch-camera/\">Foldable iPhone Outer Display Said to Feature Hole-Punch Camera</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/foldable-iphone-outer-display-said-to-feature-hole-punch-camera.2457119/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"76eb7b9fd83901a09904d3dbc3dfad3353150a2c46f3b2db5c1fae844f38f645","category":"Apple"}
