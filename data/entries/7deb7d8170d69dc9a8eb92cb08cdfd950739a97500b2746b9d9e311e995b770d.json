And yes, trying to follow what’s going on in the Madison is about as easy as trying to follow your favourite fish during a feeding frenzy. And yes, the whole thing takes place in a nondescript building in a particularly charmless bit of a fairly drab city.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for all that, the Ghent Six is still a must-see.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/gear-of-the-year-2023-bikes\">Cyclist’s Gear of the Year 2023: Bikes</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/gordy-bike-whisperer\">Meet Gordy, the Bike Whisperer</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/opinion-cycling-body-image\">Opinion: Cycling still has a body image problem</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>It’s all about the party. The Belgians love a beer, which is why we love the Belgians, and why the centre of the ’t Kuipke on a Saturday in November resembles a particularly thumping nightclub with a bicycle race going on around the outside. Sometimes there are more people watching the impromptu competition to see who can jump over the highest stack of beer glasses than there are watching the track racing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not the respectful attention of the crowd at a tennis tournament, or the chest-thumping tribalism of fans at a football match. This is sport spectating as a joyous, raucous celebration, where who wins is not as important as how much you cheer yourself hoarse over the course of an evening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also explains how a six-day event managed to sell out, packing in 6,000 people a night. It’s something we could do with a bit more of in this country. At a time when the cycling industry is still suffering from a post-Covid hangover, and races such as the Tour of Britain are under threat, we could do with a big, blousy, boisterous, British cycling bash to give us all a lift.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All we need is a velodrome, a sound system, a copy of ‘Livin’ on a Prayer’, and enough enthusiasm to turn it into a must-visit national event. Turn to p72 of the February 2024 issue of <em>Cyclist </em>to see how it’s done.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://store.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"343\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-970x343.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-970x343.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-300x106.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-768x271.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-1536x543.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-2048x724.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-750x265.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-1140x403.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>What’s in issue 148?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Red rock rollin’:</strong> In the east of the Utah desert, nestled among ancient sandstone canyons, is Moab, once a small mining town populated by prospectors and cowboys, today a cycling mecca like no place on Earth</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>AVV:</strong> After retiring from her stellar racing career, Annemiek van Vleuten tells <em>Cyclist </em>about her warrior mindset, her impact on women’s cycling and what she plans to do next</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Six days of Ghent – a party with a race: </strong>Track racing may not be your thing, but the Six Days of Ghent is an event that every cycling fan should experience at least once.
