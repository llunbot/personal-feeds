{"title":"The Cleveland Guardians vs. The Cleveland Guardians","link":"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/roller-derby-team-ups-heat-in-cleveland-guardians-trademark-fight","date":1636068210000,"content":"\n<p>Remember a few months back when <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/07/23/cleveland-team-name\">the Cleveland Indians announced their new name for next season</a>? Well, it turns out, there’s an existing Cleveland Guardians — a roller derby team — and they still haven’t worked out a deal. Here’s Kyle Jahner, reporting last week for Bloomberg Law:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The baseball team allegedly reached out to the roller derby team\nin June, more than a month before its announcement of the\nGuardians re-brand, according to the complaint. The derby team\nasked the team to make an offer, and the team offered “likely no\nmore than fifteen minutes of annual team revenue,” according to\nthe lawsuit.</p>\n\n<p>The lawsuit estimated $290 million annual revenue for the Indians,\nimplying an offer of about $8,300. The derby team alleged that it\nrejected that offer and countered, but the baseball team didn’t\nrespond.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This, of course, follows upon <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/11/03/meta-company\">Facebook’s potential legal problems</a> with existing companies named “Meta”. Why cheap out with a lowball offer? It makes no sense. It’s certainly possible that the roller derby team’s lawyer is being hyperbolic regarding “likely no more than 15 minutes of annual team revenue”, but whatever the baseball team’s offer, they could have made both sides happy by now. And if the offer really was in the ballpark of $8,300 — sheesh. That’s just stupid.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/11/04/cleveland-guardians-vs-cleveland-guardians\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"85f1acbd24bbaf72d1c2dbc190b3a3187b0a83ea544637c984a62963d83905ee","category":"Tech"}
