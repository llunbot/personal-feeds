As with road bike wheels, aerodynamics are increasingly important for gravel bike wheels, although rim depths are usually shallower. The aerodynamics are usually tuned for lower riding speeds too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best gravel bike wheels are invariably tubeless-ready and designed for disc brakes. They’ll usually have a freehub with fast engagement too, so that there’s no lag in power transfer once you start to pedal. Many gravel bike wheelsets are equally at home on the road and there’s a growing sub-category of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-all-road-bikes\">all-road</a> wheels designed to cover both road and gravel use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve reviewed a fair few gravel bike wheelsets at <em>Cyclist</em>.

That means big internal width: 32mm, to be precise, dwarfing most gravel bike wheels, which stop at around 25mm. The 40mm external width is huge, wider than most MTB wheels, but the 1,496g wheelset weight is still relatively low.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with the 54mm depth, hookless beads and matching Goodyear tyres, Zipp claims this leads to a 2 watt saving at 32kmh over its most aero competitor, although at present there are only three gravel tyres that Zipp says are compatible. It claims that the real gains come from the very low tyre pressure that can be run and hence enhanced roll-over. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s something we experienced in our testing, when we found that the wheels allowed fast progress on hardpack gravel, although we felt the ride on tarmac was a little slow. Plus, although the flat sidewalls have aero benefits, this along with the low tyre pressure exposes them to damage from rocks, as we discovered.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/zipp-303-xplr-sw-wheels-review\">Zipp 303 XPLR SW wheelset review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Gravel bike wheels: what to look for</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"728\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/08/03065643/hunt-35-gravel-wheels-4-728x970.jpg\" alt=\"hunt-35-gravel-wheels-4\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Gravel wheels share many of their features with the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-road-bike-wheels\">best road bike wheels</a>. We’ll not discuss tubeless-readiness and Centerlock disc rotor compatibility, which are both givens, but here’s what to look for when choosing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Rim width</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Wide gravel bike tyres call for <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/road-gravel-bike-rim-width\">wider rims</a> to ensure good support and help avoid squirm. 25mm internal rim width is pretty much the starting point for gravel wheels, which according to ETRTO allows you to fit tyres between 28mm and 50mm in width. Some rims go considerably wider, although as we found with the 32mm internal rim Zipp 303 XPLR SW this isn’t without issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many road rims are now approaching 25mm width too, so they’re an option for gravel use. Syncros, for example, recommends the 1,170g, £4,000 <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/syncros-capital-sl-40-wheels-review\">Capital SL 40 wheelset</a> for gravel riding – if you dare.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Rim depth</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most rims designed for gravel riding are a little shallower than those designed for road use, with 35mm being typical, as against 40 to 50mm for all-rounder road bike wheels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rise of gravel racing and the increasing speeds at the front of gravel races mean that there are deeper profile gravel wheels available, such as the DT Swiss GRC 50mm, above, and the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/hunt-40-limitless-gravel-aero\">Hunt 40 Limitless Gravel Aero</a>. But while shallower section wheels are likely to be more compliant over rough ground, brands need to be careful to ensure that deeper section gravel wheels aren’t too rigid for a comfortable ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Rim bead shape</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For road wheels, the discussion of the merits of rims with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/hookless-rims\">hookless beads</a> continues; the same is true to some extent with gravel wheels. Hooked versus hookless may be less of an issue for gravel wheels though, as the tyre is wider and run at significantly lower pressure, more akin to MTB tyres, where hookless has been a feature for some time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This can lead to problems with burping rather than the tyre coming off the rim completely though. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many brands offer hookless gravel bike rims, but others such as Campagnolo continue to use a hooked rim profile. DT Swiss has reverted from hookless to hooked beads, as it believes that hooked rims are intrinsically safer. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Wheel size</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravel bikes are increasingly designed for 700c wheels and specced with them, with the smaller 650b wheel size going somewhat out of favour. That’s due in no small measure to the increased 700c tyre clearance offered by modern gravel bikes, with 50mm now typical.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may be able to fit 650b wheels with wider gravel tyres to your bike, but the choice of newer wheelsets is now fairly limited.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Aerodynamics</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned above, gravel race speeds have increased to the point where aerodynamics are significant, so gravel bike wheels are now often aero tested as part of the design process. Often that’s at lower wind speeds than road bike wheels, with 35km/h being typical, as against 45km/h or more for road wheels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lower test speeds result in fewer watts in claimed savings, but they’re still potentially significant if you plan to race on gravel or just want a wheelset that feels faster once you hit tarmacked roads. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The wider profile of gravel tyres and lugged tread make aerodynamics more tricky too, so unless you run the same tyre in the same width as was tested and for which the wheel profile was designed, you may not achieve the claimed aero benefits. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Maintenance</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The rougher, dirtier environment off-road means that gravel wheels are more likely to need maintenance than road bike wheels, although this is no more of an issue than with MTB wheels. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Often, manufacturers will prefer spokes with external nipples for gravel wheels and brass may be chosen over alloy, despite the slight increase in weight, as brass nipples are less prone to freeze. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some wheel makers may choose J-bend spokes over straight-pull, as they can be easier to source if you break one. As a bonus, they may increase a wheel’s compliance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Hubs and freehubs</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Although cartridge bearings may be chosen, there are a fair few wheelsets in our selection above with cup and cone bearings, which can be serviced more easily. Brands typically ensure good weatherproofing in gravel wheel hubs, often with multiple seals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-is-a-freehub\">Freehubs</a> may be designed with a larger number of points of engagement, to ensure quick pick-up when riding over tricky ground. Ratchet freehubs are often specced for their larger contact area than that offered by pawl freehubs and their perceived ability to handle higher loads.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-gravel-bike-wheelsets\">Best gravel bike wheels 2025</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Pnorman","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"626c8f40c46f7914ffa60a3b2397c96acd855b2d340f2518046a72b08cf316a2","category":"Cycling"}
