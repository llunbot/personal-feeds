In fact, the more compact &amp; more efficient motor also adds an 8% torque boost, now topping out at 65Nm.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/11084628/2022-BH-Core-Carbon-smooth-power-integrated-e-bikes_gravel-road-e-bike_new-BH-2EXMAG-motor.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/11084628/2022-BH-Core-Carbon-smooth-power-integrated-e-bikes_gravel-road-e-bike_new-BH-2EXMAG-motor.jpg\" alt=\"2022 BH Core Carbon smooth power integrated e-bikes, gravel road new BH 2EXMAG e-bike motor\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/11084628/2022-BH-Core-Carbon-smooth-power-integrated-e-bikes_gravel-road-e-bike_new-BH-2EXMAG-motor.jpg 2000w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/11084628/2022-BH-Core-Carbon-smooth-power-integrated-e-bikes_gravel-road-e-bike_new-BH-2EXMAG-motor-297x178.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/11084628/2022-BH-Core-Carbon-smooth-power-integrated-e-bikes_gravel-road-e-bike_new-BH-2EXMAG-motor-800x480.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/11084628/2022-BH-Core-Carbon-smooth-power-integrated-e-bikes_gravel-road-e-bike_new-BH-2EXMAG-motor-120x72.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/11084628/2022-BH-Core-Carbon-smooth-power-integrated-e-bikes_gravel-road-e-bike_new-BH-2EXMAG-motor-768x461.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/11084628/2022-BH-Core-Carbon-smooth-power-integrated-e-bikes_gravel-road-e-bike_new-BH-2EXMAG-motor-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\"></a></p><p>The new motor adds external heat sinks to improve stable performance under load, and gets an upgraded telemetry torque sensor that enables smoother, more gradual pedal-assist.
