Although interestingly, I haven’t seen any of the EF men racing in this helmet at the Giro. They’ve either picked the more closed and more aero <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/poc-ventral-aero-road-helmet-doesnt-sacrifice-ventilation-or-weight-for-speed/\" target=\"_blank\">Ventral</a> or the lighter weight but less feature-packed <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-poc-ultralight-ventral-lite-road-bike-helmet-is-their-lightest-ever-as-light-as-180g/\" target=\"_blank\">Ventral Lite</a>. Also curious not to see any at the Grand Tour in POC’s latest <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/poc-procen-air-mini-aero-road-helmet-makes-you-faster-but-not-full-dark-helmet-a-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Procen Air</a>.
