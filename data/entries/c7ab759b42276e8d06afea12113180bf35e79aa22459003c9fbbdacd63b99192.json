Get this M2 Pro model for $500 off","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2309913/want-the-best-16-inch-macbook-pro-deal-get-this-m2-pro-model-for-500-off.html","date":1713543131000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>The 16-inch M3 MacBook Pro may be Apple’s fastest laptop, but other than a new color and a slightly faster chip, there isn’t much to get excited about. So when we see a fantastic deal on the M2 mode, we’re going to let you know: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-Laptop-12%E2%80%91core-19%E2%80%91core/dp/B0BSHDJG9T/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Official Apple reseller Expercom (via Amazon) is selling the 16-inch M2 Pro MacBook Pro with 512GB of storage and 16GB of RAM for $1,999</a>, a savings of $500 and the lowest price we’ve ever seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to the M3 Pro model, you’re getting a slightly slower M2 Pro chip with a 12‑core CPU and 19‑core GP with this MacBook Pro—and that’s really it. Otherwise, the machines are identical, with the same excellent ProMotion display and ports as the M3 model (three Thunderbolt ports, an SD card reader, and HDMI 2.1), battery life, speakers, camera, and keyboard. The only other thing that’s new you won’t get is the new Space Black color, but we’re fond of space gray anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1480214/16-inch-macbook-pro-m2-pro-review.html\">4.5-star review</a> of the 16-inch M2 Pro MacBook Pro, we praised its performance and features and said “there isn’t a reason to wait any longer” to upgrade to Apple silicon. We also found that “your money will absolutely be well spent” even if you’re upgrading from an M1 Pro mode. And that’s at <em>full</em> price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you just want a fantastic laptop without worrying about having the newest one, go grab one and save $500 right now.</p>\n\nMac, MacBook</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"c7ab759b42276e8d06afea12113180bf35e79aa22459003c9fbbdacd63b99192","category":"Apple"}
