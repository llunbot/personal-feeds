For best results in 29er mode, the MK7 is intended to run a 3″ or 3.25″ front tire and a 2.6″ or 2.8″ on the rear, offering more of a bulldozer feel with increased ride damping from the larger tire.</p>\n<p>Check out more at <a href=\"https://stoogecycles.co.uk/product/https-stoogecycles-co-uk-product-mk6-pre-order/\" target=\"_blank\">Stooge Cycles</a> and see our Stooge coverage in our Related Archives below.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/stooge-cycles-mk7/\">Stooge Cycles MK7 Comes in Three Sizes, Bigger Tires, and Two Colors</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"f07c3419642f60c0ee33e5b70388198450a12d097ab414aba7d234c59ffe7ec7","category":"Cycling"}
