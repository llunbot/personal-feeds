While the AirTag has not received any hardware updates since then, a new version of the item tracking accessory is rumored to be in development.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/airtag-purple.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nBelow, we recap rumors about a second-generation AirTag.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Timing</h2>\r<br />\nApple is aiming to release a new AirTag in mid-2025, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFrom his <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-11-17/how-will-president-donald-trump-s-new-tariffs-affect-apple-products-and-prices-m3lnfx64\"><em>Power On</em> newsletter</a> today:<blockquote>In May, I reported that Apple is working on a new AirTag — code-named B589 — for release around the middle of next year. That accessory has now progressed in manufacturing tests, and Apple is getting ready to bring it to market.</blockquote>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn October 2023, Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said mass production of the second-generation AirTag had been postponed from the fourth quarter of 2024 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/18/airtag-2-postponed-until-2025/\">until some point in 2025</a>, but he did not provide a reason for the apparent change in plans. Kuo and Gurman are thus in agreement that a new AirTag is coming next year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Features</h2>\r<br />\nIn his newsletter today, Gurman reiterated that the new AirTag will feature an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/19/airtag-with-new-chip-due-next-year/\">upgraded chip with improved location tracking</a>. If so, the AirTag could be updated with the second-generation Ultra Wideband chip that debuted in all iPhone 15 models last year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman also believes the new AirTag's built-in speaker will be more difficult to remove, as an anti-stalking measure. Overall, though, he expects the new AirTag to look similar to the current model, so do not expect major design changes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLast, he said the new AirTag will feature \"better range,\" which could allow the Precision Finding feature to work at farther distances. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nKuo previously said the new AirTag will have some kind of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/02/kuo-new-airtag-production-late-2024/\">integration with Apple's Vision Pro headset</a>, but he did not share any specific details.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airtag/\">AirTag</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/17/airtag-2-mid-2025-rumor/\">New AirTag Rumored to Launch in Mid-2025 With These Features</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-airtag-rumored-to-launch-in-mid-2025-with-these-features.2443233/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1e0b1be2dcbe86eb3d8d87fbf7246e8d3570f21ec07f4b5c0770b3e88cedf02c","category":"Apple"}
