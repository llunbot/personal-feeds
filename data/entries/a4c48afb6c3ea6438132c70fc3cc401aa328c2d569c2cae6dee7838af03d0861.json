Battery-powered mice, trackpads, and keyboards can function for several weeks to many months on a single full charge over USB or with rechargeable batteries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Apple doesn’t display this charge in an obvious place, as it does with a laptop’s battery level since you don’t need to be quite as worried about as you do having your mobile computer suddenly run out of juice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can find the current charge of most peripherals in one or more places when a wireless device is turned on and awake. On some equipment, that means moving your finger on it, moving it around, or tapping a key. Here’s where to look:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Open the <em>Control Center</em> in macOS Catalina or later and click <em>Bluetooth</em>. Any connected devices show their current charge level as a graphic and with a numeric percentage. This also shows charges for connected headphones and earbuds.</li><li>Open the <em>Bluetooth</em> preference pane in any version of macOS. All connected Bluetooth devices show their charge, but only as a graphic.</li><li>Open the <em>Keyboard</em>, <em>Mouse</em>, or <em>Trackpad</em> preference panes to see the battery graphic and numeric percentage of active peripherals of those types.</li></ul><div><figure><img src=\"https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mac911-bluetooth-pref-charges.png?w=1200\" /><figcaption>The Bluetooth preference pane shows an icon representing charge for connected devices.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mac911-bluetooth-control-center-charge.png?w=707\" /><figcaption>Control Center in Catalina and later provides a visual and numeric indicator.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mac911-keyboard-charge.png?w=1200\" /><figcaption>In this trimmed Keyboard preference pane image, you can see the charge at the very bottom as an icon and text.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on your hardware, you may receive alerts when the battery level is low.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Third-party developers used to offer utilities that would show you the charge of all connected peripherals and provide more detailed notifications, but the two best known went out of development years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ask Mac 911</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve compiled a list of the questions we get asked most frequently, along with answers and links to columns: <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/3077986/os-x/your-top-questions-to-mac-911-and-some-answers.html\">read our super FAQ</a> to see if your question is covered.
