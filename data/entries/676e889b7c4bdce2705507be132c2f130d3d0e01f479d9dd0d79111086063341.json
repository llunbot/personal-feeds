The <a href=\"https://www.patrick.spaceforce.mil/Portals/14/Weather/Terran%201%20TM-1%20L-1%20Day%20Forecast%2022%20Mar%20Launch.pdf?ver=G71TEM1ZiVd_pp9akiqfXw%3d%3d\">current forecast</a> for the launch attempt is splendid, with a 95 percent chance of acceptable conditions, according to the US Space Force officials operating the range.</p>\n<p>If recent history is any guide, Wednesday's launch attempt may consume most of the three-hour window. Relativity's first attempt to launch Terran 1, on March 8, was scrubbed near the end of the window due to problems with a fuel-temperature sensor on the second stage. A second attempt three days later did not get off the ground due to an array of issues, including last-second aborts, weather concerns, and a boat in the protected area around the launch site.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1925838#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1925838&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"676e889b7c4bdce2705507be132c2f130d3d0e01f479d9dd0d79111086063341","category":"Tech"}
