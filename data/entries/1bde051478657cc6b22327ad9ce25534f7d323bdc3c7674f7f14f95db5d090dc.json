{"title":"iPhone 16 Models Can Charge at Up to 25W Using MagSafe","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/iphone-16-25w-magsafe-charging/","date":1725908122000,"content":"The new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> models that Apple introduced today support upgraded <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a> charging. With a 30W charger, the iPhones can charge at up to 25W, an improvement over the prior 15W limit. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/iphone-16-magsafe.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nFor the first time, the ‌iPhone 16‌ models support fast charging over ‌MagSafe‌. Users can expect up to a 50 percent charge in 30 minutes when using a 30W or higher adapter paired <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MX6X3LL/A/magsafe-charger-1-m\">with one of the new MagSafe Chargers</a>. Fast charging is also available with a 20W or higher adapter paired with a standard USB-C cable.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nQi2 wireless charging is supported as well, but that is limited to 15W charging, so ‌iPhone 16‌ users will get faster charging speeds with official ‌MagSafe‌ chargers. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nA 30W power adapter will need to be purchased separately, as Apple does not include power adapters with the purchase of an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> anymore. Apple does, however, include a USB-C cable. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new ‌iPhone 16‌ models will be available for pre-order starting on Friday, September 13, with a launch to follow on Friday, September 20. There are two new ‌MagSafe‌ chargers in 1-meter and 2-meter sizes. <br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/iphone-16-25w-magsafe-charging/\">iPhone 16 Models Can Charge at Up to 25W Using MagSafe</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-models-can-charge-at-up-to-25w-using-magsafe.2435490/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1bde051478657cc6b22327ad9ce25534f7d323bdc3c7674f7f14f95db5d090dc","category":"Apple"}
