After thinking long and hard about what’s already been done and hasn’t been done at Sea Otter, Paul came up with a wild proposition for a super fun bike that would be a conversation starter for sustainability and environmental thoughtfulness in bicycle manufacturing, the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/sierrarecycler/?next=/paulcomponent/\"><span>#SierraRecycler</span></a>. Sierra Nevada loved this idea, being leaders in solar power, recycling, estate farming, transportation, composting, and water reclamation in the craft beer industry.

With zero hesitation he said “Yep, and I have just the frame for it.” He took a 1949 Schwinn cruiser and chopped a bunch of the tubes apart, then bent, mitered and welded it all back together to fit a modern 29×2.6” knobby. This sounds pretty crazy, but look at the chainstay bridge, the super sick welds, and the Sierra Nevada beer can shim, and I think you’ll start picking up what we’re layin’ down with this bike. And talk about recycling, the Monē shop is built into a 1990 Wonderbread truck!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"2000\"

environmentally-minded bike brands to collaborate with us on this build, and we made a series of Instagram posts with each brand highlighting sustainability in their own way. Björn Bikes supplied recycled rubber grips, we teamed up with Velocity and White Industries on the recycled aluminum components, Jen Green made us a sweet headtube badge from leftover scrap metal, Jerry Smith re-upholstered an old B72 saddle chassis, Outershell made custom upcycled bags out of an old Sierra Nevada billboard, and all throughout we frequently discussed recycled and recyclable packaging.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Finished-Bike-at-Recycling-Center-7.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Finished-Bike-at-Recycling-Center-7.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Finished-Bike-at-Recycling-Center-7.jpg?resize=1024,819&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Finished-Bike-at-Recycling-Center-7.jpg?resize=768,614&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Finished-Bike-at-Recycling-Center-7.jpg?resize=1800,1440&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Finished-Bike-at-Recycling-Center-7.jpg?resize=1335,1068&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Finished-Bike-at-Recycling-Center-7.jpg?resize=700,560&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Finished-Bike-at-Recycling-Center-7.jpg?resize=1536,1229&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Finished-Bike-at-Recycling-Center-27.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Finished-Bike-at-Recycling-Center-27.jpg?w=1600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Finished-Bike-at-Recycling-Center-27.jpg?resize=1024,1280&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Finished-Bike-at-Recycling-Center-27.jpg?resize=768,960&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Finished-Bike-at-Recycling-Center-27.jpg?resize=1335,1669&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Finished-Bike-at-Recycling-Center-27.jpg?resize=700,875&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Finished-Bike-at-Recycling-Center-27.jpg?resize=1229,1536&amp;quality=75 1229w\" /></p>\n<p>We don’t think there are necessarily any easy or final answers when talking about sustainability and environmental thoughtfulness in the bicycle industry, but the first step is asking questions, and the second step is trying new things.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Finished-Bike-at-Recycling-Center-4.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Finished-Bike-at-Recycling-Center-4.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Finished-Bike-at-Recycling-Center-4.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Finished-Bike-at-Recycling-Center-4.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Finished-Bike-at-Recycling-Center-4.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Finished-Bike-at-Recycling-Center-4.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Finished-Bike-at-Recycling-Center-4.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/Finished-Bike-at-Recycling-Center-4.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Headed to Sea Otter this year?
