Recruits will receive a 100,000 ruble ($1,200) sign-up bonus, and a monthly frontline duty salary of 270,000 rubles, according to the report. This is far above the wages paid to most employees of Roscosmos.</p>\n<p>Among the recruitment efforts are glossy posters, showing soldiers Photoshopped next to space vehicles, and videos that aggrandize participation in the war. In one of these advertisements, the announcer states, \"State corporation Roscosmos calls on you to join the Uran volunteer battalion, where you will be trained for victory in this great war.\" The report indicates that these recruitment videos are playing in the facilities of some Roscosmos entities, where there are 170,000 employees spread across Russia.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1948767#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1948767&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a57b1c211f634941eb25f5b42f7c144df61caa24845ca2895952608d5215a17c","category":"Tech"}
