{"title":"All the iOS 15 Features You Won't Get Until Later","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-15-delayed-features/","date":1632261417000,"content":"There are multiple features that Apple wasn't able to get ready for launch prior to the debut of iOS and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-15/\">iPadOS 15</a>, which is not atypical. There are usually some iOS features that take a little more time to prepare for primetime, and Apple releases these features in iOS updates.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/iOS-15-Later-Features.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nBelow, we've rounded up <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a> additions that weren't ready when <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-15-start-guide/\">iOS 15 launched</a> and will be implemented in ‌iOS 15‌ updates coming later this year and next year.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>SharePlay</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nA <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime-ios-15/\">FaceTime feature</a>, SharePlay was available for most of the beta testing period, but it was buggy and in August, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/17/apple-delays-shareplay-facetime-launch/\">Apple confirmed</a> that it wouldn't be implemented when ‌iOS 15‌ launched.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/facetime-shareplay-tv-show.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nSharePlay is a way for users to do more on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a> calls with friends and family, offering options for watching TV together, listening to music, and screen sharing.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhen it launches, SharePlay will be available in ‌iOS 15‌‌, ‌‌iPadOS 15‌‌, ‌<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">macOS Monterey</a>‌, and tvOS 15. Right now, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/21/ios-15-1-shareplay-reenabled/\">is testing</a> SharePlay in the iOS 15.1, iPadOS 15.1, and tvOS 15.1 betas that are available to developers. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Digital Legacy</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nDigital Legacy is a feature that lets a person's friends or family members <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/08/ios-15-legacy-contacts/\">access their data</a> in the event of their death.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nUsers will be able to set a Legacy Contact and that person will be able to access their <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-id/\">Apple ID</a> and personal information like photos after death.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nRight now, if someone passes away with a locked <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, or Mac, it's often difficult if not impossible to get access to the device, which Digital Legacy will address.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nDigital Legacy was never active in the beta and it is not yet clear when it might be ready for launch.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Keys and IDs in Wallet</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nHomeKit-enabled locks will be able to be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-15-wallet/\">stored in the Wallet app</a> going forward, so you can unlock your front door without having to download a third-party app from an accessory manufacturer. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/\">HomeKit</a> accessory makers need to implement this feature and Apple says it will roll out after the launch of ‌iOS 15‌.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/apple-wallet-drivers-license-feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nSimilarly, digital IDs and driver's licenses will be able to be stored in the Wallet app. The first states to support the feature will include Arizona and Georgia, with Connecticut, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Oklahoma, and Utah to follow.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAn exact timeline for the rollout is unknown at this time, but Apple is also working with the TSA to allow digital IDs to be accepted at some airports.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple needs to establish deals with each state, so it may be some time before digital IDs are available to all ‌iPhone‌ users in the United States.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>App Privacy Report</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nThe App Privacy Report, which Apple plans to roll out in full later this year, will let you know which apps are using the privacy permissions that have been granted to them, like access to the camera, microphone, and location.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/01/ios15-app-privacy-report.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe App Privacy Report is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-15-privacy/\">partially implemented</a> through a \"Record App Activity\" setting that can be toggled on to record a 7-day summary of app activity, but the full implementation is listed as coming soon.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/record-app-activity-ios-15.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nRight now, you can download a JSON file with data on how apps are accessing your data, but eventually, Apple will use this data to generate a full, easy-to-read App Privacy Report.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Siri-Enabled Accessories</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nApple is allowing ‌HomeKit‌ accessory makers to integrate <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> functionality into their devices in ‌iOS 15‌, but it will take time for device manufacturers to implement this functionality and it won't be available at launch.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/siri-glow.png\" />\r\n<br />\r\n‌Siri‌ integration will allow any compatible ‌HomeKit‌ device in the home to send messages, set reminders, contact family members, control devices, and more.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nNote that using ‌Siri‌ through a third-party device will require a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a> that can be used to route requests.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Universal Control</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nAn ‌iPadOS 15‌ and ‌macOS Monterey‌ feature, Universal Control will allow a single input device like a mouse or a keyboard to be used to control multiple Macs or iPads at the same time.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/universal-control-wwdc.jpeg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nUniversal Control was never implemented during the beta testing process and it is not available with the launch of ‌iPadOS 15‌, with Apple saying it will come later in the fall. Because ‌macOS Monterey‌ isn't coming until later in the year, it's quite possible that the launch of ‌macOS Monterey‌ will also see the launch of Universal Control.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Find My Network Support for AirPods</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nShortly before the launch of ‌iOS 15‌, Apple updated its ‌iOS 15‌ features page to note that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my-network-accessory-program/\">Find My</a> feature for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a> will not be launching until later this fall. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/Find-My-AirPods-Feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n‌Find My‌ support for ‌AirPods‌ is designed <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/19/find-my-network-airpods-coming-later-this-fall/\">to work with</a> the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/\">AirPods Max</a>, taking advantage of the ‌Find My‌ network to locate them should they become lost. <div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-15/\">iPadOS 15</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-15.233\">iOS 15</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-15-delayed-features/\">All the iOS 15 Features You Won't Get Until Later</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/all-the-ios-15-features-you-wont-get-until-later.2312468/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ZPPHrb4yZs4:0cvOtqVcvWY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=ZPPHrb4yZs4:0cvOtqVcvWY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/ZPPHrb4yZs4\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"475babbd7f9d61a37304ac569e1b9667ba7119f53b21114501ea7329b3a3cbe8","category":"Apple"}
