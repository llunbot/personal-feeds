Cost often ranges from $10,000 to $45,000 per mile, which includes everything from permitting and impact studies to tools, materials, and labor. But Shimano believes the return on investment is priceless. Supporting trail building and trail advocacy helps protect and expand trail access. And that means more places for all of us to ride—and more opportunities for new riders, like kids, to discover this amazing sport.<span> </span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/SLorencePhoto_trailbuilder_121.jpg?fit=1200,1067&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/SLorencePhoto_trailbuilder_121.jpg?w=1600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/SLorencePhoto_trailbuilder_121.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/SLorencePhoto_trailbuilder_121.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/SLorencePhoto_trailbuilder_121.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/SLorencePhoto_trailbuilder_128.jpg?fit=1200,1067&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/SLorencePhoto_trailbuilder_128.jpg?w=1600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/SLorencePhoto_trailbuilder_128.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/SLorencePhoto_trailbuilder_128.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/SLorencePhoto_trailbuilder_128.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>The Trail Born Fund will first focus on select areas in North America, Europe and Oceania and will further expand across these regions through 2025. By 2026, Trail Born aims to effect change across the mountain bike riding world, with the addition of Asia, Africa, and Central and South America. In all cases, support will be earmarked for legal and sustainable trails, and funds will be allocated only after a thorough review of the advocacy organizations and proposed projects.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/SLorencePhoto_trailbuilder_203.jpg?fit=1200,1067&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/SLorencePhoto_trailbuilder_203.jpg?w=1600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/SLorencePhoto_trailbuilder_203.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/SLorencePhoto_trailbuilder_203.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/07/SLorencePhoto_trailbuilder_203.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Shimano will also help promote these chosen projects, telling the stories of the people and places behind these critical efforts.
