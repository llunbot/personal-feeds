Chain Reaction Cycles Limited acts as a management company, so Wiggle Limited includes the front-facing Chain Reaction business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s worth stating that Wiggle and Chain Reaction Cycles will continue to trade during this period, as they’ll need to get rid of stock and raise funds, but if you’re worried about buying from them you can pay through a service like PayPal, which will cover you if you pay but don’t receive your order.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read the full story on <a href=\"https://www.cyclingelectric.com/news/wiggle-appoints-administrator\" target=\"_blank\">cyclingelectric.com</a></p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/wiggle-black-friday-clearance-sales\">Wiggle starts Black Friday a month early: Here are the best deals</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/wiggle-crc-self-administration\">Wiggle begins self-administration, Cycling Electric reports</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/wiggle-limited-administration\">Wiggle Limited has officially gone into administration</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Will Strickson &#124; Deputy Website Editor","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"1f0de6cd1dccef4f49891d2995152eb5218b125683ce9c2dc0f41374b244d342","category":"Cycling"}
