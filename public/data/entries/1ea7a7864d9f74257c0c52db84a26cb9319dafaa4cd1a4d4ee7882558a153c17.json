Now it is looking to make up for it by focusing on OLED panel production for the low-cost iPhone SE 4. The volume of OLED panels for the iPhone SE 4 is estimated to be around 20 million next year. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nRather than applying new specifications, the iPhone SE 4 is expected to use OLED inventory originally put in place for 2021's iPhone 13 or 2022's iPhone 14. \"It makes sense for Apple to optimize by leveraging component inventory, as it is an entry-level product,\" adds the machine language-translated Korean report.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has restarted development of a fourth-generation iPhone SE with a 6.1-inch OLED display and an Apple-designed 5G chip, according to the information shared by reputable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/27/kuo-iphone-se-4-oled-display/\">last month</a>. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nKuo said the new iPhone SE will be similar to the standard iPhone 14, which features a 6.1-inch OLED display with thinner bezels. The current iPhone SE is equipped with a 4.7-inch LCD display with thicker bezels.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFollowing the report on Kuo, reputable display analyst Ross Young <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DSCCRoss/status/1630266195751620608\">said</a> he had heard that the iPhone SE 4 will use an OLED panel from BOE, and today's report corroborates this information.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/boe/\">BOE</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theelec-kr/\">The Elec</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE\">iPhone SE (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/06/iphone-se-4-oled-panel-supplier-boe/\">6.1-Inch iPhone SE 4 OLED Panel to Be Supplied by China's BOE</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/6-1-inch-iphone-se-4-oled-panel-to-be-supplied-by-chinas-boe.2382891/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1ea7a7864d9f74257c0c52db84a26cb9319dafaa4cd1a4d4ee7882558a153c17","category":"Apple"}
