Even people in tech circles have told me they can't find a quality mechanical keyboard for a decent price. Is $28 decent enough for you?</p>\n<p>That's how much the Keychron C3 Pro is going for <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3s4XO1j\" target=\"_blank\">on Amazon</a> right now. It's a sale price that could change, but the keyboard was still only $35 when it <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/the-most-interesting-keyboard-released-this-week-is-also-the-cheapest/\">released in September</a>. Since September 21, I've been using the budget clacker as my primary keyboard, and it has kept up with my busy workload—writing about 17 articles for Ars Technica and more emails than I care to recount. Expensive mechanical keyboards often come with all sorts of perks worth obsessing over, but the C3 Pro proves that sometimes, cheap is good enough. Mechanical keyboards don't <em>have</em> to be a luxury peripheral.</p>\n<h2>Meet the C3 Pro</h2>\n  <ul>\n          <li>\n        <div>\n          <div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/listing-1-980x464.jpg\" /></div>\n          <p>\n            The C3 Pro is Keychron's lowest-priced mechanical keyboard.                          [credit:\n                              Scharon Harding                            ]\n                      </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul>\n\n<p>Keychron's C3 Pro is a tenkeyless (TKL) mechanical keyboard, so there's no numpad. If you can get past that, you're left with an affordable keyboard offering a typing experience that's superior to any membrane or mechanical keyboard in this price range.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1974725#p3\">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1974725&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ce42f4278940217beee8c6abf9b9cc809f3be83b98c63af500b8c201cd730bd2","category":"Tech"}
