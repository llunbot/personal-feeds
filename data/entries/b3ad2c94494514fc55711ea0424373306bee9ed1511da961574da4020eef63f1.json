But they do expose patients to ionizing radiation at levels linked to higher risks of cancer. In <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2832778\">a new study in JAMA Internal Medicine</a>, researchers tried to estimate what those higher risks are exactly—and although the estimates come with uncertainty, they may seem startling.</p>\n<p>Based on data from 93 million CT scans performed on 62 million people in 2023, the researchers estimated that the CT scans would lead to 103,000 future cancers. To put that in context, those 103,000 cancers would account for about 5 percent of cancers diagnosed each year, based on the current cancer rates and the current usage of CT scans. And the estimate puts CT scans on par with alcohol consumption and obesity in terms of risk factors for developing cancer.</p>\n<p>The most common types of cancers estimated to be a result of CT scans were lung cancer and colon cancer—two cancers that are becoming more common in younger people for reasons experts do not fully understand. The types of CT scans linked to the greatest number of cancers were abdomen and pelvis CT scans.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/04/ct-scans-could-cause-5-of-cancers-study-finds-experts-note-uncertainty/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/04/ct-scans-could-cause-5-of-cancers-study-finds-experts-note-uncertainty/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b3ad2c94494514fc55711ea0424373306bee9ed1511da961574da4020eef63f1","category":"Tech"}
