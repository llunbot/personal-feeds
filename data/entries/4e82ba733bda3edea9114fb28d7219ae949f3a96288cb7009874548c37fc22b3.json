{"title":"It’s $40 for a lifetime license to Microsoft Office for Macs","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2543132/its-40-for-a-lifetime-license-to-microsoft-office-for-macs.html","date":1733731200000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you seen how expensive it is just to have a basic Microsoft 365 subscription? If you’re not using every single part of it, then there’s no reason not to jump on a cheaper alternative like this <a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/microsoft-office-home-business-2019-for-mac-4?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=microsoft-office-home-business-2019-for-mac-4&amp;utm_term=scsf-610030&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000002gSGaIAM&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Office lifetime license</a>. There aren’t any recurring fees, and it’s only $39.99 (reg. $229). </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s included?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This suite comes with the works. That includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, and Teams Classic, all optimized for Macs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can install each of these apps on one computer one time, so choose wisely. After that, they’re yours for life, whether you need a better app for writing up a resume or run your entire professional life out of Excel like the rest of the world. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So why is it so cheap? This is the 2019 version of Office, and it doesn’t have all the bells and whistles of the most recent updates. That may actually be a good thing for people running older computers. It’s an easy trade if you’re sick of paying monthly for Microsoft 365. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have until December 22 to get a lifetime license for <a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/microsoft-office-home-business-2019-for-mac-4?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=microsoft-office-home-business-2019-for-mac-4&amp;utm_term=scsf-610030&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000002gSGaIAM&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Office Home and Business for Mac</a> for $39.99. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/microsoft-office-home-business-2019-for-mac-4?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral-cta&amp;utm_campaign=microsoft-office-home-business-2019-for-mac-4&amp;utm_term=scsf-610030&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000002gSGaIAM&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\"> </a></p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://cdnp2.stackassets.com/40f054387039ab3c708076dc5292dd2d87db49a9/store/0f35fb2b19cd987521f03c94c3d38e0253e61ecf21b04f91a0caf3a91c36/sale_323537_primary_image.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Microsoft Office Home &amp; Business 2019 for Mac – $39.99</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/microsoft-office-home-business-2019-for-mac-4?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral-cta&amp;utm_campaign=microsoft-office-home-business-2019-for-mac-4&amp;utm_term=scsf-610030&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000002gSGaIAM&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\">See Deal</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.stacksocial.com\" target=\"_blank\">StackSocial</a> prices subject to change. </em></p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"4e82ba733bda3edea9114fb28d7219ae949f3a96288cb7009874548c37fc22b3","category":"Apple"}
