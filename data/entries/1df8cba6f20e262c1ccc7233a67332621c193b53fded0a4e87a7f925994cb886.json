Oregon's bill stands out for a provision that would prevent companies from requiring that official parts be unlocked with encrypted software checks before they will fully function.</p>\n<p>Bill <a href=\"https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2024R1/Measures/Overview/SB1596\">SB 1596</a> passed Oregon's House by a 42 to 13 margin. Gov. Tina Kotek has five days to sign the bill into law. Consumer groups and right-to-repair advocates praised the bill as \"the best bill yet,\" while the bill's chief sponsor, state Sen. Janeen Sollman (D), pointed to potential waste reductions and an improved second-hand market for closing a digital divide.</p>\n<p>\"Oregon improves on Right to Repair laws in California, Minnesota and New York by making sure that consumers have the choice of buying new parts, used parts, or third-party parts for the gadgets and gizmos,\" said Gay Gordon-Byrne, executive director of Repair.org, in a statement.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2007810#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2007810&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1df8cba6f20e262c1ccc7233a67332621c193b53fded0a4e87a7f925994cb886","category":"Tech"}
