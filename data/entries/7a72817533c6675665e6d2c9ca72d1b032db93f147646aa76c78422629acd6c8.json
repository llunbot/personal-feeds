So you’ll be sure to find something to fit your needs, whether that’s pumping your tyres up to 100psi quickly or getting your hands on a pump that will help you seat a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/tubeless/\">tubeless tyre</a> easily.</p>\n<p>We’ve divided this list into the best track pumps and the best mini pumps.</p>\n<p>Track pumps are ideal for home use because they will make light work of pumping up tyres. Mini pumps are suited to taking out on rides in case you have to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/how-to-fix-a-puncture-video/\">fix a puncture</a>, because they are lightweight and will fit in a pocket or frame bag.</p>\n<p>You can skip to the track pump or mini pump sections by hitting one of the following links:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#besttrackpumps\">Skip to the best track pumps</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#bestminipumps\">Skip to the best mini pumps</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you’re not sure which pump is best for you, keep reading until the end for our <a href=\"#bikepumpbuyersguide\">bike pump buyer’s guide</a>, where we take you through everything you need to know about this essential bike tool.</p>\n<h2>Best track pumps of 2023</h2>\n<h3>Lezyne Classic Over Drive</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Lezyne Classic Over Drive mountain bike pump\" title=\"Lezyne Classic Over Drive\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The hose is nice and long, which aids usability.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use:</strong> MTB</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £60/$70/AU$200</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The long, mid-volume barrel and quality metal construction help this Lezyne pump strike a great performance balance, with an easy action, smooth feel and low stroke counts. Although the gauge is at the base, it’s easy to read and accurate. The hose is long, and it’s easy to swap between valve types.</p>\n<p>It’s a shame that there’s no bleed valve for spot-on pressure adjustment and some won’t like the screw-on head, although we had no issues with the valve core working loose. Max pressure is only 60psi, which rules out use as a road pump.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/maintenance/pumps/floor-pump/lezyne-classic-over-drive-track-pump-review/\">Read our full Lezyne Classic over Drive review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>LifeLine Professional</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"track pump road bike\" title=\"Track Pumps Lifeline 02\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> LifeLine’s Professional track pump is efficient, accurate and affordable.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudery / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use:</strong> Road, MTB</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £40/$49/AU$83</li>\n</ul>\n<p>LifeLine’s professional track pump gets a 25mm <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/tyres/continental-grand-prix-4000-sii-review/\">Continental GP4000</a> tyre to 100psi in 25 strokes and was just 2psi out on our separate pressure gauge, which really doesn’t matter unless you’re very particular.</p>\n<p>The steel barrel, wooden handle, long hose and all-metal switchable chuck are very impressive for the price, and we’ve had one of these going strong for years without complaint.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Specialized AirTool Comp Floor Pump</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Specialized Airtool Comp\" title=\"Specialized Airtool Comp\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Who knew pump handles could be aero?</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use:</strong> Road, MTB</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £50/$70/€65/AU$110</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The AirTool Comp ticks all the boxes in terms of functionality, with a head that accepts all valve types and a large base featuring grip tape for use in unfavourable conditions.</p>\n<p>A wide, ‘aero’-shaped handle adds ergonomics that you didn’t know were missing from a pump (although it is on the large side for those with smaller hands).

Despite this, many pumps seem to fall short of the mark. So we’ve put together this guide to tell you about the different types of pumps and what to look for when buying one.</p>\n<h3>Types of bike pump</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pumping up a mountain bike tyre with a track pump\" title=\"Pumping up a mountain bike tyre with a track pump\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Checking tyre pressure before a ride is a habit worth getting into.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Behr / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<h4>Track pump</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Road bike tyre pressure\" title=\"Road bike tyre pressure\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Track pumps are one of the most efficient ways of inflating your tyres.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Every cyclist needs a decent track pump (also known as a floor pump), and if you’re building a home workshop it really should be one of your first purchases. This style of pump will almost always offer a long flexible hose, pressure gauge and large chamber for quick air transfer.</p>\n<h4>Hand pump</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Silca Gravelero gravel mini-pump\" title=\"Silca Gravelero gravel mini-pump\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A mini-pump is a great option when you’re out and about.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Silca</i></span></div>\n<p>While a portable hand pump (or mini pump) can be used as your only option, it really shouldn’t be your first port of call.</p>\n<p>Portable pumps are designed for emergencies or occasional use, and so are kept compact and light. With these size constraints come compromises.</p>\n<p>The main issue is that these pumps stress the valve stem, eventually leading to a leaking or useless <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-inner-tubes/\">inner tube</a>. There are pumps on the market that add a flexible hose to remove this issue, but you’re still left pumping longer than you would do with a track pump, and in many cases, not able to reach the ideal pressure.</p>\n<h4>Frame pump</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Hampsten prefers to play it safe with a full-length frame pump when out on the road.

A frame pump is designed to fit within the triangle of a bike frame. This allows the pump to be bigger, which often means a more effective hand pump.

A higher-pressure pump is often a trade-off for volume output, or at least gauge accuracy. Because of this, brands such as Lezyne offer pump models specific to road or mountain biking.</p>\n<h4>Volume needed</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Silca Terra pump footplate\" title=\"Silca Terra pump footplate\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This Silca Terra pump uses an asymmetric gauge so you can fine-tune your mountain bike or gravel tyre pressures.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tom Marvin / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Much like pressure, this will depend on your main bike choice. A high-volume pump will mean it takes fewer strokes to reach your desired pressure, but in turn, will generally mean a lower maximum pressure.</p>\n<p>As mountain bike tyres have far greater volume (and lower pressure), a large-volume pump is more important here. If you have tubeless tyres, a pump with a massive volume output may be enough to seat a tyre without needing an air compressor.</p>\n<h4>Gauge accuracy</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Mountain bike tyre pressure, pressure gauge 22 PSI\" title=\"Mountain bike tyre pressure, pressure gauge 22 PSI\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A pressure gauge might be worth adding to your tool collection if you run low pressures.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Few hand pumps include a gauge, but any decent track pump should.</p>\n<p>Look for a gauge that’s easy to read and offers a suitable pressure range for your needs. Gauges are generally most accurate at the middle of the range, so if you’re trying to accurately inflate your mountain bike tyre between 23 and 25psi you’ll need a gauge with a low-pressure accuracy (or just a separate <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-tyre-pressure-gauges/\">pressure gauge</a>).</p>\n<p>A pump with a digital gauge is also an option if you’re looking at more expensive options.</p>\n<h4>Pump heads and valve types</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Silca Terra pump head\" title=\"Silca Terra pump head\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The head features a locking lever, and can be used with Presta, Schrader and Dunlop valves.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tom Marvin / OurMedia</i></span></div>\n<p>Presta (racing style) and Schrader (like on a car) are two of the most common valve types. Nearly all pumps these days will cater for at least <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/presta-vs-schrader-valves/\">Presta and Schrader</a>, but not all are as simple as others.</p>\n<p>Some pumps are valve-specific, others must be changed internally to fit various valves. A twin-valve head will have two separate slots for either valve, while a ‘smart-head’ will automatically adjust to the various valve sizes. Then there’s the thread-on style, which offers a reliable fit, but needs to be ‘flipped and changed’ depending on your desired valve.</p>\n<p>If you use tubes or tubeless valves with a removable core, just be aware that some thread-on pump heads can unscrew the valve once inflated. For this style of valve, more common press-on style heads are best.</p>\n<p>If you run tubeless tyres, check out our list of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/6-of-the-best-tubeless-pumps-and-inflators/\">best tubeless pumps and inflators</a>.</p>\n<h4>Size</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Park Tool PMP-4.2 mini cycling pump\" title=\"Six of the best Mini Pumps 06\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> You’ll want something relatively compact when out on a ride.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudery / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>If your pump is going to stay at home, size isn’t going to be of great concern. But if you’re planning to carry your pump on a ride or take it in the car, then it’s an important factor in your decision. The smallest mini-pumps will eventually inflate a tyre, but are obviously limited on air volume.</p>\n<h4>Weight</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Inflating a Presta valve\" title=\"How to pump up a bicycle tyre step-by-step guide (8 of 12)\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A mini track pump could be a good option for bikepacking escapades.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>Much like size, weight isn’t a concern if the pump is going to be left at home, and here, a sturdy pump that doesn’t topple over is a bonus. But if you’re looking to carry it with you, then you don’t want anything too heavy.</p>\n<p>The most expensive pumps are now made with lightweight aluminium, but there are plenty of plastic options, which are perfectly acceptable too. Don’t trade low-weight for something that’s just not suited to your needs, but at the same time, there’s no point carrying extra weight if you don’t have to.</p>\n<h4>Construction</h4>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Lezyne Gravel Floor Drive Pro base\" title=\"Lezyne Gravel Floor Drive Pro base\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A metal construction is more sturdy than plastic.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Nick Clark / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The quality of a pump’s construction is often in line with its price, and generally speaking the more expensive the pump, the more metal it contains.</p>\n<p>For track pumps, the cheapest options are plastic and will flex and wobble under heavy use, eventually giving up.
