While Apple announced that it would have an M2 System on a Chip, we now know one more detail about said chip.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Bloomberg’s <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1746585308626612655&amp;xcust=1-1-2203070-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Mark Gurman</a>, the Vision Pro’s M2 will have 8 CPU cores (4 performance cores and 4 efficiency cores), and 10 GPU cores. That’s the higher-end version of the M2, which is in the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1948603/15-inch-macbook-air-m2-review.html\">15-inch MacBook Air</a> and the $599 and $799 <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/347466/mac-mini-design-processsor-price-release.html\">Mac mini</a>. We already know it will likely have <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2198126/the-apple-vision-pros-m2-has-16gb-of-unified-memory.html\">16GB of RAM</a>, so since Apple promotes its <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/622664/apple-studio-display-review.html\">Studio Display</a> to go along with the Mac mini, the Vision Pro is kind of like having a Mac mini with a 100-foot display sitting on your head. (Yeah, yeah, I know, the Studio Display and Vision Pro have different screen resolutions…I did say <em>kind of</em>.)</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>Hearing the M2 chip in the Vision Pro is the higher end variant with 10 GPU cores and 8 CPU cores. Separately, Apple Card Installments will indeed be an option at checkout online and at retail stores. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://t.co/MPsLc1TIca&amp;xcust=1-1-2203070-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">https://t.co/MPsLc1TIca</a></p>— Mark Gurman (@markgurman) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1746585308626612655?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-2203070-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">January 14, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Vision Pro has a starting price of $3,499, which includes 256GB of storage. In a follow-up X post, Gurman says he has not heard about <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1746586569488932872&amp;xcust=1-1-2203070-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">storage options beyond 256GB</a>, but he’s “not ruling anything out yet.” Reports have said that the Vision Pro developer kits were outfitted with 1TB of storage but Apple only has Vision Pro “starts” at $3,499.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gurman also reports that buyers will have the option to pay via <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/233649/apple-card-monthly-payments-iphone.html\">Apple Card Monthly Installments</a>. Considering the high price tag, it seems that that will be a popular option with customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his <em>Power On</em> newsletter which is distributed on Sundays, Gurman detailed the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2201946/if-you-want-to-try-apple-vision-pro-get-ready-to-wait-a-while.html\">Vision Pro sales demo at Apple Stores</a>, a session that includes a fitting and walkthrough of the Vision Pro and visionOS features. These sessions will start on February 2 in the U.S., when the Vision Pro makes its debut in Apple Stores.
