Southern Straps has been <a href=\"https://southernstraps.com/collections/nylon-bands-for-apple-watch\">making high-quality bands</a> for the Apple Watch for almost a decade now, and the company's selection of bands offer a great alternative to Apple's own bands, in styles that Apple does not offer.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/southern-straps-nylon-band-3.jpg\" width=\"3415\" height=\"1921\" />\r<br />\nSouthern Straps has a wide selection of nylon bands that pair a comfortable design with a classic watch band style. After the Apple Watch came out in 2015, Southern Straps was the first company to make nylon Apple Watch bands, and with so many years of experience, it has had time to perfect the band design and construction.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://southernstraps.com/collections/nylon-bands-for-apple-watch\">Priced at $29</a>, each Apple Watch band is made from a single piece of nylon that is doubled over, heat sealed, and stitched together for durability. The multi-step process makes sure that every band is going to hold up for multiple years to come, and there is a five-year warranty on bands.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/southern-straps-nylon-band-2.jpg\" width=\"3381\" height=\"1902\" />\r<br />\nThere are 11 color options, ranging from solid colors in green, black, and sand, to striped options in aesthetic color combinations like blue and green, blue and orange, khaki and red, blue and white, black and gray, and the classic red, white, and blue.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBands can be ordered with custom hardware in black, silver, or gold to match different Apple Watch models. There are two sizes: one that is compatible with 42mm to 49mm Apple Watch models, and one that is compatible with smaller 38mm to 41mm models. The bands are compatible with every Apple Watch model from the original Apple Watch to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/southern-straps-nylon-band-1.jpg\" width=\"2823\" height=\"1588\" />\r<br />\nPegged spring bars are included with each band so that you're able to change the hardware if you get an Apple Watch in a new size or a new color. Southern Straps bands can be used on a daily basis for everything from work to working out.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/southern-straps-sand-apple-watch-band.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nSouthern Straps is offering an ‌Apple Watch Series 9‌ for one lucky <em>MacRumors</em> reader.
