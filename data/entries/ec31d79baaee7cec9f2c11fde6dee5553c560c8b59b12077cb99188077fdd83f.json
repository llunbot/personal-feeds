This system allows for these pedals to be quick-release. Why would you want this? In Japan, it became popular for Shinkansen users who have to break their bike down in a Rinko Bag. We did this with Sim Works on our <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2016/06/riding-circles-around-mount-fuji/\" target=\"_blank\">Mt. Fuji bicycle tour a few years ago</a>. Quick-release pedals make this process all the easier. Other uses could be if you have minimal space in your apartment for bikes. Sometimes removing pedals enables bikes to be hung on a wall closer to each other. For whatever reason you might have the Sim Works Bubbly pedals now come in the MKS Ezy system and are <a href=\"https://www.sim.works/products/bubbly-pedal-ez-superior?variant=42147444752638\" target=\"_blank\">available now at Sim Works for $148</a>.</p>\n<p>Want to see more from our Japan trip?
