The complaint added, \"Worse, after discovery of this vulnerability in the Google+ platform, Defendants kept silent for at least seven months, making a calculated decision not to inform users that their Personal Information was compromised, further compromising the privacy of consumers‘ information and exposing them to risk of identity theft or worse.\" The case website with full details is at <a href=\"https://www.googleplusdatalitigation.com/\">googleplusdatalitigation.com.</a></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1785045#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1785045&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a7c81ee5b6ef9be15dbcf60f39cf126845de4ed6be5f4785d14d8d1b3d5d4f89","category":"Tech"}
