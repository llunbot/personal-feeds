They’re calling it “Bike Camp”. </p>\n<p>Bike Camp is a festival hosted by another source of magic, Two Bikes Chattanooga. Two Bikes is a nonprofit community bike shop that, among other things, diverts bikes and bike parts from the waste stream, builds rad bikes, donates a bike to someone in need for every bike they sell, and provides a community bike stand (and encouragement) free of charge. Mitchell Connell founded this second version of Two Bikes in Chattanooga last April (it’s a separate nonprofit from the original Knoxville entity, for the sake of the resilience and agility of both), and has been building community around it at a meteoric pace for a year now.</p>\n<p>Big thanks to Mitchell, Derek, and the broader team of staff, workshop hosts, vendors, and volunteers who made Bike Camp exist. Thanks to Lael for always bringing such friendliness &amp; positivity wherever she goes. And, of course: thanks to everyone who came to Bike Camp.</p>\n<p><strong>Please, if you enjoy these videos, hit the subscribe button below!</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p></p>\n<div></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/bike-camp-chattanooga-recap-video/\">Bike Camp Chattanooga Recap Video!</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"6cea5032903032e9235ef7497b4e9f4ed0d9709822c9cf6a1ae4428711e41d94","category":"Cycling"}
