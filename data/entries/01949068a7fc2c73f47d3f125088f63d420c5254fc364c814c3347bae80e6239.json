In images it appears to be a perfect square with a small embossed Apple logo in the bottom right corner. Apple says it is compatible with the iPhone 6 and later, MacBooks and iMacs dating back to 2015, all iPads, Apple Watches, and iPod touches, and the Pro Display XDR.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we posted this story yesterday, you could <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MM6F3AM/A/polishing-cloth&amp;subid1=1-1-545436-1-0-0\">preorder the Polishing Cloth for $19</a> for delivery between October 26 and 28.
