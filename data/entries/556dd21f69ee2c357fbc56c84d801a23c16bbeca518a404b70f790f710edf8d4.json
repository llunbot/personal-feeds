We spoke to the experts to help sort the smarts from the duds and answer the FAQs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘In my experience, if I told an athlete that eating bird poo would help them recover quicker, they would do it.’ Such is the desperation for quick recovery methods, according to Dr Jessica Hill, a recovery specialist and an associate professor in Applied Sport and Exercise Physiology at St Mary’s University Twickenham.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And who wouldn’t try it for a quick fix from the dreaded DOMS (delayed onset muscle soreness), dehydration and fatigue that can come after a long hard day in the saddle? But with the hunger for easy solutions comes plenty of debate and myth. Is it true that the man who coined the RICE acronym doesn’t actually believe in it anymore? Will a post-ride pint really undo all your good work? Jennifer Aniston was spotted in compression boots, so should we all be buying them?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘People do these things before there is any real science to support it, and then the difficulty is that it takes so long for the science to catch up,’ points out Hill. ‘My advice for all athletes is to get the basics right: nutrition, sleep and hydration.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps it’s time to hold off on the pigeon droppings for now.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/compression-cycling\">Can compression help cyclists recover faster?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/get-the-most-out-of-your-recovery-rides\">How can I get the most out of my recovery rides?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/how-to-prepare-your-bike-for-winter-cycling\">How to prepare your bike for winter cycling</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Is RICE a good or bad recovery method?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/hyperice-novatec-2-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/hyperice-novatec-2-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/hyperice-novatec-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/hyperice-novatec-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/hyperice-novatec-2-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/hyperice-novatec-2-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/hyperice-novatec-2-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/hyperice-novatec-2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/hyperice-novatec-2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/hyperice-novatec-2-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/hyperice-novatec-2.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Hyperice</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The RICE method (rest, ice, compression, elevation) was first introduced in 1978 and has been a standard treatment of choice for many injuries and muscle recovery. Recently, however, the man who coined RICE – physician, author and broadcaster Dr Gabe Mirkin – has suggested the concept is outdated and that heat and movement might be better in many cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hill isn’t convinced: ‘It’s what you would do for any muscular injury: rest it, ice it, compress it to minimise the swelling and elevate it to help drain fluid. Does that not work? Medics have been using that as a treatment strategy for sprains, breaks and damaged soft tissue for years because it’s effective.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if it ain’t broke…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Will a post-ride beer affect recovery?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/09/02140243/chris_froome_beer-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"chris_froome_beer\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/09/02140243/chris_froome_beer-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/09/02140243/chris_froome_beer-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/09/02140243/chris_froome_beer-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/09/02140243/chris_froome_beer-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/09/02140243/chris_froome_beer-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/09/02140243/chris_froome_beer-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/09/02140243/chris_froome_beer-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/09/02140243/chris_froome_beer.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Christophe Ena via Getty </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The key after a race is to rehydrate as quickly as you can,’ says Hill. ‘If you drink a pint of beer, initially you’re getting a net gain of a pint of fluid, but that pint will influence the body’s fluid balance. Alcohol blocks the anti-diuretic hormones that tell your body to hold onto water. While the net immediate consumption might not be detrimental, the fact that it’s making you go to the toilet more later down the line probably is going to be detrimental. A pint of beer won’t be a big issue in the grand scheme of things, but ten pints will.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Is eight hours’ sleep really necessary? </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/07103525/sleep_alarm_clock-970x534.jpg\" alt=\"sleep_alarm_clock\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/07103525/sleep_alarm_clock-970x534.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/07103525/sleep_alarm_clock-300x165.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/07103525/sleep_alarm_clock-768x423.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/07103525/sleep_alarm_clock-750x413.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/07103525/sleep_alarm_clock-1140x628.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/07103525/sleep_alarm_clock.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I would say sleep is the one that’s most overlooked,’ says Hill. ‘People will eat and drink well but then try to survive on five or six hours a night. But there’s more to sleep than just restoration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘When we sleep, or even have a power nap, the body releases a human growth hormone that helps with muscular recovery and the repairing of any damaged tissues, making us stronger. A typical adult needs seven to eight hours a night, but athletes need to be on the higher end of that spectrum.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Must protein be consumed within 30 minutes after a ride?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"621\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/02192846/cycling_nutrition_3_vegetable_protein-970x621.jpg\" alt=\"cycling_nutrition_3_vegetable_protein\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/02192846/cycling_nutrition_3_vegetable_protein-970x621.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/02192846/cycling_nutrition_3_vegetable_protein-300x192.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/02192846/cycling_nutrition_3_vegetable_protein-768x492.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/02192846/cycling_nutrition_3_vegetable_protein-1536x983.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/02192846/cycling_nutrition_3_vegetable_protein-750x480.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/02192846/cycling_nutrition_3_vegetable_protein-1140x730.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/02192846/cycling_nutrition_3_vegetable_protein.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘After a session – a significant training session, not a gentle ride – you need to consume recovery meals and snacks that contain around 25g protein to trigger muscle protein synthesis,’ says sports nutritionist Rob Hobson. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘This is beneficial within the first hour after training, but this anabolic window does stay open for 24 hours after training, so just as important is consuming protein every three to five hours over multiple meals – the recommendation being 0.3g protein per kilo of body weight. A post-training snack or meal should also contain carbohydrates and the recommended ratio is 3:1 carb to protein.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"347\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-970x347.jpg\" alt=\"Subscribe to Cyclist Magazine\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-970x347.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-300x107.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-768x275.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-1536x550.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-750x269.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-1140x408.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4.jpg 1818w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>And is a specialist recovery drink the best bet?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/12/02142630/camelbak_podium_cycling_water_bottle-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"camelbak_podium_cycling_water_bottle\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/12/02142630/camelbak_podium_cycling_water_bottle-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/12/02142630/camelbak_podium_cycling_water_bottle-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/12/02142630/camelbak_podium_cycling_water_bottle-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/12/02142630/camelbak_podium_cycling_water_bottle-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/12/02142630/camelbak_podium_cycling_water_bottle-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/12/02142630/camelbak_podium_cycling_water_bottle-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/12/02142630/camelbak_podium_cycling_water_bottle-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/12/02142630/camelbak_podium_cycling_water_bottle.jpg 1500w\" /><figcaption>Camelbak</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Recovery drinks are a convenient way to get a good balance of protein to carbohydrates,’ says Hobson. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘But homemade chocolate milk can also be just as effective. These drinks are useful if your appetite has waned post-training as liquids may be easier on the stomach, but you can get what you need from solid food if that’s what you prefer. A simple meal like egg or shredded chicken with rice will give you what you need and is gentle on the stomach.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Should we use those full-leg compression boots after a hard ride? </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"788\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/03083248/therabody_recoveryair_pro_5-970x788.jpg\" alt=\"therabody_recoveryair_pro_5\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Hill isn’t entirely convinced: ‘Exercise-induced muscle soreness is a result of micro-damage to muscle fibres; it is an inflammatory response. Compression garments can reduce the space available for swelling to occur, because you’re compressing the tissue and muscle compartment that stops fluid leaking out of the blood vessels and sitting in the cellular spaces where it shouldn’t be. That’s what causes the pain – DOMS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘My understanding of a compression boot is that you have to apply a much higher level of compression compared to wearing compression socks or the like because you can’t move around,’ she adds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘If you’re walking around, your body and muscles work to help remove toxins, aiding venous return [the rate of blood flow back to the heart]. Whereas with the boots, you’re lying down and not getting the same action. I think you have to be tactical about when and how you apply it, and that’s the same for any recovery strategy that you use.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Is coffee after a ride good or bad? </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/06/06202300/cyclist_coffee_3488-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"cyclist_coffee_3488\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We know caffeine is useful before and during training to help reduce the perception of fatigue and enhance performance, but it may also enhance post-exercise muscle glycogen recovery,’ says Hobson. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘In a study in the journal <em>Nutrients</em>, riders depleted their glycogen stores by cycling to exhaustion and were then given either milk and coffee or just milk alongside a carb-rich meal. The addition of coffee led to increased muscle glycogen resynthesis and the glycaemic and insulinemic response – it helped replace carb stores in the muscles so helped them recover better.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>• This article originally appeared in issue 146 of <em>Cyclist </em>magazine. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to subscribe</a></strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/recovery-methods-myths\">Recovery methods mythbuster: Are theories on RICE, protein, beer and more worth following?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"556dd21f69ee2c357fbc56c84d801a23c16bbeca518a404b70f790f710edf8d4","category":"Cycling"}
