You’re seeing me slightly earlier in the schedule as the wonderful Emma is in Jordan. Before she left, she covered whether compression could help <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/compression-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">cyclists recover faster</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elsewhere, I wrote about the Gravel World Championships, Tadej Pogačar winning Il Lombardia for the third year in a row and Thibaut Pinot retiring in my <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/tadej-pogacar-lombardia-2023\" target=\"_blank\">latest Pro Log</a>. Of course, also the news of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/mark-cavendish-retirement-delay\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Cavendish’s one-year deal</a> with Astana. I interviewed Alix Popham too on how he’s using the bike to raise awareness of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/alix-popham-dementia\" target=\"_blank\">head trauma in sport</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Will covered <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/gravel-world-championships-2023-gallery-tech\" target=\"_blank\">all the tech</a> at the Gravel World Champs and Joe wrote up his experience riding the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/unbound-gravel\" target=\"_blank\">gravel race of Unbound</a>. If you’re into your bikes, there’s the news on the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/canyon-grail-v2\" target=\"_blank\">Canyon Grail </a>and <a

active – whether that’s taking up tennis or even getting round to… <em>[shudders]</em> jogging – but the one thing that has stood in my way so far, apart from myself, is lack of a good sports bra.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This Ultimate Run Bra from Champion adds support with its double back fastening mechanism. Individual cup support is said to reduce bounce by 78% and I’ve found that for those with bigger chests, it’s definitely more compressive and supportive than my older sports bras.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bra uses an Infinity-8 support system to do so, counteracting movement while running. The straps are wide and therefore non-slip (ideal for exercise) and I’ve found it hasn’t chafed either. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=205647X1684865&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fshockabsorber.co.uk%2Fultimate-run-bra-b5044%3Fsku%3DSA_B5044_BSV_38C%26gclid%3DCj0KCQjwsp6pBhCfARIsAD3GZuYXdtGdE2CF5x4rCHldsJJLQ_TIQ423mW00RFV4jId6gsAIa2apCb4aAkTaEALw_wcB\" target=\"_blank\">Shock Absorber (£52)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>‘Great Rides According to G’</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"608\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Great-Rides-According-to-G-608x970.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Great-Rides-According-to-G-608x970.jpg 608w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Great-Rides-According-to-G-188x300.jpg 188w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Great-Rides-According-to-G.jpg 627w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/geraint-thomas\" target=\"_blank\">Geraint Thomas</a> is launching his fourth book in the ‘According to G’ series, following on from ‘The World of Cycling According to G’, ‘The Tour de France According to G’ and ‘Mountains According to G’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His latest offering is a collection of ‘Great Rides’ features the 20 races, training rides and journeys ‘closest to Thomas’ heart’ across the world, including the white gravel roads of Tuscany and one-day cycles in the Peak District.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The book begins with a ride around his old Tuscan training base, where Thomas began his career as a GB Olympic hopeful. Along the way, he’s joined by ‘little b*stard’ (his frequent words, not mine) <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/remco-evenepoel\" target=\"_blank\">Remco Evenepoel</a> in Calpe and Olympic mountain bike champion <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tom-pidcock\">Tom Pidcock</a> in Yorkshire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thomas’ character always shines through, whether it’s on paper or alongside Luke Rowe on their podcast. The book is a small-sized hardback, handy for packing on the train or taking to a local coffee shop where you can almost hear the Welsh accent in your mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Released 26th October</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>What we’re into this week: Halloween!</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"727\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/10/03120735/itd_pumpkins-727x970.jpeg\" alt=\"itd_pumpkins\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>I love Halloween!
