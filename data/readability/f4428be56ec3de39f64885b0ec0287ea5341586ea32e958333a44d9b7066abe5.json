Available in 27.5″ and 29″ sizes, with three casings and two rubber compounds to choose from, the Warwick can be applied as a fast-rolling rear tire for aggressive trail riding, or as a grippy front tire at the gnarlier end of XC.&nbsp;</p><p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hn-04cW0jbI?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe></p><h2>Terravail Warwick</h2><p>We couldn’t help but think of the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2020/06/15/vittoria-mazza-all-terrain-enduro-tire-is-truckin-w-deep-aggressive-tread-pattern-and-burly-edges/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Vittoria Mazza</a> when we saw the Terravail Warwick, principally because of the stepped front edge of the center tread designed for efficient rolling. That’s where the similarities end, though. Shouldering that large center block are two very small, angled blocks placed to aid the transition to the edge.</p><p>Interspersing every instance of this trio of blocks is a pair of medium-sized blocks. While the largest block in the center tread is siped in the direction of travel, this pair of blocks feature a square cut-out at their center, perhaps to present additional edges that will help the blocks penetrate the terrain better.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/02105408/terravail-warick-trail-mtb-tire.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/02105408/terravail-warick-trail-mtb-tire.jpg\" alt=\"terravail warwick tread pattern\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1066\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/02105408/terravail-warick-trail-mtb-tire.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/02105408/terravail-warick-trail-mtb-tire-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/02105408/terravail-warick-trail-mtb-tire-800x533.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/02105408/terravail-warick-trail-mtb-tire-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/02105408/terravail-warick-trail-mtb-tire-768x512.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/02105408/terravail-warick-trail-mtb-tire-1536x1023.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>At the edge, we see two alternating blocks, the largest of which gets a stepped inboard edge; again, this could be to aid grip transition to the edge for predictable cornering. All of the edge knobs are siped to allow for some lateral flex, but they are also braced with a ramp at the outboard edge that may prevent the block from folding too far through a corner. Terravail says the multi-faceted shape is optimized for consistent, supportive cornering on rocky, rooty, and loose trails.</p><p>Terravail offers the Warwick in three different casings, all made up of a 60 TPI ply; Light and Supple, Durable, and Ultradurable. The Durable casing differs from the Light and Supple with the addition of woven nylon composite reinforcement in the sidewall between the outer rubber and the inner casing to prevent tearing and abrasions. There is also a fine nylon weave under the tread cap to defend against punctures.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/02111447/terravail-warwick-mtb-tire-casing-light-supple-durable-ultra.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/02111447/terravail-warwick-mtb-tire-casing-light-supple-durable-ultra.jpg\" alt=\"terravail warwick mtb tire casings light supple durable ultradurable\" width=\"1600\" height=\"436\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/02111447/terravail-warwick-mtb-tire-casing-light-supple-durable-ultra.jpg 1600w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/02111447/terravail-warwick-mtb-tire-casing-light-supple-durable-ultra-297x81.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/02111447/terravail-warwick-mtb-tire-casing-light-supple-durable-ultra-800x218.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/02111447/terravail-warwick-mtb-tire-casing-light-supple-durable-ultra-120x33.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/02111447/terravail-warwick-mtb-tire-casing-light-supple-durable-ultra-768x209.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/02111447/terravail-warwick-mtb-tire-casing-light-supple-durable-ultra-1536x419.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1600px) 100vw, 1600px\"></a></p><p>The Ultra-Durable casing is the most robust, with an extra ½ ply of 120 TPI nylon for sidewall protection and extra puncture defense in the tread cap. They also add butyl inserts to further strengthen the sidewalls of the tire. This one is definitely the most appropriate option for the rear tire of an enduro bike.</p><p>On top of those three casing options is the choice of two rubber compounds, simply named Fast and Grip. The Fast compound is the hardest for the least rolling resistance, while the Grip is softer for a better connection to the terrain. Within those two compounds, there is variation across the tread pattern. On both tires, the center tread gets a harder compound for better rolling characteristics while the side knobs are relatively softer for better grip in corners.</p><h3>Pricing &amp; Availability</h3><ul><li>27.5 x 2.5″, Black Sidewall, Light and Supple, Fast Compound, $70 MSRP</li><li>27.5 x 2.5″, Tan Sidewall, Light and Supple, Fast Compound, $70 MSRP</li><li>27.5 x 2.5″, Black Sidewall, Durable, Grip Compound, $85 MSRP</li><li>27.5 x 2.5″, Tan Sidewall, Durable, Grip Compound, $85 MSRP</li><li>27.5 x 2.5″, Black Sidewall, Ultra-Durable, Grip Compound, $90 MSRP</li><li>29 x 2.5″, Black Sidewall, Light and Supple, Fast Compound, $70 MSRP</li><li>29 x 2.5″, Tan Sidewall, Light and Supple, Fast Compound, $70 MSRP</li><li>29 x 2.5″, Black Sidewall, Durable, Grip Compound, $85 MSRP</li><li>29 x 2.5″, Tan Sidewall, Durable, Grip Compound, $85 MSRP</li><li>29 x 2.5″, Black Sidewall, Ultra-Durable, Grip Compound, $90 MSRP</li><li>29 x 2.3″, Black Sidewall, Light and Supple, Fast Compound, $70 MSRP</li><li>29 x 2.3″, Tan Sidewall, Light and Supple, Fast Compound, $70 MSRP</li><li>29 x 2.3″, Black Sidewall, Durable, Grip Compound, $85 MSRP</li><li>29 x 2.3″, Tan Sidewall, Durable, Grip Compound, $85 MSRP</li><li>29 x 2.3″, Black Sidewall, Ultra-Durable, Grip Compound, $90 MSRP</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://teravail.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Terravail.com</em></a></p></section></article></div></div>","author":"Jessie-May Morgan","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"f4428be56ec3de39f64885b0ec0287ea5341586ea32e958333a44d9b7066abe5","category":"Cycling"}
