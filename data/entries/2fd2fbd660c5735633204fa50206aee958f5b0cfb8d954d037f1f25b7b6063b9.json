Its gorgeous all-screen design isn’t expected to change and we don’t think there will be all that much to worry about missing out on other than a faster chip and better cameras.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even without an update in nearly two years, we think the iPad Air is one of the best tablets ever made and perfect for just about any task. In our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/625135/ipad-air-m1-review.html\">4.5-star review</a>, we called the iPad Air “a Pro in all but name” and praised its design and performance. And at the price, it’s a bargain too—so go grab one before the price jumps back up.</p>\n\niPad</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"2fd2fbd660c5735633204fa50206aee958f5b0cfb8d954d037f1f25b7b6063b9","category":"Apple"}
