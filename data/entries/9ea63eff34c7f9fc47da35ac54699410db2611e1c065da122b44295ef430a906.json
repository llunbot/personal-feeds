The Urban <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> Stand has a built-in magnet that is designed to attach to a compatible ‌iPad‌, with the stand and the ‌iPad‌ automatically aligning thanks to the magnets in the recent ‌iPad‌ models.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/urban-ipad-stand-2.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nOn the stand, the ‌iPad‌ is positioned at an ideal height for an ergonomic viewing experience, and with the adjustable hinge at the back, the ‌iPad‌ can be rotated around 360 degrees to accommodate any viewing angle.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/urban-ipad-stand-3.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAvailable in either silver or space gray, the ‌‌iPad‌‌ Stand matches well with Apple's devices, and it is made from a hard, durable aluminum material that will last for years to come. The Urban Magnetic Stand is compatible with the first, second, and third-generation 11-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ models and the third, fourth, and fifth-generation 12.9-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ models.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/urban-ipad-stand-4.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nTo go along with the stand, Lululook is also offering <em>MacRumors</em> readers its $19 <a href=\"https://www.lululook.com/collections/ipad-accessories/products/foldable-mobile-phone-stand\">Foldable Mobile Phone Stand</a>, which is a versatile mobile device holder. It is compatible with all iPhones that are at least 4.7-inches in size, which means it should work with all modern <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> models, including the latest <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> and 13 options.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/lululook-iphone-stand-1.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe stand can even fit iPads up to 11 inches, so you can use it with the standard ‌iPad‌, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a>, 11-inch ‌iPad Pro‌, and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a>. Made from an aluminum alloy material, the stand is adjustable and can be rotated into multiple viewing angles for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a> calls, watching movies, cooking, and more.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/lululook-iphone-stand-2.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nBecause of the foldable design, the stand is also able to collapse down, a feature that makes it much more portable and easy to bring on the go. There is a cutout at the center of the stand to accommodate charging with a Lightning cable, and the stand itself does not offer charging capabilities.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/lululook-iphone-stand-3.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nWe have 10 prize packs, each of which features an Urban Magnetic ‌iPad Pro‌ Stand and a Foldable Mobile Phone Stand.
