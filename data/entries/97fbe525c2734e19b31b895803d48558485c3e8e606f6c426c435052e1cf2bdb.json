It consistently has some of the highest-rated original films and series and lines up a lot of <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/07/apple-scores-record-72-emmy-award-nominations-and-sweeps-across-top-categories/\">Emmy nominations</a> each year. It’s a good value too: At $9.99 a month it offers ad-free viewing, 4K, and family sharing, all of which cost more than competing services. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the library is a little thin. By relying almost entirely on original series and films, Apple TV+ has a rather small catalog compared to media companies that have decades of content to draw upon. If users aren’t watching something almost every day, they’re more likely to cancel the service in favor of services that have larger libraries of shows they watch often, such as Netflix and Disney+.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, that may change. soon. A <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-07-18/apple-is-in-talks-to-license-more-films-from-hollywood\">Bloomberg report</a> claims that Apple is currently talks with major movie studios to license films for Apple TV+. It is unclear if Apple is seeking to permanently add films to its Apple TV+ content library or whether they will be new releases, older hits, or exclusives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout 2024, Apple has been offering subscribers limited access to hit movies to help bolster their subscription value., For example, Apple licensed over <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2252986/apple-tv-51-free-movies-subscriber-bonus.html\">50 popular films</a> in March, including Fight Club, Spider-Man, and Star Trek, and has occasionally offered free movies related to one of the latest new shows. Bloomberg’s report sounds like something more permanent, with Apple looking to make TV+ one of the exclusive homes for major Hollywood releases while building an extensive library of third-party films.</p>\n\nApple TV, Streaming Media</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"97fbe525c2734e19b31b895803d48558485c3e8e606f6c426c435052e1cf2bdb","category":"Apple"}
