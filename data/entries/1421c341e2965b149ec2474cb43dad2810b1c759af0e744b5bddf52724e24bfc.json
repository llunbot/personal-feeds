The gradient of this particular street required the granny ring, especially as I would be wearing a rucksack destined to be filled with all the natural and healthy foods that were unavailable in the east end of Glasgow (which at that time boasted a life expectancy for men of just 53 years, lower than that of Iraq).</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/hope-lotus-track-bike-team-gb-2023\">The even weirder new Hope-Lotus track bike has a split seatpost and serrated fork</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/greg-lemond-podcast-2\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 84: Greg LeMond, winner of the greatest ever Tour de France</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/uci-road-cycling-world-championships-route-tv-guide-all-you-need-to-know\">Glasgow UCI Cycling World Championships 2023: Key information</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>In the pre-Strava age, I wasn’t aware of the length or gradient of this climb, just that it was steep and seemed to go on forever, but once at the top I felt as if I’d accomplished something worth sharing with thousands of strangers – if only such a thing had been possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had no idea that this nondescript stretch of uneven, urban tarmac was destined to become a classic climb of professional cycling. Yet Montrose Street will soon be the centre of the cycling universe as it features in the final circuit of the men’s and women’s <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/uci-road-cycling-world-championships-route-tv-guide-all-you-need-to-know\" target=\"_blank\">World Championships Road Race</a>. It’s not a bad claim to fame for a city centre thoroughfare that until 2013 was better known for its potholes and roadworks than its role in deciding the outcome of assorted major bike races.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was the year Glasgow hosted the British National Road Championships and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/mark-cavendish-interview-2\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Cavendish</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/lizzie-deignan-cyclist\" target=\"_blank\">Lizzie Deignan</a> (then Armitstead) emerged victorious after repeated punishing laps of the city centre that featured Montrose Street. The following year it was the Commonwealth Games, and Montrose Street once again proved decisive as Geraint Thomas and Deignan took the honours in the road races.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More recently, the circuit was used in the 2018 European Championships, won by Marta Bastianelli and Matteo Trentin, who outsprinted Mathieu van der Poel and Wout van Aert.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After Britain, Europe and the Commonwealth, it is now the World’s turn to ride a stretch of road whose KoM leaderboard already reads like a who’s who of cycling superstars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Van Aert did his homework early, making a surprise visit to Glasgow in May to recce both the TT and road race courses, labelling the latter as ‘risky business’. Whether he was referring to the nerve-shredding number of turns on the 14km city centre circuit – which the men will ride ten times, the women seven – or the sudden pitch in gradient at Montrose Street isn’t clear. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"347\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-970x347.jpg\" alt=\"Subscribe to Cyclist Magazine\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-970x347.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-300x107.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-768x275.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-1536x550.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-750x269.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4-1140x408.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/clickable-subs-promo4.jpg 1818w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>But it’s safe to assume none of the contenders will be underestimating just how attritional Montrose Street will be. I found it wearing enough on my shopping trips just twice a week, but the pros will be tackling it ten times in less than four hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They’ll be confronted by what looks like a tsunami of tarmac immediately after they have made a 90° right turn from George Street. If they haven’t shifted down by the time they see the ‘13%’ warning triangle on their left, their dreams may already be in tatters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It may be only 300m long in total, but the first 200m is tougher pound-for-pound than such iconic ascents as the Cipressa (Milan-San Remo, average 4.1%) or the Ghisallo (Giro di Lombardia, 5.2%).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have I convinced you how heroic my shopping trips were yet?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The views may not be quite as impressive. Swap the Italian lakes for a mix of Modernist and Victorian architecture (‘an utterly boring and nondescript little building’, said one architecture critic about the 1970s Strathclyde University outpost on the right at the top), plus an NCP car park and a landscaped garden where the Glasgow Royal Maternity Hospital used to stand, and you get the idea. But the atmosphere created by fans has previously been every bit as passionate as that of their Continental counterparts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was there in 2018, standing in the pouring rain for five hours to cheer on not just the race leaders but those at the back entertaining fans with wheelies or grabbing a ‘sticky bottle’ from their team cars. If Glasgow City Council had any PR savvy, they’d have already renamed this ugly little hill the Mur de Montrose, giving it a tinge of glamour that only road cycling can bestow upon the unlikeliest of locations.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Montrose Street: key stats</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Location:</strong> Glasgow<br /><strong>Length:</strong> 0.2km<br /><strong>Total ascent:</strong> 16m<br /><strong>Average gradient:</strong> 6.5%<br /><strong>Maximum gradient:</strong> 9.1%</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Source: <a href=\"https://veloviewer.com/segment/1271847/Montrose+Street+Climb\" target=\"_blank\">VeloViewer</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/montrose-street-world-championships\">The ‘Mur de Montrose’, pro cycling’s latest classic climb</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Martin James","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"1421c341e2965b149ec2474cb43dad2810b1c759af0e744b5bddf52724e24bfc","category":"Cycling"}
