It adds 19 scenarios to the base game, allowing you to play as, among others, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oda_Nobunaga\">Oda Nobunaga</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlemagne\">Charlemagne</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragnar_Lodbrok\">Ragnar Lothbrok</a>. The campaigns are inspired by the deep community around <em>Age of Empires</em> but spiffed up with voice acting, music, bug fixes, and \"quality of life improvements.\" Some new mechanics show up in the scenarios, including population migration, political decisions, assassinations, and more. It's $13 on launch day, works with Xbox Game Pass on PC (where <em>AoE2: DE </em>is included), and it's on sale for preorder at about $11 until launch.</p>\n  <ul>\n          <li>\n        <div>\n          <div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/aoevv5-980x551.jpeg\" /></div>\n          <p>\n            Oda Nobunaga's realm in <em>Victors and Vanquished</em>.

And a huge chunk of that big chunk is Filthydelphia, who had been <a href=\"https://forums.ageofempires.com/t/filthydelphias-campaign-collection/112886\">turning out campaigns</a> like \"Kings of West Africa\" and \"Francis Drake on the Spanish Main\" for years. Beyond the maps and army configurations, many of the campaigns contain narrative pieces. \"City of Peace\" involves a young woman murdered in Madinat al-Salaam, and you, the vizier, must find her murderer. Community scenarios like these make up 14 of the expansion's 19 scenarios.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005903#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2005903&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a630399116a1ad3bfcae94d6c16f0aeb4e4f9a76300c01ed22a1f6770ebf4195","category":"Tech"}
