It’s one of the most iconic and influential tech gadgets of all time, and everyone wants to know what’s coming next. That Apple is so secretive only heightens the appeal of iPhone rumors and leaks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it should come as little surprise that iPhone 17 rumors, leaks, and info started to circulate months before the iPhone 16 was even formally announced. Here’s everything we know so far, but don’t take any of it as solid info: even when early rumors are accurate, plans can change, and nothing is ever certain until Apple announces it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Updated November 19:</strong> A new report from analyst Jeff Pu claims the iPhone 17 will be 6mm thick, which would make it the slimmest iPhone ever.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 17: Release date</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s something we do know: The new iPhone lineup is almost always announced in September—usually on a Tuesday in the second week of September, to be specific. So we would expect the iPhone 17 line to be announced on or around September 9, 2025. Here’s when the most recent models were released:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>iPhone 15:</strong> September 12, 2023</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPhone 14: </strong>Sepember 7, 2022</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPhone 13:</strong> Sepember 14, 2021</li>\n\n\n\n<li>i<strong>Phone 12:</strong> October 13, 2020 (delayed due to Covid)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Historically, preorders for the iPhone begin on the Friday after the announcement, and the phones ship a week later. On occasion, some specific models may ship a couple of weeks later than the others due to production issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 17: Price</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We haven’t yet heard if the iPhone 17 line will cost the same as the iPhone 16 line, which at this time hasn’t even been announced yet. One rumor from a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2405536/iphone-17-leaked-specs-displays-chip-memory-pricing.html\">popular leaker on Weibo</a> contends that the “Plus” model will be replaced by the new “Slim” model that costs more than the Pro Max, though it won’t have the same processor and RAM and the Pro models. The supposed pricing would be: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>iPhone 17</strong>: 6.27-inch LTPO display, A19/8GB ($799)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPhone 17 Pro</strong>: 6.27-inch LTPO display, A19 Pro/12GB ($1,099)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPhone 17 Pro Max</strong>: 6.86-inch LTPO display, A19 Pro/12GB ($1,199)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPhone 17 Slim</strong>: 6.65-inch LTPO display, A19/8GB ($1,299)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This would mean a significant upward shift in overall iPhone pricing, with the Pro model jumping up $100 and a new model replacing the Plus with a price of $100 more than the Pro Max.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 17: Colors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We haven’t yet heard anything about what colors to expect from the iPhone 17 line. The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2301253/2024-iphone-colors-iphone-16-plus-pro-max-purple-yellow-gold-space-gray.html\">iPhone 16 is expected to launch</a> in seven colors, with white and purple joining blue, pink, yellow, green, and black. Additionally, desert yellow and cement gray are expected which are reportedly reminiscent of the classic gold and space gray options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We haven’t heard any rumors about the iPhone 17’s colors and probably won’t until after the iPhone 16 launches.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3131_fa79fa.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPad Air M2 vs Pro\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3131_fa79fa.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 4032w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3131_fa79fa.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3131_fa79fa.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3131_fa79fa.jpeg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3131_fa79fa.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1152&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3131_fa79fa.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1536&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>The iPhone 17 is expected to have an ultra-thin model like the M4 iPad Pro.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Petter Ahrnstedt</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 17: New slimmer ‘Air’ model</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s been rumored for years that Apple is planning to launch a new model with higher-end features above the Pro Max. It looks like it may finally arrive in 2025. Several analysts have reported that the existing Plus model will be replaced by a <strong>new “Slim” model</strong> with a larger screen size and a much thinner body. Analyst Jeff Pu was the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2324602/iphone-17-slim-24mp-front-camera-2025.html\">first to report this change</a>, and The Information later <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2337606/the-2025-iphone-could-feature-a-thin-redesigned-ultra-high-end-model.html\">reported on the Slim model</a>, stating that it would be a new even-higher-end model that sits above “Pro Max” in the lineup and would have a centered rear camera and a smaller Dynamic Island.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pu <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/18/iphone-17-air-rumored-features/\">later said</a> he expects the phone to have an A19 chip (not A19 Pro), 8GB of RAM, around a 6.6-inch display, an aluminum body, and a single 48MP rear camera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A more <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2419247/apple-will-finally-launch-the-iphone-air-in-2025-leaker-claims.html\">recent video by Jon Prosser</a> surmises that the slim iPhone will be called the iPhone Air (we agree that makes sense) and <strong>will <em>not</em> be the most expensive in the lineup</strong>, but rather be a mid-priced model that prioritizes form and design over specs, much like the MacBook Air. Additionally, a report by Mark Gurman of Bloomberg in August 2024 claimed the new model will fit between the standard iPhone and the Pro: ” If you want something snazzier than a standard iPhone–but don’t really need the performance, screen size, or cameras of a Pro model–you can get something that looks much cooler while still having the specifications of a regular iPhone.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href=\"http://Ajinomoto\">recent report</a> suggested that Apple <strong>won’t use resin-coated copper components</strong> on the mainboard due to quality issues with the supplier. This was one of the ways Apple planned to reduce internal space requirements, so it’s unclear if it will have an impact on the iPhone 17 slim model’s overall thickness or not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple jumped back on the thin train with the launch of the M4 iPad Pro in May. It’s also rumored that Apple will <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2369453/ipad-pro-thin-design-iphone-macbook-apple-watch.html\">launch a thinner Apple Watch and MacBook Pro</a> over the coming months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest report from Jeff Pu claims that the iPhone 17 Air/Slim will be around 6mm thick. That’s thinner than any iPhone so far. The iPhone 16, for context, is 7.8mm thick. The thinnest new iPad Pro is 5.1mm thick.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 17: Rumored new features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>All iPhone 17 models have been rumored to feature a <strong><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/02/iphone-17-24mp-front-camera-rumor/\">24MP front-facing camera</a></strong> and the <strong>always-on display</strong> is supposed to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2251596/report-claims-the-iphone-17-will-finally-get-an-always-on-display.html\">finally be available on the non-Pro models</a>. Some believe that ProMotion will come to the non-Pro models too, since the same LPTO technology that enables the always-on display is what makes ProMotion possible, in Apple’s iPhone implementation. If true, it would be the first time Apple has offered ProMotion on a non-Pro device.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is also <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2270684/iphone-17-anti-glare-scratch-resistant-display.html\">said to be working with Corning</a> on a <strong>new anti-glare and scratch-resistant glass</strong> for the iPhone 17 lineup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2406933/report-at-least-one-iphone-17-model-to-feature-a-mechanical-aperture.html\">report from The Information</a> claims that “at least one” model will feature a <strong>mechanical aperture</strong>, which would be new for iPhones but has been seen in a handful of Android phones so far.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don’t know much about what chips will power the iPhone 17 line, but we expect the high-end models (Pro and possibly Slim) will get an <strong>A19 Pro</strong>, while the non-Pro models will get either some variant of the A18 or a somewhat cut-back version of the A19. Since Apple is expected to bump every iPhone 16 model to 8GB of RAM due to the demands of Apple Intelligence, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2441215/\">rumors</a> have suggested Apple will increase the memory in the iPhone 17 Pro models to <strong>12GB</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/18/iphone-17-pro-rumored-features/\">more recent research note</a> from analyst Jeff Pu corroborated these claims, and added that the iPhone 17 Pro would feature a <strong>48MP telephoto camera</strong> along with a new <strong>24MP front camera</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to wireless, the cellular modem is likely to still be supplied by Qualcomm; Apple’s own efforts to produce a top-tier 5G modem seem to be stalled and likely won’t be ready in time for next year’s iPhone 17 line. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/828757/wi-fi-7-speed-latency-apple-devices.html\">Wi-Fi 7 support</a> seems likely, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone history</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><br />The iPhone 16 range and the iPhone SE 3 are the current-generation models available from Apple. In addition to this SE 4 model we’re also expecting <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2393967/iphone-17-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">iPhone 17</a> to launch in 2025.
