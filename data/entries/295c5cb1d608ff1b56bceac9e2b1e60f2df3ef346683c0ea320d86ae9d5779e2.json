Here’s how your AirPods will improve this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Nod ‘yes’ or shake ‘no’ to answer or decline calls</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When it’s crowded or noisy, you may not be able to answer a Siri request using your voice. And your hands may be full. With AirPods Pro (2nd gen), you can simply gently nod your head “yes” or shake it “no” to answer a Siri request.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Voice Isolation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Already a feature on iPhone, iPad, and Mac, Voice Isolation is coming to AirPods Pro. This feature removes a <em>lot</em> of background noise from what your AirPods Pro mics pick up, so the person you’re talking to can clearly hear you even when surrounded by lots of noise.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Better gaming features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Games will be able to use Personalized Spatial Audio with AirPods (3rd gen), AirPods Pro, or AirPods Max. The new Game Mode for iOS and iPadOS will reduce latency to 2nd-gen AirPods Pro in addition to game controllers.</p>\n\nHeadphones, Mobile Phone Accessories</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"295c5cb1d608ff1b56bceac9e2b1e60f2df3ef346683c0ea320d86ae9d5779e2","category":"Apple"}
