In December, Broadcom <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/12/broadcom-cuts-at-least-2800-vmware-jobs-following-69-billion-acquisition/\">began laying off thousands of employees</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/12/broadcom-ends-vmware-perpetual-license-sales-testing-customers-and-partners/\">stopped selling perpetually licensed versions of VMware products</a>, pushing its customers toward more stable and lucrative software subscriptions instead. In January, it <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/01/broadcom-killing-vmware-partner-program-could-disrupt-thousands-of-businesses/\">ended its partner programs</a>, potentially disrupting sales and service for many users of its products.</p>\n<p>This week, Broadcom is making a change that is smaller in scale but possibly more relevant for home users of its products: The free version of VMware's vSphere Hypervisor, also known as ESXi, <a href=\"https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2107518\">is being discontinued</a>.</p>\n\n<p>ESXi is what is known as a \"bare-metal hypervisor,\" lightweight software that runs directly on hardware without requiring a separate operating system layer in between. ESXi allows you to split a PC's physical resources (CPUs and CPU cores, RAM, storage, networking components, and so on) among multiple virtual machines. ESXi also supports passthrough for PCI, SATA, and USB accessories, allowing guest operating systems direct access to components like graphics cards and hard drives.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2003094#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2003094&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8324a1dbe1cdf6139bcb5dd2485c4a9a174b927881bf073cf7c6968b718471dd","category":"Tech"}
