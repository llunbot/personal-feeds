The company assured users that Prime Video will have \"meaningfully fewer ads than linear TV and other streaming TV providers.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe current price of Amazon Prime memberships will not change, but members who prefer to avoid ads can opt for an ad-free version at an extra cost of $2.99 per month. Amazon's email to subscribers reads:<blockquote>Dear Prime member, \r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe are writing to you today about an upcoming change to your Prime Video experience. Starting January 29, Prime Video movies and TV shows will include limited advertisements. This will allow us to continue investing in compelling content and keep increasing that investment over a long period of time. We aim to have meaningfully fewer ads than linear TV and other streaming TV providers. No action is required from you, and there is no change to the current price of your Prime membership. We will also offer a new ad-free option for an additional $2.99 per month...</blockquote>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAmazon already operates Freevee, a free, ad-supported streaming service.
