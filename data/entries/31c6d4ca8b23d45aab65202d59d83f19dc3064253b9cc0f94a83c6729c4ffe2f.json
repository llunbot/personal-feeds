The current AirTag launched in April 2021 and is priced at $29.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/AirTag-and-Lavender-iPhone.jpg\" alt width=\"1001\" height=\"563\" />\r<br />\nKuo believes the new AirTag will have better integration with Apple's upcoming Vision Pro headset, as part of a spatial computing ecosystem, but he did not provide any additional details or reveal any other potential new features for the item tracker.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe current AirTag is equipped with an Apple-designed U1 chip for Ultra Wideband, enabling a Precision Finding feature that displays the distance and direction to an AirTag. Kuo already said iPhone 15 models will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/19/iphone-15-new-u1-chip-vision-pro-headset/\">likely have an upgraded Ultra Wideband chip</a>, so perhaps Apple is planning an upgraded U2 chip for both iPhones and the AirTag.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBased on this timeframe, a new AirTag is still over a year away from launching, so additional rumors about the accessory are likely to surface over the coming months.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airtags/\">AirTags</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airtags.232\">AirTags</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/02/kuo-new-airtag-production-late-2024/\">Kuo: New AirTag Likely to Enter Mass Production in Late 2024</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-new-airtag-likely-to-enter-mass-production-in-late-2024.2397564/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"31c6d4ca8b23d45aab65202d59d83f19dc3064253b9cc0f94a83c6729c4ffe2f","category":"Apple"}
