Depending on the model, ebikes can be extremely heavy which could potentially overload your hitch rack. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Saris-MHS-Duo-increased-weight-limit-for-ebikes3.jpg\"><img width=\"460\" height=\"388\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Saris-MHS-Duo-increased-weight-limit-for-ebikes3.jpg\" alt=\"Saris MHS Duo increased weight limit for ebikes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Saris-MHS-Duo-increased-weight-limit-for-ebikes3.jpg 460w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Saris-MHS-Duo-increased-weight-limit-for-ebikes3-297x251.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Saris-MHS-Duo-increased-weight-limit-for-ebikes3-120x101.jpg 120w\" /></a></figure>\n<figcaption>(Photos/Saris)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s good news for <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-saris-mhs-bike-rack/\" target=\"_blank\">Saris MHS bike rack</a> owners though as the brand just upped the weight limit for the two-bike rack from 60lbs each, to a massive 100lbs per tray. That change comes after extensive testing that confirmed heavier bikes could safely be carried on existing racks. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Saris-MHS-Duo-increased-weight-limit-for-ebikes2.jpg\"><img width=\"458\" height=\"402\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Saris-MHS-Duo-increased-weight-limit-for-ebikes2.jpg\" alt=\"Saris MHS Duo increased weight limit for ebikes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Saris-MHS-Duo-increased-weight-limit-for-ebikes2.jpg 458w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Saris-MHS-Duo-increased-weight-limit-for-ebikes2-297x261.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Saris-MHS-Duo-increased-weight-limit-for-ebikes2-120x105.jpg 120w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you run the third bike add-on, that weight limit drops to 80 lbs for the first two trays, and 35 lbs for the third, elevated tray. For existing rack owners, no changes or updates are needed. Your current rack is now certified to carry more!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://saris.com/products/mhs-2-bike-package?utm_source=Klaviyo&amp;utm_medium=campaign&amp;_kx=vqnaksbYwgaJkZ2JiupDSIC_2bhpoA2yI4J4mHCP-YA.V7Wmaq\" target=\"_blank\">saris.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/saris-mhs-2-bike-rack-ebike-weight-limit-100lbs/\">Saris MHS 2-Bike Rack Now Certified to Carry Up to 100lbs Per Tray</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"8410c8a4ee21c995af07333f2620ecaa6012620d0a211582b79dcc6cafb542f6","category":"Cycling"}
