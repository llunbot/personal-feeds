Four of the six bugs allow for remote code execution and carry severity ratings of 7.5 to 9.8 out of a possible 10. Exim said it has made patches for three of the vulnerabilities available in a private repository. The status of patches for the remaining three vulnerabilities—two of which allow for RCE—are unknown. Exim is an open source mail transfer agent that is used by as many as <a href=\"https://www.securityspace.com/s_survey/data/man.202302/mxsurvey.html\">253,000 servers</a> on the Internet.</p>\n<h2>“Sloppy handling” on both sides</h2>\n<p>ZDI provided no indication that Exim has published patches for any of the vulnerabilities, and at the time this post went live on Ars, the Exim website made no mention of any of the vulnerabilities or patches. On the <a href=\"https://seclists.org/oss-sec/\">OSS-Sec mail list</a> on Friday, an Exim project team member <a href=\"https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2023/q3/254\">said</a> that fixes for two of the most severe vulnerabilities and a third, less severe one are available in a “protected repository and are ready to be applied by the distribution maintainers.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1972409#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1972409&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ca75e473ea04e1a0813dedb6d7de63637106933910da46bccd75487259117bc5","category":"Tech"}
