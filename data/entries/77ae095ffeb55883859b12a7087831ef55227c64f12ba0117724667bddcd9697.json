This new feature automatically detects upcoming climbs and works out a profile as you ride. It means you no longer need to load predetermined routes to get climb info.</p>\n<p>Pirelli updated its highly rated <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/pirelli-pzero-race-tlr-4s-tyres/\">P Zero Race 4S</a> tyre to make it <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/tubeless/\">tubeless-ready</a>. The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/tyres/road-bike-tyres/pirelli-p-zero-race-4s-tyre-review/\">clincher version</a> is well regarded by the BikeRadar team as a tough yet fast-enough option for year-round road riding, but the addition of a tubeless casing makes sense given the direction of travel for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bike-tyres/\">road bike tyres</a>.</p>\n<p>In terms of wheels to mount them to, BikeRadar’s senior technical editor, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/author/ashleyquinlan/\">Ashley Quinlan</a>, published his review of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/wheels/wheel-sets/enve-ses-4-5-wheelset-review/\">ENVE’s new SES 4.5 wheelset</a>, awarding them a near perfect score. They don’t come cheap, but it seems there’s little to be desired in terms of pure performance on the road.</p>\n<p>Ahead of the 2023 <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/how-to-watch-giro-ditalia/\">Giro d’Italia</a>, EF Education-EasyPost has announced its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/ef-giro-switch-kit/\">latest limited-edition kit</a>.</p>\n<p>This year’s design showcases Rapha’s Excess Collection, which uses leftover materials to create a patchwork design. Style is subjective, of course, but I think this is another great kit that pushes the boundaries of cycling kit design.
