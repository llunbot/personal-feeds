And we’ve found a great one today: Best Buy is selling <a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/321564/614286/10014?u=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-watch-series-6-gps-40mm-blue-aluminum-case-with-deep-navy-sport-band-blue/6215921.p?skuId=6215921&amp;subid1=1-1-556578-1-198234-9934\">the 40mm Apple Watch Series 6 in blue for $299</a> and the <a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/321564/614286/10014?u=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-watch-nike-series-6-gps-44mm-silver-aluminum-case-with-pure-platinum-black-nike-sport-band-silver/6215912.p?skuId=6215912&amp;subid1=1-1-556578-1-198234-9934\">44mm Nike Apple Watch for $329</a>, a savings of $100 on either model. Additionally, you can get <a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/321564/614286/10014?u=https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-watch-series-6-gps-cellular-44mm-blue-aluminum-case-with-deep-navy-sport-band-blue/6139711.p?skuId=6139711&amp;subid1=1-1-556578-1-198234-9934\">a cellular 44mm blue model for $379</a>, good for $150 off the original MSRP. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While you’re missing out on a slightly larger screen and faster charging, the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/358065/apple-watch-series-7-vs-series-6-design-display-features-price.html\">Apple Watch Series 6</a> has the same health sensors as the Apple Watch Series 7, including ECG, blood-oxygen, and heart rate, as well as fall detection, noise, and sleep tracking, and an always-on display. It’s also compatible with every Series 7 band and gets you three months of Apple Fitness+ for free. It even has the same processor as the Series 7 and of course, you’ll be able to install watchOS 8 and receive future updates for years to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Nike version of the Apple Watch is identical to the standard version but has a Nike Sport band and exclusive watch faces as well as the Nike Run Club app pre-installed. It has cellular connectivity, which requires monthly service to operate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This deal is only available while supplies last and with the 40mm models already sold out, you should probably act fast if you want one.</p>\n</div>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"9d3cb0805b4a7b451146a95acd0ccd52cdf97354ff72d793e9466574a1c6146f","category":"Apple"}
