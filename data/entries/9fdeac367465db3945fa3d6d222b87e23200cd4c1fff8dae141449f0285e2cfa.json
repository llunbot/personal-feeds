The library, started in 2006, provides operations and algorithms developers can use to safely implement secure encryption, decryption, signing, verification, hashing, and key exchange in the apps they create. The library supports federal certification requirements for cryptographic modules used in some governmental environments.</p>\n<h2>Massive overhaul underway</h2>\n<p>Despite the name, SymCrypt supports both symmetric and asymmetric algorithms. Itâ€™s the main cryptographic library Microsoft uses in products and services including Azure, Microsoft 365, all supported versions of Windows, Azure Stack HCI, and Azure Linux. The library provides cryptographic security used in email security, cloud storage, web browsing, remote access, and device management. Microsoft documented the update in a <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/security-compliance-and-identity/microsoft-s-quantum-resistant-cryptography-is-here/ba-p/4238780\">post</a> on Monday.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049244#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049244&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9fdeac367465db3945fa3d6d222b87e23200cd4c1fff8dae141449f0285e2cfa","category":"Tech"}
