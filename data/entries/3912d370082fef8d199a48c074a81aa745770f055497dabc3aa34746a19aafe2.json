This will be a semi-regular platform for Radavist editors and contributors to make bold, sometimes controversial claims about cycling. A way to challenge long-held assumptions that deserve a second look. Sometimes they will be global issues with important far-reaching consequences; other times, they will shed light on little nerdy corners of our world that don’t get enough attention. This week, John looks at a divisive topic through a historical lens to lay it all out in a column called: “Bike Touring is Not Bikepacking No Matter the Bags Used or Terrain Traversed.”</em></p>\n<p><em>Read our latest edition of The Dust Up below…</em><span></span></p>\n<p>Our comment threads are often full of great discourse, and one theme that seems to pop up whenever I review a touring bike is: what’s the difference between <em>bicycle touring</em> and <em>bikepacking</em>?

He even refers to his old photos as “mountain bike touring,” an activity that has been around since the birth of the mountain bike. </em></p>\n<p>This early bikepacking progression, stewarded forward by folks like Eric, had much to do with the fundamental shift in how mountain biking began versus how it evolved. In the early 1980s, almost every MTB frame had rack mounts. Their geometries were more relaxed to haul loads, and the riding positions were more upright. Many vintage photos show riders using panniers, handlebar rolls, portage strap bags, and even frame bags as they explored much of the California wilderness via overnighters and long mountain bike tours.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1400\" height=\"933\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG0082.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG0082.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1400w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG0082.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG0082.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG0082.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/IMG0082.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w\" /></p>\n<p><em>Photo via <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/wende-cragg-early-mountain-bike-photos/\" target=\"_blank\">Wende Cragg</a>‘s story she penned for us: “I learned to fly… on a mountain bike.”</em></p>\n<p>Bikes had free reign on all singletrack, even in wilderness areas, until congress passed HR1349 banning bikes in Wilderness in 1977. Many of these rides took an entire day to get from town to the “good stuff” so hauling your gear on hiking trails while riding was paramount.</p>\n<p>As NORBA and professional racing began to influence MTB designs, the geometries got more racing-oriented, with more aggressive riding positions, not in line with the more relaxed geometries of the 1980s, and the frames lost the rack mounts. This shift is a big reason why hardware-free bags came to be. How would you carry cargo if your bike didn’t have rack mounts?</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"999\" height=\"677\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/3766863_orig.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/3766863_orig.jpg?w=999&amp;quality=75 999w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/3766863_orig.jpg?resize=768,520&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/3766863_orig.jpg?resize=700,474&amp;quality=75 700w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"999\" height=\"664\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/8478124_orig.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/8478124_orig.jpg?w=999&amp;quality=75 999w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/8478124_orig.jpg?resize=768,510&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/8478124_orig.jpg?resize=700,465&amp;quality=75 700w\" /></p>\n<p><em>Photos by K.

Bicycle touring has long existed and refers to multiple terrain types, not just pavement. Even in Europe, a number of the classic tours are on mostly dirt. If anything, bikepacking and randonneuring–or timed, long-distance rides–are more closely related than bike touring is to bikepacking. So if bicycle touring is pleasure-oriented in a non-competitive space, then bikepacking is inherently competitive with others or oneself and performance-oriented…</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/07/LittleBeltsTour-13.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/07/LittleBeltsTour-13.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/07/LittleBeltsTour-13.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/07/LittleBeltsTour-13.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/07/LittleBeltsTour-13.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/07/LittleBeltsTour-13.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/07/LittleBeltsTour-13.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/07/LittleBeltsTour-13.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><em>Let me clarify; I do not look down upon bikepacking or performance riding. I’m a different pedal strokes for different folks kind of person. If anything, I would draw the line between touring being more of an external experience (friends, more active observation of surroundings via stopping to take photos/make food/swin, etc..) while bikepacking is a more internal, personal experience (pushing oneself, packing light, riding longer distances, stripping oneself down to the core, etc). One isn’t necessarily better or more wholesome than the other–we host stories on both sides of this coin–but they are different experiences and deserve different nomenclature.</em></p>\n<p>Chris Burkard, in our <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2023-rapha-yomp-rally-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Yomp Rally Reportage</a>, explained why he loves the individual-focused pursuit of ultra racing:</p>\n<blockquote><p><em>“I love where my mind goes, where my body goes and where my heart goes when I am on the fringe of my capabilities – I cannot find that kind of honesty with myself in any other situation.”</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Bike tours can be challenging, and honestly, that’s one of the best parts about a long bike tour, but racing is a different ballgame. If you value time spent in a group setting with a bunch of your friends traveling along a route, stopping to soak in the views, rolling into towns for a drink at a bar, eating snacks, and swimming in a nearby water hole, then chances are you’re on a bike tour.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2012/11/BKtoPHLLY-14.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2012/11/BKtoPHLLY-14.jpg?w=970&amp;quality=75 970w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2012/11/BKtoPHLLY-14.jpg?resize=768,475&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2012/11/BKtoPHLLY-14.jpg?resize=700,433&amp;quality=75 700w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"970\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2012/11/BKtoPHLLY-11.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2012/11/BKtoPHLLY-11.jpg?w=970&amp;quality=75 970w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2012/11/BKtoPHLLY-11.jpg?resize=768,475&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2012/11/BKtoPHLLY-11.jpg?resize=700,433&amp;quality=75 700w\" /></p>\n<p>Back in the early 2000s, when I was living in New York, I used to use Carradice bags to cycle tour on the various dirt towpaths from New York to Philadelphia every year in the fall to soak in the Northeast’s leaf change. I would pack everything I needed to bandit camp along the way in a simple handlebar and saddle bag. Later, in a small group, we’d do this annually for the Philly Bike Expo. These early trips set the hook for my love of traveling by bicycle and offered up an escape from the hustle and bustle of city living.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2019/10/2014-Oregon-Outback-35.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2019/10/2014-Oregon-Outback-35.jpg?w=1800&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2019/10/2014-Oregon-Outback-35.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2019/10/2014-Oregon-Outback-35.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2019/10/2014-Oregon-Outback-35.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2019/10/2014-Oregon-Outback-35.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2019/10/2014-Oregon-Outback-164.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2019/10/2014-Oregon-Outback-164.jpg?w=1800&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2019/10/2014-Oregon-Outback-164.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2019/10/2014-Oregon-Outback-164.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2019/10/2014-Oregon-Outback-164.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2019/10/2014-Oregon-Outback-164.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w\" /></p>\n<p><em>Oregon Outback, 2014</em></p>\n<p>My love for touring, on both dirt and pavement grew, and I began pushing deeper into the mountains, off the Adventure Cycling maps I used to guide my way, to soak in the vast grandeur of the Western United States.
