Influence campaigns are large-scale efforts to shift public opinion, push false narratives or change behaviors among a target population. <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-disinformation-foreign-influence-election-microsoft-7f802f9f4a0efe206fdaad29516b1f7f\">Russia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-voters-targeted-by-chinese-influence-online-researchers-say-2024-09-03/\">China</a>, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/09/12/justice-department-fbi-iran-trump-00178997\">Iran</a>, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/07/09/nx-s1-4994027/israel-us-online-influence-campaign-gaza\">Israel</a> and other nations have run these campaigns by exploiting <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/09/04/nx-s1-5100329/us-russia-election-interference-bots-2024\">social bots</a>, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russian-interference-presidential-election-influencers-trump-999435273dd39edf7468c6aa34fad5dd\">influencers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/social-media-platforms-leave-alleged-russian-influence-network-largely-untouched-2024-09-06/\">media companies</a> and <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesfarrell/2024/05/30/openai-disrupts-disinformation-campaigns-from-russia-china-using-its-systems-to-influence-public-opinion/\">generative AI</a>.</p>\n<p>At the Indiana University <a href=\"https://osome.iu.edu/\">Observatory on Social Media</a>, my colleagues <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&amp;user=f_kGJwkAAAAJ&amp;view_op=list_works&amp;sortby=pubdate\">and I</a> study influence campaigns and design technical solutions – algorithms – <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-017-0111-y\">to detect</a> and counter them. <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1609/icwsm.v15i1.18075\">State-of-the-art methods</a> developed in our center use several indicators of this type of online activity, which researchers call inauthentic coordinated behavior. We identify clusters of social media accounts that post in a synchronized fashion, amplify the same groups of users, share identical sets of links, images or hashtags, or perform <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1140/epjds/s13688-023-00410-9\">suspiciously similar sequences of actions</a>.</p>\n<p>We have uncovered many examples of coordinated inauthentic behavior. For example, we found accounts that flood the network with tens or hundreds of thousands of posts in a single day. The same campaign can post a message with one account and then have other accounts that its organizers also control “like” and “unlike” it hundreds of times in a short time span. Once the campaign achieves its objective, all these messages can be <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1609/icwsm.v16i1.19355\">deleted to evade detection</a>. Using these tricks, foreign governments and their agents can manipulate social media algorithms that determine what is trending and what is engaging to decide what users see in their feeds.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/how-foreign-influence-campaigns-manipulate-your-social-media-feeds/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/10/how-foreign-influence-campaigns-manipulate-your-social-media-feeds/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Filippo Menczer, The Conversation","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"53bc6df9d932300d33ce2402009d4d3f016346739474b1d258bbc80efafa9812","category":"Tech"}
