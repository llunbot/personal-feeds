These components not only provided an\nauthentic look and feel but also remained fully functional, with:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A power switch for system activation.</li>\n<li>A reading on/off switch to engage or disable the Woe display.</li>\n<li>A manual override switch to cycle through needle positions if\nwireless control failed.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When I watched this episode, I remember noticing how cool the device seemed. It turns out to be even cooler than I thought. So much effort into such a little thing. And the coolest thing is that, in a sense, the WoeMeter actually <em>works</em> as a handheld wireless prop.</p>\n\n<p>Reusing those Nagra dials to add verisimilitude reminds me of how much of <em>Star Wars</em> came from reused pieces of old gadgetry, like two of the lightsabers (Luke’s and Vader’s) <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-42369174\">being made from 1940s-era Graflex camera flash guns</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/04/lumon-industries-woemeter\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"30beb767bf138c362895fb4ef57c6b65b4d8b8ff4dbe771dc76b979aadd7ca85","category":"Tech"}
