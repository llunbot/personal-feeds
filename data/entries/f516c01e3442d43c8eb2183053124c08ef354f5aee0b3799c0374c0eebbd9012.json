Their all-new Motive brakes take everything the brand learned from developing their <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/sram-maven-dh-disc-brake-initial-review/\" target=\"_blank\">most-powerful-ever</a> Maven brakes, and made them lighter to serve mountain bikers from all disciplines. You get Code-like power, but Level-like weight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SRAM figures that trail and all-mountain riders that would have picked Codes in the past will benefit from a bit more power, lighter weight, and easier maintenance. Since XC keeps getting more and more technical, they too will benefit from a significant braking power boost, and just a small weight compromise over the previous <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/srams-new-level-ultimate-and-tlm-brakes-provide-more-power-with-less-weight/\" target=\"_blank\">Level</a> series. In reality, those weight weenies can still tune their setup with smaller &amp; lighter rotors than before while still being able to go faster and brake later thanks to more brake power..</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s new?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Motive-all-new-lightweight-powerful-4-piston-mineral-oil-mountain-bike-brakes_chiselled-caliper-design.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Motive-all-new-lightweight-powerful-4-piston-mineral-oil-mountain-bike-brakes_chiselled-caliper-design.webp\" alt=\"SRAM Motive all-new lightweight powerful 4-piston mineral oil mountain bike brakes, sculpted caliper inspired by Code\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Motive-all-new-lightweight-powerful-4-piston-mineral-oil-mountain-bike-brakes_chiselled-caliper-design.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Motive-all-new-lightweight-powerful-4-piston-mineral-oil-mountain-bike-brakes_chiselled-caliper-design-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Motive-all-new-lightweight-powerful-4-piston-mineral-oil-mountain-bike-brakes_chiselled-caliper-design-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Motive-all-new-lightweight-powerful-4-piston-mineral-oil-mountain-bike-brakes_chiselled-caliper-design-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Motive-all-new-lightweight-powerful-4-piston-mineral-oil-mountain-bike-brakes_chiselled-caliper-design-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Motive-all-new-lightweight-powerful-4-piston-mineral-oil-mountain-bike-brakes_chiselled-caliper-design-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Motive-all-new-lightweight-powerful-4-piston-mineral-oil-mountain-bike-brakes_chiselled-caliper-design-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>SRAM sculpted away a lot of the mass that makes Mavens so beefy while retaining the power of 4-piston braking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These new brakes all feature the same DirectLink actuation from Level &amp; Guide braking to keep weight to a minimum and deliver a linear braking feel. Now, with all-new seal designs, they run exclusively on mineral oil, which means they won’t absorb water like DOT fluid does. As a result, SRAM now recommends bleeding only every other year. Of course, you’ll need all-new bleed kits if you maintain your own bikes, though.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Motive-all-new-lightweight-powerful-4-piston-mineral-oil-mountain-bike-brakes_stealth-bar-routing.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Motive-all-new-lightweight-powerful-4-piston-mineral-oil-mountain-bike-brakes_stealth-bar-routing.webp\" alt=\"SRAM Motive all-new lightweight powerful 4-piston mineral oil mountain bike brakes, Stealth routing inspired by Level\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Motive-all-new-lightweight-powerful-4-piston-mineral-oil-mountain-bike-brakes_stealth-bar-routing.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Motive-all-new-lightweight-powerful-4-piston-mineral-oil-mountain-bike-brakes_stealth-bar-routing-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Motive-all-new-lightweight-powerful-4-piston-mineral-oil-mountain-bike-brakes_stealth-bar-routing-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Motive-all-new-lightweight-powerful-4-piston-mineral-oil-mountain-bike-brakes_stealth-bar-routing-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/SRAM-Motive-all-new-lightweight-powerful-4-piston-mineral-oil-mountain-bike-brakes_stealth-bar-routing-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Motive calipers take on a more angular, all-new aesthetic, kind of reshaping the long-running <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/all-new-sram-code-brakes-follow-the-guides-to-more-power-and-better-braking/\" target=\"_blank\">Code</a> caliper.
