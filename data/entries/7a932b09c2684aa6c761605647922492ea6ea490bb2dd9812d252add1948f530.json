{"title":"Don’t Fret: WTB Plans to Keep 29+ Tires in Its Catalog","link":"https://theradavist.com/2021/10/dont-fret-wtb-plans-to-keep-29-tires-in-its-catalog/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=dont-fret-wtb-plans-to-keep-29-tires-in-its-catalog","date":1634345697000,"content":"<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2020/05/ENVE-Mountain-Fork-1.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>So there’s been a lot of chatter on this website about the availability of 29×3″ tires and I can finally share what <a href=\"https://www.wtb.com/\" target=\"_blank\">WTB</a>‘s 29+ offering will be later this year and into 2022. The official word from WTB is that 29×3 is here to stay, with the following coming in soon:</p>\n<p>-Ranger 2.8 x 27.5″ TCS Light/Fast Rolling 60tpi Dual DNA SG2 tire<br />\n-Ranger 3.0 x 29″ TCS Light/Fast Rolling 60tpi Dual DNA SG2 tire<br />\n-Vigilante 2.8 x 27.5″ TCS Tough/Fast Rolling 60tpi TriTec E25 tire</p>\n<p>If you’re like me, who invested in a 29+ tourer, you can breathe a sigh of relief. Many thanks to WTB for believing in us chonky weirdos. xo</p>\n<p>Also, you don’t need to do anything at the moment but be patient. They’re hoping the 29×3″ Rangers will land in December so you don’t have to email them or anything…</p>\n<p>Enjoy the weekend!</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"7a932b09c2684aa6c761605647922492ea6ea490bb2dd9812d252add1948f530","category":"Cycling"}
