The research serves as an instructive case study on the mathematical limitations of SR models, despite sometimes grandiose marketing claims from AI vendors.</p>\n<p>What sets <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/openai-announces-o3-and-o3-mini-its-next-simulated-reasoning-models/\">simulated reasoning models</a> apart from traditional large language models (LLMs) is that they have been trained to output a step-by-step \"thinking\" process (often called \"<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903\">chain-of-thought</a>\") to solve problems. Note that \"simulated\" in this case doesn't mean that the models do not reason at all but rather that they do not necessarily reason using the same techniques as humans. That distinction is important because human reasoning itself is difficult to define.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/new-study-shows-why-simulated-reasoning-ai-models-dont-yet-live-up-to-their-billing/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/new-study-shows-why-simulated-reasoning-ai-models-dont-yet-live-up-to-their-billing/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0599c3a0035a9db4942716952839d37c5b0f176bc89e0736b2f331b606129497","category":"Tech"}
