That's the somewhat ironic recommendation Google, one of the world's largest Internet companies, is making to its employees. <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/18/google-restricting-internet-access-to-some-employees-for-security.html\">CNBC's Jennifer Elias</a> reports that Google is \"starting a new pilot program where some employees will be restricted to Internet-free desktop PCs\" while they work. An internal memo seen by CNBC notes that “Googlers are frequent targets of attacks” by criminals, and a great way to combat that is to not be on the Internet.</p>\n<p>Employees that work at major tech companies are a much richer target for criminals compared to normal people. Tech company employees have all sorts of access to sensitive data, and compromising a single employee could lead to exploiting sensitive infrastructure. Just last week, Microsoft <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/07/how-a-cloud-flaw-gave-chinese-spies-a-key-to-microsofts-kingdom/\">was targeted</a> by a Chinese espionage hacking group that somehow stole a cryptographic key to bypass Microsoft's authentication systems, giving it access to 25 organizations, including multiple government agencies.</p>\n<p>The report says Google's new pilot program \"will disable Internet access on the select desktops, with the exception of internal web-based tools and Google-owned websites like Google Drive and Gmail.\" This was originally mandatory for the 2,500 employees that were selected, but after \"receiving feedback\"—we're going to assume that was very <em>enthusiastic</em> feedback—Google is letting employees opt out of the program. The company also wants some employees to work without root access, which is common sense for a lot of computer roles, but not really for developers, which are used to being able to install new programs and tools.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1955186#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1955186&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e749a24945c5abec77359ac16bf84897b9e608ab80fafe9528301de02c163da9","category":"Tech"}
