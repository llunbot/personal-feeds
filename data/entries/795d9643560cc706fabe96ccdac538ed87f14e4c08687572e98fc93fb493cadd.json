These instances are ideal for running compute-intensive workloads such as <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/batch\">batch processing</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/\">machine learning</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/gaming\">high-end gaming</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/hpc\">high performance computing (HPC)</a> workloads, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/advertising-marketing/advertising-technology/\">ad serving</a>, and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/media/tech/accelerated-video-transcoding/\">video encoding</a>.</p> \n<p>Compared to C5 instances using an Intel processor, this new instance type provides:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Up to <strong>15%</strong> improvement in compute price performance.</li> \n <li>Up to <strong>9%</strong> higher memory bandwidth.</li> \n <li>Up to <strong>40 Gbps</strong> for <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ebs/\">Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS)</a> and <strong>50 Gbps</strong> for networking.</li> \n <li>Always-on <strong>memory encryption</strong>.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>Like M6i, C6i instances are available in 9 sizes:</p> \n<table> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td>Name</td> \n   <td>vCPUs</td> \n   <td>Memory<br /> (GiB)</td> \n   <td>Network Bandwidth<br /> (Gbps)</td> \n   <td>EBS Throughput<br /> (Gbps)</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>c6i.large</strong></td> \n   <td>2</td> \n   <td>4</td> \n   <td>Up to 12.5</td> \n   <td>Up to 10</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>c6i.xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>4</td> \n   <td>8</td> \n   <td>Up to 12.5</td> \n   <td>Up to 10</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>c6i.2xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>8</td> \n   <td>16</td> \n   <td>Up to 12.5</td> \n   <td>Up to 10</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>c6i.4xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>16</td> \n   <td>32</td> \n   <td>Up to 12.5</td> \n   <td>Up to 10</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>c6i.8xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>32</td> \n   <td>64</td> \n   <td>12.5</td> \n   <td>10</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>c6i.12xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>48</td> \n   <td>96</td> \n   <td>18.75</td> \n   <td>15</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>c6i.16xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>64</td> \n   <td>128</td> \n   <td>25</td> \n   <td>20</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>c6i.24xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>96</td> \n   <td>192</td> \n   <td>37.5</td> \n   <td>30</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>c6i.32xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>128</td> \n   <td>256</td> \n   <td>50</td> \n   <td>40</td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>The new instances are built on the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/\">AWS Nitro System</a>, a collection of building blocks that offloads many of the traditional virtualization functions to dedicated hardware for high performance, high availability, and highly secure cloud instances.</p> \n<p>As you should do with M6i instances, for optimal networking performance, upgrade your Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) drivers to version 3.

Virginia, Ohio), US West (Oregon), and EU (Ireland). As usual with EC2, you pay for what you use.
