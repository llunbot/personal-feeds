NUDL was created by Christopher Bohannon, who previously designed helmets for Nutcase before the brand folded in 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>NUDL products launched last Spring, with their kid’s helmets featuring both MIPS and Twiceme technology to enhance safety. The Twiceme and GPS functions allow parents to keep an eye on their kid’s whereabouts while they’re pedalling around the neighborhood.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>NUDL Youth MIPS Helmets:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NUDL-Youth-MIPS-Helmets-back.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"801\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NUDL-Youth-MIPS-Helmets-back.webp\" alt=\"NUDL Youth MIPS helmets, back\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NUDL-Youth-MIPS-Helmets-back.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NUDL-Youth-MIPS-Helmets-back-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NUDL-Youth-MIPS-Helmets-back-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NUDL-Youth-MIPS-Helmets-back-768x513.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NUDL-Youth-MIPS-Helmets-back-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NUDL-Youth-MIPS-Helmets-back-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All NUDL Youth MIPS helmets feature bucket/skateboarding style shells, with a traditional vent layout for this style of helmet. As indicated by the name, MIPS liners are included in all youth helmets to reduce rotational forces on the brain in a crash.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The helmets are constructed with ABS Shells and EPS liners. Since infants fall differently than older kids, a softer density EPS foam is used for NUDL’s infant helmets vs. their youth helmets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two sizes of the Youth MIPS Helmet are available – Youth Small (52-56cm) and Youth Medium (56-60cm). NUDL’s helmets include a dial-operated PAS (Precision Adjust System) retention system to ensure a snug, secure fit.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NUDL-Youth-MIPS-Helmets-Twiceme-info.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"677\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NUDL-Youth-MIPS-Helmets-Twiceme-info.webp\" alt=\"NUDL Youth MIPS helmets, Twiceme info\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NUDL-Youth-MIPS-Helmets-Twiceme-info.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NUDL-Youth-MIPS-Helmets-Twiceme-info-297x168.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NUDL-Youth-MIPS-Helmets-Twiceme-info-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NUDL-Youth-MIPS-Helmets-Twiceme-info-768x433.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to MIPS, NUDL is including Twiceme technology on their kid’s helmets. An integrated Twiceme chip allows you to store up to three emergency contact numbers and personal medical information in the helmet. In an emergency, the info can be accessed by anyone who has the Twiceme app on their smartphone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Parents can also use GPS tracking to monitor your kid’s whereabouts, and set geo-fence boundaries to be alerted if your kid ventures beyond them.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NUDL-Youth-MIPS-Helmets-Fidlock-graphic.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1031\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NUDL-Youth-MIPS-Helmets-Fidlock-graphic.webp\" alt=\"NUDL Youth MIPS helmets, Fidlock graphic\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NUDL-Youth-MIPS-Helmets-Fidlock-graphic.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NUDL-Youth-MIPS-Helmets-Fidlock-graphic-297x255.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NUDL-Youth-MIPS-Helmets-Fidlock-graphic-120x103.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NUDL-Youth-MIPS-Helmets-Fidlock-graphic-768x660.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>NUDL chose Fidlock magnetic buckles for their helmets for two reasons. First, they’re easy to operate, even with one hand. Second, their pinch-free design ensures your young rider won’t pinch their neck and not want to wear a helmet again! The ‘Y’ adjusters on the sides of the straps are a self-locking type, which should be easy to adjust.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pricing and Availability:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NUDL-Youth-MIPS-Helmets-dinosaurs.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"988\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NUDL-Youth-MIPS-Helmets-dinosaurs.webp\" alt=\"NUDL Youth MIPS helmets, dinosaurs\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NUDL-Youth-MIPS-Helmets-dinosaurs.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NUDL-Youth-MIPS-Helmets-dinosaurs-297x245.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NUDL-Youth-MIPS-Helmets-dinosaurs-120x99.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/NUDL-Youth-MIPS-Helmets-dinosaurs-768x632.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>*Images c.
