It’s been a while after a hiatus for the Giro d’Italia <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-2023\" target=\"_blank\">rest day recaps</a>, but normal service has resumed. The <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/criterium-du-dauphine-preview\" target=\"_blank\">Critérium du Dauphiné</a> is currently ongoing and I think a lot of us enjoyed seeing Julian Alaphilippe (Soudal-QuickStep) win the second stage into La Chaise-Dieu. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1.

In a press conference on Monday, Bossuyt said she would prove she is ‘not a cheater’ and that this is an issue of contamination.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Letrozole can be used to treat breast cancer and is a banned drug on the World <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/doping-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">Anti-Doping</a> Agency Prohibited List due to its potential use with anabolic steroids to avoid adverse effects and/or boost testosterone production. Belgian cyclocross rider Toon Aerts also tested positive for Letrozole in an out-of-competition sample in 2022 and claims it was due to contamination. He faces a two-year suspension.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><p><a href=\"https://t.co/iWTlodms17\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/iWTlodms17</a></p>— Aerts Toon (@ToAerts) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ToAerts/status/1665270199346663424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">June 4, 2023</a></blockquote> </div>\n\n\n\n<p>Aerts tweeted his support for Bossuyt, saying, ‘We are one year on, I’m still deep in misery, and unfortunately there is another case. I can imagine so well what Shari is going through now. This shouldn’t happen. Another athlete, who is also human, who will go through a deep valley with her whole family.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canyon-SRAM stated they have a ‘zero tolerance’ approach to doping and will await the decision of the French Anti-Doping Agency (AFLD) before taking further action.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2.

Bahrain Victorious sign Antonio Tiberi</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><p><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f917.png\" alt=\"🤗\" /> Welcome, Antonio Tiberi!<br /><br /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/270d.png\" alt=\"✍\" /> Team Bahrain Victorious has signed former junior World Champion <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AntonioTiberi4?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">@AntonioTiberi4</a> until the end of the 2025 season.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/RideAsOne?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">#RideAsOne</a><br /><br /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f517.png\" alt=\"🔗\" /> <a href=\"https://t.co/T15rTWWaLm\" target=\"_blank\">https://t.co/T15rTWWaLm</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Z4Eh8t8xIa\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/Z4Eh8t8xIa</a></p>— Team Bahrain Victorious (@BHRVictorious) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BHRVictorious/status/1664299424602894339?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">June 1, 2023</a></blockquote> </div>\n\n\n\n<p>Antonio Tiberi, who was fined €4,000 after killing the San Marino Minister of Tourism’s cat with an air rifle, has been signed by Bahrain Victorious. The 21-year-old was initially <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/2023-pro-cycling-vuelta-femenina\" target=\"_blank\">suspended by former team Trek-Segafredo</a> in March, but actions during his suspension apparently resulted in the termination of his contract.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bahrain Victorious announced their new signing by saying his opportunities this season have been ‘limited’, but that Tiberi can thrive in their environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4.

The news comes after <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-2023\" target=\"_blank\">Gee lit up the Giro d’Italia</a> through breakaways and second-places galore in both stages and classifications. The 25-year-old Canadian ultimately won the overall combativity award.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gee said, ‘So many second places made me extremely hungry to get that first win and hopefully one day get a stage win in a Grand Tour. I’d like to continue to develop without necessarily picking something to specialise in, and just see which direction racing takes me in as a rider.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m looking forward to seeing it.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pro-cycling-sponsors\">Who actually are the pro cycling team sponsors?</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/no-slowing-down-greg-lemond-profile\">No slowing down: Greg LeMond profile</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-best-cycling-documentaries\">The best cycling documentaries</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>5. <em>The Last Rider</em>: A new Greg LeMond documentary </h2>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-best-cycling-documentaries\" target=\"_blank\">Cycling documentaries</a> are booming.
