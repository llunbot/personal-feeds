Under its ATT framework, users are able to choose whether they wish to be tracked for ads or other marketing purposes. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\"Some apps have trackers embedded in them that are taking more data than they need,\" Apple explains in a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Ihw_Al4RNno\">promotional video</a>. \"Sharing it with third parties, like advertisers and data brokers... This has been happening without your knowledge or permission. Your information is for sale. You have become the product.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple was on the receiving end of similar complaints last month from Mark Zuckerberg, who <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/26/apple-privacy-rules-blame-facebook-earnings/\">blamed</a> Apple's privacy changes for lower-than-expected quarterly growth during an earnings call for Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook. The Meta CEO claimed the changes \"not only [negatively affect] our business, but millions of small businesses in what is already a difficult time for them in the economy.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to one <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/01/apple-privacy-social-media-companies/\">report</a>, Apple has cost social media companies including Meta,  Twitter, Snapchat, and YouTube, nearly $10 billion in revenue in the second half of 2021. But Peloton has more to be concerned about when it comes to Apple, which this week expanded Fitness+, its own home fitness service offering, to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/03/apple-fitness-in-15-new-countries/\">15 additional countries</a>. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nPeloton shares have dropped nearly 20% since Apple showcased new Apple Fitness+ features at its September event. In a clear sign of investor unease at Apple's creep into the fitness market, reports earlier in the week <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/news/3763062-peloton-falls-as-apple-secures-design-patent-for-fitness\">linked</a> a dip in Peloton shares to a <a href=\"https://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?docid=D0934902&amp;SectionNum=2&amp;IDKey=7B3AABAE402C&amp;HomeUrl=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2%2526Sect2=HITOFF%2526p=1%2526u=%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsearch-bool.html%2526r=8%2526f=G%2526l=50%2526co1=AND%2526d=PTXT%2526s1=apple%2526s2=2021%24.PD.%2526OS=apple%252BAND%252BISD/2021%2526RS=apple%252BAND%252BISD/2021\">patent approval</a> for Apple's Fitness+ app, which features HIIT, Yoga, Core, and other workouts taught by trainers, similar to Peloton classes.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/peloton/\">Peloton</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-tracking-transparency/\">App Tracking Transparency</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/05/peloton-says-apple-privacy-changes-hurt-business/\">Peloton Says Apple's Privacy Rules Limit Its Ability to Gain Subscribers</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/peloton-says-apples-privacy-rules-limit-its-ability-to-gain-subscribers.2321892/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=r0CLd982TQs:y0DajTzxHUI:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=r0CLd982TQs:y0DajTzxHUI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/r0CLd982TQs\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4cdd3ca3577ef5e155299f0196a3732f1a72df5a1344b29a9340ae17fd79d17b","category":"Apple"}
