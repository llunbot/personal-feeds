Both the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/aging/publications/features/lonely-older-adults.html\">CDC</a> and the U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek H. Murthy issued statements warning the public about the spread and serious physical and mental health implications of loneliness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Murthy wrote in the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/30/opinion/loneliness-epidemic-america.html\" target=\"_blank\">New York Times</a>, “At any moment, about one out of every two Americans <a href=\"https://newsroom.thecignagroup.com/loneliness-epidemic-persists-post-pandemic-look\" target=\"_blank\">is experiencing</a> measurable <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31203639/\" target=\"_blank\">levels of loneliness</a>. This includes introverts and extroverts, rich and poor, and younger and older Americans. Sometimes loneliness is set off by the loss of a loved one or a job, a move to a new city, or health or financial difficulties — or a once-in-a-century pandemic.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Medical school student Andrew Mohama decided to embark on a solo <a href=\"https://gearjunkie.com/biking/gravel/marin-four-corners-2-gravel-bike-review\">bikepacking</a> journey from San Francisco to Chicago during a 2-month break from classes. Along the way, in small, dispersed rural towns, Mohama asked random people he ran into three simple, yet complex, questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“How do you feel about community?”<br />“What do you not have that you wish you had?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Do you experience loneliness?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mohama’s focus was to listen intently, thus the film title, “The Bike Listening Tour” from Nate Mitka/<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@PuffyPatchFilms\">Puffy Patch Films</a>. Watch his eye- and mind-opening travels, as you may find the public’s answers and his observations and conclusions to be surprising.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This post originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.gearjunkie.com\">gearjunkie.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/the-bike-listening-tour-video-about-loneliness/\">The Bike Listening Tour: Riding 2,500 Miles to Learn About Loneliness &amp; Community</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Seiji Ishii","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"0adeb37ef399f0a6cdc13273e3a06b2b5e8c871b470f0ddcfeac7d9285e02682","category":"Cycling"}
