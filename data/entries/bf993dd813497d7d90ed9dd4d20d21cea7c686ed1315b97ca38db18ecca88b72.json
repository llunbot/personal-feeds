The beta 2 includes a new Coverage section in the General System Settings. This includes AppleCare information about the Mac and any connected Apple Bluetooth accessories. It’s similar to the Coverage section in iOS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week, Apple released the 14.1 beta 1 that introduced the new Favorites feature for Apple Music. Favorite songs, artists, albums, and playlists will be added to your library and factor into song suggestions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-14_1-release-notes&amp;xcust=1-1-2084160-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">developer release notes</a>, 14.2 contains a fix for an issue where Remote Widgets appear blank when an iPhone and Mac are running mismatched operating systems (for example, iOS 16 instead of iOS 17, and macOS Sonoma). The notes also recommend two workarounds that developers can use for issues with Wallet and WidgetKit. Here are the release notes for developers, though they are aimed at developers and their tools or reports; this release may have more features or changes than what is contained here.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Remote Widgets</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Resolved Issues</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed: Remote Widgets might render blank on mismatched iOS and macOS releases.
