{"title":"CloudSLAW","link":"https://slaw.securosis.com/?utm_source=df","date":1710703965000,"content":"\n<p>My thanks to Rich Mogull for sponsoring DF last week to promote CloudSLAW — Cloud Security Lab a Week. He wants to make cloud security knowledge accessible to anyone, with or without security or cloud experience, for free. CloudSLAW delivers a 15-30 minute lab to your inbox, RSS feed, or YouTube. You don’t need to be a tech pro, but, as Rich says, it helps to know the difference between an API and an IPA.</p>\n\n<p>Rich has taught cloud security around the world for over a decade. He’s also one of the preeminent writers about security issues in general, and Apple platforms particularly. If you’re a regular reader, you probably recognize his name: I’ve linked to articles by Rich <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/search/rich+mogull\">dozens of times over the years</a>, and <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2019/02/15/ep-243\">he was my guest on The Talk Show</a> just a few years ago. He knows his shit and he’s great at explaining it. CloudSLAW is his attempt to help anyone go from zero to hero on cloud security. Go ahead and sign up now — it’s free of charge.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/17/cloudslaw\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"eec5f7a17fa011afb1f697d7ebb8144f0c5ba480ba6f8109bac70abded2f3285","category":"Tech"}
