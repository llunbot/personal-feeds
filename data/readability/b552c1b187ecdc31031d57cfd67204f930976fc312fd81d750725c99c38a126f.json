It was big news, but not exactly the most earth-shattering. Then, three years later, Pon acquired a completely different kind of bike brand – <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2015/07/04/interview-dont-call-them-a-sellout-santa-cruz-bikes-joins-pon-holding-group/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Santa Cruz Bikes</a>. Now, all of a sudden it seemed like more people were paying attention. Santa Cruz didn’t seem like a brand that would have even been for sale in the first place, let alone to join along side Cervelo in a corporate portfolio. Fast forward to August of this year, and Pon made another eye-catching business move by purchasing the Northern-California bicycle shop chain, Mike’s Bikes.</p><p>Today, the Netherlands-based bike giant Pon Holdings announced one of its biggest purchases yet. With the addition of another US-based bicycle giant, Dorel Sports. The move creates a massive bike conglomerate, with a projected combined revenue of around $2.9 billion.</p><p>The sale includes Dorel Industries’ bicycle segment, Dorel Sports, which owns <a href=\"https://www.cannondale.com/en-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cannondale</a> and <a href=\"http://www.schwinn.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Schwinn</a>, among other high-profile brands. With it, and their recent addition of Mike’s Bikes, Pon theoretically has the ability to offer a bike shop experience where they own everything soup to nuts, with just about every type of bicycle as well.</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23232124/Cannondale-Super-Six-CX-Force-1-Logo-.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23232124/Cannondale-Super-Six-CX-Force-1-Logo-.jpeg 640w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23232124/Cannondale-Super-Six-CX-Force-1-Logo--297x198.jpeg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23232124/Cannondale-Super-Six-CX-Force-1-Logo--120x80.jpeg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/23232124/Cannondale-Super-Six-CX-Force-1-Logo--630x420.jpeg 630w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\"></p><p>By and large, the ebike market fuels Pon.Bike. The entity got its de facto start in 2012 when Pon Holdings bought experienced Dutch ebike brand <a href=\"https://propelbikes.com/brand/gazelle/?utm_source=bing&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=gazelle&amp;utm_term=gazelle%20electric%20bikes&amp;utm_campaign=Gazelle+%7C+Search&amp;utm_source=bing&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;hsa_acc=1011347387&amp;hsa_cam=11837168298&amp;hsa_grp=1158886010386292&amp;hsa_ad=&amp;hsa_src=o&amp;hsa_tgt=kwd-72430883987656:loc-4126&amp;hsa_kw=gazelle%20electric%20bikes&amp;hsa_mt=e&amp;hsa_net=adwords&amp;hsa_ver=3&amp;msclkid=ddac3cec20ee160a55d65d88a87bbb7a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gazelle</a>. From there, it added international brands like <a href=\"https://www.kalkhoff-bikes.com/en_gb/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kalkhoff</a> and <a href=\"https://www.focus-bikes.com/int/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Focus</a>, <a href=\"https://www.santacruzbicycles.com/en-US\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Santa Cruz</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cervelo.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cervélo</a> in the United States. Eventually, it reached $1.5 billion in revenue (with 70% of that from e-bikes).</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/05005458/Santa-Cruz-Chameleon-custom-1.jpg\" alt=\"Santa Cruz Chameleon, custom 1\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/05005458/Santa-Cruz-Chameleon-custom-1.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/05005458/Santa-Cruz-Chameleon-custom-1-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/05005458/Santa-Cruz-Chameleon-custom-1-120x80.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/05005458/Santa-Cruz-Chameleon-custom-1-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\"></p><p>Along with Cannondale and Schwinn, Dorel’s portfolio includes <a href=\"https://www.mongoose.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mongoose</a>, <a href=\"https://www.gtbicycles.com/usa_en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GT</a>, <a href=\"https://www.chargebikes.com/?msclkid=669ed3b72fdb1395dea6b2d3a0e10f4f&amp;utm_source=bing&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=NE%20%7C%20Brand%20%7C%20Relaunch%207.14.21&amp;utm_term=charge%20bikes&amp;utm_content=Brand\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Charge</a>, <a href=\"https://caloi.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Caloi</a>, and KidTrax (which competes with Fisher-Price’s Power Wheels). It’s a significant addition for Pon in the United States, where the company boasted $1.2 billion in revenue. But Caloi’s popularity in Brazil supports its growth worldwide.</p><p>Pon cites sustainability and urban transportation as priorities, especially in the e-bike market.</p><p>“Biking is not only healthy, it also plays a critical role in fighting inner-city congestion,” said Janus Smalbraak, CEO of Pon Holdings. “It’s one of the most sustainable ways of transport. We are determined to make bikes a powerful part of mobility.”</p><p>In a statement, the company said it hopes its existing ebike experience will translate into better sales in the category for its new holdings. Notably, new Pon.Bike brand Cannondale <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021/09/08/2022-cannondale-tesoro-neo-x-movaro-neo-ebikes-load-up-for-the-daily-commute/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">recently updated its electric lineup</a>.</p><div id=\"attachment_274362\"><p><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-274362\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/11154125/shutterstock_4675755621-700x467-1.jpg\" alt=\"dorel sports acquisition\" width=\"700\" height=\"467\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/11154125/shutterstock_4675755621-700x467-1.jpg 700w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/11154125/shutterstock_4675755621-700x467-1-297x198.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/11154125/shutterstock_4675755621-700x467-1-120x80.jpg 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-274362\">(photo/Markus Mainka, Shutterstock)</p></div><p>The purchase, which will not include any of Dorel’s cash or debt, will cost Pon Holdings $810 million. Board members of both companies unanimously approved the move, which should finalize during the first quarter of 2022. The seven new brands bring Pon.Bike’s total to 19.</p><p>Conversely, Dorel Industries effectively leaves the cycling industry with the sale. It said it will use the estimated proceeds of the deal — an estimated $735 million — to reduce debt and return capital to shareholders. Its future plans focus on expanding margins in its home furnishings and juvenile products businesses.</p><blockquote><p>“Today’s step is a milestone in the creation of a world-leading bike company with a variety of quality brands,” Smalbraak said. “We have now reached a highlight with the acquisition of Dorel Sports. They have a rich history with their iconic bike brands all with an impressive heritage. Dorel Sports really is complementary to Pon.Bike and that’s why this is such a logical step.”</p></blockquote></section></article></div></div>","author":"Sam Anderson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"b552c1b187ecdc31031d57cfd67204f930976fc312fd81d750725c99c38a126f","category":"Cycling"}
