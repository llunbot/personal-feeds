Along the way, people's existing skepticism toward online content from strangers may be reaching new heights.</p>\n\n<p>Deep doubt is skepticism of real media that stems from the existence of generative AI. This manifests as broad public skepticism toward the veracity of media artifacts, which in turn leads to a notable consequence: People can now more credibly claim that real events did not happen and suggest that documentary evidence was fabricated using AI tools.</p>\n<p>The concept behind \"deep doubt\" isn't new, but its real-world impact is becoming increasingly apparent. Since the term \"deepfake\" first surfaced in 2017, we've seen a rapid evolution in AI-generated media capabilities. This has led to recent examples of deep doubt in action, such as conspiracy theorists claiming that President Joe Biden has been <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/08/the-conspiracy-theorists-who-think-biden-has-been-replaced-by-ai/\">replaced by an AI-powered hologram</a> and former President Donald Trump's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/08/the-many-many-signs-that-kamala-harris-rally-crowds-arent-ai-creations/\">baseless accusation</a> in August that Vice President Kamala Harris used AI to fake crowd sizes at her rallies. And on Friday, Trump <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/09/06/now-trump-says-photo-him-with-e-jean-carroll-is-ai/\">cried \"AI\" again</a> at a photo of him with E. Jean Carroll, a writer who successfully sued him for sexual assault, that contradicts his claim of never having met her.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042584#p3\">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042584&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4488b786f52cc81077bbadd684add5ea612b19c9675c63d6aa17308031b7b1a2","category":"Tech"}
