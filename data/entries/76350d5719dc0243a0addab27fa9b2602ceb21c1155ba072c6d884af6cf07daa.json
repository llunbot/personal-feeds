We could get thinner laptops, for one. We could also potentially squeeze more performance out of today's already impressively thin designs.</p>\n<p>That's what San Jose, California startup Frore Systems is trying to convince laptop makers of as it looks for the first OEM to adopt what it describes as the first solid-state active cooling chip.</p>\n<p>Most recently, the company equipped the M2 15-inch MacBook Air with three of its chips, dubbed AirJet Minis. Media witnesses to a recent demonstration reported that the chips helped bring MacBook Pro-comparable performance to sustained heavy workloads on the MacBook Air.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1986932#p3\">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1986932&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"76350d5719dc0243a0addab27fa9b2602ceb21c1155ba072c6d884af6cf07daa","category":"Tech"}
