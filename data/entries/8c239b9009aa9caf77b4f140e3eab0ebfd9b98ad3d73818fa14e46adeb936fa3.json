More than 500,000 people have already added a driver's license or ID to the California DMV Wallet app, where California tested the option before starting to roll it out to the Wallet app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple announced California's Wallet license plans <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/15/iphone-drivers-license-california-soon/\">back in August</a>, and said that it was working with California to bring IDs to Apple Wallet.<blockquote>\"We're excited to be working with the state of California to bring IDs in Apple Wallet to Apple's home state soon, and provide residents with an easy, secure, and private way to present their California driver's license and state ID in person and in app using Apple Wallet,\" said Jennifer Bailey, Apple's vice president of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet. \"Whether using IDs in Apple Wallet to breeze through travel, or to securely verify age or identity at businesses, California driver's licenses and state IDs in Apple Wallet make ID presentment seamless - all with the security built into iPhone and Apple Watch.\"</blockquote>\r<br />\nIDs and licenses stored in the Wallet app on ‌iPhone‌ or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> can be used for TSA screenings at select airports (including SFO, LAX, and SJC) and for age verification at select stores. Right now, California's mobile wallet support is still in an early stage, and only 1.5 million participants are able to sign up.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/California?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#California</a> residents can now present their ID in Apple Wallet on iPhone and Apple Watch at select TSA checkpoints when departing from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/flyLAXairport?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@flyLAXairport</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/flySFO?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@flySFO</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FlySJC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@FlySJC</a>.<br />Not a CA resident?

So far, only Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, Hawaii, and Ohio have implemented support. Apple said in 2022 that Connecticut, Iowa, Kentucky, Oklahoma, and Utah are working on support, and today added that Montana, New Mexico, and West Virginia also plan to adopt the functionality. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-wallet/\">Apple Wallet</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/19/iphone-drivers-license-wallet-app-california/\">iPhone Driver's License Support Expands to More Californians</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-drivers-license-support-expands-to-more-californians.2437074/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8c239b9009aa9caf77b4f140e3eab0ebfd9b98ad3d73818fa14e46adeb936fa3","category":"Apple"}
