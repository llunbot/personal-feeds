Courtney recently parted ways with the SCOTT-SRAM program, which she called home for the past six years. This new collaboration, however, hits a little closer to home and highlights Courtney’s mission-driven initiative to empower women and girls through mountain biking—while showcasing the Allied <s>USA-Made</s> (and 100g lighter) BC40 mountain bike race machine. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Kate-Courtney-Allied-BC40-long--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Kate-Courtney-Allied-BC40-long--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Kate Courtney Allied BC40 long\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Kate-Courtney-Allied-BC40-long--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Kate-Courtney-Allied-BC40-long--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Kate-Courtney-Allied-BC40-long--1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Kate-Courtney-Allied-BC40-long--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Kate-Courtney-Allied-BC40-long--768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Kate-Courtney-Allied-BC40-long--2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Kate-Courtney-Allied-BC40-long--800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Kate-Courtney-Allied-BC40-long--720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Photos: Allied </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Kate Courtney Joins the Allied Family</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Kate Courtney is a household name in cross-country mountain biking. She is the 2018 UCI Mountain Bike World Champion, two-time U.S. XC National Champion, and Tokyo 2020 Olympian. Known for her historic 2018 World Championship gold (the first American Elite women’s win in 17 years), she embarks on a new chapter with Allied Cycle Works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courtney will race the 2025 season aboard the newly refined BC40 mountain bike. Courtneys program, She Sends Racing, ties into to the She Sends Foundation, a nonprofit established in 2023. Courtney’s schedule has not been released, but we expect a full roster of XCO racing, though the She Sends Racing is new to the World Cup scene. Courtney alone carries a impressive 1,474 UCI points and is currently ranked 9th in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Allied-BC40-bottom-side-.webp\"><img width=\"2048\" height=\"1366\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Allied-BC40-bottom-side-.webp\" alt=\"Allied BC40 bottom side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Allied-BC40-bottom-side-.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Allied-BC40-bottom-side--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Allied-BC40-bottom-side--1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Allied-BC40-bottom-side--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Allied-BC40-bottom-side--768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Allied-BC40-bottom-side--800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Allied-BC40-bottom-side--720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>She Sends Racing Partners</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Who else is Courtney partnering with for her She Sends Racing Program? She made an announcement two weeks ago that she is partnering with electric vehicle manufacture <a href=\"https://rivian.com/\">RIVAN</a> – so that one we know for sure. In her photos, she sporting a full Rapha kit and RedBull helmet, so we can assume they are both in for the 2025 racing season. The tires look to be Schwalbe, which will be a new tire for Courtney who has ridden Maxxis previously under the SCOTT-SRAM banner the last six years. It will be interesting to see who else jumps on, and what her racing program will be this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>“I’m thrilled to partner with Allied and race the updated BC40 this season. From the first test ride, I was blown away by its performance. It’s exciting to bring this American-made brand to the World Cup stage.”</em> – Kate Courtney </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Allied-BC40-FA-.webp\"><img width=\"2048\" height=\"1366\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Allied-BC40-FA-.webp\" alt=\"Allied BC40 FA\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Allied-BC40-FA-.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Allied-BC40-FA--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Allied-BC40-FA--1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Allied-BC40-FA--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Allied-BC40-FA--768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Allied-BC40-FA--800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Allied-BC40-FA--720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>The Updated Allied BC40</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The BC40, Allied’s cross-country race bike, now features a 100-gram weight reduction. <em>Where does the reduction come from?</em> Allied told us it’s from an updated carbon layup and bottom bracket. We’re hoping to see one for ourself sometime soon and get the full lowdown.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Allied-BC40-front-.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1025\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Allied-BC40-front--1536x1025.webp\" alt=\"Allied BC40 front\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Allied-BC40-front--1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Allied-BC40-front--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Allied-BC40-front--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Allied-BC40-front--768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Allied-BC40-front--800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Allied-BC40-front--720x480.webp 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Allied-BC40-front-.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Allied-BC40-full-.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1025\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Allied-BC40-full--1536x1025.webp\" alt=\"Allied BC40 full\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Allied-BC40-full--1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Allied-BC40-full--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Allied-BC40-full--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Allied-BC40-full--768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Allied-BC40-full--800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Allied-BC40-full--720x480.webp 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Allied-BC40-full-.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To complement the BC40, Allied is also debuting its innovative DUET lightweight handlebar and stem system. Designed and manufactured in-house, the DUET cockpit combines weight savings and adjustability in a two-piece setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Duet-Cockpit-front--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"2560\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Duet-Cockpit-front--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Duet Cockpit front\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Duet-Cockpit-front--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Duet-Cockpit-front--297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Duet-Cockpit-front--1536x1536.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Duet-Cockpit-front--120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Duet-Cockpit-front--768x768.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Duet-Cockpit-front--2048x2048.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>DUET Handlebar and Stem</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The DUET system solves a longstanding challenge with traditional bar and stems clamps. Ones that require carbon handlebars to be overbuilt to endure clamping forces. Allied’s redesigned clamp system distributes forces more evenly, allowing for a lighter, more refined design without compromising strength. Unlike one-piece carbon bar/stem setups, this two piece system allows for adjustments for wrist angle and profile.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Duet-Cockpit-side-.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1025\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Duet-Cockpit-side--1536x1025.webp\" alt=\"Duet Cockpit side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Duet-Cockpit-side--1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Duet-Cockpit-side--297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Duet-Cockpit-side--120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Duet-Cockpit-side--768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Duet-Cockpit-side--800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Duet-Cockpit-side--720x480.webp 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Duet-Cockpit-side-.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Duet-Cockpit-set--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1536\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Duet-Cockpit-set--1536x1536.webp\" alt=\"Duet Cockpit set\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Duet-Cockpit-set--1536x1536.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Duet-Cockpit-set--297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Duet-Cockpit-set--120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Duet-Cockpit-set--768x768.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Duet-Cockpit-set--2048x2048.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Key details include:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>DUET Handlebar</strong>: 780mm carbon bar, optimized for use with the DUET stem – 135g</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>DUET Stem</strong>: CNC-machined aluminum stem – 64g (50mm)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Integrated Computer Mount</strong>: 3g</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Total Weight</strong>: As low as 199g, lighter than most integrated systems while maintaining adjustability</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>MSRP</strong>: USD 325</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“We reimagined the handlebar and stem interface from the ground up.
