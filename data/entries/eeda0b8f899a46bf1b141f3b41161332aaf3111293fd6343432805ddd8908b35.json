{"title":"Apple TV is now on Android, so your friends can watch ‘Severance’ and talk about it","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2607001/apple-tv-app-android-now-available.html","date":1739402688000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s say your best buddy–we’ll call him Pietro–uses an Android phone. To each his own, you say. The problem is, Pietro, who doesn’t own a TV and watches shows on his phone (like I said, to each his own) doesn’t subscribe to Apple TV+ because there’s no Android app for that. This means when you excitedly call Pietro after watching the latest episode of <em>Severance</em> that dropped on Friday, you can’t talk about it. Instead, you have to ask him how’s he doing, how the kids are, what he had for dinner, whatever. Ho hum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But today is your (or Pietro’s) lucky day. Apple has released the Apple TV app on Android and it’s now available on the <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apple.atve.androidtv.appletv&amp;hl=en_US&amp;pli=1\">Google Play store</a>. It provides access to all Apple TV+ content, as well as <a href=\"https://tv.apple.com/us/channel/mls-season-pass/tvs.sbd.7000\">MLS Season Pass</a>. A subscription is required for Apple TV+, which costs $9.99/£9.99 per month; MLS Season Pass is an additional subscription fee, but does not require an Apple TV+ subscription (<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2592372/apple-tv-subscribers-get-weekly-free-sunday-night-soccer-mls-games-in-2025.html\">learn more about MLS Season Pass</a>). Apple TV+ also offers TV shows and movies available to rent or buy but <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/611252/apple-tv-plus-android-app\">The Verge</a> reports that you cannot access the store from within the Android app. Users on Reddit say that previously purchased shows can’t be accessed, either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Verge also points out that the Apple TV app for Android is optimized for foldable phones, which Pietro loves to brag about (“Crease? That’s not a crease,” he likes to say). Google’s Dan Seifert posted that the app also has a themeable app icon, picture-in-picture support, as well as offline downloads. So your Android-using buddy really has no excuse for missing out on one of the best shows of the year and a bunch of other <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/230863/apple-tv-originals-shows-series-movies-release-dates-news-actors-directors.html\">great Apple TV+ content</a>. Unless the lack of casting support in the app is a dealbreaker. Then you’re just going to have to go back to chatting about the weather.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>thrilled to see Apple TV land on Android devices today!it's an excellent Android citizen too:themeable app icon: ✅PIP support: ✅offline downloads: ✅foldable posture support: ✅https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apple.atve.androidtv.appletv</p>— <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:jg5fwnsbilld3oempi5yjigb?ref_src=embed\">dan seifert (@dcseifert.bsky.social)</a> <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:jg5fwnsbilld3oempi5yjigb/post/3lhz56kjcvo2o?ref_src=embed\">2025-02-12T21:40:07.642227Z</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"eeda0b8f899a46bf1b141f3b41161332aaf3111293fd6343432805ddd8908b35","category":"Apple"}
