In our example, we're choosing the Downloads folder.</li>\r<br />\n<li>From the <strong>Library</strong> sidebar on the far left, select <strong>Photos</strong>.</li>\r<br />\n<li>From the <strong>Actions</strong> column, drag <strong>Change Type of Images</strong> (the one with the Preview icon) to the workflow area.\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/change-image-type.jpg\" alt=\"automator\" width=\"1000\" height=\"470\" />\r<br />\n</li><li>A dialog prompt will appear. If you want your action to convert copies of images placed in the folder and preserve the originals, select <strong>Add</strong>. If you want it to convert the original images, select <strong>Don't Add</strong>.</li>\r<br />\n<li>In the <strong>Change Type of Images</strong> action panel, choose the type of format that you want images to be converted to. We're selecting <strong>JPG</strong>.\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/02/convert-jpg-action.jpg\" alt=\"automator\" width=\"613\" height=\"112\" />\r<br />\n</li><li>In the Automator menu bar, select <strong>File -&gt; Save...</strong> or press <strong>Command-S</strong>, call your new file action \"Convert Image,\" then click <strong>Save</strong>.</li></ol>That's all there is to it. Next time you want to convert an image into your preferred format, simply drag it into the folder that you assigned the action to. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nNow that you know how to create the image conversion workflow in Automator, you may want to turn it into a standalone \"Application,\" the option for which you can find in Automator's document menu. An \"Application\" is a self-running workflow that acts as a droplet – any files or folders dropped onto it are used as input to the workflow. In other words, you could add an \"Application\" to your Dock and drop images onto it for conversion.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYou can also import Automator workflows into the Shortcuts app. Shortcuts can convert most Automator workflows into shortcuts that carry out the same functions, events and automations — you simply drag a workflow file into Shortcuts and the conversion happens automatically. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/automator/\">Automator</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/turn-macos-folder-into-image-converter-how/\">Turn Any macOS Folder Into an Image Converter – Here's How</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/turn-any-macos-folder-into-an-image-converter-–-heres-how.2453484/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"edaaec0e9e70b867707d338ef86eb52f55f5c427cbad4b671caa58220aadbe73","category":"Apple"}
