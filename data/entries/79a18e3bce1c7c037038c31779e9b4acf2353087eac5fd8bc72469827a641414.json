According to a new report, Apple has some plans for the laptop to commemorate the occasion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-11-03/apple-finally-finds-its-game-console-rival-with-the-new-m4-and-m4-pro-mac-minis-m31na57p\">Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman’s</a> latest Power On newsletter, Apple plans to make the 2026 MacBook Pro thinner than the current design, which is already just 0.61 inches. The other major change is that the laptop will sport an OLED display, like the one in the current <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2369843/m4-ipad-pro-1tb-review.html\">iPad Pro</a>, which has a tandem OLED. OLEDs offer better contrast and black levels than the mini-LED displays the laptop currently has.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2026 MacBook Pro will also likely have an M6 chip following the M5 in 2025. An earlier <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2490120/iphone-18-to-get-enhanced-2nm-chip-12gb-of-ram.html\">report in October</a> claimed that Apple is eyeing the 2nm process for the iPhone 18’s A20 chip in 2026, which could also make its way to the M6 given the similarities between the two chips. So 2026 is shaping up to be the year of the debut of 2nm chips, with an iPhone release in September, followed by the new MacBook Pros in November.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But between the just released M4 MacBook Pro and the 2026 “true overhaul,” Apple will likely update the laptop in 2025 with M5 series chips, which is expected to offer a typical performance upgrade over the M4, according to Gurman.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"79a18e3bce1c7c037038c31779e9b4acf2353087eac5fd8bc72469827a641414","category":"Apple"}
