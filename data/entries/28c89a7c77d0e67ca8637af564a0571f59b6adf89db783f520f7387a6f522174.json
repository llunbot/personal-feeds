It’s basically all the things that don’t fit into the other three categories of bikes, tech and kit, and as you’ll see below that can mean a few different things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will be our final article of the year, so thanks to everyone that’s joined us and clicked on a few pages, hope to see you again in 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sam Challis, tech editor</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>SiS Protein20 bars</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/in-the-drops-07-06-24-5-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Science in Sport Protein20 bar\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/in-the-drops-07-06-24-5-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/in-the-drops-07-06-24-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/in-the-drops-07-06-24-5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/in-the-drops-07-06-24-5-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/in-the-drops-07-06-24-5-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/in-the-drops-07-06-24-5-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/in-the-drops-07-06-24-5-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/in-the-drops-07-06-24-5-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/in-the-drops-07-06-24-5-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/in-the-drops-07-06-24-5.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Sam Challis</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve been placing more of a priority on my protein intake this year and have found supplements such as whey powder and high-protein bars have been invaluable in helping me hit my daily target. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas a protein shake is more simply a means to end, I’ve found protein bars to be a genuinely enjoyable substitute for the regular confectionary that I’ve tried to tone down. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve chomped my way through several options on the market this year (emphasis on the ‘chomped’ – protein bars are invariably dense) and SiS’s Protein20 bars – the salted caramel flavour, specifically – have become firm favourites. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most importantly they pack in 20g of protein, which is on par with most bars, but that comes from plant derived sources such as pea protein rather than dairy, making them vegan and better for the environment.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there’s the fact that they are actually pleasant to eat: an initial crunch of chocolate-covered ‘protein crispies’, followed by gooey caramel and then the chewy denseness of the high-protein nougat center. Delicious and nutritious, and enough to get a Gear of the Year vote from me. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>James Spender, deputy editor</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Cyclist Magazine Podcast </h3>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Personal trumpet tooting time, but Will, Robyn and I have had some excellent guests on the podcast this year, and I’ve really enjoyed doing it. Which, honestly, I haven’t so much before – the podcast is really out of my comfort zone… I’m not a natural presenter, I do get very self-conscious and I do very much prefer having an hour to craft 1,000 words than a second to say a sentence. So thanks guests and thanks co-hosts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have no idea why I’m telling you this, it’s probably way off brand as we’re supposed to be slick and shiny and in charge, right? But this year I’ve also realised that I like it when people tell me how they <em>really</em> find things in life, as it makes me feel better about my own struggles, and that makes me feel happier and less alone. It’s all about sharing vulnerabilities, man, being shiny all the time is for losers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/cyclist-magazine-podcast\" target=\"_blank\">podcast</a>. Give it a listen, and even, give it a watch! We’re on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@Cyclistmagvideo\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube</a> now (I can’t watch of course). The most recent episode is Andy Schleck, but pod guests this year include Tadej Pogačar, Tom Pidcock, Peter Sagan, Joanna Rowsell, Fabian Cancellara, DJ Spoony off the radio, Carlton Kirby, Ned Boulting, Krishnan Guru-Murthy off the telly, Maurice Burton… the list goes on. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ebay </h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Trek-Emonda-secondhand-970x728.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Trek-Emonda-secondhand-970x728.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Trek-Emonda-secondhand-300x225.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Trek-Emonda-secondhand-768x576.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Trek-Emonda-secondhand-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Trek-Emonda-secondhand-750x563.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Trek-Emonda-secondhand-1140x855.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Trek-Emonda-secondhand.webp 1600w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I hate that I’m advertising – for free – a huge corporate entity, but there is no escaping the fact Ebay has been good to me this year (or me to it, depends how you see at it).  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve bought two bikes, a 2023 Trek Emonda pour moi and a mint-condition 1990s steel Marin mtb for the fam – it was a steal at £35 for the frameset and we needed a burlier bike to accommodate riding around town with a baby on the back (also bought a new car seat for said baby).  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I purchased a very high-end, used once Vileda mop (lots of research on cleaning forums) with spinning basket for less half the RRP; loads of steel wool and wood filler to deal with a mouse problem; all manner of DIY materials for projects I still haven’t started – but ownership is 9/10ths of completion; a new drive belt for a very old Walkman; pens; some better roller wheels for my Brompton so it actually rolls when folded up; and even a whole car, a 2014 Honda Jazz since you ask. One careful lady owner and though she isn’t sexy – the Jazz I mean – I can’t rate her enough. If there’s a smaller engined car you can fit a fridge freezer into, I’ll eat my newly acquired V5C logbook (I even sold our old Jazz’s vehicle manual on Ebay, because one man’s landfill after his old Jazz was written off is another man’s treasure). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And news in a few days ago, my uncle has just bought a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/robert-wade-swallow-landescape-ironbridge-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">Landescape</a> tandem on the ‘bay for a hair over £900 that was made for Freddie Flintoff and Lawrence Dallaglio for a charity bike ride, and which is sponsored by Pizza Express and has flames painted on it. Bless you, Ebay. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+1\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-1-970x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-1-970x300.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-1-300x93.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-1-768x238.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-1-1536x476.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-1-2048x634.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-1-750x232.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-1-1140x353.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Laurence Kilpatrick, staff writer</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apidura City back pack </h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"648\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DSC01212-970x648.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DSC01212-970x648.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DSC01212-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DSC01212-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DSC01212-1536x1026.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DSC01212-2048x1368.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DSC01212-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DSC01212-1140x762.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DSC01212-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DSC01212-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/DSC01212-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Since featuring the Apidura City Back Pack in my <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/tailfin-frame-bag\" target=\"_blank\">In The Drops</a>, the poor guy has been treated absolutely disgracefully. Come hell or high water, this modest-looking but infinitely well-designed bag has been dragged through the worst of British weather and hasn’t put a foot wrong. It doesn’t try too hard to stuff in unnecessary features that nobody wants and bucks the trend of roll top design that seems to be ubiquitous elsewhere. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, you’ve got a very simple clipping design that keeps the waterproof material safely secured. There’s a (removable) waist and chest strap to keep everything in place, an external zip pocket for keys and valuables, as well as internal laptop and valuable storage. Subtle reflective detailing features on front and back, while there’s a handy flap that I’m able to clip a rear bike light onto. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This humble grey sack might not be the aesthetic pick of the cycling scenesters out there, but it’s supremely well made and utterly reliable.  </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n

one. I’ve had a couple of trips to Italy this year, one of which is coming to a magazine near you in the new year and the other came in the spring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Monte Grappa the headline act of this year’s Giro d’Italia, I was volunteered to go to Bassano del Grappa for my dose of suffering on the mountain, and it was fantastic. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Photographer Juan and I spent some time dotting about the town and got shown around the hot spots by Scottish local legend Monty, who worked for Basso Bikes and had helped to organise our trip. Monty has been a key cog in setting up the new Bassano Club House, which is part of increasing Bassano’s standing as a fantastic – and quieter – Girona-like cycling destination. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s road, gravel, MTB, great people and great food and drink. It’s a must-visit.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/monte-grappa-italy-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">Monte Grappa Big Ride</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-3-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cyclist-gear-of-the-year-2024-other-stuff\">Cyclist’s Gear of the Year 2024: Other stuff</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Will Strickson &#124; Website Editor","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"28c89a7c77d0e67ca8637af564a0571f59b6adf89db783f520f7387a6f522174","category":"Cycling"}
