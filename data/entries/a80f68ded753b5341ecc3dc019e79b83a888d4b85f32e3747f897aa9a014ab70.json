Microsoft reportedly plans for the Arm version of its next Surface tablet to be the flagship, and major apps like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/google-launches-chrome-nightlies-for-windows-11-on-arm/\">Chrome</a> and Dropbox have recently released Arm-native Windows versions for the first time.</p>\n<p>Ahead of the chips' launch late this year, Qualcomm announced a new lower-end model destined for cheaper devices. Dubbed the Snapdragon X Plus, it shares a lot in common with the flagship <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/10/qualcomm-snapdragon-x-elite-looks-like-the-windows-worlds-answer-to-apple-silicon/\">Snapdragon X Elite</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The Snapdragon X Plus includes 10 CPU cores instead of the Elite’s 12, though the more noticeable change is its lack of support for clock-speed boosting; the chip’s 3.4 GHz base frequency is as fast as it goes, where the Elite chips can boost two cores to 4.2 GHz and one core up to 4.3 GHz, depending on the specific model. Qualcomm also rates the X Plus’ integrated GPU at 3.8 TFLOPs, down from the X Elite’s maximum of 4.6 TFLOPs. Aside from those high-level FLOP numbers, we still know very little about how the GPU will be configured; we also don’t know the ratio of “big” and “little” CPU cores.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019890#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019890&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a80f68ded753b5341ecc3dc019e79b83a888d4b85f32e3747f897aa9a014ab70","category":"Tech"}
