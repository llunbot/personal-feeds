It wasn’t because it shifted better. It wasn’t because it looked cleaner. It was because I could shift with my pinkies. I’ve since gotten rid of that bike, but you can bet its replacement also has electronic shifting. I’m never going back. Although <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/sram-transmission-compatiblity-udh\" target=\"_blank\">I have acquiesced to using electronic shifters</a> for mountain bikes, I believe they actually make more sense on drop-bar bikes. Because you can shift with your pinkies.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/RADAVIST-DUST-UP-ELECTRONIC-SHIFTING-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/RADAVIST-DUST-UP-ELECTRONIC-SHIFTING-2.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/RADAVIST-DUST-UP-ELECTRONIC-SHIFTING-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/RADAVIST-DUST-UP-ELECTRONIC-SHIFTING-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>For me, mountain biking is about two things: Going down a hill, and getting back to the top. But when I’m on my drop-bar bike, it’s more about the vibes. Maybe I feel like hammering. Maybe I feel like cruising. Maybe I feel like <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/audiobooks-and-long-bike-rides/\" target=\"_blank\">sinking into an audiobook</a>. Whatever the vibe, I want the bike to disappear. Sure, I’m pedaling, steering, and braking, but those actions are like breathing. They originate deep within my brain stem. <i>Shifting,</i> on the other hand, is slightly more cerebral. Especially if I have to move my hand, bend my wrist, and overcome cable friction. That causes the bike to reappear, and the vibe to fade.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/RADAVIST-DUST-UP-ELECTRONIC-SHIFTING-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/RADAVIST-DUST-UP-ELECTRONIC-SHIFTING-1.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/RADAVIST-DUST-UP-ELECTRONIC-SHIFTING-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/RADAVIST-DUST-UP-ELECTRONIC-SHIFTING-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>This is well trodden territory in the electronic shifting debate. There’s no way—and no <i>reason</i>—to settle it. For many riders, a shifters’ tactility is a feature, not a bug. Nic Morales wrote <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/the-dust-up-an-ode-to-friction-shifting/\">a Dust-Up</a> praising the sensation that I have shunned. So, I’m not gonna relitigate the fundamentals here. I’m just gonna talk about pinky-shifting. I remember the first time I did it. I was at the Interbike trade show (RIP), test-riding Di2 at the off-site demo event. I was accelerating while turning left through an uphill intersection, my middle and ring fingers firmly anchored under the hoods. I was used to the disruption of moving those load-bearing fingers to shift. But that day, the novelty of Di2 got me inspired. I probed forward with my pinkies, and found they could reach the paddles. More importantly, they had the strength to actuate them. <a href=\"https://www.narenkatakam.com/moses-and-his-little-finger/\" target=\"_blank\">The pinky is a pretty fascinating thing.</a></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/RADAVIST-DUST-UP-ELECTRONIC-SHIFTING-4.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/RADAVIST-DUST-UP-ELECTRONIC-SHIFTING-4.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/RADAVIST-DUST-UP-ELECTRONIC-SHIFTING-4.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/RADAVIST-DUST-UP-ELECTRONIC-SHIFTING-4.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/RADAVIST-DUST-UP-ELECTRONIC-SHIFTING-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/RADAVIST-DUST-UP-ELECTRONIC-SHIFTING-3.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/RADAVIST-DUST-UP-ELECTRONIC-SHIFTING-3.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/RADAVIST-DUST-UP-ELECTRONIC-SHIFTING-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>It’s even better with AXS / e-tap, where there’s just one paddle per lever. And each is easier to reach. When I’m in the hoods—which is most of my ride—pinky-shifting has become second nature. My thumb and fingers drape comfortably but firmly around and under the levers, and my pinkies are just a quick 30 mm stretch away from the action. Or, when the rest of my fingers are covering the brake levers on a downhill, I can tuck my pinky behind them for the same effect. Plus, dropping my Reverb AXS seatpost on a red light and then raising it on a green, feels almost like telepathy. It’s become a reflex, involving tiny muscles, tiny bones, and tiny movements. In fact, this whole thing is pretty tiny. Hardly worth writing a Dust-Up about…</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/the-dust-up-electronic-bicycle-shifting-is-better/\">The Dust-Up: Two Little Reasons Why Electronic Shifting Is Better</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"Travis Engel","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"78dbce319c004d47b067e51de32f24f0e33b2b35aae648288f9dcc796c4aa843","category":"Cycling"}
