Japan and New Zealand both have large swathes of land where traditional cellular coverage is unavailable due to terrain limitations.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor au customers, Starlink Direct covers all of Japan, providing connectivity in remote areas where cellular towers are not available. au does not charge for the service, which allows users to send and receive text messages, get emergency earthquake alerts, and share their location with friends and family.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn New Zealand, One NZ customers can use Starlink Direct to send and receive texts anywhere in the country, with the functionality included in eligible mobile plans.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nStarlink Direct is available when cellular signal is not, as long as there is a clear line of sight to the sky. While an open space not obstructed by buildings helps with connectivity, users do not need to hold their smartphone up to the sky to connect, which is a requirement for Apple's built-in satellite service offered through its partnership with Globalstar.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCarrier-based satellite services are supported on the ‌iPhone‌ 14 models and later, and customers who have access to carrier satellite options can use those in addition to the satellite connectivity that is included in Apple's modern iPhones.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>(Thanks, <a href=\"https://x.com/dhinakg\">Dhinak</a>!)</em><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/10/apple-carrier-satellite-services-expansion/\">Apple Continues Rolling Out Support for Carrier Satellite Services</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-continues-rolling-out-support-for-carrier-satellite-services.2455076/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6bb0203eb34f194cf1263f07dd25c32224209ff87fa7e75a342fa0a131c64269","category":"Apple"}
