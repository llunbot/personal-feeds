Today, he provided some additional details about these devices, which are expected to launch in 2026 or 2027.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/FoldPad-Redux-24-Magenta-and-Blue.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1265\" />\r<br />\nIn a research note with investment firm GF Securities, Pu said the two devices will include a foldable iPhone with a 7.8-inch inner display, along with a larger foldable device with an 18.8-inch display. He described the larger foldable as a MacBook-iPad hybrid, and he believes that the device will likely run macOS, rather than iPadOS.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis is a very bold prediction, as it implies that the 18.8-inch foldable device could end up being a touch-screen Mac. In his <em>Power On</em> newsletter over the weekend, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-03-16/apple-iphone-17-air-foldable-iphone-details-ai-crisis-to-haunt-top-100-event-m8bl3a9c\"><em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said</a> that Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/16/ios-19-big-design-changes/\">rumored design changes coming with iOS 19 and macOS 16</a> should set the stage for new hardware designs, including \"foldable devices and touch-screen Macs.\" However, there have not been any rumors indicating that a touch-screen Mac will launch as early as next year, so some skepticism is warranted for the time being.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPu does cite a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/15/iphone-17-air-19-inch-macbook-report/\">recent report from <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> as the basis for some of his foldable information, so it is possible that his macOS prediction is simply based on that report having said that the 18.8-inch device is \"intended to serve as a laptop.\" But, until we hear otherwise, we can dream about the intriguing possibility of a touch-screen Mac.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-ipad/\">Foldable iPad</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-macbook/\">Foldable MacBook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/\">Jeff Pu</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/apple-foldable-macos-prediction/\">Foldable MacBook-iPad Hybrid Device Likely to Run macOS, Analyst Says</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/foldable-macbook-ipad-hybrid-device-likely-to-run-macos-analyst-says.2453367/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6f5aaa37c67975f3fc206653fa3f314ec216d5e8f2a89e8e2aabb786473c0ccd","category":"Apple"}
