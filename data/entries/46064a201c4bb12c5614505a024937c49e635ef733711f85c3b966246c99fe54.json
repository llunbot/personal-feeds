Officials from Boeing and NASA, which manages Boeing's multibillion-dollar Starliner commercial crew contract, previously targeted Friday, May 17, for the spacecraft's first launch with astronauts onboard.</p>\n<p>Boeing's ground team traced the leak to a flange on a single reaction control system thruster on the spacecraft's service module.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024298#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024298&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"46064a201c4bb12c5614505a024937c49e635ef733711f85c3b966246c99fe54","category":"Tech"}
