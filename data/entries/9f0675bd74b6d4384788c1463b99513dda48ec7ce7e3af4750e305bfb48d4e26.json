Both models can charge over Thunderbolt or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a>. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe 10-core 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pro models are also capable of charging from zero to 50 percent within 30 minutes through a new fast charge feature. The 14-inch model can fast charge over Thunderbolt or ‌MagSafe‌, while the 16-inch model needs the ‌MagSafe‌ connection for fast charging.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro-13/\">13\" MacBook Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">14\" and 16\" MacBook Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_13\">13\" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">16\" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/18/macbook-pro-m1-pro-battery-life/\">New MacBook Pros Offer Up to 10 Hours Longer Battery Life Than Prior-Generation</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-macbook-pros-offer-up-to-10-hours-longer-battery-life-than-prior-generation.2317715/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=tJ83wzRroQ0:yDLZhj-qWoY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=tJ83wzRroQ0:yDLZhj-qWoY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/tJ83wzRroQ0\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9f0675bd74b6d4384788c1463b99513dda48ec7ce7e3af4750e305bfb48d4e26","category":"Apple"}
