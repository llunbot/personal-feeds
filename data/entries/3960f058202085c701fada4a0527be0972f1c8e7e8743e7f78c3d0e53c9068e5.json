At the start, long before James Bond went from page to screen, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2014/12/first-bond-car-actually-monster-bentley/\">he drove a Blower Bentley,</a> the equivalent in 1953 of <a href=\"https://www.thedrive.com/accelerator/29995/the-homologated-1998-toyota-gt-one-is-the-wildest-road-legal-toyota-ever\">tooling about today in a Toyota GT-One</a>. The move to motion pictures meant driving something a bit more current than a 1931 Le Mans racer, and over the course of 25 films there's been plenty of four-wheel action. But one car stands out above all the others—the Aston Martin DB5.</p>\n<p>We first saw the ionic coupé in 1964's <em>Goldfinger</em>, where it almost stole the show with its battering ram, ejector seat, smoke screen, and the rest of the gadgets that introduced the world to <em>the Bond car</em>. It has appeared in eight films in total. After <em>Goldfinger</em> it returned in <em>Thunderball</em>, then sat out the Lazenby and Moore years before returning in <em>GoldenEye</em> and then <em>Tomorrow Never Dies</em>, despite a marketing deal that meant Q had to issue the secret agent BMWs instead.</p>\n<p><em>Casino Royale</em> offered a new origin story for the DB5, with Bond winning the car in a game of poker. However, when it shows up again in <em>Skyfall</em> six years later, the steering wheel has switched sides, and Q Branch has had some fun with it. When last we saw 007 in <em><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/11/spectre-review-suddenly-mi6-objects-to-the-concept-of-espionage/\">Spectre</a></em> he was driving away in BMT 216A, and we've known <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/12/the-next-bond-film-no-time-to-die-mashes-up-aston-martins-gatling-guns/\">since the first trailer for <em>No Time to Die</em></a> that the DB5—and its headlamp miniguns—plays an important role in <em>No Time to Die</em>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801118#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801118&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
