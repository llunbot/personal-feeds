As spotted by <em><a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2024/08/22/google-maps-bottom-bar-redesign-iphone/\">9to5Google</a></em>, \"Go\" has been removed, but users can still access it using a new \"You\" middle tab, via a new \"Saved trips\" section therein.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"You\" was previously called \"Saved,\" and retains the same bookmark icon. But tapping it takes you to an updated page with new top tabs for \"Notifications\" and \"Messages,\" both of which serve content that was previously found in the \"Updates\" tab, now removed. That leaves \"Contribute\" as the last tab of the three on the main maps screen.\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/13/apple-maps-vs-google-maps/\">Apple Maps vs. Google Maps: Which Is Better?</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nThe rollout is occurring in version 6.129.1 of Google Maps.
