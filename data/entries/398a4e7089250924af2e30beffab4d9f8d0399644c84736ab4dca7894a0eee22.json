It can be mounted to a handlebar using a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/brand/go-pro/\">GoPro</a>-style mount.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n

Change Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Developed by former Formula 1 aerodynamicist, Dr Barney Garrood, the Aerosensor uses a patented probe design which is said to provide robust data in wind angles of up to 50 degrees of yaw.</p>\n<p>This enables “peerless repeatability in practically all wind conditions”, according to Aerosensor.</p>\n<p>The latter point is key, as other existing products on the market, such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/notio-konect-provides-all-your-aero-data-without-a-wind-tunnel/\">Noti Konect</a> or Velocomp Aeropod, typically require you to test on wind-free days for good results.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\"

<i>Aerosensor / Alex Duffil via Drive Change Media</i></span></div>\n<p>According to Dr Garrood, tyre rolling resistance data can be gleaned from independent sources to enable the Aerosensor to account for this variable.</p>\n<p>When real-world rolling resistance cannot be precisely calculated, Dr Garrood says assuming a fixed figure within the right ballpark would not affect the repeatability of test results.</p>\n<p>The Aerosensor costs £850.</p>\n<h2>Aerobody</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n

consistent body position while riding or testing.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Aerosensor / Alex Duffil via Drive Change Media</i></span></div>\n<p>When doing comparative tests of body positions or equipment, maintaining a consistent position on the bike is crucial for getting good results.</p>\n<p>This is because any differences due to changes in body position are likely to outweigh those found between two different pieces of equipment, such as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/buyers-guide-to-road-bike-wheels/\">wheelsets</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-aero-helmets/\">aero helmets</a>.</p>\n<p>Likewise, once you’ve found an aerodynamic riding position, it’s important to know whether this can actually be maintained while riding and when fatigued.</p>\n<p>In response to this, Aerosensor has developed the Aerobody.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n

abdomen.</p>\n<p>If your body position then deviates from the predetermined starting point while riding, the Aerobody will notify you via the Aerosensor Garmin Connect IQ app.</p>\n<div>\n    \n

“sub-millisecond accuracy”.</p>\n<p>This data is then transmitted wirelessly to the Aerosensor, which then transmits it to the Aerosensor Garmin Connect IQ app alongside the aero data, where it can

it’s relatively easy to use.</p>\n<p>It’s claimed a rider can be up and running with the Aerosensor within 10 minutes of unboxing it.</p>\n<p>Dr Garrood says the device is able to automatically calibrate itself while you ride, meaning there isn’t a need to perform a specific calibration protocol prior to testing, as with some competitor devices.</p>\n<p>The Aerosensor ACS can be purchased
