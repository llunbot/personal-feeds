That was never going to be the case, even if this injunction had gone into effect. <em>What was the point of the injunction then?</em> you might ask. Good question.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/12/09/update-regarding-ygr-injunction\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"15b01b1bd3c186948cf2744705cbc7ac7e303fc92d74fecd9385f7abca6f4067","category":"Tech"}
