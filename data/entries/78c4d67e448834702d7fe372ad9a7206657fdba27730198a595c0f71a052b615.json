The species lived some 3.6 million years ago and no complete skeleton has yet been found. So there has been considerable debate among paleobiologists about megalodon's size, body shape and swimming speed, among other characteristics.</p>\n<p>While some researchers have compared megalodon to a gigantic version of the stocky great white shark,  others believe the species had a more slender body shape. A new paper published in the journal Palaeontologia Electronica bolsters the latter viewpoint, also drawing conclusions about the megalodon's body mass, swimming speed (based on hydrodynamic principles), and growth patterns.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/06/worlds-largest-predatory-shark-had-elevated-body-temperature/\">previously reported</a>, the largest shark alive today, reaching up to 20 meters long, is the whale shark, a sedate filter feeder. As recently as 4 million years ago, however, sharks of that scale likely included the fast-moving predator megalodon (formally <em>Otodus megalodon</em>). Due to incomplete fossil data, we're not entirely sure how large megalodons were and can only make inferences based on some of their living relatives.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/study-megalodons-body-shape-was-closer-to-a-lemon-shark/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/study-megalodons-body-shape-was-closer-to-a-lemon-shark/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"78c4d67e448834702d7fe372ad9a7206657fdba27730198a595c0f71a052b615","category":"Tech"}
