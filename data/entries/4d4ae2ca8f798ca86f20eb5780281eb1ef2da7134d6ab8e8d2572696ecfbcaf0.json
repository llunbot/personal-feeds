They’re hackable, forgettable, and, sometimes, guessable (looking at you, password1). As companies like Microsoft and Google move to embrace password-less logins, Yubico thinks it has the key to keeping things simple. The YubiKey Bio Series announced today is the company’s first hardware security key to offer fingerprint logins.</span></p>\n<p><span>Yubico’s </span><a href=\"https://fave.co/3DgvZ5Y\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Bio Series</span></a><span> introduces biometric authentication to the hardware security key-maker’s lineup. The new keys support the latest FIDO2/WebAuthn and U2Fopen authentication standards to which Yubico contributes.</span></p>\n<p><span><div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/yubico-a-and-b.png\" /><p>Fits either your USB-C (left) or USB-A (right) port.

Each key has a built-in fingerprint reader, so you can log in with the tap of a finger instead of having to remember your password. The key could also serve as a form of two-factor authentication. </span></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801126#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801126&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4d4ae2ca8f798ca86f20eb5780281eb1ef2da7134d6ab8e8d2572696ecfbcaf0","category":"Tech"}
