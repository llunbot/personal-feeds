In addition, the inner material of its bags, such as the Pro Pack, is made from recycled polyester and the zips are made from recycled nylon. This is supported by the Clean-Up program in Indonesia, which collects Ocean Impact Plastic from the sea and coastal areas in order to actively contribute to the reduction of plastic pollution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The design of the Pro Pack follows the maxim: square, practical, good. With a volume of 25 liters and compact dimensions of 18.5 by 12.2 by 6.3 inches (47 by 31 by 16 centimeters), it complies with IATA guidelines and is therefore perfect as hand luggage for air travel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The storage space is easily accessible from the top via a large lid. Inside there is a compartment for a 16-inch laptop, an iPad compartment, a small zip compartment for cables, and a separate compartment for an umbrella or a slim drinking bottle. There is also a compartment in the lid itself for small items such as tissues. Two loops for pens and a key ring round off the well-thought-out interior.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The laptop compartment can be accessed from the outside and inside. A large front compartment the size of a magazine and a hidden pocket for a wallet on the back keep things organized. There are also two elasticated side pockets for water bottles and a strap for the telescopic handle of a trolley.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><div><ul><li><figure><img alt=\"PRO PACK Farben\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PRO_PACK_Farben.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"GotBag ProPack\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GotBag_ProPack.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"PRO PACK Details\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PRO_PACK_Details.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li></ul><a></a><a></a><a></a><div></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The padded shoulder straps and chest strap are individually adjustable, while the padded back panel provides noticeable relief for the back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a certified B-Corporation, the company belongs to a community that adheres to the highest social and ecological standards. In addition, the products have been awarded the PETA-Approved Vegan seal, which emphasizes their animal-friendliness. The Pro Pack is available in six different color combinations.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Should you buy the Got Bag Pro Pack?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, the Pro Pack is the secret star in the Got Bag lineup. Large storage volume, good handling, and a favorable price speak well of the backpack. However, the Pro Pack has a fixed and not a variable volume. Nevertheless, the volume is easier to load, especially when shopping. If the 25-liter volume is not enough for you, there is a 35-liter version in the <a href=\"https://us.got-bag.com/collections/pro-pack-travel\" target=\"_blank\">Pro Pack Travel</a>.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"a492aebfb15acb96ed6ae338bbe1d87228032bbe94b62abef5734f50e9c11065","category":"Apple"}
