The breathtaking landscape doesn’t even look real – especially when the sky is filled with hot air balloons. The terrain also acts as a nearly unlimited canvas for the best mountain bikers in the world. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following in the tire tracks of <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/kilian-bron-follows-a-fire-lit-drone-through-cappadocia-in-follow-the-light/\" target=\"_blank\">Kilian Bron</a> and others, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/kriss-kyle-dont-look-down-bmx-bowl-hot-air-balloon/\" target=\"_blank\">Kriss Kyle</a> treats us to his latest edit. Somehow, the terrain looks even more otherworldly thanks to a fresh coating of snow. Kind of like the powdered sugar dusted onto Turkish Delight. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Credits:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>240 miles northwest of Gobekli Tepe lies the region of Cappadocia, Turkey. Millions of years ago this region was transformed by a series of volcanic eruptions, leaving layer upon layer of volcanic ash that compressed over millennia leaving behind this other-worldy landscape. In this mountain bike film Kriss Kyle tackles all 4 seasons in this strange and wonderful place. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Rider: Kriss Kyle </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Bike: Specialized Status </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Director/cinematography: Matty Lambert </li>\n\n\n\n<li>FPV drone pilot: Andrew Lawrence </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sound mix: Keith White </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Still photography: Marcus Cole </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Edit: Matty Lambert </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Music: Lost Under Heaven – Beneath the Concrete</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/kriss-kyle-takes-us-back-to-cappadocia-in-turkish-delight/\">Kriss Kyle Takes Us Back to Cappadocia in Turkish Delight</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"ce34cd44add05e3efb9a61512645f82cea9a5575ccb254952d1503daddc05ef5","category":"Cycling"}
