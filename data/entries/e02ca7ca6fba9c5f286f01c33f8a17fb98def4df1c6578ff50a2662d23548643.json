{"title":"Your iPhone may finally tell you how long it will take to charge","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2516031/your-iphone-may-finally-tell-you-how-long-it-will-take-to-charge.html","date":1731097963000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>There are lots of battery-powered devices that can give you an estimate of how much longer they’ll need to stay plugged in until they’re fully charged. It’s not exactly a new feature. MacBooks gives you this info in the Battery menu of Settings or the menu bar, for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With all the battery management and analysis built into our modern iPhones, it’s kind of remarkable that they don’t do this. Fortunately, a “time to charge” feature may be on the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2024/11/05/ios-18-how-long-iphone-charge/\">9to5Mac</a> discovered some code in the latest <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2499054/ios-18-2-apple-intelligence-siri-genmoji-install-release-beta.html\">iOS 18.2 beta</a> that points to a new <em>BatteryIntelligence</em> framework. The framework will take into account the amount of charge your battery can hold, its state of charge, and the amount of power it’s receiving from the charger (USB-C or wireless, we assume) and produce an estimate of how much longer it will take for the battery to charge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to 9to5Mac, users will be able to do things like get a notification stating how long it will take to charge to the current limit (80% or whatever you set it to). I could see Apple incorporating the info into the Dynamic Island, or perhaps on the lock screen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The feature is not yet enabled, so it’s unclear if it will come in iOS 18.2 or a later release. It may also be restricted to specific iPhone models, much like the custom charge limits or other battery features.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"e02ca7ca6fba9c5f286f01c33f8a17fb98def4df1c6578ff50a2662d23548643","category":"Apple"}
