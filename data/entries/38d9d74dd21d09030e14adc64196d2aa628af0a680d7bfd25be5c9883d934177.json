Although they did say they may, at some point, offer a few different teeth or offset options. The new chainring is compatible with all chains, except for 12-speed Shimano HG+ chains. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tumbleweed-Bikes-Wagon-Wheel-Chainring-black-logo-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"854\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tumbleweed-Bikes-Wagon-Wheel-Chainring-black-logo-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Tumbleweed Bikes Wagon Wheel Chainring black logo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tumbleweed-Bikes-Wagon-Wheel-Chainring-black-logo-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tumbleweed-Bikes-Wagon-Wheel-Chainring-black-logo-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tumbleweed-Bikes-Wagon-Wheel-Chainring-black-logo-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tumbleweed-Bikes-Wagon-Wheel-Chainring-black-logo-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tumbleweed-Bikes-Wagon-Wheel-Chainring-black-logo-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tumbleweed-Bikes-Wagon-Wheel-Chainring-black-logo-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tumbleweed-Bikes-Wagon-Wheel-Chainring-tumbleweed-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"854\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tumbleweed-Bikes-Wagon-Wheel-Chainring-tumbleweed-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Tumbleweed Bikes Wagon Wheel Chainring tumbleweed\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tumbleweed-Bikes-Wagon-Wheel-Chainring-tumbleweed-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tumbleweed-Bikes-Wagon-Wheel-Chainring-tumbleweed-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tumbleweed-Bikes-Wagon-Wheel-Chainring-tumbleweed-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tumbleweed-Bikes-Wagon-Wheel-Chainring-tumbleweed-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tumbleweed-Bikes-Wagon-Wheel-Chainring-tumbleweed-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tumbleweed-Bikes-Wagon-Wheel-Chainring-tumbleweed-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There is currently only one option for tooth count, 32t, and one offset option, +3mm. This offset gives you the same offset as standard Shimano rings. And will give you the same chain line as stock. The two options for material are aluminum (black) which weighs in at 60g. And 304 stainless steel (silver) which weighs in at 150g. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tumbleweed-Bikes-Wagon-Wheel-Chainring-first-pic-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tumbleweed-Bikes-Wagon-Wheel-Chainring-first-pic-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Tumbleweed Bikes Wagon Wheel Chainring first pic\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tumbleweed-Bikes-Wagon-Wheel-Chainring-first-pic-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tumbleweed-Bikes-Wagon-Wheel-Chainring-first-pic-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tumbleweed-Bikes-Wagon-Wheel-Chainring-first-pic-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tumbleweed-Bikes-Wagon-Wheel-Chainring-first-pic-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The benefit, or trade-off for the stainless chainring’s weight is an exponentially longer life. Tumbleweed says they have a “sponsored rider that has nearly 5000 miles of loaded touring on a stainless chainring”, which still looks new.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Wagon Wheel Retail and Detail</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail: $110 (stainless), and $85 (aluminum)</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Compatibility: For Shimano Direct Mount Cranks</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Material: 7075 aluminum and 304 stainless steel</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tooth Count: 32t</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Offset: +3mm offset</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Colors: Silver (stainless) and Black (aluminum)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Weight: 60g (aluminum), 150g (stainless)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://tumbleweed.cc/\" target=\"_blank\">TumbleweedBikes.cc</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/tumbleweed-bicycle-co-wagon-wheel-32t-shimano-direct-mount-chainring/\">Tumbleweed Bicycle Co.
