With big modern 30mm road tire clearance on 700c wheels, 12mm thru-axles &amp; flat mount disc brakes paired to a comfortable upright position with endurance road geometry tweak for flat bars, this was a great fast city commuter and weekender training road bike option for riders who didn’t want drop bars.</p><p>Then, the carbon bike was so popular, Canyon reshaped the alloy version to match with a lighter aluminum frame in the same style and carbon fork comfort. Both carbon &amp; alloy bikes offer full-coverage fender compatibility, but the new aluminum bikes add rear rack mounts, as well.</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/18045538/2022-Canyon-Roadlite-flat-bar-road-fitness-bikes_Roadlite-CF-geometry.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/18045538/2022-Canyon-Roadlite-flat-bar-road-fitness-bikes_Roadlite-CF-geometry.jpg\" alt=\"2022 Canyon Roadlite flat bar road fitness bikes, Roadlite CF geometry\" width=\"1200\" height=\"510\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/18045538/2022-Canyon-Roadlite-flat-bar-road-fitness-bikes_Roadlite-CF-geometry.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/18045538/2022-Canyon-Roadlite-flat-bar-road-fitness-bikes_Roadlite-CF-geometry-297x126.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/18045538/2022-Canyon-Roadlite-flat-bar-road-fitness-bikes_Roadlite-CF-geometry-800x340.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/18045538/2022-Canyon-Roadlite-flat-bar-road-fitness-bikes_Roadlite-CF-geometry-120x51.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/18045538/2022-Canyon-Roadlite-flat-bar-road-fitness-bikes_Roadlite-CF-geometry-768x326.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p>Available in a wide six size range (XS-XXL) and several tiers on the European market for several years, now both the entry-level carbon &amp;
