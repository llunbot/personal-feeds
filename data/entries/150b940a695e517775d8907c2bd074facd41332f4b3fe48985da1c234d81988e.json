Apple has so far given no indication that it is interested in accepting that proposal.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFollowing the court ruling and with Apple's policy changes, major app developers are already moving to make it easier for users to purchase or subscribe to content outside of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/01/spotify-ios-update-web-purchase-link/\">Spotify already submitting an app update</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/01/patreon-ios-app-update-in-app-purchases/\">Patreon indicating that it will do so</a>, and ‌Epic Games‌ saying that it will bring Fortnite back to the U.S. ‌App Store‌.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store-review-guidelines/\">App Store Review Guidelines</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/\">Epic Games</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/\">Epic Games vs. Apple</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/01/apple-updates-u-s-app-review-guidelines-epic/\">Apple Updates U.S. App Review Guidelines Following Epic Games Ruling</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-updates-u-s-app-review-guidelines-following-epic-games-ruling.2456351/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Eric Slivka","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"150b940a695e517775d8907c2bd074facd41332f4b3fe48985da1c234d81988e","category":"Apple"}
