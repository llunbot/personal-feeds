But as silly as a 1300€ aluminum folding full-suspension ebike with 20” wheels and fat 4” wide tires, solid hauling capacity, and quick swappable batteries can be… it’s actually fun to ride, and really hit the mark in replacing short car trips on two wheels.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Engwe Engine X 250 folding 20″ fat-tire ebike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-ebike_trail-riding.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-ebike_trail-riding.jpg\" alt=\"Engwe Engine X folding mini fat full-suspension ebike, trail riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-ebike_trail-riding.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-ebike_trail-riding-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-ebike_trail-riding-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-ebike_trail-riding-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-ebike_trail-riding-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-ebike_trail-riding-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-ebike_trail-riding-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s plenty of low-cost direct-to-consumer ebikes out on the market these days. And while big-name ebikes from trusted bicycle companies might be the first choice for most of our Bikerumor readers, not everyone can afford the latest tech in ebikes. Seriously, most performance ebikes we write about easily climb over $10,000 or €, some over $15k. It can be a bit crazy, really.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I write about how Shimano’s <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/shimano-emtb-autoshift-freeshift-stuns-powered-by-linkglide-xt-di2-review/\" target=\"_blank\">AutoShift &amp; FreeShift</a> are truly revolutionary in how we ride eMTBs, when I talk about how Scott’s <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2023-scott-solace-eride-lightweight-gravel-ebike/\" target=\"_blank\">Solace e-gravel</a> ebike is lighter than my steel bikepacking bike, or when I ride a crazy light TQ-powered <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/rotwild-r-x275-sets-new-lightest-trail-emtb-benchmark-at-15-3kg-for-tq-powered-ebike/\" target=\"_blank\">Rotwild eMTB</a> that weighs less than my carbon trail bike at home… all of these are just really expensive toys for people with lots of disposable income. They are all great technologies and evolutions that are making it more fun and more natural to ride ebikes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But they aren’t solving transportation problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-ebike_recyclables.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-ebike_recyclables.jpg\" alt=\"Engwe Engine X folding mini fat full-suspension ebike, recylcables\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-ebike_recyclables.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-ebike_recyclables-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-ebike_recyclables-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-ebike_recyclables-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-ebike_recyclables-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-ebike_recyclables-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This Engwe Engine X on the other hand is exactly that.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-ebike_LIDL-grocery-run.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-ebike_LIDL-grocery-run.jpg\" alt=\"Engwe Engine X folding mini fat full-suspension ebike, LIDL grovery run\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-ebike_LIDL-grocery-run.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-ebike_LIDL-grocery-run-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-ebike_LIDL-grocery-run-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-ebike_LIDL-grocery-run-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-ebike_LIDL-grocery-run-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-ebike_LIDL-grocery-run-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-ebike_LIDL-grocery-run-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not a high-performance ebike. It’s pedal-assisted transportation, and an alternative to driving a car down to the local grocery store. Also with a bit of bootleg throttle-assisted transport, too.

I tested the 1299€ Engine X 250 model (with a 400€ extra 768Wh battery) because it is the only version that you actually are legally allowed to ride on public roads in Europe. And my rationale for trying the ebike was to have something I could ride the 700m up the road to our neighborhood recycling drop-off point, 9km to the grocery store, or 13km to the train station. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also didn’t want a 9999€ ebike that I would be afraid to leave locked up for a few days at the station until I got back.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s the deal with all the crazy features?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-ebike_rear-detail.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-ebike_rear-detail.jpg\" alt=\"Engwe Engine X folding mini fat full-suspension ebike, rear rack\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-ebike_rear-detail.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-ebike_rear-detail-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-ebike_rear-detail-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-ebike_rear-detail-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-ebike_rear-detail-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-ebike_rear-detail-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting off, the Engwe Engine X is powered by a 250W brushless motor in the rear hub and a 624Wh swappable internal battery with 25km/h limited pedal-assist through a low-cost Shimano 7-speed drivetrain, and stopped by basic mechanical disc brake with 160mm rotors.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-ebike_rear-rack-detail.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-ebike_rear-rack-detail.jpg\" alt=\"Engwe Engine X folding mini fat full-suspension ebike, rea suspension\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-ebike_rear-rack-detail.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-ebike_rear-rack-detail-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-ebike_rear-rack-detail-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-ebike_rear-rack-detail-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-ebike_rear-rack-detail-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-ebike_rear-rack-detail-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-ebike_rear-rack-detail-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It has 20” diameter paired-spoke alloy mag wheels.

It’s not well-damped long travel, but instead, something to take the edge off and I guess look cool. It also is in no way adjustable. I certainly would have preferred a simpler hardtail and the cost of the extra complexity spent on making a better fork. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it wasn’t an option. Yet oddly, it hasn’t been such of a problem in 8 hard months, either.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-e-bike_folded-driveside.jpg\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-e-bike_folded-driveside.jpg\" alt=\"Engwe Engine X folding mini fat full-suspension ebike, folded\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-e-bike_folded-driveside.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-e-bike_folded-driveside-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-e-bike_folded-driveside-800x800.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-e-bike_folded-driveside-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-e-bike_folded-driveside-768x768.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh yeah, it also folds. With a pivot in the rear third of the massive boxy toptube, the ebike collapses on itself to take up less space. The overly tall stem extension shaft folds down with the handlebar next to the fork leg, and the ultra-long seatpost drops low.

Sure if you are cramped for space, the folding handlebar/stem shaft thing really takes up less space. The only reason you might fully fold it is so it will fit in the trunk of a car – or to stick it in a really big bag to smuggle it onto a German train as ‘luggage’ and not as a ‘bike’ not that I would know anything about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-e-bike_frame-detail-riding.jpg\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-e-bike_frame-detail-riding.jpg\" alt=\"Engwe Engine X folding mini fat full-suspension ebike, riding detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-e-bike_frame-detail-riding.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-e-bike_frame-detail-riding-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-e-bike_frame-detail-riding-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-e-bike_frame-detail-riding-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-e-bike_frame-detail-riding-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-folding-mini-fat-full-suspension-e-bike_frame-detail-riding-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It also gets roughly 3/4 coverage aluminum fenders that do a good job of keeping you dry and clean-ish in all conditions.

Engwe officially describes it as a “<em>strange noise when accelerating, which is a little like vibration</em>” but I would call it a mildly terrifying groan like the rear hub internals are on the verge of dying. They say it is normal, and nothing to be worried about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was worried, and would usually brake (<em>which immediately stops the pedal-assist</em>) or simply stop pedaling (<em>which stops the support also after little normal ebike lag, just a bit slower</em>) to make it stop. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But ultimately it kept making the noise and it kept working. Everything is fine (<em>I guess</em>).

It has the ultra-high handlebar Stack you would expect from a chopper motorcycle, and little provision to get the bar any lower than 33cm above the top of the headtube. But you can make it higher, if you wanted that for some reason. (The lowest handlebar Stack is ~ 860mm combining the 528mm frame Stack with that bar height.) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its headtube angle is also a wacky-sounding 86.5° that combines with the fork offset to give it a reasonable 48mm of Trail. It still flops over to the side on steep hills at ultra-low speeds or when sitting loaded and leaning to the side on its kickstand, which generally seems odd. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But once riding, it does actually work fine, going to show that there’s a lot of wiggle room in building bikes with different wheel &amp; tire sizes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How did it survive?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-250-ebike_compact-folding-20inch-mini-fat-tire-full-suspension-commuter-e-bike_playing-in-snow.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-250-ebike_compact-folding-20inch-mini-fat-tire-full-suspension-commuter-e-bike_playing-in-snow.jpg\" alt=\"Engwe Engine X 250 ebike, a compact folding 20&quot; mini fat-tire full-suspension commuter e-bike, playing in the snow\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-250-ebike_compact-folding-20inch-mini-fat-tire-full-suspension-commuter-e-bike_playing-in-snow.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-250-ebike_compact-folding-20inch-mini-fat-tire-full-suspension-commuter-e-bike_playing-in-snow-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-250-ebike_compact-folding-20inch-mini-fat-tire-full-suspension-commuter-e-bike_playing-in-snow-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-250-ebike_compact-folding-20inch-mini-fat-tire-full-suspension-commuter-e-bike_playing-in-snow-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-250-ebike_compact-folding-20inch-mini-fat-tire-full-suspension-commuter-e-bike_playing-in-snow-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-250-ebike_compact-folding-20inch-mini-fat-tire-full-suspension-commuter-e-bike_playing-in-snow-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-250-ebike_compact-folding-20inch-mini-fat-tire-full-suspension-commuter-e-bike_playing-in-snow-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, every bolt came loose, but it came with a tool kit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not a good quality tool kit, but all the wrenches you needed to tighten the bolts that rattled loose were there.

But as a modern cyclist, I wanted a bit more modern creature comforts. I didn’t buy any components to make this ebike a better ride, I simply dug into the used parts bin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing I swapped in was a less squishy saddle. You have a very upright position on this ebike so a padded seat is not a terrible idea, but I wanted literally anything firmer. I opted for the most padded PRO saddle I had with round rails that fit into the classic ‘guts’ at the top of the seatpost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then I had to deal with the cockpit. The telescoping stem shaft is super high. I slammed it all the way down – still a good 20-25cm higher than the saddle – and it still feels like riding a chopper. A shorter shaft would make serious cyclists more comfortable. Next, I ditched the tiny 57cm wide handlebar and put on an old 71cm bar, aided by some proper lock-on grips for much better off-road control to balance the wacky/washy geometry.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-250-ebike_compact-folding-20inch-mini-fat-tire-full-suspension-commuter-e-bike_hauling-a-gravel-bike.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-250-ebike_compact-folding-20inch-mini-fat-tire-full-suspension-commuter-e-bike_hauling-a-gravel-bike.jpg\" alt=\"Engwe Engine X 250 ebike, a compact folding 20&quot; mini fat-tire full-suspension commuter e-bike, hauling a gravel bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-250-ebike_compact-folding-20inch-mini-fat-tire-full-suspension-commuter-e-bike_hauling-a-gravel-bike.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-250-ebike_compact-folding-20inch-mini-fat-tire-full-suspension-commuter-e-bike_hauling-a-gravel-bike-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-250-ebike_compact-folding-20inch-mini-fat-tire-full-suspension-commuter-e-bike_hauling-a-gravel-bike-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-250-ebike_compact-folding-20inch-mini-fat-tire-full-suspension-commuter-e-bike_hauling-a-gravel-bike-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-250-ebike_compact-folding-20inch-mini-fat-tire-full-suspension-commuter-e-bike_hauling-a-gravel-bike-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-250-ebike_compact-folding-20inch-mini-fat-tire-full-suspension-commuter-e-bike_hauling-a-gravel-bike-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-250-ebike_compact-folding-20inch-mini-fat-tire-full-suspension-commuter-e-bike_hauling-a-gravel-bike-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, bigger pedals.

(<em>But being realistic, let’s not go LCA on it to get into the embodied energy or emissions from its manufacture, delivery, and end-of-use recycling/recovery.</em>)</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-250-ebike_compact-folding-20inch-mini-fat-tire-full-suspension-commuter-e-bike_Nove-Mesto-World-Cup-finish.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-250-ebike_compact-folding-20inch-mini-fat-tire-full-suspension-commuter-e-bike_Nove-Mesto-World-Cup-finish.jpg\" alt=\"Engwe Engine X 250 ebike, a compact folding 20&quot; mini fat-tire full-suspension commuter e-bike, Nove Mesto World Cup\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-250-ebike_compact-folding-20inch-mini-fat-tire-full-suspension-commuter-e-bike_Nove-Mesto-World-Cup-finish.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-250-ebike_compact-folding-20inch-mini-fat-tire-full-suspension-commuter-e-bike_Nove-Mesto-World-Cup-finish-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-250-ebike_compact-folding-20inch-mini-fat-tire-full-suspension-commuter-e-bike_Nove-Mesto-World-Cup-finish-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-250-ebike_compact-folding-20inch-mini-fat-tire-full-suspension-commuter-e-bike_Nove-Mesto-World-Cup-finish-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-250-ebike_compact-folding-20inch-mini-fat-tire-full-suspension-commuter-e-bike_Nove-Mesto-World-Cup-finish-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-250-ebike_compact-folding-20inch-mini-fat-tire-full-suspension-commuter-e-bike_Nove-Mesto-World-Cup-finish-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Engwe-Engine-X-250-ebike_compact-folding-20inch-mini-fat-tire-full-suspension-commuter-e-bike_Nove-Mesto-World-Cup-finish-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You don’t need a 15,000€ ebike to get groceries.
