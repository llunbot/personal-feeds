You get faster engagement and proven durability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the new 350 hubs just dial it back to 72-teeth on their DEG ratchet rings. You still get fast 5° engagement, with even higher strength than before. Add in larger diameter bearings, and these new 350 DEG hubs are some of the fastest and the toughest mountain bike hubs that DT Swiss makes.
