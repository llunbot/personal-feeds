The only more compliant category on BMC’s scale is TCC Gravel, and this is currently reserved for the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/gravel-bikes/bmc-urs-one-review/\">BMC URS</a> gravel bike.</p>\n<p>The frame also has dropped flat-section seatstays and a D-shaped carbon seatpost, which should also introduce greater compliance into the bike.</p>\n<p>With a 74.2-degree seat tube angle and 72-degree head tube angle across all sizes, BMC says the frame’s geometry is endurance-focused. This is slightly more aggressive than the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/bmc-roadmachine-x-review/\">aluminium Roadmachine X’s</a> geometry.</p>\n<p>BMC also says it’s kept the front centre of the bike long for stability but the chainstays short for fast acceleration.</p>\n<p>The frame has clearance for 33mm tyres and, alongside two cage mounts, it also appears to have a top-tube mounting point.</p>\n<h2>BMC and SRAM components</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The bike uses SRAM components across all models.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Schultheiss / BMC</i></span></div>\n<p>The carbon Roadmachine X is available in two build options: the top-shelf Roadmachine X ONE and the second-tier Roadmachine X TWO.</p>\n<p>Both builds use the same finishing kit from BMC, with an integrated stem design and D-section seatpost, as well as a Fizik Terra Argo X3 saddle.</p>\n<p>BMC has specced both bikes with its own wheels; the Roadmachine X ONE gets 35mm-deep carbon rims and the Roadmachine X TWO gets 25mm-deep aluminium rims. Both bikes are fitted with 32mm WTB Expanse tyres.</p>\n<p>Both bikes are also fitted with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/sram-rockshox-xplr/\">SRAM eTap XPLR</a> 1x groupsets, with the Roadmachine X TWO getting a Rival-level groupset and the Roadmachine X ONE getting Force-level. Both bikes have a single 44t front ring and 10-44t cassettes.</p>\n<h2>BMC Roadmachine X range, price and availability</h2>\n<p>BMC says the Roadmachine X ONE is available now and the Roadmachine X TWO will be available in April 2022.</p>\n<p>Pricing starts at £4,450 / $4,799 / €4,699.</p>\n<h3>BMC Roadmachine X ONE</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Roadmachine X ONE has a SRAM Force eTap groupset and carbon wheels.</span></figcaption><span> <i>BMC</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Frame/fork:</strong> Road Machine X Premium Carbon</li>\n<li><strong>Groupset:</strong> SRAM Force eTap AXS 12-speed</li>\n<li><strong>Gearing:</strong> 44t, 10-44t</li>\n<li><strong>Brakes:</strong> SRAM Force eTap AXS HRD</li>\n<li><strong>Wheels:</strong> BMC CRD-321 carbon, tubeless-ready</li>\n<li><strong>Tyres:</strong> WTB Expanse 32mm</li>\n<li><strong>Bar:</strong> BMC RAB 02 carbon</li>\n<li><strong>Stem:</strong> BMC ICS1</li>\n<li><strong>Saddle:</strong> Fizik Terra Argo X3</li>\n<li><strong>Availability:</strong> Available now</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £5,700 / $6,299 / €5,999</li>\n</ul><h3>BMC Roadmachine X TWO</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Roadmachine X TWO trades carbon wheels for aluminium.</span></figcaption><span> <i>BMC</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Frame/fork:</strong> Road Machine X Premium Carbon</li>\n<li><strong>Groupset:</strong> SRAM RIVAL AXS 12-speed</li>\n<li><strong>Gearing:</strong> 44t, 10-44t</li>\n<li><strong>Brakes:</strong> SRAM Rival eTap AXS HRD</li>\n<li><strong>Wheels:</strong> BMC XRD-522 alloy, tubeless-ready</li>\n<li><strong>Tyres:</strong> WTB Expanse, 32mm</li>\n<li><strong>Bar:</strong> BMC RAB 02</li>\n<li><strong>Stem:</strong> BMC ICS1</li>\n<li><strong>Saddle:</strong> Fizik Terra Argo X3</li>\n<li><strong>Availability:</strong> April 2022</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £4,450 / $4,799 / €4,699</li>\n</ul>","author":"Stan Portus","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"cd75f0fb1a15624b0137787df33ce0e60c0736deabfa5545465324f15d7001b4","category":"Cycling"}
