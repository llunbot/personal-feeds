A number\nthat I can’t really wrap my mind around. A number larger than the\npopulation of all but 14 countries (🤯).</p>\n\n<p>I was very conflicted about whether I should share and observe\nthis milestone publicly. I am by nature a very shy, quiet person\nand not one to seek the spotlight.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately I decided to share this milestone for two reasons:\nGratitude and Community.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Couldn’t have happened to a nicer guy, truly. Widgetsmith is proof that you just never know when something is going to <em>really</em> resonate and take off. Smith is a very talented developer (and designer) with a bunch of successful apps, but Widgetsmith in particular is a genuine sensation. 100 million downloads is a number I can’t even get my head around.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/21/widgetsmith-100m\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"46cedc79d491b50c69f727e9e82d5a894dce67d7accf245a20d2a0cafb5521b7","category":"Tech"}
