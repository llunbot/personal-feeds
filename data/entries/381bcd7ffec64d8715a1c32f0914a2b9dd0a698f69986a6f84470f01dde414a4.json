Twin Galaxies <a href=\"https://www.twingalaxies.com/feed_details.php/6194/twin-galaxies-statement/5\">announced Tuesday morning</a> that it \"shall heretofore reinstate all of Mr. Mitchell’s scores as part of the official historical database on Twin Galaxies’ website.\"</p>\n<p>The statement comes days after <a href=\"https://www.courthousenews.com/notorious-arcade-gamer-billy-mitchell-settles-suit-over-donkey-kong-world-record/\">Courthouse News reported</a> that Mitchell and Twin Galaxies had reached a confidential settlement in <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/05/billy-mitchell-takes-his-donkey-kong-high-score-cheating-case-to-court/\">a defamation case</a> surrounding Mitchell's 2018 removal from the Twin Galaxies scoreboard. </p>\n<p>Mitchell's scores appear on <a href=\"https://www.twingalaxies.com/The-Original-TG-Historical-Database\">\"The Original TG Historical Database,\"</a> a newly created section of the site that serves as a \"historical archive of the original score database, copied verbatim from the system obtained during Twin Galaxies' acquisition in 2014.\" That \"unmodified, legacy snapshot preserv[es] performances and achievements predating the current TG ownership and modern adjudication protocols,\" Twin Galaxies writes. Mitchell's scores still do not appear on <a href=\"https://www.twingalaxies.com/game/donkey-kong/arcade\">Twin Galaxies' main page of <em>Donkey Kong</em> scores</a>, which reflect more modern adjudication decisions.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995915#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995915&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"381bcd7ffec64d8715a1c32f0914a2b9dd0a698f69986a6f84470f01dde414a4","category":"Tech"}
