From the renders, we can see that the rear of the Apple Watch will consist of the same configuration of health sensors as the current Series 6.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe renders reveal no significant design changes to the Digital Crown or side button; however, they show two speakers that extend the entire side of the Apple Watch compared to the current adjacent speaker design. According to dimensions shared, the Apple Watch Series 7 will be offered in the same 40 and 44mm case sizes as expected.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhile the bezels on the upcoming watch are expected to be thinner, which would allow for a larger display, the flat edges also allow the surface area to be larger. <em>Bloomberg's</em> Mark Gurman has noted that Apple is testing a new screen lamination process for the Series 7 which will bring the display closer to the cover glass.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/91mmobile-apple-watch-series-2.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to the report, the 44mm model of the Series 6 will sport a 1.8-inch display compared to the current 1.73 display in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 6</a>. While no dimensions for the smaller 40mm model are shared, a similar proportional increase in display size can be expected. The Series 7 will also be 1.7mm thinner compared to the Series 6, according to the report.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple leaker <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/\">Jon Prosser</a> reported on an updated design for the upcoming Apple Watch Series 7 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/19/prosser-apple-watch-series-7-design/\">earlier this year</a>, and <em>91mobiles'</em> renders are mostly in line with Prosser's reporting. Reliable <em>Bloomberg</em> journalist Mark Gurman has also stated the upcoming Apple Watch model can <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/14/apple-watch-7-thinner-display-borders/\">be expected to feature design changes</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSince the introduction of the first Apple Watch, Apple has maintained the compatibility of older Apple Watch bands with all Apple Watch series. This has allowed customers to upgrade their existing Apple Watch without purchasing new bands compatible with the newer model. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhile not mentioned directly in the report, today's renders make it appear as though that despite the flat-edges of the upcoming Apple Watch, the Series 7 should maintain compatibility with older Apple Watch bands. The Apple Watch Series 7 is expected to be announced alongside the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a> at a digital Apple Event in September. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 6</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/91mobiles-com/\">91mobiles.com</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/17/apple-watch-series7-cad-larger-display/\">Alleged Apple Watch Series 7 CAD Renders Reveal New Design With Flat Edges and Larger Display</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/alleged-apple-watch-series-7-cad-renders-reveal-new-design-with-flat-edges-and-larger-display.2307798/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=YFR625aLaXo:y1RUnOyNRJ0:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=YFR625aLaXo:y1RUnOyNRJ0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/YFR625aLaXo\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"06de004bf69e08a1a0e668bd8b6208148dee4ef1136dd7eb0e55790acd54073e","category":"Apple"}
