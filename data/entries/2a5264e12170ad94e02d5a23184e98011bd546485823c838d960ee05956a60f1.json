My (former) dentist's office did this year—in writing, even. And they claimed that the recommendation came from the American Dental Association.</p>\n<p>It's a common refrain from dentists, but it's false. The American Dental Association <em>does not</em> recommend annual routine X-rays. And this is not new; it's been that way for well over a decade.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ada.org/-/media/project/ada-organization/ada/ada-org/files/resources/library/oral-health-topics/dental_radiographic_examinations_2012.pdf?rev=fd33893f4d634cbaab92733c2313c354&amp;hash=45F728CEF900B5B654539635A9147AA9\">The association's guidelines from 2012</a> recommended that adults who don't have an increased risk of dental caries (myself included) need only bitewing X-rays of the back teeth every two to three years. Even people with a higher risk of caries can go as long as 18 months between bitewings. The guidelines also note that X-rays should not be preemptively used to look for problems: \"Radiographic screening for the purpose of detecting disease before clinical examination should not be performed,\" the guidelines read. In other words, dentists are supposed to examine your teeth <em>before</em> they take any X-rays.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/10/do-you-really-need-those-routine-dental-x-rays-probably-not/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2024/10/do-you-really-need-those-routine-dental-x-rays-probably-not/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2a5264e12170ad94e02d5a23184e98011bd546485823c838d960ee05956a60f1","category":"Tech"}
