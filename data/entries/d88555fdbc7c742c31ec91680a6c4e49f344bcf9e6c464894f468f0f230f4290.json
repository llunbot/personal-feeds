The division <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/09/volkswagen-audi-porsche-vw-group-plans-one-os-to-rule-them-all/\">was created in 2019</a> to consolidate software development for VW's 10 different brands under one roof. But it's been anything but smooth sailing ever since, resulting in delays to new models and even the firing of former VW CEO Herbert Diess in 2022.</p>\n<p>Cariad was originally charged with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/04/whats-going-on-with-volkswagens-software-division/\">developing three different automotive software platforms concurrently</a>. One platform, called E3 1.1, is for VW Group's mass-market electric vehicles like the VW ID.4.</p>\n<p>E3 1.2 will debut in the more upmarket EVs currently under development by Audi and Porsche and should appear first in <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/11/heres-how-porsche-is-keeping-a-performance-focus-as-it-makes-more-evs/\">the electric Porsche Macan</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/04/this-electric-fastback-is-the-next-audi-a6-e-tron-due-in-late-2022/\">Audi's A6 e-tron</a> and Q6 e-tron. But those models have been delayed due to development difficulties and now won't appear until 2024.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1937375#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1937375&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
