Mondraker says it’s all about balance. This is still a relatively expensive ebike, but Mondraker wanted to build a more accessible entry point for riders looking to get into ebikes. So, with the lighter-assist SX motor and a 400Wh tucked inside a normal-looking alloy frame, the Sly should make a great stepping stone to pedal-assisted trail riding…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Mondraker Sly eMTB 150/160mm alloy all-mountain ebike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mondraker-Sly-light-aluminum-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mondraker-Sly-light-aluminum-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2025 Mondraker Sly lightweight alloy eMTB, aluminum all-mountain ebike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mondraker-Sly-light-aluminum-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mondraker-Sly-light-aluminum-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mondraker-Sly-light-aluminum-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mondraker-Sly-light-aluminum-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mondraker-Sly-light-aluminum-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mondraker-Sly-light-aluminum-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Mondraker)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So where is the logical entry point to performance eMTBs? Mondraker thinks their new Sly might be the answer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their carbon Crafty goes full-blast with a torque-y Bosch CX motor and huge batteries for big range. The carbon Neat with its ultralight TQ powertrain doubles down on less weight for a more natural ride. And now, the Mondraker Sly fills that gap in between. And at prices that put an eMTB a bit more in-reach of the average mountain biker.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mondraker-Sly-light-aluminum-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_climbing-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mondraker-Sly-light-aluminum-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_climbing-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2025 Mondraker Sly lightweight alloy eMTB, aluminum all-mountain ebike, climbing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mondraker-Sly-light-aluminum-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_climbing-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mondraker-Sly-light-aluminum-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_climbing-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mondraker-Sly-light-aluminum-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_climbing-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mondraker-Sly-light-aluminum-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_climbing-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Mondraker-Sly-light-aluminum-eMTB-all-mountain-ebike_climbing-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s Mondraker’s 3rd light mid-power eMTB (after the carbon Neat &amp; Dune).

Why alloy? Because it makes sense! It’s where everything started, it’s never gone out of fashion, and the demand is still there. In fact, after NEAT and DUNE, this has been a very special project for us. We’ve been very committed to making this a really, really nice bike, using cutting-edge manufacturing techniques and giving it a very refined finish which makes this one our lightest and finest Stealth Alloy full suspension e-MTB framesets ever.<br />This bike represents a deepening of our trust and confidence in the light e-MTB market. Moreover, the Bosch Performance SX motor shares the same philosophy as the SLY, ‘punchy’, ‘powerful’ and ‘light’; They could have been made for each other. The specifications were important too. We wanted them to be down-to-earth to give that ‘real’ feel on the trails and I think we nailed it.”</p>\n<cite><em>– Luis Martínez, Mondraker Product Manager</em></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details from Mondraker:</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2025-Mondraker-Sly-lightweight-alloy-eMTB_150mm-aluminum-all-mountain-ebike_classic-angular-aesthetic-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2025-Mondraker-Sly-lightweight-alloy-eMTB_150mm-aluminum-all-mountain-ebike_classic-angular-aesthetic-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2025 Mondraker Sly lightweight alloy eMTB, aluminum all-mountain ebike, mondraker looks in alloy\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2025-Mondraker-Sly-lightweight-alloy-eMTB_150mm-aluminum-all-mountain-ebike_classic-angular-aesthetic-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2025-Mondraker-Sly-lightweight-alloy-eMTB_150mm-aluminum-all-mountain-ebike_classic-angular-aesthetic-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2025-Mondraker-Sly-lightweight-alloy-eMTB_150mm-aluminum-all-mountain-ebike_classic-angular-aesthetic-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2025-Mondraker-Sly-lightweight-alloy-eMTB_150mm-aluminum-all-mountain-ebike_classic-angular-aesthetic-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/2025-Mondraker-Sly-lightweight-alloy-eMTB_150mm-aluminum-all-mountain-ebike_classic-angular-aesthetic-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Stealth Alloy frame with seamless welds to recreate classic ‘organically angular’ Mondraker design aesthetic</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Updated Zero Suspension System with the same NEAT kinematics</li>\n\n\n\n<li>29” wheels with 150mm travel and a 160mm fork</li>\n\n\n\n<li>classic Mondraker Forward Geometry</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Bosch Performance SX 55Nm x 250W motor (600W peak), with 4 fully tunable assist modes</li>\n\n\n\n<li>400Wh integrated internal battery, with up to 1500m vertical gain range</li>\n\n\n\n<li>compatible with 250Wh Powermore range extender, for an extra +60% range</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Bosch eMTB controller set in the toptube, plus handlebar-mounted eBike display</li>\n\n\n\n<li>HHG (Hidden Housing Guide) headtube integrated cable guiding</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2x sets of bottle bosses for 2 water bottles or 1 bottle + range extender</li>\n\n\n\n<li>max 29 x 2.6” (66mm) rear tire clearance</li>\n\n\n\n<li>integrated rear shock guard, plus plastic &amp;
