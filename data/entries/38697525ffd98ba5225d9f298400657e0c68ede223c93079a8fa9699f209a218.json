Xcode 15.2 can be used by developers to create ‌visionOS‌ apps for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a> headset, and it also includes SDKs for iOS 17.2, iPadOS 17.2, tvOS 17.2, watchOS 10.2, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/\">macOS Sonoma</a> 14.2.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs for TestFlight, version 3.5 of the app allows for the beta testing of ‌visionOS‌ apps for the first time, plus it allows compatible iOS and iPadOS apps to be used on the ‌Apple Vision Pro‌ headset.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApps created for ‌visionOS‌ can be submitted to the ‌Apple Vision Pro‌ <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> starting today.
