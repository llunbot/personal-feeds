For example, if you recently searched for \"Japchae,\" you might see suggestions for other popular Korean dishes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nElsewhere, Google says it has also improved image results. Previously, Chrome only displayed images for search suggestions in the address bar that matched a specific product users were looking for. Now on iOS and Android, Chrome will show images for broader shopping categories and products based on simple searches. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nLastly, Chrome on Android and iOS now has improved on-device capabilities that will give users search suggestions even when they have a poor network conntection. Google claims this will also mean more helpful suggestions when Incognito Mode is enabled.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGoogle says the three new features are now gradually being rolled out to Chrome users. The changes follow last week's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/22/google-chrome-mac-help-me-write-ai/\">launch</a> of a new generative AI-based \"Help me Write\" feature that is available for Chrome browser for desktops.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/\">Google</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chrome/\">Chrome</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/01/google-chrome-new-web-search-features/\">Google Boosts Chrome's Web Search Suggestions on Mobile and Desktop</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-boosts-chromes-web-search-suggestions-on-mobile-and-desktop.2420784/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"db2823dd37151e19c027dc2662ee634b6675cc47845a4dfa73358cc576880e45","category":"Apple"}
