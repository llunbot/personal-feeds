It's the company's first launch in over a year of a graphics card that could charitably be described as \"mainstream,\" both in performance and in price. It costs <a href=\"https://howl.me/cjzRfNi4CJZ\" target=\"_blank\">$600</a>.</p>\n<p>It's not productive to keep going back to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/03/nvidia-gtx-1080-ti-review/\">the also-$600 GTX 1080</a>, at the time the fastest graphics card you could buy anywhere from anyone, and wondering how we <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/12/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4080-review-second-only-to-the-4090-for-now/\">got here</a> from there (<a href=\"https://www.in2013dollars.com/us/inflation/2016?amount=600\">some of it</a> is inflation, not all of it). But I keep doing it as a reminder that $600 is still more than many people pay for their entire PC, tablet, smartphone, or high-end game console. No other component in a gaming PC has seen its price shoot up like this over the same span of time; a Core i5 CPU cost around $200 in 2016 and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/intels-core-i5-is-the-best-bargain-in-cpus-right-now-but-which-should-you-get/\">costs around $200 now</a>, and RAM and SSDs are both historically cheap at the moment.</p>\n<p>To review the 4070 is to simultaneously be impressed by it as a product while also being frustrated with the conditions that led us to an \"impressive\" $600 midrange graphics card. It's pretty fast, very efficient, and much more reasonably sized than other recent Nvidia GPUs. In today's topsy-turvy graphics card market, I could even describe it as a good deal. But if you're still yearning for the days when you could spend $300 or less on a reasonably performant GPU with the latest architecture and modern features, keep waiting.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1931927#p3\">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1931927&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"66a7736b2eda78e6e56bd500109f881e308aefdf123a0df72c6140a54661d1ed","category":"Tech"}
