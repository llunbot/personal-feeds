Yet broad confidentiality agreements block us from voicing our concerns, except to the very companies that may be failing to address these issues. Ordinary whistleblower protections are insufficient because they focus on illegal activity, whereas many of the risks we are concerned about are not yet regulated.</blockquote>\r<br />\nEmployees are ultimately calling on AI companies to offer solid whistleblower protections for speaking out about the risks of AI.\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n \t<li>Avoid creating or enforcing agreements that prevent criticism for risk-related concerns.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Offer a verifiably anonymous process for employees to raise risk-related concerns to the board, regulators, and independent organizations with relevant expertise.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Support a culture of open criticism to allow employees to raise risk-related concerns about technologies to the public, the board, regulators, and more, as long as trade secrets are protected.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Avoid retaliating against employees who publicly share risk-related confidential information after other processes have failed.</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\nA total of 13 employees signed the letter, including seven former OpenAI employees, four current OpenAI employees, one former Google DeepMind employee, and one current Google DeepMind employee. OpenAI <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/5/17/24158478/openai-departures-sam-altman-employees-chatgpt-release\">has threatened</a> employees with loss of vested equity for speaking up, and it makes them sign draconian NDA agreements that muzzle criticism.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe letter comes as Apple prepares to announce multiple AI-powered features for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a> and other software updates on Monday.
