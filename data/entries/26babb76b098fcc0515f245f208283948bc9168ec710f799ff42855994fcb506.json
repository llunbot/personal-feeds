Modern iPhones and iPads have bright enough screens to remain clearly viewable in summer while also consuming much less power despite the larger size.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But brightness isn’t everything. iOS/iPadOS generally adjusts the brightness of a device’s display to match its analysis of the lighting conditions you’re currently amid. You may not always want that. You can disable default settings and use manual controls to keep brightness where you want it.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Check out these tips to save the battery life on your <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1510063/how-to-make-your-iphone-battery-last-longer.html\">iPhone</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2424975/ipad-battery-tips-dark-mode-charging-airplane-mode.html\">iPad</a>.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>Adjust brightness manually</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even with automatic brightness adjustment enabled, you can always swipe to display the Control Center and drag the Brightness slider up or down. That provides an override to the current setting until your iPhone locks after a specified delay, or you press the side or top button. (You can adjust the Auto-Lock duration in <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>Display &amp; Brightness</em>.) You can also go to <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>Display &amp; Brightness</em> to access the slider there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have an iPhone or iPad with True Tone, the Display &amp; Brightness settings also show a True Tone switch. True Tone uses multiple sensors to determine the ambient lighting and then adjust the hue and intensity. This can make images, videos, and flat colors onscreen appear visually the same in different lighting conditions. If you find that distracting, you can disable it. (True Tone appears in the iPhone 8 and later, iPhone SE 2nd generation and later, and <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-kz/guide/ipad/aside/ipade8ab292d/17.0/ipados/17.0\">many iPad models</a>.)</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac911-auto-bright-sbs.png\" alt=\"iOS brightness settings\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac911-auto-bright-sbs.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac911-auto-bright-sbs.png?resize=300%2C281&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac911-auto-bright-sbs.png?resize=768%2C719&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"958\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption><p>You can manually adjust brightness from the Control Center (left), or opt to disable automatic brightness adjustment altogether (right).</p></figcaption>\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"iOS brightness settings\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac911-auto-bright-sbs.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac911-auto-bright-sbs.png?resize=300%2C281&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac911-auto-bright-sbs.png?resize=768%2C719&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"958\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>You can manually adjust brightness from the Control Center (left), or opt to disable automatic brightness adjustment altogether (right).</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"iOS brightness settings\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac911-auto-bright-sbs.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac911-auto-bright-sbs.png?resize=300%2C281&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/mac911-auto-bright-sbs.png?resize=768%2C719&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"958\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>You can manually adjust brightness from the Control Center (left), or opt to disable automatic brightness adjustment altogether (right).</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Disable automatic brightness</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You may find that your iPhone or iPad changing the brightness level automatically is less useful to you than letting you set a fixed brightness and adjusting it to your liking. If so, go to <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>Accessibility</em> &gt; <em>Display &amp; Text Size</em> and disable <em>Auto-Brightness</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple uses Auto-Brightness as part of the way it manages battery life on your device. After disabling the feature, you may notice faster battery consumption during normal usage. You can check how the battery’s power drains over a day using the chart in <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>Battery</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ask Mac 911</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve compiled a list of the questions we get asked most frequently, along with answers and links to columns: <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/3077986/os-x/your-top-questions-to-mac-911-and-some-answers.html\">read our super FAQ</a> to see if your question is covered.
