Until now, pretty much every geared ebike on the market had essentially just added a powerful new motor into an existing bicycle drivetrain initially designed solely for human pedal power, with various levels of shifting success. Now, Pinion leverages their internal gearbox expertise to combine motor and gearing into a single integrated ebike drive system designed to provide powerful, smooth pedal-assist support and the simplicity &amp; security of direct chain or belt drive to a rear wheel without a derailleur.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pinion Mission ON.E combined ebike motor &amp; gearbox</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pinion-ON-E-combined-ebike-motor-gearbox-unit-MGU-complete-transmission-powertrain_drive-unit.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pinion-ON-E-combined-ebike-motor-gearbox-unit-MGU-complete-transmission-powertrain_drive-unit.jpg\" alt=\"Pinion ON.E combined ebike motor gearbox unit MGU complete transmission powertrain, detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pinion-ON-E-combined-ebike-motor-gearbox-unit-MGU-complete-transmission-powertrain_drive-unit.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pinion-ON-E-combined-ebike-motor-gearbox-unit-MGU-complete-transmission-powertrain_drive-unit-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pinion-ON-E-combined-ebike-motor-gearbox-unit-MGU-complete-transmission-powertrain_drive-unit-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pinion-ON-E-combined-ebike-motor-gearbox-unit-MGU-complete-transmission-powertrain_drive-unit-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pinion-ON-E-combined-ebike-motor-gearbox-unit-MGU-complete-transmission-powertrain_drive-unit-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pinion-ON-E-combined-ebike-motor-gearbox-unit-MGU-complete-transmission-powertrain_drive-unit-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Pinion’s ON.E drive is truly the first mainstream self-contained ebike powertrain – electric pedal-assist motor &amp; electronically shifing transmission in one. Pinion calls it a MGU solution: motor + gearbox unit. A development project 12 years in the making, now all ebike drive components – motor, shifting system, sensors, and control tech – have been developed from the ground up as a single system, designed to work seamlessly together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Connected as one, the MGU of the Pinion ON.E eDrive system always knows what gear the rider is in, what cadence &amp; pedal-power the rider is inputting, and can adjust the speed &amp; motor power support accordingly for perfect internal shifts &amp; smooth power output to the rear wheel. The ON.E means an ebike that “<em>knows when to shift, shifts precisely, reliably, instantaneously and – depending on the setting – can even shift for you</em>“. Pinion says the result is an ebike with “<em>unmatched reliability and performance in a package of similar size and weight as other current mid-motor e-bike drive systems with external shifting components</em>“. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pinion-ON-E-combined-ebike-motor-gearbox-unit-MGU-complete-transmission-powertrain_eMTB-detail.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pinion-ON-E-combined-ebike-motor-gearbox-unit-MGU-complete-transmission-powertrain_eMTB-detail.jpg\" alt=\"Pinion ON.E combined ebike motor gearbox unit MGU complete transmission powertrain, on the trail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pinion-ON-E-combined-ebike-motor-gearbox-unit-MGU-complete-transmission-powertrain_eMTB-detail.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pinion-ON-E-combined-ebike-motor-gearbox-unit-MGU-complete-transmission-powertrain_eMTB-detail-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pinion-ON-E-combined-ebike-motor-gearbox-unit-MGU-complete-transmission-powertrain_eMTB-detail-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pinion-ON-E-combined-ebike-motor-gearbox-unit-MGU-complete-transmission-powertrain_eMTB-detail-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pinion-ON-E-combined-ebike-motor-gearbox-unit-MGU-complete-transmission-powertrain_eMTB-detail-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pinion-ON-E-combined-ebike-motor-gearbox-unit-MGU-complete-transmission-powertrain_eMTB-detail-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pinion-ON-E-combined-ebike-motor-gearbox-unit-MGU-complete-transmission-powertrain_eMTB-detail-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption><em>all c.

The fact that Pinion, a German medium-sized company, is outsmarting the global corporations and being the first to come onto the market with a motor-gear unit is not just a nice underdog story, but also proof of its innovative strength.</p>\n<cite>– Arne Bischoff, Pressedienst-Fahrrad</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a

/></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Pinion rates their new powertrain as outputting a max virtual 85Nm of torque to compare it to other systems (based on a 1:1 gearing ratio.) Since their system actually combines motor and gearbox in one, its real torque varies by what gear you are in – it tops out at a real 160Nm at the rear wheel. But that also means that you don’t lose nearly as much energy/torque/power in the drivetrain itself. It’s also the same reason why comparing ebike hub motor and mid-drive motor torque is difficult, so we’ll assume Pinion’s 85Nm figure is comparable to standard mid-drive motors.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pinion-ON-E-combined-ebike-motor-gearbox-unit-MGU-complete-transmission-powertrain_detail.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pinion-ON-E-combined-ebike-motor-gearbox-unit-MGU-complete-transmission-powertrain_detail.jpg\" alt=\"Pinion ON.E combined ebike motor gearbox unit MGU complete transmission powertrain, drivetrain detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pinion-ON-E-combined-ebike-motor-gearbox-unit-MGU-complete-transmission-powertrain_detail.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pinion-ON-E-combined-ebike-motor-gearbox-unit-MGU-complete-transmission-powertrain_detail-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pinion-ON-E-combined-ebike-motor-gearbox-unit-MGU-complete-transmission-powertrain_detail-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pinion-ON-E-combined-ebike-motor-gearbox-unit-MGU-complete-transmission-powertrain_detail-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pinion-ON-E-combined-ebike-motor-gearbox-unit-MGU-complete-transmission-powertrain_detail-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pinion-ON-E-combined-ebike-motor-gearbox-unit-MGU-complete-transmission-powertrain_detail-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course, one of the most important features of even a standard Pinion gearbox is its combined low maintenance and longevity.
