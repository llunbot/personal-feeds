The judge determined that internal company documents showed Apple deliberately violated her earlier order.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/01/apple-updates-u-s-app-review-guidelines-epic/\">complied</a> with the latest ruling immediately but is now asking for relief from what it describes as \"punitive\" measures that would cost it \"hundreds of millions to billions\" of dollars annually. The company wants the appeals court to issue a ruling by May 28.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"These new rules are not temporary sanctions for non-compliance that Apple can purge,\" the filing states. \"Instead, the district court took the highly irregular step of imposing new, different, and permanent restrictions.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAt the heart of the dispute is how Apple implemented the original 2021 injunction. After losing at trial, Apple created a new entitlement system that allowed developers to include links to external payment options, but <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/us-app-store-alternative-purchase-option/\">imposed a 12-27% commission</a> on purchases made through those links and restricted where the links could appear.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEpic Games argued this framework violated both the letter and spirit of the court's order, and Judge Gonzalez Rogers ultimately agreed, finding that Apple's approach \"undermine[d] the spirit of the injunction by limiting competition.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn its emergency motion, Apple contends the judge exceeded her authority by essentially setting its prices at zero and taking control over how developers can present alternative payment options within apps.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSeveral major apps including <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/01/spotify-ios-update-web-purchase-link/\">Spotify</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/06/kindle-app-gets-biggest-ios-change-in-a-decade/\">Kindle</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/01/patreon-ios-app-update-in-app-purchases/\">Patreon</a> have already updated their iOS apps to include direct links to external payment methods since the ruling took effect.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEpic Games responded to Apple's emergency motion by calling it \"a last ditch effort to block competition and extract massive junk fees at the expense of consumers and developers.\" The company added that it was \"full speed ahead to bring Fortnite to iPhones and iPads in the U.S. this week.\"<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/\">Apple Antitrust</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/\">Epic Games vs. Apple</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/08/apple-appeals-app-store-ruling-epic-games/\">Apple Seeks to Pause 'Extraordinary' App Store Ruling in Epic Games Battle</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeks-to-pause-extraordinary-app-store-ruling-in-epic-games-battle.2456706/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"77a7bb144e6726b0042efa64fa3a7a33f4d84bad86092d27d0c4d9f6b053e312","category":"Apple"}
