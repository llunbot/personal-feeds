Powered by custom fourth generation Intel Xeon Scalable Processors (Sapphire Rapids), these high memory instances are designed to support large, in-memory databases including SAP HANA, Oracle, and SQL Server. Here are the specs:</p> \n<table> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>Instance Name</strong></td> \n   <td><strong>vCPUs<br /> </strong></td> \n   <td><strong>Memory (DDR5)<br /> </strong></td> \n   <td><strong>EBS Bandwidth<br /> </strong></td> \n   <td><strong>Network Bandwidth<br /> </strong></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>u7i-12tb.224xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>896</td> \n   <td>12,288 GiB</td> \n   <td>60 Gbps</td> \n   <td>100 Gbps</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>u7in-16tb.224xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>896</td> \n   <td>16,384 GiB</td> \n   <td>100 Gbps</td> \n   <td>200 Gbps</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>u7in-24tb.224xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>896</td> \n   <td>24,576 GiB</td> \n   <td>100 Gbps</td> \n   <td>200 Gbps</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>u7in-32tb.224xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>896</td> \n   <td>32,768 GiB</td> \n   <td>100 Gbps</td> \n   <td>200 Gbps</td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>The new instances deliver the best compute price performance for large in-memory workloads, and offer the highest memory and compute power of any SAP-certified virtual instance from a leading cloud provider.</p> \n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/\">AWS Nitro System</a>, all of the memory on the instance is available for use. For example, here’s the 32 TiB instance:</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/05/28/u7i_32tb_ga_1.png\" width=\"1081\" height=\"231\" /></p> \n<p>In comparison to the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/now-available-amazon-ec2-high-memory-instances-with-6-9-and-12-tb-of-memory-perfect-for-sap-hana/\">previous generation</a> of EC2 High Memory instances, the U7i instances offer more than 135% of the compute performance, up to 115% more memory performance, and 2.5x the EBS bandwidth. This increased bandwidth allows you to transfer 30 TiB of data from EBS into memory in an hour or less, making data loads and cache refreshes faster than ever before. The instances also support <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-ena-express-improved-network-latency-and-per-flow-performance-on-ec2/\">ENA Express</a> with 25 Gbps of bandwidth per flow, and provide an 85% improvement in P99.9 latency between instances.</p> \n<p>Each U7i instance supports attachment of up to 128 General Purpose (gp2 and gp3) or Provisioned IOPS (io1 and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-ebs-io2-block-express-volumes-with-amazon-ec2-r5b-instances-are-now-generally-available/\">io2 Block Express</a>) EBS volumes. Each io2 Block Express volume can be as big as 64 TiB and can deliver up to 256K IOPS at up to 32 Gbps, making them a great match for U7i instances.</p> \n<p>The instances are SAP certified to run Business Suite on HANA, Business Suite S/4HANA, Business Warehouse on HANA (BW), and SAP BW/4HANA in production environments.
