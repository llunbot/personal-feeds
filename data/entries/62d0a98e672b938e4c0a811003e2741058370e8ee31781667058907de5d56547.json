At launch, it seemed like a no-brainer—an all-electric version of the nation's most popular four-wheel vehicle that rode better than any other F-150 and a starting price of just $40,000 sure sounded compelling. In practice, things haven't worked out quite that well. Today, we learned that F-150 Lighting prices are increasing for some trims, and others are being retired altogether.</p>\n<p>When Ford first announced Lightning pricing in 2021, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/05/ford-reveals-pricing-for-the-f-150-lightning-pro-work-truck/\">the range started at</a> $39,974 for a Lightning Pro—the trim aimed at commercial customers—with the standard range battery, or $49,974 for the Lightning Pro with a larger battery capable of 300 miles of range. The F-150 Lightning XLT was the entry-level model for private customers, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/05/heres-what-we-know-about-fords-electric-f-150-lightning-pickup/\">which originally cost $52,974</a>, with more expensive Lariat and Platinum trims that topped out at $90,874.</p>\n<p>But Ford raised those prices before too long, then raised them again. Coupled with a post-pandemic trend of outrageous additional dealer markups, this spelled bad news for F-150 Lightning sales—the entry-level F-150 Lightning Pro cost $59,974 by the middle of 2023, $20,000 more than the 2021 pricing. In July 2023, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/07/ford-slashes-f-150-lightning-ev-prices-by-up-to-9979/\">the automaker cut F-150 Lightning prices heavily</a>, but prices remained significantly higher than at launch.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1993462#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1993462&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
