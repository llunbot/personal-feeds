Explore the incredible range of mountain bike trails in and around the canyon, with terrain suited for riders of all levels. In <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.alltrails.com/parks/us/texas/palo-duro-canyon-state-park/mountain-biking\">Palo Duro Canyon State Park</a>, choose from five bike-friendly, multi-use trails and one technical mountain bike-only trail that wind along the canyon floor. The stratified redrock cliffs and towering hoodoos provide a stunning backdrop for the ride. Keep an eye out for wildlife — including Texas horned lizards, wild turkeys, roadrunners, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or head to the canyon rim, where more than 10 miles of singletrack and an additional 20 miles of bike-friendly doubletrack and dirt roads at <a href=\"https://merusadventure.com/mountain-biking/\" target=\"_blank\">MERUS Adventure MTB trails</a>. Perched atop the redrock escarpments these trails offer stunning views of the region’s unique landscape and the canyon below.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Canyons-Plains-of-the-Texas-Panhandle-1.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"695\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Canyons-Plains-of-the-Texas-Panhandle-1.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Canyons-Plains-of-the-Texas-Panhandle-1.webp 1000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Canyons-Plains-of-the-Texas-Panhandle-1-297x206.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Canyons-Plains-of-the-Texas-Panhandle-1-120x83.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Canyons-Plains-of-the-Texas-Panhandle-1-768x534.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/03/PassportToAdventure_MountainBikingTX_inline-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Canyons-Plains-of-the-Texas-Panhandle2.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"695\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Canyons-Plains-of-the-Texas-Panhandle2.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Canyons-Plains-of-the-Texas-Panhandle2.webp 1000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Canyons-Plains-of-the-Texas-Panhandle2-297x206.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Canyons-Plains-of-the-Texas-Panhandle2-120x83.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Canyons-Plains-of-the-Texas-Panhandle2-768x534.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Honda Genuine Accessories — like the frame or fork mount bike attachments — add versatility so you can explore new rugged adventures; (top/Alamy; bottom/Honda) <br /><br /><em>Disclaimer: Passport TrailSport Elite shown with Honda Genuine Accessories.

At <a href=\"https://tpwd.texas.gov/state-parks/possum-kingdom\" target=\"_blank\">Possom Kingdom State Park</a>, clear blue waters and more than 300 miles of shoreline bordered by dramatic cliffs make for an intriguing paddle. Navigate hidden coves and around protruding rock formations as you explore the 17,000-acre lake. Then make your way to the southeastern corner of the lake where you can continue your journey down one of the most scenic stretches of the Brazos River, which flows under high granite bluffs before opening up to reveal spectacular views of the Palo Pinto Mountains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the northern part of the Panhandle, <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lamr/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Lake Meredith National Recreation Area</a> is an oasis amid the region’s arid grasslands. The lake is prone to high winds, but non-motorized vessels can find a quiet refuge to paddle in the Spring Canyon Basin. The basin’s wetlands are one of seven unique habitats around the lake that support migratory birds and other wildlife. After your paddle, don’t miss a chance to go for a spin on the recreation area’s <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/lamr/planyourvisit/ohv-off-highway-vehicles.htm\" target=\"_blank\">OHV trails at Blue Creek or Rosita Flats</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/02/PassportToAdventure_LakeMeredithTexas_inline.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Canyons-Plains-of-the-Texas-Panhandle3.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"695\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Canyons-Plains-of-the-Texas-Panhandle3.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Canyons-Plains-of-the-Texas-Panhandle3.webp 1000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Canyons-Plains-of-the-Texas-Panhandle3-297x206.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Canyons-Plains-of-the-Texas-Panhandle3-120x83.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Canyons-Plains-of-the-Texas-Panhandle3-768x534.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Canyons-Plains-of-the-Texas-Panhandle4.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"695\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Canyons-Plains-of-the-Texas-Panhandle4.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Canyons-Plains-of-the-Texas-Panhandle4.webp 1000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Canyons-Plains-of-the-Texas-Panhandle4-297x206.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Canyons-Plains-of-the-Texas-Panhandle4-120x83.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Canyons-Plains-of-the-Texas-Panhandle4-768x534.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>The 10-speed transmission offers precise gearing to handle rough trails with ease; (top photos/Shutterstock, bottom photo/Honda) <br /><br /><em>Disclaimer: Passport TrailSport Elite shown with Honda Genuine Accessories.</em><br /><a href=\"https://automobiles.honda.com/passport#trailsport\" target=\"_blank\"></a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n<a href=\"https://automobiles.honda.com/passport#trailsport\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the Honda Passport TrailSport</a>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Adventure Off-Road</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of OHV trails, beginners and seasoned off-road drivers can put their skills to the test at the <a href=\"https://merusadventure.com/off-roading/\" target=\"_blank\">off-road trails at MERUS Adventure</a>.

Choose drive-in sites with full hookups or primitive hike-in sites. Either way, you’ll have a chance to pitch your tent beneath the stunning Caprock Escarpment this popular park is known for. During the day, explore trails through dramatic redrock landscapes and spot Southern Plains bison on the grasslands. After the sun goes down, direct your gaze upward. As a Dark Sky Preserve, the park offers exceptional views of the cosmos with minimal light pollution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking for a more secluded spot? Opt for <a href=\"https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/cibola/home/?cid=stelprdb5397425\" target=\"_blank\">Lake Marvin</a> in the Black Kettle National Grasslands or <a href=\"https://tpwd.texas.gov/state-parks/copper-breaks\" target=\"_blank\">Copper Breaks State Park</a> — both near the Oklahoma border.

Across region’s vast landscapes, the last remaining Texas longhorn herds graze. Keep an eye out for the iconic symbols of the state’s western heritage in pastures throughout the Panhandle, including at <a href=\"https://thc.texas.gov/historic-sites/fort-griffin\" target=\"_blank\">Fort Griffin Historic Site</a> along the historic Great Western Cattle Trail, where the largest herd resides. Or get a chance to observe smaller herds at Copper Break, Palo Duro Canyon, and San Angelo state parks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, cruise Highway 40 — known as the Main Street of America because of its connection to the Historic Route 66 — to hit a variety of unique locales, including the Leaning Tower of Texas, the Historic 6th Street District and colorful murals throughout downtown Amarillo, and plenty of <a href=\"https://www.visitamarillo.com/blog/post/9-funny-weird-original-roadside-attractions-in-texas/\" target=\"_blank\">entertaining roadside art</a>. If you’ve worked up an appetite on the road, you’re in luck. The Texas Panhandle is home to some of the most iconic Texan-sized meals. Stop by the <a href=\"https://www.bigtexan.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Big Texan Steak Ranch</a> where you can tuck into a 72-ounce steak — free of charge if you can finish the full meal in one sitting — and other Texan meals of more reasonable portions.<a href=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/images.gearjunkie.com/uploads/2025/03/PassportToAdventure_Roadside_inline.jpg\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Canyons-Plains-of-the-Texas-Panhandle9.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"695\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Canyons-Plains-of-the-Texas-Panhandle9.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Canyons-Plains-of-the-Texas-Panhandle9.webp 1000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Canyons-Plains-of-the-Texas-Panhandle9-297x206.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Canyons-Plains-of-the-Texas-Panhandle9-120x83.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Canyons-Plains-of-the-Texas-Panhandle9-768x534.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Canyons-Plains-of-the-Texas-Panhandle10.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1295\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Canyons-Plains-of-the-Texas-Panhandle10.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Canyons-Plains-of-the-Texas-Panhandle10.webp 1295w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Canyons-Plains-of-the-Texas-Panhandle10-297x172.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Canyons-Plains-of-the-Texas-Panhandle10-120x69.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Canyons-Plains-of-the-Texas-Panhandle10-768x445.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Seamlessly transition from off-road to on with smart features like the active shuttle grille, which automatically opens and closes to help with efficiency and improved aerodynamics; (top/Shutterstock; bottom/Honda)   <br /><br /><em>Disclaimer: Honda Passport TrailSport Elite shown with Honda Genuine Accessories.<br />Honda reminds you to properly secure cargo items and follow all applicable load limits and loading guidelines.</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n<a href=\"https://automobiles.honda.com/passport#trailsport\" target=\"_blank\">Explore the Honda Passport TrailSport</a>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article was sponsored by the all-new </em><a href=\"https://automobiles.honda.com/passport#trailsport\" target=\"_blank\">2026 Honda Passport TrailSport</a><em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/explore-off-road-in-the-canyons-plains-of-the-texas-panhandle/\">Explore Off-Road in the Canyons &amp; Plains of the Texas Panhandle</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Meghan Miranda","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"d69a66cf09747612567fabfd5993259be631267d1b66d8bc8aa414760ae2311b","category":"Cycling"}
