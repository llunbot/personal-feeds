This document is intended to provide an overview of the changing state of our knowledge about the process itself and its impact on our environment. Past versions have been comprehensive and involved the work of hundreds of scientists, all coordinated by the US's Global Change Research Program.</p>\n<p>It's not clear what the next report will look like.

It is a very detailed look at the state of climate science, the impacts warming is having on the US, and our efforts to limit warming and deal with those impacts. Various agencies and local governments have used it to help plan for the expected impacts of our warming climate.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/trump-admin-may-be-trying-to-sabotage-the-national-climate-assessment/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/trump-admin-may-be-trying-to-sabotage-the-national-climate-assessment/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3f9b0e9702edcd2f117e5f044b53e0ee745819f55cc65937928920cb256b93c5","category":"Tech"}
