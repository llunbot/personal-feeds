Microsoft is turning Recall off by default when users set up PCs that are compatible with the feature, and it's adding additional authentication and encryption that will make it harder to access another user's Recall data on the same PC.</p>\n\n<p>It's likely not a coincidence that Microsoft also <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/05/22/releasing-windows-11-version-24h2-to-the-release-preview-channel/\">quietly pulled</a> the build of the Windows 11 24H2 update that it had been testing <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/biggest-windows-11-update-in-2-years-nearly-finalized-enters-release-preview/\">in its Release Preview channel</a> for Windows Insiders. It's not unheard of for Microsoft to stop distributing a beta build of Windows after releasing it, but the Release Preview channel is typically the last stop for a Windows update before a wider release.</p>\n<p>Microsoft hasn't provided a specific rationale for pulling the update; the blog post says the pause is \"temporary\" and the rollout will be resumed \"in the coming weeks.\" Windows Insider Senior Program Manager Brandon LeBlanc <a href=\"https://x.com/brandonleblanc/status/1799478915582542199\">posted</a> on social media that the team was \"working to get it rolling out again shortly.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030031#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030031&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"186b430550d30725a6efd4938b3cad7b326fc17757d010470bfbb4751ffa9d54","category":"Tech"}
