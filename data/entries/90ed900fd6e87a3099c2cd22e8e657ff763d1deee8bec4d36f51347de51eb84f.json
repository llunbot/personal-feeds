On Wednesday, a group of seven major automakers announced a plan to create a new charging network of more than 30,000 chargers across North America starting next year.</p>\n<p>BMW, General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz, and Stellantis are creating a joint venture to significantly expand the number of fast-charging sites in the US and Canada. The sites will use the new <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/02/heres-how-the-government-plans-to-make-ev-chargers-common-and-reliable/\">National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure guidelines</a>, which means, among other things, 97 percent uptime for each charging port. The sites will support both <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/07/the-ars-technica-guide-to-electric-vehicle-charging/3/\">CCS1 and NACS plugs</a>, and the chargers will also support the plug-and-charge protocol.</p>\n<p>\"North America is one of the world’s most important car markets—with the potential to be a leader in electromobility. Accessibility to high-speed charging is one of the key enablers to accelerate this transition. Therefore, seven automakers are forming this joint venture with the goal of creating a positive charging experience for EV consumers. The BMW Group is proud to be among the founders,\" said BMW Group CEO Oliver Zipse.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1956680#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1956680&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
