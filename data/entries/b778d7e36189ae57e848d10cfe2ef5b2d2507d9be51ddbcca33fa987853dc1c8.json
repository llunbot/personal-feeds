spent out a pretty penny for your dream bike, it deserves only the best to keep it looking and functioning immaculately. If you’re willing to invest more than your average bike cleaner, this UFO Bike Wash from CeramicSpeed is a powerful yet eco-friendly bike wash that’s as effective as it is easy to use. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 500ml bottle features a robust spray top and offers around 30 washes when 3-4 sprays of the solution are sprayed into a brush as directed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After rinsing off your bike, CeramicSpeed suggests wiping down the frame, metal surfaces, wheels and tyres with the brush, and leaving the bike covered in the foam solution for 3-5 minutes before rinsing and wiping down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For bottle refills, CeramicSpeed supplies a 125ml concentrate that can be added to the bottle and topped up with 250ml water, so you’ll need two refills per spray bottle. It’s still not cheap, but you’ll save a little on using this method, not to mention the plastic of the spray bottle.</p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n

I certainly do, and to help you see where you have and haven’t already scrubbed, a foaming bike cleaner like the Weldtite Snow Foam Bike Cleaner is a great choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No pre-rinse necessary; simply spray the Snow Foam all over the frame, wheels, bars and pedals and wait a minute before scrubbing. Weldtite claims that you can do a waterless wash, though I’d be more sceptical about getting all the grime off the bike without water, especially after a winter gravel ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Snow Foam is also disc brake and carbon safe, according to Weldtite, though it does offer specific cleaning products for disc brake rotors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For your chain and cassette, reach for the Weldtite Thunder Foam (£10.99), which is a foaming chain degreaser with the same action, though with a citrus scent rather than the Snow Foam’s candy floss.</p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>BBB Bio Super Wash Bike Shampoo</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bio-Super-Wash-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bio-Super-Wash-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bio-Super-Wash-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bio-Super-Wash-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bio-Super-Wash-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bio-Super-Wash-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bio-Super-Wash-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bio-Super-Wash-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bio-Super-Wash-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bio-Super-Wash-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Bio-Super-Wash-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Katherine Moore</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>£9.99 | <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=6821&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.westbrookcycles.co.uk%2Fbbb_bio_super_wash_bike_shampoo-39402\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Highly concentrated cleaning formula to make 100L bike wash</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Natural wax for paint protection</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Biodegradable and produced in carbon neutral facilities</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For excellent value, pick up a bottle of concentrated BBB Bio Super Wash Bike Shampoo.

Of course, buying a concentrated product also means less plastic packaging requirement, and more efficient transport without the water.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’d rather buy a bike wash that’s ready to use, then opt for the BBB Bio Ready Wash Bike Shampoo Trigger Bottle, which retails at £7.99 for 500ml of ready-mixed formula.</p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Bike cleaners: how to choose</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"792\" height=\"531\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Muc-Off-bike-cleaner.jpg\" alt=\"Muc Off bike cleaner\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Muc-Off-bike-cleaner.jpg 792w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Muc-Off-bike-cleaner-300x201.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Muc-Off-bike-cleaner-768x515.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Muc-Off-bike-cleaner-750x503.jpg 750w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>What different types of bike cleaner are there?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most bike cleaners are supplied in a ready-to-use diluted formula and spray bottle, which can be applied to a pre-rinsed bike and then washed off with more water after scrubbing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also buy bike cleaner concentrate, which you can either use to refill spray bottles, or add to a small bucket of water. This can be a more wallet-friendly way to purchase bike cleaner, as well as use less plastic packaging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also get foaming bike washes, either for direct use from an aerosol onto the bike, or for use in conjunction with a pressure washer (such as the Muc-Off Snow Foam).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s the difference between bike cleaner and degreaser?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most brands recommend a separate degreaser for <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-bike-chain-cleaner\">cleaning the chain</a>, chainrings and cassette.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While a bike cleaner is designed to tackle the frame, wheels, tyres, and cockpit area, a degreaser is designed to clean the drivetrain, which often requires more powerful cleaning to rid the area of grease and stubborn dirt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some degreasers can be really strong, so a pair of rubber gloves aren’t the worst idea to protect your hands from the chemicals – not to mention black grease!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll also need to be careful with how liberal you are with the degreaser. There are parts of the bike that rely on grease to function optimally which you don’t want to wash out, and you must be careful when scrubbing your cassette and chain not to transfer degreaser and grime onto your brake rotors if you’re running a disc brake setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you’ve fully degreased your chain, check out our guide to the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-bike-chain-lubes\" target=\"_blank\">best </a><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-bike-chain-lubes\">c</a><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-bike-chain-lubes\" target=\"_blank\">hain lubes</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Can I use bike cleaner on my disc brakes?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While some manufacturers claim that their bike cleaning formulas are disc brake safe, I’d avoid washing rotors with bike cleaner, just to avoid any potential contamination from other parts of your bike such as the drivetrain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, opt for disc brake specific cleaners, or a wipe with a clean cloth and IPA (Isopropyl Alcohol).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-4-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-bike-cleaner\">Best bike cleaners 2025: Sprays, foams and kits for quick bike cleaning</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Pnorman","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"b778d7e36189ae57e848d10cfe2ef5b2d2507d9be51ddbcca33fa987853dc1c8","category":"Cycling"}
