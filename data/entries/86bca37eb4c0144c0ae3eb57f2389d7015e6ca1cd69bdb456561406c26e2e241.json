SR245 goes through it.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>True enough, <i>Strade Regionali</i> number 245 does indeed run through the middle of Rossano, helping to connect the town to its bigger brother to the north, Bassano del Grappa. But what the entry misses is the surprising number of highly successful companies this 8,000-strong community hosts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lauded motorsport wheel maker OZ Racing was founded here in 1971, as was saddle maker Selle San Marco in 1935. However, Rossano Veneto’s most celebrated son must surely be <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/viva-italia-inside-wilier\" target=\"_blank\">Wilier Triestina</a>, established 1906. Or perhaps that should be ‘stepson’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Our grandfather bought the Wilier name in 1969,’ says Andrea Gastaldello, who runs the company with brothers Enrico and Michele. ‘Before then Wilier was located in Bassano, founded by Pietro Dal Molin in 1906. But in 1969, my grandfather moved it here, to Rossano, and we have been here ever since, now into our third generation.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fortunes of Wilier have waxed and waned over the years, but its 113-year heritage makes it one of the elder statesmen of cycling, only eclipsed by Bianchi (1885), Peugeot (1886), Raleigh (1887) and Schwinn (1895).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, Andrea Gastaldello talks us through some of the pivotal bicycles from Wilier’s past.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n

oldest bike we have,’ says Gastaldello. ‘It was one of the first Ramato-coloured bikes (the traditional colour of Wilier), although the colour has faded through time and weather. A private owner had the bike in his home and 10 years ago we bought it from him for €5,000, which is probably a lot more than it cost when it was made in the 1940s. But it is a very important part of our history, having been ridden by Fiorenzo Magni when he won the Giro d’Italia in 1948.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seventy years on, Magni is still one of Wilier’s most celebrated riders. Despite being unlucky enough to race in the era of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/coppi-tour-de-france-1949\" target=\"_blank\">Fausto Coppi</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/glory-ride-todd-buchholz\" target=\"_blank\">Gino Bartali</a>, hence his nickname of ‘The Third Man’, the Tuscan would add two more Giro titles to his <em>palmarès</em> in 1951 and 1955, plus three back-to-back Tour of Flanders titles, hence his other nickname, ‘The Lion of Flanders’.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"883\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/05141556/history-makers-wilier-01-970x883.jpg\" alt=\"history-makers-wilier-01\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/05141556/history-makers-wilier-01-970x883.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/05141556/history-makers-wilier-01-300x273.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/05141556/history-makers-wilier-01-768x699.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/05141556/history-makers-wilier-01-1536x1398.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/05141556/history-makers-wilier-01-750x683.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/05141556/history-makers-wilier-01-1140x1037.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/05141556/history-makers-wilier-01.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Magni is also the subject of one of cycling’s most iconic images, a photo of him riding hunched over and steely-eyed while biting down on an inner tube attached to his stem in order to help him balance, having crashed and broken his collarbone on Stage 12 of the 1956 Giro. The Lion lived up to his billing and rode the next ten stages broken-boned, somehow finishing second overall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘We had our own team from 1946 to 1951, and Magni rode for us for three of them, winning the Giro in 1948, then Flanders in 1949 and 1950. Unfortunately we had to close the team in 1952. Money had become a problem as Italians increasingly turned to motos and scooters for transport.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s interesting to note that in response to this industry-wide problem, Magni helped bring the first non-cycling related sponsor, Nivea, into the sport in 1954 to secure funding for his cash-strapped Ganna-Ursus team.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pantani TT bike, 2002</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/02191258/history-makers-wilier-03-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"history-makers-wilier-03\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/02191258/history-makers-wilier-03-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/02191258/history-makers-wilier-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/02191258/history-makers-wilier-03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/02191258/history-makers-wilier-03-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/02191258/history-makers-wilier-03-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/02191258/history-makers-wilier-03-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/02191258/history-makers-wilier-03-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/02191258/history-makers-wilier-03-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/02191258/history-makers-wilier-03.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘A big step forward for us was sponsoring Mercatone Uno, which was a team built around Marco Pantani for the 1997 season,’ says Gastaldello. ‘It was not an easy decision for us. At the start Pantani had a very good time with Carrera [Carrera Jeans-Vagabond, 1992-1996] but in 1995 he had a terrible crash involving a car at Milano-Torino and broke his leg in two places. No one was sure if he would ever race competitively again. We had to trust that he would come back a champion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The team was hit by bad luck from the beginning. Marco hit a black cat that ran into the road in the 1997 Giro and had to retire, which was frustrating as he was competitive. But he came back in a good way for the Tour de France and had a good season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘But at the end of 1997 we lost sponsorship to Bianchi, a much larger company than us that offered more money to sponsor the team. We were already providing 70 bikes a year plus extra money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The opportunity came back to sponsor Mercatone Uno in 2002, and this is a time-trial bike we made for Marco. The bars are custom from 3T, the frame is Easton tubing, the wheels are branded “Eolic” by Selle Italia, but really that’s just stickers on another company’s wheels. Although Mercatone was traditionally yellow, we had to make the bike and jerseys blue for the Tour because of course the leader rides in yellow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Sadly by 2002 Pantani already had problems with drugs so was not competitive in the races. We spent only one season with the team then we had to stop. Strangely, Mercatone – a big chain in Italy, like the Italian Ikea – went bankrupt only a few months ago.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cento, 2006</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"576\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/02191302/history-makers-wilier-07-970x576.jpg\" alt=\"history-makers-wilier-07\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/02191302/history-makers-wilier-07-970x576.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/02191302/history-makers-wilier-07-300x178.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/02191302/history-makers-wilier-07-768x456.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/02191302/history-makers-wilier-07-1536x912.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/02191302/history-makers-wilier-07-750x445.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/02191302/history-makers-wilier-07-1140x677.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/02191302/history-makers-wilier-07.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Our company was started in 1906 by Mr Dal Molin in Bassano del Grappa, 10km from here,’ says Gastaldello. ‘In Bassano in the 1940s and 50s we had 150 employees, one of whom was my grandfather, Giovanni. Then the company went bankrupt – by the 1960s everyone was buying scooters – and in 1969 my grandfather, with my uncle Antonio and father Lino, decided to buy the name of the company and to start a bike shop and start making bikes again in our village.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘My grandfather died in 1979, then in 1988 and 1990 my brothers arrived and my uncle and father decided to split up.

By the time Marco Pantani reached the top of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/alpe-d-huez-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">Alpe d’Huez</a> on Stage 13, it was most definitely the fastest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Marco climbed Alpe d’Huez in 37 minutes and 35 seconds, which is still the record for the climb,’ says Gastaldello. ‘It was a very good time for Wilier, a big boost to our growth in international markets because everyone was watching this stage and this guy and looking at this bike. The frame weighed 1,200g and was one of the first TIG-welded frames – before us was only Cannondale.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pantani fans will recognise the <i>Il Pirata</i> cartoon on the frame and custom-embroidered on the saddle, but there are other subtle touches specific to the Italian climber.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, an analogue indicator set in-line of the cable housing displayed gear selection using cable movement to push a needle, visible through a plastic window a bit like a pressure gauge. Second, the wheels pushed some serious boundaries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘For a while Selle Italia made special lightweight wheels in collaboration with a company called ACI that makes spokes and hubs, and Ambrosio, which makes rims. The spokes are very thin, 1.2mm [2mm was more common in 1997], so thin they would break under heavier riders. But for Pantani, no problem. It might seem normal now, but these wheels were under 1,500g and had 32 spokes each.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ramato ‘Kids bike’, c.1975</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"598\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/02191313/history-makers-wilier-15-970x598.jpg\" alt=\"history-makers-wilier-15\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/02191313/history-makers-wilier-15-970x598.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/02191313/history-makers-wilier-15-300x185.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/02191313/history-makers-wilier-15-768x473.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/02191313/history-makers-wilier-15-1536x946.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/02191313/history-makers-wilier-15-750x462.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/02191313/history-makers-wilier-15-1140x702.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/08/02191313/history-makers-wilier-15.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>‘In the 1970s and 1980s, in the workshop of my grandfather’s time, they made these kind of bikes for children, or really for parents who were passionate cyclists!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘This came to us from a collector in Switzerland, who contacted me around five years ago to say did we want to buy it, so we paid €500,’ says Gastaldello. ‘I couldn’t tell you if that is good value, but I know these bikes were expensive when they were made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The wheels are 20-inch tubulars and the groupset is Campagnolo Nuovo Record.
