Which GC leader would you back? Which youngster would you be nailing down on a ten-year contract?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well if you haven’t ever considered these key questions, it’s time to do so now. You have millions of Euros spare and you’re looking to launch a new team in 2026, with a UCI WorldTour licence already guaranteed. All you’ve got to do is choose the riders you want to sign from those available on the current market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We took this idea on ourselves and created our own WorldTour-level roster from all the riders currently on the transfer market for 2026. The rules for this are quite simple: we can hypothetically sign up 26 riders (the minimum for UCI WorldTour teams) from the pool of over 2,000 available riders, creating a team with a mix of GC, sprint and Classics aspirations. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>How does this work?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-49.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-49.webp 1800w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-49-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-49-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-49-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-49-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-49-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-49-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-49-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-49-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-49-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Thomas Maheux</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s clear up how we’re going to do this. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pool of WorldTour riders without a contract for 2026 currently sits at 225. Alongside them, there are 2,000 riders at ProTeam and Continental level without a deal signed for next season. We are hypothetically coming into the sport with a substantial budget – though not <em>quite</em> a match for UAE Team Emirates XRG or <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/ineos-grenadiers-totalenergies-merger\">the rumoured Total Energies-Ineos</a> superteam – so we can pick up some well-known names.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hate to be the fun police, but we’re not going to go all Harlem Globetrotters and sign everyone out there on the market. What’s the fun in having Enric Mas, Richard Carapaz <em>and</em> Primož Roglič on the same squad? Also, who could realistically afford that bill apart from a petrostate prince or Bond villain?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keeping this in mind, we’ve trawled through results databases and built a team with a mixed focus across GC, sprinting and the Classics, while also keeping an eye on the future with some young signings. We’ll go through our roster, justifying each of our 26 picks.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+3\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-3-970x300.webp\" alt=\"Cyclist banner saying 'the best rides, bikes, kit and pro interviews every month, click here to subscribe'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-3-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-3-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-3-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-3-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-3-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-3-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-3-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>GC prospects</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-45.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-45.webp 1800w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-45-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-45-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-45-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-45-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-45-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-45-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-45-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-45-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-45-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Every team needs a GC leader. So, who could be on the move this year? Well, Carapaz, Wilco Kelderman and Florian Lipowitz will all need to seek a contract renewal or a change of home for 2026. Some names are already off the market, as Adam Yates, Mas and David Gaudu have all secured contract renewals and Roglič is expected to sign an extension to his deal with Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe in the coming weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking at these names, EF Education-EasyPost may struggle to keep Carapaz on their books. The American squad had to pull some major strings to get the 2019 Giro d’Italia winner to move across in 2023, and since signing, his results have been blighted by poor luck and lacklustre form. Yes, he won the polka-dot jersey at the Tour last year, but for the team’s backers, the return on investment seems tough to justify.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If EF lost their leader, I’d be happy to take Carapaz in. Despite that recent form, I think he’s still got the legs to podium another Grand Tour by the time he retires. At last year’s Tour de France, he managed to sneak into the yellow jersey for a brief period, and so far at this year’s Giro, he’s looked really strong. If it were up to me, I’d send Carapaz to the Giro and Vuelta on a yearly basis. There’s no need to waste his time getting smashed by Tadej Pogačar and Jonas Vingegaard at the Tour de France. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-23T152904.246-970x647.png\" alt=\"arkea b&amp;b hotels 2024\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-23T152904.246-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-23T152904.246-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-23T152904.246-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-23T152904.246-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-23T152904.246-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-23T152904.246-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-23T152904.246-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-23T152904.246-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-23T152904.246-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-23T152904.246.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One man to keep your eye out for in the upcoming transfer market is Kévin Vauquelin. As his Arkéa-B&amp;B Hotels team are faced with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/uci-rankings-promotions-and-relegations\">the real prospect of relegation</a>, their French leader will be looking to hop ship and move elsewhere to keep up his momentum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s hard to guess what kind of rider Vauquelin, a stage winner on last year’s Tour de France, could evolve into. At the moment, he really feels like a Matteo Jorgenson-lite, able to contend in Classics, stage races and as a domestique. Yes, he could continue to sweep up Coupe de France races for a new team, hoovering up UCI points like he has for Arkéa over the past three seasons. However, he’s got greater potential, perhaps as a stage race leader. He’s already got the time-trialling legs for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Visma-Lease a Bike, Lidl-Trek and Ineos Grenadiers are rumoured to be in the hunt for the Norman, so we’re not the only ones who believe in his potential. Although I’m not quite sure I’m ready to see Vauquelin churned into a luxury domestique for Vingegaard.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n

a bike race on your own. When building a GC roster, domestiques are almost as important as the team leaders themselves. Looking at the transfer market this year, there’s a real mix of names, old and new, who may be open to a change of scenery in 2026. For us, we’ve gone for a distinctly Italian entourage for our two GC leaders. Don’t worry, we’ll get Carapaz onto an Italian crash course before you know it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leading our flock of domestiques is Mattia Cattaneo, who’s currently contracted to Soudal-QuickStep until the end of the season. The Italian, who finished 12th at the 2021 Tour de France, is a loyal rider who is often underrated. He can be up there in the GC, brushing with the top ten at Grand Tours, while serving up top results in time-trials as well (he finished fourth today in the Stage 10 TT at the Giro, for instance). He’d be a phenomenal domestique at the likes of UAE Team Emirates or Visma-Lease a Bike, but we’re hoping to get his pen to paper before those superteams get hold of him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To balance out Cattaneo’s experience, the younger Matteo Sobrero catches my eye. The former Giro stage winner moved to Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe as part of the team’s GC beef-up at the beginning of last season. However, this move hasn’t quite resulted in the glistening domestique role that some would have been hoping for. He’s a sharp all-rounder though and would be a valued member of any Grand Tour roster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same can also be said for Filippo Zana, currently at Jayco-AlUla. Zana’s stock has risen greatly since joining Jayco back in 2023, having won a Giro stage that year while on domestique duties for Eddie Dunbar. Tried and tested in that realm, he’d be a reliable signing for the mountains, however I’d really like to see what he could do in the Classics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We end our chain of Italians by switching focus to a Belgian often given the unfair moniker of Remco Evenepoel’s doppleganger: Ilan Van Wilder. In reality, it could be tough to snatch Van Wilder away from his beloved QuickStep squad, but perhaps the allure of escaping Evenepoel’s shackles could prove enticing for the young Belgian.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To give Carapaz an Ecuadorian colleague, look no further than XDS-Astana’s breakout climber Harold Martín López. Seeming to come out of nowhere, the 24-year-old finished runner-up at the recent Tour of Turkey and took the overall victory at the Tour of Hellas earlier in the spring. A thoroughbred climber wouldn’t go amiss here, to be honest.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Our sprinters</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/olav-kooij-giro-ditalia-1-970x647.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/olav-kooij-giro-ditalia-1-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/olav-kooij-giro-ditalia-1-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/olav-kooij-giro-ditalia-1-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/olav-kooij-giro-ditalia-1-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/olav-kooij-giro-ditalia-1-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/olav-kooij-giro-ditalia-1-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/olav-kooij-giro-ditalia-1-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/olav-kooij-giro-ditalia-1-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/olav-kooij-giro-ditalia-1-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/olav-kooij-giro-ditalia-1.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re balancing out our overall ambitions with some younger sprinting talents. There are a few sprinting names up for grabs in this year’s transfer market, including Dylan Groenwegen, Bryan Coquard, Fernando Gaviria and Cees Bol. However, a certain Dutchman caught our eye: Olav Kooij.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After several years spent within Visma-Lease a Bike, it’s rumoured that the Dutchman could be on the move, with Decathlon-AG2R already linked to the 23-year-old. It’s not a shock that he wants a change. Kooij has been overshadowed a bit at Visma-Lease a Bike, often finding his interests playing second fiddle t the GC aspirations of Vingegaard and the joint Classics and sprinting ambitions of Wout van Aert. In that case, we need to free Kooij from the shackles of Visma and funnel him into the Tour de France stage hunter he’s born to be. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding another weapon to our sprinting arsenal, let’s stick with the youngsters and discuss Tobias Lund Andresen, a 22-year-old from Denmark who we imagine not many readers know very much about. While he has few WorldTour results in his career to date, he has lit up lower-tier stage races such as the Cro Race, Tour of Turkey and Tour of Denmark. Although his string of stage victories has been a convincing sign of things to come, however, it feels as though his Picnic-PostNL squad have been using him in the wrong way. Last year, he worked as a lead-out man for Fabio Jakobsen for most of the season, only to beat the Dutchman several times at the Tour of Turkey. Perhaps with the rise of Casper van Uden within the team as well, Lund will be eager to jump ship in the winter.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Building a sprint train</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"595\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/GettyImages-2161778363-970x595.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/GettyImages-2161778363-970x595.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/GettyImages-2161778363-300x184.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/GettyImages-2161778363-768x471.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/GettyImages-2161778363-1536x942.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/GettyImages-2161778363-2048x1256.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/GettyImages-2161778363-750x460.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/02/GettyImages-2161778363-1140x699.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption>Dario Belingheri/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A vital ingredient in any sprinter’s recipe for success is their leadout train. Some may the lead-out it a dying art, but most sprinters still look to work closely with one or two given teammates throughout the year as a dedicated leadout train.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this, we need to tap up some real engines or under-utilised sprinters in the current pro peloton. Looking down the list, former Giro stage winner Stefano Oldani stands out. He was a phenomenal rider at Lotto and Alpecin, but since leaving for Cofidis he seems to have been lost in the melee of riders there. He’s got what it takes to be a leadout man, having worked in that role for Caleb Ewan and Tim Merlier in his previous posts. A change of environment could bring out the best in the Italian.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike Oldani, Jenthe Biermans has been a UCI points hoover for Arkéa-B&amp;B Hotels in recent years. If his current squad gets relegated – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/uci-rankings-promotions-and-relegations\">which is very likely</a> – then he may look for an escape route back onto the WorldTour level. Biermans isn’t quite capable of winning top-level sprints, but his power and racecraft could be turned into a valuable leadout role for faster WorldTour sprinters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Experience – as well as power – can play its part in the leadout. Québecois rider Guillaume Boivin, who would be 36 years old by the time this contract is signed, has been a solid <em>rouleur </em>throughout his career, managing to finish inside the top 20 of major cobbled Classics. With this expertise, he should be able to slot into a leadout man role for one of our young leaders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, to throw in a bit of power and another rider for support in the Classics, let’s sign up Brent Van Moer. A breakaway rider at heart, his expertise could easily be shifted into the sprint train. To be fair, he’s got a decent kick on him too, having recently finished in fourth place at Omloop Het Nieuwsblad.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Küng in the Classics</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/20250313PN0040-A.S.O._Billy_Ceusters-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/20250313PN0040-A.S.O._Billy_Ceusters-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/20250313PN0040-A.S.O._Billy_Ceusters-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/20250313PN0040-A.S.O._Billy_Ceusters-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/20250313PN0040-A.S.O._Billy_Ceusters-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/20250313PN0040-A.S.O._Billy_Ceusters-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/20250313PN0040-A.S.O._Billy_Ceusters-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/20250313PN0040-A.S.O._Billy_Ceusters-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/20250313PN0040-A.S.O._Billy_Ceusters-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/20250313PN0040-A.S.O._Billy_Ceusters-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/20250313PN0040-A.S.O._Billy_Ceusters-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There aren’t too many out-and-out Classics names up for grabs this year. Given that Mads Pedersen has now secured a lifetime contract with Lidl-Trek, Tiesj Benoot, Jasper Stuyven and Quinten Hermans are the biggest one-day contenders left on the market for 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stefan Küng, whose stint at Groupama-FDJ could come to an end this year, is the pick of the bunch though. Although the Swiss rarely wins, he’s always there or thereabouts. He’s finished inside the top ten of Paris-Roubaix and the Tour of Flanders on six occasions since 2022 – a record only mirrored by the likes of Mathieu van der Poel, Mads Pedersen and Wout van Aert. He’s not just confined to the Classics either, given he’s a nifty domestique on both the flat and the moderate inclines, and let’s not forget his time-trialling prowess. He flirted with the idea of moving team back in 2022, so he may give it a think over this summer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ultimate pairing for Küng would be another metronome of the Classics: Fred Wright. The Brit is a real all-rounder in the Classics, able to reach the top ten in the likes of Milan-San Remo, the Tour of Flanders, Paris-Roubaix and the Amstel Gold Race. Not only that, he can sweep up top tens in Grand Tour sprints or compete for glory from a lucky breakaway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of the lumpier Classics, there are two names that immediately jump out among the names available. First is Roger Adrià, who has quickly risen through the ranks with Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe despite his relatively late start to WorldTour life. The Spaniard was a silent fixture of last autumn’s Classics cycle, finishing inside the top 15 throughout the final months of the calendar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second is Dorian Godon, another rider who has certainly gone up in value over the past season or two. The Frenchman won the Brabantse Pijl back in 2023 before scoring a couple of stage victories last year at the Tour de Romandie as part of Decathlon-AG2R’s miracle spring. Godon is a hardy <em>puncheur</em> with a solid kick on him, so whether it’s Amstel Gold or a flat profile, he’d come in handy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The wildcards</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Cyclist-Strade-Bianche-Mens-race.-08-mars-2025-50-min-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Cyclist-Strade-Bianche-Mens-race.-08-mars-2025-50-min-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Cyclist-Strade-Bianche-Mens-race.-08-mars-2025-50-min-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Cyclist-Strade-Bianche-Mens-race.-08-mars-2025-50-min-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Cyclist-Strade-Bianche-Mens-race.-08-mars-2025-50-min-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Cyclist-Strade-Bianche-Mens-race.-08-mars-2025-50-min-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Cyclist-Strade-Bianche-Mens-race.-08-mars-2025-50-min-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Cyclist-Strade-Bianche-Mens-race.-08-mars-2025-50-min-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Cyclist-Strade-Bianche-Mens-race.-08-mars-2025-50-min-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Cyclist-Strade-Bianche-Mens-race.-08-mars-2025-50-min-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/03/Cyclist-Strade-Bianche-Mens-race.-08-mars-2025-50-min-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Xavier Pereyron</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After ticking the traditional boxes, some riders can really fit into any of these categories. For that reason, we’ve given them the wildcard status. Here, you’ll see stage hunters, underdogs and Swiss Army Knives on the bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ultimate Swiss Army Knife – or at least a Slovenian one – has to be <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/matej-mohoric-cyclist\">Matej Mohorič</a>. He ticks several boxes, from breakaway specialist to Classics powerhouse. His contract will be up for grabs at the end of the year, with an extension at Bahrain a possibility but not signed off at this point. Mohorič’s experience is an obvious draw for any team. He’s one of the most studious riders in the pack as well, so he’d slot into the vital role as road captain wherever he goes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A jack of all trades, Andrea Vendrame is sometimes overlooked in the pro peloton. As one of the toughest sprinters out there, he’s able to get over bumps that very few of his fast rivals can. Given how underestimated he is, Vendrame is allowed a leash in the breakaway, sometimes working against the peloton like at last year’s Giro d’Italia. The Italian’s contract is up for renewal at the end of 2025. He’s tasted success at Decathlon-AG2R, but at the age of 30, a change may be welcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s swoop in and poach Attila Valter while we’re at it. After three years at Visma-Lease a Bike, Valter might want to search for a new home in 2026. Although the Dutch squad used him as a domestique, Valter could rightfully be enticed by a new challenge, one that could see him fight in breakaways, go for Classics or even return to a Grand Tour roster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scottish rider and former national track champion Mark Stewart has been a consistent points scorer for his Vini Fantini squad. He’s become a cornerstone of breakaways in recent years, and he’s got a real skill at poaching decent results over in Asia and Oceania. It’s a bit of a surprise that he hasn’t made the move up to the WorldTour in a similar vein to Aaron Gate, who jumped up to XDS-Astana last year to great effect. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Thinking about the next generation</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-47-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-47-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-47-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-47-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-47-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-47-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-47-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-47-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-47-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-47-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Adobe-Express-file-47.webp 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Gautier Demouveaux</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Signing young riders is so important for WorldTour teams. Scouting top-tier talent has become a lucrative business given the potential return in spotting the next Pogačar out on the roads somewhere. Nowadays, the top teams harvest young talent while they’re still teenagers, funnelling them through an in-house development squad, before making the leap up to the WorldTour level. We can’t quite sign up a teenager for life here, so we’re going to have to do some real digging to find the best youngsters willing (and able) to leave their current setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One youngster bound to be in the eye of a contract storm soon is Antoine L’Hote. It’s not 100% clear what kind of rider he’ll morph into, but his results have been impressive for a 19-year-old. Currently contracted to Decathlon-AG2R’s development project, he’ll be up for grabs this year. Looking like a hardy sprinter, he could be an interesting project for any WorldTour squad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A couple of years older than L’Hote, Martin Svrček has finished on the podium of the last two UCI Road World Championships, both in the under-23 road race. He’s been contracted to Soudal-QuickStep for a while, but has been sidelined for bigger races. Given the Slovak’s aptitude for the Classics, it feels as though the marriage with QuickStep hasn’t quite given him what he expected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Digging deep through the results databases, a rider that jumps out is Tobias Svarre. The 20-year-old Dane has risen through the ranks in Scandinavia as part of Team ColoQuick, the same squad that nurtured Vingegaard. Svarre is a strong <em>puncheur</em>, but he’s got a decent enough kick to defeat some WorldTour riders, as seen in the Danish domestic scene. While we’re on the subject of Danes, Frederik Wandahl is a must-sign for me. He may blow a little hot or cold, but the Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe rider is top-quality when he’s on a good day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe a rider unknown to some, 24-year-old Kyrylo Tsarenko has been enjoying a breakthrough year on the second-tier of pro cycling. Winner of the Tour of Hainan this spring, the Ukrainian is a decent climber capable of fighting for breakaways.
