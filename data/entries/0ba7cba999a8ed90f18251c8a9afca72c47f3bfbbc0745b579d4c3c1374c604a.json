The ITC has ordered Apple to stop importing Apple Watch blood oxygen sensor equipment that infringes on patents owned by medical device company Masimo.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nU.S. sales of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 9</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> are set to stop online after 12:00 p.m. on Thursday, December 21. In-store sales will stop after December 24. The sales ban is limited to the United States and only impacts Apple. Best Buy, Walmart, Target, and other retailers can continue to sell the ‌Apple Watch Ultra 2‌ and Series 9 until supplies are exhausted.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ITC implemented the import ban after deciding that Apple had indeed violated Masimo patents with the blood oxygen monitoring technology in the Apple Watch, which Masimo has been claiming for years.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple could avoid an import ban if the White House vetoes the ITC's decision, but it is so far looking like that might not happen. The White House has until December 25 to decide whether it will step in. Back when the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> was facing an import ban because of a patent dispute with Samsung, then-President Barack Obama did <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2013/08/03/obama-administration-vetoes-partial-ban-on-apple-products/\">veto the ITC's ruling</a>, but this time Apple is in a dispute with an American company and it is over a product that is not as pivotal as the ‌iPhone‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is working to update the algorithms used in the Apple Watch blood oxygen sensor in an attempt to skirt the ban, and the company said that it plans to submit a workaround. While Apple thinks it can avoid patent infringement through a software update, Masimo has said that a software update <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/19/masimo-ceo-on-apple-watch-ban/\">will not work</a>.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/itc/\">ITC</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/patent-lawsuits/\">Patent Lawsuits</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/masimo/\">Masimo</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/20/apple-watch-itc-stay-denied/\">ITC Denies Apple's Request for a Stay on Looming Apple Watch Import Ban</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/itc-denies-apples-request-for-a-stay-on-looming-apple-watch-import-ban.2414290/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0ba7cba999a8ed90f18251c8a9afca72c47f3bfbbc0745b579d4c3c1374c604a","category":"Apple"}
