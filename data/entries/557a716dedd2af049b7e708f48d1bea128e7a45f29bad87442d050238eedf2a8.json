The <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cannondale-supersix-history\" target=\"_blank\">original SuperSix</a> was a classic round tubed road bike renowned for its ride quality and low weight and before that <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cannondale-50-years-of-pioneering-bike-design\" target=\"_blank\">Cannondale’s alloy bikes</a> were prominent in the pro peloton.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cannondale introduced the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/cannondale-systemsix-review\" target=\"_blank\">SystemSix</a> in 2019 to fill a gap for an aero road bike in its range. But in the intervening period since, the SuperSix Evo has had <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/cannondale-supersix-evo-review\" target=\"_blank\">a radical makeover</a>, sprouting its own aero features. The current fourth generation SuperSix Evo is raced by the EF Education pro teams and claimed to have aerodynamics close to those of the SystemSix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cannondale was also an early proponent of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-endurance-road-bikes\" target=\"_blank\">endurance bike</a> class. The <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/cannondale-synapse-carbon-1-rle-review\" target=\"_blank\">Synapse</a> was launched 15 years ago, designed to offer a more comfortable ride for those who were not competing, but also used to good effect by the pros during cobbled races. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest generation Synapse comes in both carbon and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-aluminium-road-bikes\" target=\"_blank\">aluminium </a>options, with the latter offering the most affordable entry into Cannondale’s disc brake road bike range. Cannondale continues to sell its CAAD alloy bikes too – we’ve more on the CAAD13 and CAAD Optimo below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how do the current generation Cannondale SuperSix Evo, SystemSix and Synapse ranges stack up, what specs are available and at what prices? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read on for a complete breakdown of Cannondale’s UK road bike offering and our recommendations on how to choose the best

that the latest 2023 generation of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cannondale-supersix-evo-2023\" target=\"_blank\">SuperSix Evo</a> is 12 watts more efficient than its predecessor at 45kph, despite the visual similarities, and that it’s more aero than many of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-aero-bikes\" target=\"_blank\">best aero bikes</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SuperSix Evo has Cannondale’s Delta Steerer design, which allows for <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/opinion-integration\" target=\"_blank\">internal cable routing</a> and also results in a narrow head tube to reduce drag. The rear of the bike is skinny too, so much so that the Shimano Di2 battery has to be housed inside the down tube, as it won’t fit in the seat tube or seatpost. Cannondale offers aero bottles and cages on the bike, which it says actually make the SuperSix Evo more aero, although the cages can also accept a standard round bottle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SuperSix Evo has a one piece carbon bar and stem on higher specs, in contrast to the SystemSix, which has a separate proprietary HollowGram Knot bar and stem, allowing you to adjust the bar pitch through eight degrees.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/11/02141355/cannondale_systemsix_1-970x728.jpg\" alt=\"cannondale_systemsix_1\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The SystemSix has deep aero tube sections throughout. It’s a design feature that newer aero road bikes, such as the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/giant-propel-2023\" target=\"_blank\">Giant Propel</a>, are moving away from in favour of a thinner seat tube that’s potentially more compliant. When reviewed, we reckoned that the SystemSix’s ride comfort was adequate rather than class-leading, even back in 2019, and aero bike design has moved on since then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carbon Synapse bikes have aero tube profiles as well. The top spec Synapse has a separate handlebar and stem design called the Save bar that, like the SystemSix’s design, allows you to adjust the bar pitch. Cannondale says that it also helps absorb vibration. It doesn’t integrate the cables though and they run externally into the downtube. Other specs have a more standard separate alloy bar and stem.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cannondale SuperSix vs SystemSix vs Synapse: standards</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-8-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Cannondale SuperSix Evo bicycle\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-8-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-8-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-8-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-8-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-8-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-8-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-8-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-8-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-8-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-8.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Lizzie Crabb</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Cannondale isn’t a brand to stick with the status quo and has over time used a number of proprietary designs in its bikes, from the Ai rear triangle and symmetrically dished rear wheel on its original <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/cannondale-topstone-carbon-2-l-review\" target=\"_blank\">Topstone</a> gravel bike to the 650b wheels and Lefty suspension fork on the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/cannondale-slate-review\" target=\"_blank\">Slate</a>. Both of these are <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-is-a-gravel-bike\" target=\"_blank\">gravel bikes</a> and Cannondale was an early adopter of the gravel genre too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It developed the BB30 bottom bracket standard and was a big proponent of the advantages of a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/press-fit-vs-threaded-bb\" target=\"_blank\">pressfit bottom bracket</a>, making the BB30 standard openly available to its competitors, to help encourage its take-up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it’s something of a surprise that the fourth generation SuperSix Evo has reverted to a threaded <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bottom-bracket-standards-guide\" target=\"_blank\">BSA bottom bracket</a> shell, which Cannondale says is both simple and reliable. It shouldn’t creak either. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Synapse also has a BSA threaded bottom bracket. The SystemSix retains a pressfit bottom bracket though, following the PF30a standard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another area where Cannondale has played with a variant then reverted to a more standard design is thru-axles. The SystemSix has the Mavic Speed Release system, while both the SuperSix and Synapse now use a standard thru-axle design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also flirted with an ultra-narrow 25.4mm seatpost on the previous version of the Synapse, while the current design has a standard width 27.2mm post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, the trend with the current generation of Cannondale bikes is to swap back to established industry standards, which improves interchangeability and increases the number of options if you want to change components.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cannondale SuperSix vs SystemSix vs Synapse: weight</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"666\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/cannondale-synapse-2022-review-1-970x666.jpg\" alt=\"Grey Cannondale Synapse bicycle on gravel road\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/cannondale-synapse-2022-review-1-970x666.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/cannondale-synapse-2022-review-1-300x206.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/cannondale-synapse-2022-review-1-768x527.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/cannondale-synapse-2022-review-1-1536x1054.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/cannondale-synapse-2022-review-1-750x515.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/cannondale-synapse-2022-review-1-1140x783.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/cannondale-synapse-2022-review-1.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Lizzie Crabb</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Cannondale doesn’t in general quote complete bike weights, except for the Synapse Carbon models, which we’ve noted below for each bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some claimed frame weights for the SuperSix Evo. Here, it claims a 770g weight for the SuperSix Evo Lab71 frame, 810g for the Hi-Mod frame and 915g for the standard modulus frameset, all fully painted and in size 56, giving you an idea of weight saving from the higher spec carbon fibre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve reviewed at least one spec of each Cannondale bike. We weighed the top spec<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/cannondale-systemsix-review\" target=\"_blank\"> SystemSix</a> at 7.7kg back in 2019 and the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/cannondale-supersix-evo-review\" target=\"_blank\">SuperSix Evo</a> Hi-Mod 1 at 7.2kg in 2023. The top spec <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/cannondale-synapse-carbon-1-rle-review\" target=\"_blank\">Synapse</a>, meanwhile, tipped our scales at 8.2kg, although around 500g of that is the SmartSense system – more on that later. So the weights of the bikes which we reviewed were competitive, although not class-leading.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cannondale SuperSix vs SystemSix vs Synapse: geometry</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/04132013/cannondale_systemsix-riding5-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"cannondale_systemsix-riding5\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/04132013/cannondale_systemsix-riding5-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/04132013/cannondale_systemsix-riding5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/04132013/cannondale_systemsix-riding5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/04132013/cannondale_systemsix-riding5-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/04132013/cannondale_systemsix-riding5-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/04132013/cannondale_systemsix-riding5-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/04132013/cannondale_systemsix-riding5-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/04132013/cannondale_systemsix-riding5-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/07/04132013/cannondale_systemsix-riding5.jpg 1800w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s actually not much to differentiate the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-does-frame-geometry-affect-a-bike\" target=\"_blank\">geometries </a>of Cannondale’s three bike ranges. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SystemSix’s reach is slightly longer across the range, by up to 9mm, than the SuperSix Evo’s. The stack is comparable between the two bikes though. As you’d expect for an endurance bike, the Synapse is taller, although its reach is not dissimilar to the other two bikes. There are slight differences between the alloy and carbon Synapse frames’ geometry too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are subtle differences in other measurements too, such as the wheelbase, although these don’t consistently point to a difference in ride characteristics. Instead, the Synapse’s endurance focus is likely to come more from its in-built compliance zones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The differences in tyre clearance between Cannondale’s race and endurance bikes is more marked though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SuperSix Evo’s 30mm clearance is a little narrow by the standards of modern road race bikes. While some higher spec SuperSix Evo bikes make use of this with 28mm or 29mm tyres, many specs are equipped with 25mm tyres. All the SystemSix specs include 25mm tyres.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few years ago, that would have been considered on the wide side, but many bikes are equipped with 28s now, while <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/canyon-aeroad-ultimate-endurace-compared\" target=\"_blank\">Canyon road race bikes</a>, for example, have a mixed 25mm front/28mm rear set-up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Synapse Carbon goes wider, with 35mm tyre clearance and includes mudguard mounts, while the alloy Synapse’s tyre clearance is 32mm. Chainstay length is 5mm longer on the Synapse to accommodate the wider tyres and it should also give the bike a more planted ride feel than the SuperSix Evo and the SystemSix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Synapse range is equipped with 30mm tyres throughout. Giant fits 32mm tyres to its <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/giant-propel-tcr-defy\" target=\"_blank\">Defy</a>, although the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/canyon-aeroad-ultimate-endurace-compared\" target=\"_blank\">Canyon Endurace</a> is equipped with 30mms.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cannondale SuperSix vs SystemSix vs Synapse: frame grades</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cannondale offers three carbon frame grades, plus alloy, although not all carbon grades are available for each bike model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SuperSix Evo is the only Cannondale road bike to get the top Lab71 frame. This uses higher grade carbon fibre and resin to reduce weight. Below that, both the SuperSix Evo and the SystemSix can be bought either in Hi-Mod or standard modulus carbon. As noted above, the Hi-Mod frames offer lower weight than the standard modulus option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With compliance its calling card, the Synapse frame is offered in one carbon grade, designed to provide ride smoothing rather than stiffness. The frame incorporates flex zones in the rear triangle, which increase vertical compliance and vibration damping.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cannondale SuperSix vs SystemSix vs Synapse: sizing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cannondale SuperSix Evo Lab71 is available in six sizes: 48, 51, 54, 56, 58 and 61. The SuperSix Evo Hi-Mod adds a size 44.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are just five sizes available in the UK for the SystemSix Hi-Mod aero bike: 51, 54, 56, 58 and 60, although the standard modulus frame adds 47 and 62 frame sizes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Synapse Carbon has even fewer sizes on offer: 51, 54, 56 and 58, while the Synapse alloy is available in sizes 44, 48, 51, 54, 56, 58 and 61.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cannondale SuperSix vs SystemSix vs Synapse: groupsets</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-11-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Cannondale SuperSix Evo bicycle\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-11-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-11-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-11-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-11-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-11-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-11-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-11-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-11-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/cannondale-supersix-evo-himod-1-review-11.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Lizzie Crabb</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Cannondale’s UK specs are quite Shimano-heavy with relatively few SRAM specs sold. It offers the full range of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-shimano-groupsets\" target=\"_blank\">Shimano groupsets</a> from 12-speed electronic Dura-Ace right down to 9-speed mechanical Sora across its range.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/sram-red-axs-groupset-review-2024\" target=\"_blank\">SRAM Red</a> specs available for the SuperSix Evo and SystemSix and a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/sram-force-axs-review\" target=\"_blank\">Force </a>spec for the SuperSix Evo though. While many brands offer <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/sram-rival-etap-axs-groupset-review\" target=\"_blank\">SRAM Rival </a>as a lowest spec with electronic shifting, there are no Rival-equipped bikes in Cannondale’s UK line-up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s increasingly common for bike makers to offer a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/best-power-meters-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">power meter</a> on their higher spec bikes. Power meters are trickling down to mid-spec bikes too, particularly since SRAM offers single sided power meters at Rival and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/sram-apex-12-speed\" target=\"_blank\">Apex </a>level which are comparatively inexpensive. But in Cannondale’s range it’s only the Lab71 grade SuperSix Evo that has power meter options, and only in the Team and SRAM Red builds.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cannondale SmartSense system</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/cannondale-synapse-smartsense-1-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/cannondale-synapse-smartsense-1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/cannondale-synapse-smartsense-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/cannondale-synapse-smartsense-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/cannondale-synapse-smartsense-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/cannondale-synapse-smartsense-1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/cannondale-synapse-smartsense-1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/cannondale-synapse-smartsense-1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/cannondale-synapse-smartsense-1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/cannondale-synapse-smartsense-1-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/cannondale-synapse-smartsense-1.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The majority of bikes in the Cannondale Synapse Carbon range are sold equipped with SmartSense. This is Cannondale’s system that includes a front and rear light that adapt to the ambient light level. Most specs also include a rearview radar developed in association with Garmin. They’re all powered by a single battery, which is mounted towards the base of the down tube.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s fair to say that the jury is still out on SmartSense. On the one hand, it improves riders’ safety by making them more visible and providing an alert when vehicles approach from behind. On the other, it adds around 500g to the bike’s weight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When he reviewed the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/cannondale-synapse-carbon-1-rle-review\" target=\"_blank\">Cannondale Synapse Carbon 1 RLE</a> with SmartSense, tech editor Sam Challis said, ‘I couldn’t help feeling that the extra half a kilo neutered the bike uphill somewhat, toning down a ride feel that has always before felt pleasantly lively.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you like the idea of having an integrated light system, the SuperSix Evo and alloy Synapse frames are also compatible with SmartSense, although it’s not offered as standard. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cannondale equips its bikes with its own front wheel sensor, which measures the bike’s speed and distance travelled independently from a cycling computer. It links to the Cannondale phone app to remind you of service intervals too. On SmartSense-equipped bikes, it also turns on the lights and radar automatically once you start to move.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cannondale CAAD alloy bike range</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/07/05062940/cannondale_caad13_1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"cannondale_caad13_1\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t discount Cannondale’s alloy CAAD bikes. Before carbon fibre took over as the material of choice for performance road bikes, Cannondale was an early mover from steel to alloy and its CAAD range was one of the foremost pro-level race bikes, ridden by sprinter <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/in-the-den-of-the-lion-king\" target=\"_blank\">Mario Cipollini</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now incremented to CAAD13, Cannondale’s alloy bikes are still among the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-aluminium-road-bikes\" target=\"_blank\">best aluminium road bikes</a> available.

There’s a more affordable rim brake <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/bike-we-like-cannondale-caad-optimo\" target=\"_blank\">CAAD Optimo </a>range that sits below the CAAD13 and is priced from £900 to £1,300.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cannondale-supersix-history\">The complete history of the Cannondale SuperSix</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-all-road-bikes\">Best all-road bikes 2024 reviewed</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cannondales-supersix-evo-2023-whats-changed\">Here’s every nerdy detail on Cannondale’s fourth generation SuperSix Evo frameset</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-endurance-road-bikes\">Best endurance road bikes 2024 ridden and reviewed</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-road-bike\">Best road bikes: Best bikes from under £1,000 to over £10,000</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Cannondale SuperSix vs SystemSix vs Synapse: ranges compared</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cannondale’s road bikes are available in a good spread of specs.

If you want to go fast, the SuperSix Evo rivals Cannondale’s aero bike though and makes fewer compromises to achieve its speed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Sam Challis said in his SuperSix Evo Hi-Mod 1 review: “If Cannondale’s aero claims about the bike are to be believed, I’m struggling to see a case now for the brand’s SystemSix, which isn’t much faster and is over a kilo heavier.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SystemSix is showing its age too, while the SuperSix Evo’s recent refresh has kept it reasonably up to date, although not cutting-edge in design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the majority of riders on UK roads, the Synapse makes a good claim to be the Cannondale bike of choice though. It’s smoother and is more likely to suit the average non-racer. The 35mm tyre clearance gives the bike <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-all-road-bikes\" target=\"_blank\">all-road</a> capabilities. The SmartSense system does add weight, but if you ride with lights that’s extra mass that you’ll probably be clamping to your bike in any case. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Read our full reviews of the Cannondale <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/cannondale-supersix-evo-review\" target=\"_blank\">SuperSix Evo</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/cannondale-systemsix-review\" target=\"_blank\">SystemSix</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/cannondale-synapse-carbon-1-rle-review\" target=\"_blank\">Synapse Carbon</a> to help you choose</em>, <em>and check out the full range at <a href=\"https://www.cannondale.com/en/bikes/road\" target=\"_blank\">cannondale.com</a></em></p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cannondale-supersix-history\">The complete history of the Cannondale SuperSix</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-all-road-bikes\">Best all-road bikes 2024 reviewed</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cannondales-supersix-evo-2023-whats-changed\">Here’s every nerdy detail on Cannondale’s fourth generation SuperSix Evo frameset</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-endurance-road-bikes\">Best endurance road bikes 2024 ridden and reviewed</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-road-bike\">Best road bikes: Best bikes from under £1,000 to over £10,000</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/cannondale-supersix-systemsix-synapse\">Cannondale SuperSix Evo vs SystemSix vs Synapse: Which is the best Cannondale road bike for you?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"pnorman","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"557a716dedd2af049b7e708f48d1bea128e7a45f29bad87442d050238eedf2a8","category":"Cycling"}
