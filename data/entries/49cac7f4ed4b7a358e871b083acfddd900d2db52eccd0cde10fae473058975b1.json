using a split seatpost in Glasgow.\" title=\"Hope HB.T Paris\" />                                            <p>British Cycling has unveiled the Hope HB.T Paris, an updated version of its iconic track bike, the Hope HB.T.</p>\n<p>As well as updates to the frame and handlebars, the HB.T Paris features a striking, 3D-printed split seatpost made by Renishaw, a UK-based company that specialises in additive manufacturing (or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/bikeradar-podcast-josh-poertner-on-3d-printing-the-benefits-of-quality-chain-lubricants-tyres-and-aerodynamics/\">3D-printing</a>, as it’s more commonly known).</p>\n<p>The updated track bike has been announced ahead of the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2023-cycling-world-championships-tv-live-streams/\">2023 UCI Cycling World Championships</a>, which are taking place in Glasgow next week.</p>\n<p>Per UCI rules, nations must register equipment and clothing with the UCI ahead of each Olympic Games.</p>\n<p>The UCI also requires nations to present this equipment for inspection at one of four events leading up to the Games.</p>\n<p>With the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/events/paris-2024/\">2024 Paris Olympics</a> now less than a year away, the Glasgow World Championships is the last possible event to present equipment of inspection (according to the UCI’s own <a href=\"https://assets.ctfassets.net/761l7gh5x5an/5t03O3wzR8ON3ZX5aoDYnQ/0286f00527af431fdc70cf1da1387b5d/UCI_Track_Equipment_Registration_Procedure_Paris_2024.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Equipment Registration Procedure document</a>).</p>\n<p>As such, British Cycling says it is bringing a total of  “64 pieces of kit and equipment” to Glasgow, which could see “potential use at the 2024 Paris Olympic Games”.</p>\n<h2>Renishaw 3D-printed split seatpost</h2>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Hope HB T Paris\" title=\"Hope HB T Paris_007\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Hope HB.T Paris track bike will debut at the 2023 World Championships.</span></figcaption><span> <i>SWPpix</i></span></div>\n<p>The most eye-catching part of the updated bike is undoubtedly the split seatpost.</p>\n<p>While it appears to insert into the seat tube of the Hope carbon frame in a single aerofoil shape, it splits almost immediately above the seat clamp into two slim aerofoil shapes, leaving a gaping hole in the middle.</p>\n<p>These then extend diagonally backwards before abruptly kinking forwards again towards the saddle clamp, where the two aerofoils rejoin each other.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Hope HB.T Paris\" title=\"Hope HB.T Paris\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> As well as having a split design, each half angles backwards before kinking forwards sharply to rejoin at the saddle clamp.</span></figcaption><span> <i>SWPix</i></span></div>\n<p>Considering this is a bike designed for track racing, this design is almost certainly intended to reduce aerodynamic drag, rather than to improve compliance, for example.</p>\n<p>At a glance, it appears to be an extension of the bike’s overall aerodynamic philosophy which considers the bike and rider as a system (rather than as separate component parts).</p>\n<p>The fork legs and seatstays, for example, are placed in line with the riders legs, and it appears this seatpost design may be trying to achieve the same thing.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Hope HB.T Paris\" title=\"Hope HB.T Paris\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The unusual seatpost design certainly chimes with the rest of the bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>SWPix</i></span></div>\n<p>The design is somewhat reminiscent of the ‘IsoFlow’ seat tube hole on the latest <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2023-trek-madone-slr/\">Trek Madone SLR</a>, too.</p>\n<p>When that bike launched Trek claimed the hole helped accelerate airflow through it, reducing the bike’s trailing low-pressure wake (and, in turn, reducing its drag). Could British Cycling be attempting something similar there, too?</p>\n<p>The cycling world has been treated to a number of unusual 3D-printed designs in recent years, from the original <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/hope-hb-t/\">Hope HB.T</a> and its wide stance seat stays and dual crown fork, to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/filippo-ganna-pinarello-hour-record-bike/\">Filippo Ganna’s humpback whale-inspired Hour Record bike</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/mythos-elix-3d-printed-stem/\">Mythos Elix 3D-printed stem</a>. Wild new designs such as this suggest we’ve only scratched the surface at what’s possible with this (relatively) new manufacturing technology.</p>\n<h2>A Hope HB.T in Paris</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Hope HB.T Paris\" title=\"Hope HB.T Paris\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Hope HB.T frameset has also been revised and updated to make it even faster than before.</span></figcaption><span> <i>SWPix</i></span></div>\n<p>Beyond the seatpost, the Hope frameset has also undergone a few notable revisions.</p>\n<p>As already noted, the Hope HB.T Paris retains the holistic aerodynamic philosophy of its predecessor, aiming to account for the presence of the rider on board it.</p>\n<p>The radically wide stance fork and seat stays remain, although it appears the 3D-printed parts at the tops of each have been updated to make them slimmer and more aerodynamic.</p>\n<p>The trailing edge of the fork legs also appear have been updated with a sawtooth profile. Again, we assume this serves an aerodynamic purpose.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Hope HB.T Paris\" title=\"Hope HB.T Paris\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The trailing edge of the fork now has a sawtooth profile, which we presume is another aerodynamic feature.</span></figcaption><span> <i>SWPix</i></span></div>\n<p>The head tube has also been updated, with the Paris bike losing the hourglass shape of the original bike, in favour of an incredibly slim, straight design.</p>\n<p>Given the previous shape accommodated the frame’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-ultimate-guide-to-headsets/\">headset</a> bearings, it appears as the Hope HB.T is using a very small steerer tube and headset arrangement.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Hope HB.T Paris\" title=\"Hope HB.T Paris\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The new straight head tube appears very slim, and loses the hourglass shaping of the previous version.</span></figcaption><span> <i>SWPix</i></span></div>\n<p>The Hope HB.T Paris is pictured with Hope’s own front and rear tubular track disc wheels, as well as a carbon fibre aero crankset and chainring combination.</p>\n<p>British Cycling has shown two versions – one with time trial-style aero extensions for pursuit events and one with a drop handlebar for sprint and bunch races.</p>\n<p>As before, the aero extensions also appear to be 3D-printed, though they are of a wider and deeper (and, therefore, presumably also more aerodynamic) shape than before.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Hope HB.T Paris\" title=\"Hope HB.T Paris\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The time trial extensions on the pursuit version of the bike have also seen an update.</span></figcaption><span> <i>SWPix</i></span></div>\n<p>The drop handlebars may also be 3D-printed, although as they’re painted it’s hard to be certain. Either way, these also use a fairly radical shape, with each arm of the bar rising outwards from the headtube to the drops.</p>\n<p>The front-on picture of the new drop handlebars also shows the Hope frame equipped with a more standard, one-piece seatpost.</p>\n<p>This could indicate the split-design post is only optimal for certain events, or for certain riders, and both types will be available as options.</p>","author":"Simon von Bromley","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"49cac7f4ed4b7a358e871b083acfddd900d2db52eccd0cde10fae473058975b1","category":"Cycling"}
