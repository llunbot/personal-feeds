He previously only expected the iPhone 17 Pro Max to have 12GB of RAM, so this is good news for customers who will be purchasing the other models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKuo said even the base-model iPhone 17 might be equipped with 12GB of RAM, but only if supply chain shortages can be overcome. He said that Apple will make a final decision on the amount of RAM it will offer in this device by May.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll of the models in the iPhone 16 lineup are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/all-iphone-16-models-have-8gb-ram/\">equipped with 8GB of RAM</a>, so the jump to 12GB would be a significant increase. Increased RAM can contribute to improved performance for Apple Intelligence and multitasking.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEven if the base-model iPhone 17 sticks with 8GB of RAM, Kuo said he expects all models in the iPhone 18 lineup to have 12GB of RAM.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKuo said the increased RAM will primarily benefit Apple suppliers Micron and SK Hynix.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple should announce the iPhone 17 series in September.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/\">iPhone 17 Air</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/\">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/24/iphone-17-air-12gb-ram-rumor/\">iPhone 17 Air Now Rumored to Feature 12GB of RAM Like the Pro Models</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-air-now-rumored-to-feature-12gb-of-ram-like-the-pro-models.2455885/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ba9e3b71dd97828c9c459a6575eb3e824baa3d30f38fe3816a6113f49b224509","category":"Apple"}
