With a HAMR.</p>\n<p>Seagate has been experimenting with heat-assisted magnetic recording, or HAMR, since at least 2002. The firm has occasionally popped up to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/03/hamr-time-seagate-demos-terabyte-per-inch-hard-disk-technology/\">offer a demonstration</a> or make <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/02/hamr-dont-hurt-em-laser-assisted-hard-drives-are-coming-in-2020/\">yet another</a> \"around the corner\" pronouncement. The press has enjoyed myriad chances to celebrate the wordplay of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MC_Hammer\">Stanley Kirk Burrell</a>, but new qualification from large-scale customers might mean HAMR drives will be actually available, to buy, as physical objects, for anyone who can afford the most magnetic space possible. Third decade's the charm, perhaps.</p>\n<p>HAMR works on the principle that, when heated, a disk's magnetic materials can hold more data in smaller spaces, such that you can fit more overall data on the drive. It's not just putting a tiny hot plate inside an HDD chassis; as <a href=\"https://www.seagate.com/www-content/ti-dm/tech-insights/en-us/docs/TP707-1-1712US_HAMR.pdf\">Seagate explains in its technical paper</a>, \"the entire process—heating, writing, and cooling—takes less than 1 nanosecond.\" Getting from a physics concept to an actual drive involved adding a laser diode to the drive head, optical steering, firmware alterations, and \"a million other little things that engineers spent countless hours developing.\" Seagate has a lot more about Mozaic 3+ <a href=\"https://www.seagate.com/innovation/mozaic/\">on its site</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/after-decades-of-talk-seagate-seems-ready-to-actually-drop-the-hamr-hard-drives/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/after-decades-of-talk-seagate-seems-ready-to-actually-drop-the-hamr-hard-drives/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"94c71fd8f3a48f5e9782eeb4fbd37145eff59e1348bdca0a7ca3ef30418c1ce1","category":"Tech"}
