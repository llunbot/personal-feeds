As always, it will start with a livestream keynote on Monday morning at 10 am Pacific, 1 pm Eastern. We'll be in attendance reporting on the event, so let's take a moment to take stock of what we expect to see next week.</p>\n<p>But first, let's note something we <em>don't</em> think we'll see: Due to some peculiarities about Apple's upgrade cycles, as well as a push toward the M4, we're not actually expecting any major hardware announcements at WWDC this year.</p>\n<p>That's OK, though, because it looks like it's going to be a big one for software news. iOS has seen relatively modest updates in the past couple of years, but that's about to change.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029509#p3\">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029509&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e649d37dd4cbcfc908910d392d296a235c6e02899f21b84fcbd150bb38485067","category":"Tech"}
