This new <a href=\"https://www.ciclovation.com/GRIND-TOUCH/81820028.html\" target=\"_blank\">Grind Touch_Diamond GXL</a> bar tape is being hawked as “the ultimate handlebar tape for gravel cyclists”. But, Cyclovation goes on to say that the new tape is “<em>designed to deliver control, comfort, and durability on every ride</em>“. Which sounds like all cyclists could benefit? I’ll let you guys be the judge.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-hero.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-hero.webp\" alt=\"Ciclovation Grind Touch_ Diamond GXL Gravel Bar Tape hero\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-hero.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-hero-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-hero-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-hero-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-hero-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-hero-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos / Ciclovation)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The tape uses “high-performance” elastomer composite materials. They’re saying that the Touch_Diamond GXL is setting a new standard in anti-slip performance. And I suppose it’s due to the diamond-patterned texture of the tape that offers this “<em>unparalleled stability and handling</em>“. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-khaki-rolls.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-khaki-rolls.webp\" alt=\"Ciclovation Grind Touch_ Diamond GXL Gravel Bar Tape khaki rolls\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-khaki-rolls.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-khaki-rolls-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-khaki-rolls-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-khaki-rolls-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-khaki-rolls-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-khaki-rolls-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Khaki </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-matte-black-rolls.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-matte-black-rolls.webp\" alt=\"Ciclovation Grind Touch_ Diamond GXL Gravel Bar Tape matte black rolls\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-matte-black-rolls.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-matte-black-rolls-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-matte-black-rolls-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-matte-black-rolls-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-matte-black-rolls-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-matte-black-rolls-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Matte Black</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There seem to be a lot of unsubstantiated claims about Cyclovation’s new bar tape here, but I’ll continue. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ciclovation Prioritizes Rider Comfort</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Pushing development beyond making a bar tape with the claimed superior grip, the handlebar tape was designed to prioritize rider comfort. It uses thickened,high-density foam that “effectively absorbs shocks and vibrations”. This, in turn, will reduce hand fatigue over long distances.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-side-view.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-side-view.webp\" alt=\"Ciclovation Grind Touch_ Diamond GXL Gravel Bar Tape side view\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-side-view.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-side-view-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-side-view-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-side-view-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-side-view-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-side-view-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The tape uses silicone adhesive backing, which will help to keep it where you wrapped it. The tape material should allow for easy installation and is said to conform effortlessly to a variety of handlebar shapes as well. It comes in 2300mm length which should be enough for wide flared bars.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-burgundy-rolls.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-burgundy-rolls.webp\" alt=\"Ciclovation Grind Touch_ Diamond GXL Gravel Bar Tape burgundy rolls\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-burgundy-rolls.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-burgundy-rolls-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-burgundy-rolls-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-burgundy-rolls-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-burgundy-rolls-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-burgundy-rolls-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Burgundy</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-racing-green.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-racing-green.webp\" alt=\"Ciclovation Grind Touch_ Diamond GXL Gravel Bar Tape racing green\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-racing-green.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-racing-green-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-racing-green-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-racing-green-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-racing-green-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ciclovation-Grind-Touch_-Diamond-GXL-Gravel-Bar-Tape-racing-green-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Racing Green</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With the extra padding and grip, not to mention length, it sounds like the tape could be a bit heavier than average but the weight is not provided. The tame measures 30mm wide and an ample 3.6mm thick and includes VORTEX lock-in bar plugs. Ignoring the gravel-specific branding, it sounds like this tape would be a good option for anyone who prioritizes grip and comfort on their dropbar bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Retail and Features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail: €39.99 ($42)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Colors: Natural Khaki, Racing Green, Burgundy Red, Matte Black</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Designed for Gravel Cyclists</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Superior Grip and Comfort</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Made for Wide Handlebars</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Nature-Inspired Colors</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Versatile &amp; Ready for Distance</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.ciclovation.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ciclovation.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/ciclovation-releases-gravel-specific-bar-tape/\">Ciclovation Releases Gravel Specific Bar Tape, for Gravel Cyclists Only?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"864110e19ee4bc482d1adf1354a4765f0a9028b25d47294d0c454a26c1ab079a","category":"Cycling"}
