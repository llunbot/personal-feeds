present or boring part of an outfit, but here at <em>Cyclist, </em>we couldn’t disagree more. After years of testing different types of cycling socks, we certainly appreciate a pair of high quality, sweat wicking, durable and stylish socks; a world away from the disappointment of saggy, snaggy and smelly ones. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as a lot of tech goes into making the best cycling clothing for each season and discipline, so too does attention need to be paid when it comes to cycling socks. Our experienced team of riders know their lightweight climbing socks from odour-resistant merino designs and race-ready aero socks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best cycling socks for summer: <em>Cyclist’s </em>picks<em> </em></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Rule 28 Aero Socks</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Rule28-Aero-socks-970x646.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Rule28-Aero-socks-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Rule28-Aero-socks-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Rule28-Aero-socks-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Rule28-Aero-socks-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Rule28-Aero-socks-2048x1364.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Rule28-Aero-socks-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Rule28-Aero-socks-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Rule28-Aero-socks-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Rule28-Aero-socks-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Rule28-Aero-socks-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>RRP: £28 | <a href=\"https://www.rule28.com/products/aero-socks\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Aerodynamically optimised cycling socks for racing</li>\n\n\n\n<li>UCI legal height</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wide calf gripper </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest iteration of Rule 28’s market-changing aero offering that was launched in 2017, the Rule 28 Aero Socks are worn both on the road and track and at the highest level of the sport, with a calf length that complies with UCI sock height rules.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The socks are available in four size ranges; UK 3.5-5, 5.5-7, 7.5-9.5 and 10-12, and either black or white colourways.

Unlike some of Rapha’s other sock offerings, the Lightweight socks are only available in a single cuff length.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=18515&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rapha.cc%2FGB%2Fen%2Fshop%2Flightweight-socks-regular%2Fproduct%2FLWK05RGBLKLRG\" target=\"_blank\">Rapha (£18)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>MAAP Alt Road Trail Socks</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Maap-Alt-Road-Trail-socks-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Maap-Alt-Road-Trail-socks-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Maap-Alt-Road-Trail-socks-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Maap-Alt-Road-Trail-socks-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Maap-Alt-Road-Trail-socks-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Maap-Alt-Road-Trail-socks-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Maap-Alt-Road-Trail-socks-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Maap-Alt-Road-Trail-socks-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Maap-Alt-Road-Trail-socks-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Maap-Alt-Road-Trail-socks-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Maap-Alt-Road-Trail-socks-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>£28 | <a href=\"https://maap.cc/uk/products/alt_road-merino-space-dye-sock-bluestone\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Heavyweight merino wool blend sock for hot, off-road riding</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Recommended temperature range 15-40 degrees Celsius</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only are the MAAP Alt Road Trail Socks designed for hot weather, but they’re also – as the name suggests – made for off-road riding. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thinner socks might not always be better when it comes to hotter weather, as these thicker socks use a merino wool blend to help with thermoregulation, as well as being anti-microbial and acting to reduce odour. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This comes in extra handy when you’re riding for multiple days (eg, bikepacking without access to washing facilities), and often generally feel cosier than lightweight synthetic socks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The material is 80% merino wool and 20% polyamide, engineered with a high pilling resistance, to keep the socks looking good for longer.

Thicker, reinforced toe boxes and heels help to resist the rubbing that hike-a-bike can cause, while the inclusion of natural fibres can help when riding for multiple days, for example while <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/an-introduction-to-bikepacking\" target=\"_blank\">bikepacking</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is the ideal summer cycling sock length?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Cafe-du-Cycliste-Tie-Die-socks-worn-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Cafe-du-Cycliste-Tie-Die-socks-worn-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Cafe-du-Cycliste-Tie-Die-socks-worn-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Cafe-du-Cycliste-Tie-Die-socks-worn-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Cafe-du-Cycliste-Tie-Die-socks-worn-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Cafe-du-Cycliste-Tie-Die-socks-worn-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Cafe-du-Cycliste-Tie-Die-socks-worn-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Cafe-du-Cycliste-Tie-Die-socks-worn-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Cafe-du-Cycliste-Tie-Die-socks-worn-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Cafe-du-Cycliste-Tie-Die-socks-worn-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Cafe-du-Cycliste-Tie-Die-socks-worn-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no perfect sock height; the choice is personal preference. You’ll notice most pro cyclists riding a higher cuff sock, extending to just under the calf. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you’re keen to minimise tan lines for your off-the-bike life, then a shorter ankle sock might work better for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have longer legs and are looking for a longer sock, then some brands such as Rapha offer a longer fitting option.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Are there any differences for summer cycling socks designed for road and gravel cycling?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Maap-Alt-Road-Trail-socks-worn-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Maap-Alt-Road-Trail-socks-worn-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Maap-Alt-Road-Trail-socks-worn-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Maap-Alt-Road-Trail-socks-worn-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Maap-Alt-Road-Trail-socks-worn-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Maap-Alt-Road-Trail-socks-worn-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Maap-Alt-Road-Trail-socks-worn-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Maap-Alt-Road-Trail-socks-worn-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Maap-Alt-Road-Trail-socks-worn-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Maap-Alt-Road-Trail-socks-worn-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Maap-Alt-Road-Trail-socks-worn-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While most socks can be worn for either road or gravel, some designs feature enhanced materials for the rigours of off-road cycling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravel-specific cycling socks with a thickened heel and toe box can help resist rubbing from hike-a-bike sections, while a more robust knit can help avoid snags from brambles or other overgrowth that you’re much less likely to encounter while riding on the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a practical standpoint, you may also find less pale coloured socks for gravel riding; a darker colour can help prevent staining from unexpected mud or puddles!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What are the best colours for summer cycling socks?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, the best colour for summer cycling socks is largely down to personal preferences. Current pro cycling trends seem to show most riders opting for a sleek white shoe and white sock combo throughout the year, but if you’re trying to keep your own socks and shoes white through the winter you may have other ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are lots of jazzy colours to choose from when it comes to summer cycling socks, which are just as much a part of any cycling outfit as the rest of it. There’s a popular Instagram hashtag #sockdoping for a reason…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you do a lot of off-road riding, coloured or darker socks may be a more practical option for avoiding stains. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What are aero cycling socks?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Rule28-Aero-socks-worn-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Rule28-Aero-socks-worn-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Rule28-Aero-socks-worn-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Rule28-Aero-socks-worn-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Rule28-Aero-socks-worn-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Rule28-Aero-socks-worn-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Rule28-Aero-socks-worn-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Rule28-Aero-socks-worn-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Rule28-Aero-socks-worn-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Rule28-Aero-socks-worn-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Rule28-Aero-socks-worn-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Aero socks are tall-cuffed cycling socks designed to be as slippery as possible; that is to minimise aerodynamic drag, just like a well-fitted skinsuit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aero socks launched onto the scene in 2017, and have since been well-adopted by pro cyclists and some amateurs alike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aero cycling socks tend to be more expensive than standard cycling socks, though there are now a range of brands – small and mainstream – that offer them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When would you need aero cycling socks?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Aero cycling socks offer the biggest watt savings when riding at higher speeds, so if you’re going for a bimble in the lanes then you’re probably better off sticking to your normal socks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you’re looking to squeeze out every last ounce of performance and are looking for a relatively low cost improvement (compared to aero wheels and helmets), then aero socks may be for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To give you a bit of an idea of potential savings, Rule 28 claims that its socks can save 12 watts at 45kmh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Looking for something warmer?
