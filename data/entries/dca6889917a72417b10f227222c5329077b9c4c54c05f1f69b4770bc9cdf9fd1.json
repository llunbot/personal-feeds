On Wednesday, the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/automotive-trends\">EPA published</a> its Automotive Trends Report, which now included data for model-year 2022 vehicles.</p>\n<p>And the data is good: record-low carbon emissions and record-high fuel economy, and the biggest improvement year on year for almost a decade.</p>\n<p>For MY2022, the EPA says that the average real-world CO<sub>2</sub> emissions for all new vehicles fell by 10 g/mile to 337 g/mile, the lowest average it has ever measured. Similarly, real-world fuel economy increased by 0.6 mpg for MY2022, to 26 mpgâ€”this, too, is a record high and the single-largest year-on-year improvement for both CO<sub>2</sub> and mpg for nine years.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992563#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992563&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
