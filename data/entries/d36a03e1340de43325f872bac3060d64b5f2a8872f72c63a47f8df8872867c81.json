That includes the offering of <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/2mhhmpwy\">a $130 Thunderbolt 4 (USB-C) Pro cable</a>, one that's actually $160 if you need the full 3 meters. Could one cable, an object whose job is to transfer power and data and be completely unnoticed, be worth that kind of cash?</p>\n<p>Lumafield, maker of manufacturing-minded industrial CT scanners, <a href=\"https://www.lumafield.com/article/usb-c-cable-charger-head-to-head-comparison-apple-thunderbolt-amazon-basics\">studied this question across three dimensions</a>. After scanning Apple's top-of-the-line cable, a <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3FovOZA\">$10 Amazon Basics model</a>, and USB-C cables costing $5.59 and $3.89, Lumafield had no definitive answer other than \"we buy cables that meet our needs\" and that \"there’s plenty of room for clever engineering and efficient manufacturing\" inside a seemingly defined spec like USB-C.</p>\n<p>But we can say that if your goal is to buy one cable that will hold up to abuse, work with the power and data speeds of today and a reasonably distant tomorrow, and remove cables from your list of things that might be the problem? Lumafield's images show why Apple's alpha-cable might just be worth it.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976995#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1976995&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d36a03e1340de43325f872bac3060d64b5f2a8872f72c63a47f8df8872867c81","category":"Tech"}
