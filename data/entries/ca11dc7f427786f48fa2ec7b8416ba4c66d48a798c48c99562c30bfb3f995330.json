{"title":"iOS 17: What's New With AirPlay","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-airplay/","date":1691185087000,"content":"With the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a> update, Apple is updating and refining almost every <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> app and feature, and that includes <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/\">AirPlay</a>. ‌AirPlay‌ is Apple's wireless communication protocol that allows music and video content from iPhones, iPads, and Macs to be beamed to devices like the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a>, and third-party speakers, smart TVs, set-top boxes, and receivers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/iOS-17-AirPlay-Feature.jpg\" alt width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" />\r<br />\nThis guide highlights the changes that Apple is making to ‌AirPlay‌ in ‌iOS 17‌, with these features also available in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/\">macOS Sonoma</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>AirPlay Preferences</h2>\r<br />\n‌iOS 17‌ improves on-device intelligence for ‌AirPlay‌, and it is able to better learn your preferences over time. If you typically ‌AirPlay‌ from your ‌iPhone‌ to the ‌Apple TV‌ in the living room, it will learn that behavior and show the ‌Apple TV‌ first in your ‌AirPlay‌ list over other ‌AirPlay‌ devices that may be in the home.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/ios-17-airplay.jpg\" alt width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nDevices are shown in the ‌AirPlay‌ interface based on relevance, and you'll also now see suggested connections proactively based on your prior ‌AirPlay‌ usage.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌AirPlay‌ interface is smarter from the outset, and it shows the devices that are located closest to you first rather than offering up a more arbitrary list. The ‌AirPlay‌ interface also makes it clearer which device content is AirPlaying to and whether ‌AirPlay‌ is active. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Automatic AirPlay</h2>\r<br />\nThe Automatic ‌AirPlay‌ feature that was available for TVs in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-16/\">iOS 16</a> has expanded to include speakers as well in ‌iOS 17‌. You can opt in to have the ‌iPhone‌ automatically connect to nearby speakers and TVs when playing content from apps that you regularly use with ‌AirPlay‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/ios-17-airplay-automatic.jpg\" alt width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nPreviously, this setting was limited to ‌AirPlay‌ TVs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>AirPlay in Hotel Rooms</h2>\r<br />\nApple is teaming up with hotel chains and TV manufacturers to introduce smart TV sets that will let hotel guests automatically ‌AirPlay‌ content from their Apple devices to the hotel TV.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/airplay-hotels.jpg\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"894\" />\r<br />\nThe option will let guests watch their own TV shows and movies without having to sign into streaming accounts on shared televisions, providing more security for viewing content when traveling.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIHG Hotels and Resorts will be the first hotel company to bring ‌AirPlay‌ to its hotels, and LG <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/22/lg-airplay-hotel-room-tvs/\">plans to introduce</a> AirPlay-compatible smart TVs designed specifically for use in hotels.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Read More</h2>\r<br />\nYou can get more information on the changes coming in ‌iOS 17‌ in our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">comprehensive iOS 17 roundup</a>.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-airplay/\">iOS 17: What's New With AirPlay</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-whats-new-with-airplay.2397815/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ca11dc7f427786f48fa2ec7b8416ba4c66d48a798c48c99562c30bfb3f995330","category":"Apple"}
