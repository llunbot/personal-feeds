Apple made it so that users in the EU who open Safari for the first time are presented with a choice screen that allows them to opt for a new default browser from a list of popular alternatives in their country. However, browser companies have been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/12/apple-eu-default-browser-options-criticized/\">openly critical</a> of the way Apple originally designed the screen, and the Commission's probe was conducted in consultation with those companies.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe browser companies encouraged regulators to push for a stronger implementation to level the competitive playing field, and it sounds like they got the improvements they wanted. Apple <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/support/browser-choice-screen/\">made several changes</a> to the screen in question last October with the release of iOS 18.2. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple had good reason to abide by its DMA requirements. In cases of infringement, the Commission can impose fines up to 10% of the company's total worldwide turnover. Such fines can go up to 20% in case of repeated infringement under the DMA. The Commission also has the power to adopt \"additional remedies\" such as \"obliging a gatekeeper to sell a business or parts of it,\" or banning the company from acquisitions of additional services related to the non-compliance.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is still under non-compliance investigation by the Commission for anti-steering rules. The probe is looking at whether the company allows developers to \"steer\" users away from its App Store and link to alternate payment methods.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/\">Apple Antitrust</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-commission/\">European Commission</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/\">European Union</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/25/eu-close-antitrust-probe-browser-choice-screen/\">EU to Close Antitrust Investigation into Apple's Browser Choice Screen</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/eu-to-close-antitrust-investigation-into-apples-browser-choice-screen.2454018/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"25beb63bf4b21edcaae32a40164470546f9955522b11e0dfee558b9ff142bbc9","category":"Apple"}
