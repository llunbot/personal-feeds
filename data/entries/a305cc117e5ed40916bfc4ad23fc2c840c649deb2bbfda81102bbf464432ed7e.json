It conveniently mirrors iOS notifications, calls, and messages, letting users stay updated without taking their phones out. What a lot of wearers don’t know, though, is how powerful and feature-packed watchOS really is, and how much your smartwatch can accomplish. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below are ten Apple Watch perks you’re probably unfamiliar with.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Timely gate access</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a watchOS user, chances are you’re already relying on Apple Pay to quickly make payments from your wrist. Similarly, the Apple Watch automatically syncs compatible tickets whenever you add them to the Wallet app on iOS. This lets you enter venues and board planes by double-clicking the side button and scanning the QR code on the smartwatch’s display. But what if your favorite gym, cinema, or airline doesn’t officially offer Apple Wallet cards for purchased tickets or memberships?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, you can manually create an Apple Watch card using any QR code. Simply download the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/wallet-creator/id1486573384\">Wallet Creator app</a> on your iPhone, create the card, and add it to the Wallet app on iOS. In a few seconds, the newly created card should also appear on your Apple Watch when you double-click its side button. This spares you from digging through your emails or third-party apps whenever you need to cross compatible gates.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Apple-Watch-displaying-QR-code.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple Watch displaying QR code\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Apple-Watch-displaying-QR-code.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Apple-Watch-displaying-QR-code.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Apple-Watch-displaying-QR-code.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Apple-Watch-displaying-QR-code.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Apple-Watch-displaying-QR-code.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Apple-Watch-displaying-QR-code.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Apple-Watch-displaying-QR-code.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Apple-Watch-displaying-QR-code.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Mahmoud Itani / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Timeless texter</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s no secret that cellular-enabled Apple Watches can independently make calls and send texts. But did you know that regular Wi-Fi models can also do that, even when your iPhone is off or in a different location? As you’d expect, there are some requirements and limits, but it’s doable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first and main condition is having Wi-Fi access. You can connect to any (unknown) network by inputting its password in the Settings app on watchOS. Once connected, you can send and receive iMessages and make FaceTime audio calls right from your wrist. This is especially helpful during emergencies if your iPhone dies or <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671675/how-to-use-find-my-iphone-to-find-lost-or-stolen-iphone-or-ipad.html\">gets stolen</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of iMessage, you can also use the Digital Touch applet in the Messages app on watchOS to send your actual heartbeat to a contact. Just place two fingers on the display, then swipe them down to send. If the recipient is also a watchOS user, their Apple Watch’s haptic feedback will mimic your heartbeat to replicate your pulse. It’s a cute, lesser-known way for couples to communicate.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Web browser in disguise</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another hidden Messages feature is the built-in web view that provides a basic Safari experience on watchOS. All you have to do is iMessage yourself a link, then open it on your Apple Watch. The feature also supports the Reader perk, which presents articles neatly and hides distracting items. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading articles on a smartwatch’s tiny display is unlikely to become a regular habit, but it could come in handy in certain situations.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Reincarnated iPod shuffle</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You probably already use your Apple Watch’s native Now Playing app to control the music streaming on your iPhone. However, many users miss out on watchOS’s native playback perk. Simply pair AirPods or third-party Bluetooth headphones to your smartwatch, and stream directly from Apple Music if you have an internet connection. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For offline listening, both Apple Music and Spotify support downloading playlists to the wearable’s local storage, letting you leave your iPhone behind. This makes it possible to run outdoors with just your Apple Watch and a pair of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668628/best-earbuds-for-iphone.html\">wireless earbuds</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Apple-Watch-Music-app.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple Watch Music app\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Apple-Watch-Music-app.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Apple-Watch-Music-app.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Apple-Watch-Music-app.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Apple-Watch-Music-app.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Apple-Watch-Music-app.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Apple-Watch-Music-app.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Apple-Watch-Music-app.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Apple-Watch-Music-app.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Mahmoud Itani / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>The TV remote you’ll never lose</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>watchOS also offers a native Remote app that lets you fully control your Apple TV. Even on this miniature screen, the interface manages to fit all of the main buttons, letting you switch apps, go back, navigate, control the volume, and more. It’s ideal for when you’re cooking or cleaning and don’t want to dirty the physical Siri Remote or your iPhone. Or those times when neither of those items are conveniently to hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can similarly control other smart home appliances that rely on the HomeKit infrastructure using the native Home app on watchOS. I often use it to change the color of my light bulbs when Siri—<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2643682/is-siri-really-that-bad-yes-yes-it-is.html\">in typical Siri fashion</a>—fails to process my voice commands.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Apple-Watch-Remote-app.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple Watch Remote app\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Apple-Watch-Remote-app.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Apple-Watch-Remote-app.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Apple-Watch-Remote-app.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Apple-Watch-Remote-app.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Apple-Watch-Remote-app.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Apple-Watch-Remote-app.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Apple-Watch-Remote-app.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Apple-Watch-Remote-app.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Mahmoud Itani / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Radio check—do you copy?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from FaceTime and iMessage, the Apple Watch offers an exclusive communication tool that seemingly very few people use. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673129/how-to-use-walkie-talkie-on-apple-watch.html\">Walkie-Talkie</a> is a built-in app that lets you quickly contact other watchOS users using your voice. Once you add a friend there, you can communicate verbally in real time using the FaceTime audio technology. When you’re in a meeting or just don’t want to be reached, you can toggle off your availability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While most users probably prefer regular audio messages or phone calls, the Walkie-Talkie app makes it easier to get quick answers for minor questions—like what brand of milk to get from the supermarket. It mostly caters to best friends, family members, and partners, as having less intimate acquaintances reach you at any time would be too intrusive.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Apple-Watch-Walkie-Talkie-app.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple Watch Walkie-Talkie app\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Apple-Watch-Walkie-Talkie-app.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Apple-Watch-Walkie-Talkie-app.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Apple-Watch-Walkie-Talkie-app.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Apple-Watch-Walkie-Talkie-app.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Apple-Watch-Walkie-Talkie-app.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Apple-Watch-Walkie-Talkie-app.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Apple-Watch-Walkie-Talkie-app.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Apple-Watch-Walkie-Talkie-app.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Mahmoud Itani / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Nighttime iPhone locator</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you often misplace your iPhone, you’ve likely made use of the handy Ping toggle in the Apple Watch’s Control Center. When you tap it, your iPhone produces a loud screech if it’s within Bluetooth range. What you probably don’t know, though, is that pressing and holding on that toggle will also make your iPhone’s camera LED flash. This makes it possible to locate your phone in a pitch-black environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>It can tell the time!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Did you know that your Apple Watch can tell the time? Literally, I mean. Once you enable the Speak Time toggle in Clock settings, you can have watchOS announce the current time audibly by holding two fingers on the watch face. I sometimes use this feature when I wake up in the morning to identify the time without opening my heavy eyelids.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>TickTock-friendly</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re living the solo life and often need to record videos or take photos of yourself, this one’s for you. watchOS offers a built-in Camera Remote app that transforms your Apple Watch into a viewfinder for your iPhone’s Camera app. This ensures you’re in frame and helps you fine-tune composition before shooting. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The app also offers handy shortcuts to some of the Camera app’s buttons, like the shutter, zoom, and flash.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Fitness-award-on-Apple-Watch-.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Fitness award on Apple Watch\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Fitness-award-on-Apple-Watch-.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Fitness-award-on-Apple-Watch-.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Fitness-award-on-Apple-Watch-.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Fitness-award-on-Apple-Watch-.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Fitness-award-on-Apple-Watch-.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Fitness-award-on-Apple-Watch-.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Fitness-award-on-Apple-Watch-.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Fitness-award-on-Apple-Watch-.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Your Apple Watch can do a lot more than count steps and track activiity.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>One more tip</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For the last tip, your Apple Watch can actually calculate how much you need to tip at restaurants. Just input the bill’s total in the native Calculator app and hit the Tip button. You can then choose the percentage and optionally the number of people splitting it, et voilà!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Always on hand</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple Watch has come a long way. What once used to be a dependent accessory can now perform most basic smartphone tasks on its own. That’s even more practical for those with an active cellular plan. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s true that performing most of these tasks would be more practical using the wider iPhone screen. But there are still instances when the Apple Watch makes more sense. Sometimes your hands are occupied, other times your iPhone is out of charge—regardless of your reasons, it’s comforting to know that the wearable strapped to your wrist at all times can connect you to your loved ones, play your favorite tunes, unlock electric doors, control and find other devices, and much more. Over and out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For even more things to do with an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671574/best-apple-watch.html\">Apple Watch</a> see our guide to the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1923515/apple-watch-hidden-features-photos-unlock-games-messages-battery.html\">cool things Apple Watch can do</a>.
