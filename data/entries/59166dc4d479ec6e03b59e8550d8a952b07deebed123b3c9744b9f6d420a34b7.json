We’ve got full analysis of the race, teams and starters, a history of its most epic editions and our own experience of riding the (slightly shorter) full course a few years ago in our accompanying detailed <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-of-flanders-route-riders-sportive-and-all-you-need-to-know\" target=\"_blank\">Tour of Flanders guide</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year’s women’s race was won by Lotte Kopecky of SD Worx. With a pair of wins and a second place to her name already in 2023, can she make it two in a row? The 2022 men’s race was won for a second time in his career by Mathieu van der Poel, who won a four-up sprint to the line in Oudenaarde.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-of-flanders-2022-gallery\">Gallery: The best images from the Tour of Flanders 2022</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-forgotten-climbs-of-flanders\">The forgotten climbs of Flanders</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/big-ride-taking-on-the-cobbles-of-flanders\">Big Ride: Taking on the cobbles of Flanders</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-of-flanders-route-riders-sportive-and-all-you-need-to-know\">Tour of Flanders 2023: All you need to know including route, how to watch, start list, history and sportive</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>How to watch Tour of Flanders 2023</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/03/Parcours-men%C2%A9-Flanders-Classics-970x647.jpg\" alt /><figcaption>© Flanders Classics</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘De Ronde’ takes place on Sunday 2rd April so be sure not to miss the live action.
