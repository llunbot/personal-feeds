{"title":"Preview: What you need to know about stage 16 of the Vuelta a España","link":"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/08/preview-what-you-need-to-know-about-stage-16-of-the-vuelta-a-espana/","date":1630352351000,"content":"<div><div><p><strong>Date:</strong> Tuesday August 31<br><strong>Start: </strong>Laredo<br><strong>Finish: </strong>Santa Cruz de Bezana<br><strong>Distance: </strong>180 km</p><p>The first day of the final week is likely to be the race’s final sprint stage. There’s one Cat 3 climb partway through this coastal stage, and there are some uncategorized climbs later on in the profile, but they likely won’t stop this from being a bunch gallop.</p><p>That said, it is worth noting that there is a fair bit of wind on the forecast as the race rides along the coast. That will be something to keep an eye on as the stage rolls towards its likely sprint conclusion.</p><p><strong>Who’s it for: </strong>Sprinters.</p><p><strong>Dane Cash’s picks: </strong><em>The unusual way that the finale of stage 13 played out raises some question marks about Fabio Jakobsen, but he’s still probably the fastest finisher in the race right now with a great lead-out around him. He’s the favorite for stage 16. Arnaud Démare, Alberto Dainese, Magnus Cort, and Michael Matthews are others to watch.</em></p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2021-vuelta-profile-stage16.jpeg\"></figure><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/stage16.jpeg\"></figure></div></div>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"30b3d6392540f9cba3b20a49bf48cb27c277e779973eec672016d56939ba9510","category":"Cycling"}
