The <a href=\"https://www.codeweavers.com/crossover/\">CrossOver software</a> for Mac and Windows, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/apple/2023/06/apple-has-a-proton-like-game-porting-toolkit-for-getting-windows-games-on-mac/\">Apple's Game Porting Toolkit</a>, and the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/proton-update-gets-18-more-windows-games-running-on-linux-including-chex-quest-hd/\">Proton project</a> that powers <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/bye-bye-windows-gaming-steamos-officially-expands-past-the-steam-deck/\">Valve's SteamOS</a> and the Steam Deck are all rooted in Wine, and the attention and resources put into the project in recent years have dramatically improved its compatibility and usefulness.</p>\n<p>Yesterday, the Wine project announced <a href=\"https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine/-/releases/wine-10.0\">the stable release of version 10.0</a>, the next major version of the compatibility layer that is not an emulator. The headliner for this release is support for <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/arm/arm64ec\">ARM64EC</a>, the application binary interface (ABI) used for Arm apps in Windows 11, but the release notes say that the release contains \"over 6,000 individual changes\" produced over \"a year of development effort.\"</p>\n<p>ARM64EC allows developers to mix Arm and x86-compatible code—if you're making an Arm-native version of your app, you can still allow the use of more obscure x86-based plugins or add-ons without having to port everything over at once. Wine 10.0 also supports ARM64X, a different type of application binary file that allows ARM64EC code to be mixed with older, pre-Windows 11 ARM64 code.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/wine-10-0-released-adding-linux-compatibility-for-arm-windows-apps/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/wine-10-0-released-adding-linux-compatibility-for-arm-windows-apps/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"23d957a2eda7fbfc5b62f0cf2dad2ecebba0192458999d3e02555ac1b9880ec6","category":"Tech"}
