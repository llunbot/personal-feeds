This third generation road bike from the Czech framebuilder is a beautiful example of classic road bike looks updated with some of the cleanest integration and internal cable routing we’ve ever seen…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Repete R3: Reason neatly integrated modern steel road bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Repete-R3-Reason-fully-integrated-handmade-modern-steel-road-bike_clean-cockpit.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Repete-R3-Reason-fully-integrated-handmade-modern-steel-road-bike_clean-cockpit.jpg\" alt=\"Repete R3 Reason fully integrated handmade modern steel road bike, clean cockpit\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Repete-R3-Reason-fully-integrated-handmade-modern-steel-road-bike_clean-cockpit.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Repete-R3-Reason-fully-integrated-handmade-modern-steel-road-bike_clean-cockpit-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Repete-R3-Reason-fully-integrated-handmade-modern-steel-road-bike_clean-cockpit-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Repete-R3-Reason-fully-integrated-handmade-modern-steel-road-bike_clean-cockpit-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Repete-R3-Reason-fully-integrated-handmade-modern-steel-road-bike_clean-cockpit-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Repete-R3-Reason-fully-integrated-handmade-modern-steel-road-bike_clean-cockpit-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Repete-R3-Reason-fully-integrated-handmade-modern-steel-road-bike_clean-cockpit-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption><em>all photos by Cory Benson, c. Bikerumor</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A classic trope of perfected minimalism is that a design is complete when there is no unnecessary feature and detail that could be removed. Looking at the new Repete R3: Reason, this road bike is so smooth and sleek. There are clearly no extraneous details remaining.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve been following Repete since their first road bikes built in Prague back <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/found-repete-cycles-handmade-columbus-steel-frames-from-the-czech-republic/\" target=\"_blank\">almost a decade ago</a>. But they’d really stepped up their game around 2019. That’s when we got a <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/friday-roundup-repete-in-prague-sagans-secrets-bikepacking-prizes-more/\" target=\"_blank\">sneak peek</a> inside their updated workshop of what would become their 2nd generation <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/repete-cycles-repeats-with-new-designs-workshop-updated-steel-bikes-decode-custom-colors-more/\" target=\"_blank\">Reason road &amp; Verne gravel</a> bikes. But now Repete take their design and craftsmanship to the next level with this new generation three R3: Reason integrated road bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s new?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Repete-R3-Reason-fully-integrated-handmade-modern-steel-road-bike_angled-frameset.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Repete-R3-Reason-fully-integrated-handmade-modern-steel-road-bike_angled-frameset.jpg\" alt=\"Repete R3 Reason fully integrated handmade modern steel road bike, angled frameset\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Repete-R3-Reason-fully-integrated-handmade-modern-steel-road-bike_angled-frameset.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Repete-R3-Reason-fully-integrated-handmade-modern-steel-road-bike_angled-frameset-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Repete-R3-Reason-fully-integrated-handmade-modern-steel-road-bike_angled-frameset-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Repete-R3-Reason-fully-integrated-handmade-modern-steel-road-bike_angled-frameset-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Repete-R3-Reason-fully-integrated-handmade-modern-steel-road-bike_angled-frameset-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Repete-R3-Reason-fully-integrated-handmade-modern-steel-road-bike_angled-frameset-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to the 2nd gen road bike, Repete still welds and brazes the new Repete R3: Reason Prague, from top-tier lightweight Columbus Spirit HSS double-butted steel tubing. But now, fully integrated. Cables completely disappear. The seatpost clamp gets hidden away. A new removable CNC-machined braze-on front derailleur clamp makes 1x, 2x &amp; Di2 setups sleeker than ever. And even the water bottle bolt braze-ons are so low-profile that they blend into the tubes. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Repete-R3-Reason-fully-integrated-handmade-modern-steel-road-bike_hidden-internal-cables.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Repete-R3-Reason-fully-integrated-handmade-modern-steel-road-bike_hidden-internal-cables.jpg\" alt=\"Repete R3 Reason fully integrated handmade modern steel road bike, fully internal cable routing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Repete-R3-Reason-fully-integrated-handmade-modern-steel-road-bike_hidden-internal-cables.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Repete-R3-Reason-fully-integrated-handmade-modern-steel-road-bike_hidden-internal-cables-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Repete-R3-Reason-fully-integrated-handmade-modern-steel-road-bike_hidden-internal-cables-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Repete-R3-Reason-fully-integrated-handmade-modern-steel-road-bike_hidden-internal-cables-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Repete-R3-Reason-fully-integrated-handmade-modern-steel-road-bike_hidden-internal-cables-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Repete-R3-Reason-fully-integrated-handmade-modern-steel-road-bike_hidden-internal-cables-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Repete-R3-Reason-fully-integrated-handmade-modern-steel-road-bike_hidden-internal-cables-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To make the integrated routing and internal 1 1/8″ to 1.5″ tapered headset solution work, Repete welds a stainless cup for the upper bearing of the headset directly onto the top of the tapered Columbus headtube to create that multi-curve hourglass shape without losing the strength of the originally-drawn tube. It’s quite a bit more work that simply machining such a headtube, but Repete assures us it’s worth the hassle.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Repete-R3-Reason-fully-integrated-handmade-modern-steel-road-bike_hidden-seatpost-clamp.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Repete-R3-Reason-fully-integrated-handmade-modern-steel-road-bike_hidden-seatpost-clamp.jpg\" alt=\"Repete R3 Reason fully integrated handmade modern steel road bike, hidden seatpost clamp\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Repete-R3-Reason-fully-integrated-handmade-modern-steel-road-bike_hidden-seatpost-clamp.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Repete-R3-Reason-fully-integrated-handmade-modern-steel-road-bike_hidden-seatpost-clamp-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Repete-R3-Reason-fully-integrated-handmade-modern-steel-road-bike_hidden-seatpost-clamp-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Repete-R3-Reason-fully-integrated-handmade-modern-steel-road-bike_hidden-seatpost-clamp-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Repete-R3-Reason-fully-integrated-handmade-modern-steel-road-bike_hidden-seatpost-clamp-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Repete-R3-Reason-fully-integrated-handmade-modern-steel-road-bike_hidden-seatpost-clamp-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The seatpost clamp is a special treat. It utilizes a 3d-printed stainless steel element at the top of each of the seatstays that flows neatly into the back of the cut-away seattube. Then a stainless steel bolt tightens from the non-driveside to replaceable hardware tucked away inside. It’s such a clean modern adaptation of an integrated clamping concept you could find on classic steel bikes for decades.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, and at the same time, Repete gives the R3: Reason more tire clearance to take on rougher roads. Now there’s room for up to 35mm tires. While at the same time, they shave a couple millimeters off the already short chainstays.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech Details &amp; Geometry</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Repete-R3-Reason-fully-integrated-handmade-modern-steel-road-bike_flush-bottle-cage-bolts.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Repete-R3-Reason-fully-integrated-handmade-modern-steel-road-bike_flush-bottle-cage-bolts.jpg\" alt=\"Repete R3 Reason fully integrated handmade modern steel road bike, downtube with flush bottle cage bolts\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Repete-R3-Reason-fully-integrated-handmade-modern-steel-road-bike_flush-bottle-cage-bolts.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Repete-R3-Reason-fully-integrated-handmade-modern-steel-road-bike_flush-bottle-cage-bolts-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Repete-R3-Reason-fully-integrated-handmade-modern-steel-road-bike_flush-bottle-cage-bolts-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Repete-R3-Reason-fully-integrated-handmade-modern-steel-road-bike_flush-bottle-cage-bolts-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Repete-R3-Reason-fully-integrated-handmade-modern-steel-road-bike_flush-bottle-cage-bolts-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Repete-R3-Reason-fully-integrated-handmade-modern-steel-road-bike_flush-bottle-cage-bolts-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Repete-R3-Reason-fully-integrated-handmade-modern-steel-road-bike_flush-bottle-cage-bolts-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Repete-R3-Reason-fully-integrated-handmade-modern-steel-road-bike_flush-bottle-cage-bolts-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Repete R3: Reason is a performance road bike handbuilt in the Czech Republic from the best steel available.

But it’s great. Repete has the stainless steel dropouts of the Reason and the Verne, investment cast locally in the Czech Republic – about an hour from their workshop. For Repete, custom cast dropouts were core element of a proper handmade bicycle frame. And a bit of a symbol of success. So, they worked hard to make it happen. And then, they documented the process of development. So, they take us all along for the ride, all the way inside the foundry to the actual casting. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enjoy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://repete.cc/\" target=\"_blank\">Repete.cc</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/repete-r3-reason-integrated-modern-steel-road-bike/\">Repete’s New R3: Reason is the Cleanest Modern Steel Road Bike You’ve Ever Met</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"717eaf5679b83f0f8d46a3a1a06579028b2f0d6ebf9251f954e3d95712924ac7","category":"Cycling"}
