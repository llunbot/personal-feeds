And it’s even better than it’s on sale: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2023-iMac-Desktop-Computer/dp/B0CM5BFRND/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Amazon is selling all of its M3 iMac configurations for $150 off</a> right now, including <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-2023-iMac-Desktop-Computer/dp/B0CM5KBG3M/?th=1&amp;tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">our favorite with a 10-core GPU and 256GB of storage</a> for an all-time low of $1,399.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the coolest things about the iMac is the way it looks. Let’s be honest: having a super large screen that incorporates all that hardware can be handy. The 24-inch 4.5K Retina display is absolutely gorgeous, offering some 500 nits of brightness and 1 billion colors. Since this computer seeks to be the only thing you need on your desk, you should know a video camera is incorporated in the top bezel, delivering 1080p video.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Powered by Apple’s super fast M3 chip, the iMac lets you breeze through tasks. Whether you’re just playing around online or you’re actually working on something for your job, this computer has your back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon’s sale brings the least-expensive mode down to $1,150 featuring 8GB of memory, an 8-core GPU, and a 256GB SSD, which is great for light computing work. Our favorite configuration brings the GPU up to 10 cores, adds two USB 3 ports, and includes a Magic Keyboard with Touch ID and a power adapter with an Ethernet port. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2126614/24-inch-imac-m3-review.html\">reviewed the iMac 2023</a>, we found it’s a fantastic device with great CPU and GPU performance, and we loved it enough to give the iMac 4.5/5 stars and our Editors’ Choice award. “If you’re looking for a new, complete Mac setup– a computer, display, and input devices–the M3 iMac is a great choice.
