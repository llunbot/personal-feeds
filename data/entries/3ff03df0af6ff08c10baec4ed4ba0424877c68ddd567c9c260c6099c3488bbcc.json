Ready to mount all the latest SRAM AXS Transmission mountain bike derailleurs for a huge Eagle mullet range or the new 13-speed Red Xplr for a tighter gearing cluster, 3T’s road, fast gravel, adventure gravel, and even e-gravel frames can all get built up with the latest drivetrains…. and <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/3t-exploro-italia-gravel-bikes-upgraded-fully-internal-cable-routing/\" target=\"_blank\">fully integrated internal routing</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, 3T have already been shipping UDH-ready Racemax Italia gravel bikes for some time. Your bike may already be UDH-equipped, whether you noticed it or not!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>All made-in-Italy 3T Italia bikes go UDH</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/3T-Strada-Italia-aero-road-bike-with-UDH.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/3T-Strada-Italia-aero-road-bike-with-UDH.webp\" alt=\"3T Strada Italian made-in-Italy aero road bike with UDH for latest SRAM Red XPLR, up close\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/3T-Strada-Italia-aero-road-bike-with-UDH.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/3T-Strada-Italia-aero-road-bike-with-UDH-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/3T-Strada-Italia-aero-road-bike-with-UDH-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/3T-Strada-Italia-aero-road-bike-with-UDH-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/3T-Strada-Italia-aero-road-bike-with-UDH-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/3T)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Frankly, I didn’t think that 3T going UDH was all that newsworthy. I mean, we already reported on the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/3t-extrema-italia-gets-faster-gnarlier-for-gravel-bike-adventure-racing/\" target=\"_blank\">Extrema Italia</a> getting UDH more than a year ago, and the new <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2024-3t-strada-italia-aero-wide-tire-carbon-road-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">Strada Italia</a> getting it last spring. But even though the base-level <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/3t-racemax-gravel-bike-combines-integrale-upgrade-at-lower-prices-new-wpnt-colors/\" target=\"_blank\">RaceMax Integrale</a> finally got integrated cable routing a couple of months ago, it did not get UDH. But until now, the premium RaceMax Italia that was <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/3t-exploro-racemax-italia-exposes-raw-carbon-weave/\" target=\"_blank\">introduced two years ago</a> still hadn’t gotten a UDH upgrade. And reading our comments, it was clear that this was putting off a number of our readers for seriously considering this otherwise versatile, and frankly trailblazing gravel bike platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So now it’s here. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Special-EVO-edition-3T-Exploro-RaceMax-Italia-EVO_All-made-in-Italy-3T-Italia-bikes-go-UDH.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Special-EVO-edition-3T-Exploro-RaceMax-Italia-EVO_All-made-in-Italy-3T-Italia-bikes-go-UDH.webp\" alt=\"3T RaceMax Italia EVO made-in-Italy carbon gravel bike gets UDH, angled\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Special-EVO-edition-3T-Exploro-RaceMax-Italia-EVO_All-made-in-Italy-3T-Italia-bikes-go-UDH.webp 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Special-EVO-edition-3T-Exploro-RaceMax-Italia-EVO_All-made-in-Italy-3T-Italia-bikes-go-UDH-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Special-EVO-edition-3T-Exploro-RaceMax-Italia-EVO_All-made-in-Italy-3T-Italia-bikes-go-UDH-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Special-EVO-edition-3T-Exploro-RaceMax-Italia-EVO_All-made-in-Italy-3T-Italia-bikes-go-UDH-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Special-EVO-edition-3T-Exploro-RaceMax-Italia-EVO_All-made-in-Italy-3T-Italia-bikes-go-UDH-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Special-EVO-edition-3T-Exploro-RaceMax-Italia-EVO_All-made-in-Italy-3T-Italia-bikes-go-UDH-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>UDH on all made-in-Italy 3T Italian frames for SRAM direct mount / full mount / T-type transmission derailleur compatibility, plus of course backward compatibility with every other rear derailleur, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Actually, it’s apparently been here for quite some time. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Special edition 3T Exploro Racemax Italia EVO</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/3T-RaceMax-Italia-EVOin-extra-virgin-olive-oil-green_All-made-in-Italy-3T-Italia-bikes-go-UDH_Red-XPLR-build.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/3T-RaceMax-Italia-EVOin-extra-virgin-olive-oil-green_All-made-in-Italy-3T-Italia-bikes-go-UDH_Red-XPLR-build.webp\" alt=\"3T RaceMax Italia EVO made-in-Italy carbon gravel bike gets UDH, special extra-virgin olive oil edition\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/3T-RaceMax-Italia-EVOin-extra-virgin-olive-oil-green_All-made-in-Italy-3T-Italia-bikes-go-UDH_Red-XPLR-build.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/3T-RaceMax-Italia-EVOin-extra-virgin-olive-oil-green_All-made-in-Italy-3T-Italia-bikes-go-UDH_Red-XPLR-build-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/3T-RaceMax-Italia-EVOin-extra-virgin-olive-oil-green_All-made-in-Italy-3T-Italia-bikes-go-UDH_Red-XPLR-build-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/3T-RaceMax-Italia-EVOin-extra-virgin-olive-oil-green_All-made-in-Italy-3T-Italia-bikes-go-UDH_Red-XPLR-build-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/3T-RaceMax-Italia-EVOin-extra-virgin-olive-oil-green_All-made-in-Italy-3T-Italia-bikes-go-UDH_Red-XPLR-build-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So about that bright green gravel bike that brings us the UDH news… 3T debuted this bike at Velofollies in Belgium over the weekend, claiming its bright color reveals tones and reflections reminiscent of extra-virgin olive oil. So, the special EVO edition stands for <em>extra-virgin olive</em>, not some kind of <em>evo</em>lution. It’s simply the first new model to highlight the shift to UDH. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yes, all other made-in-Italy filament-wound Racemax Italia colors, builds, and framesets are now UDH-ready, from this point forward. In fact, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The limited edition olive oil gravel bike comes spec’d with a new SRAM Red XPLR AXS groupset, the ultra-wide Zipp 303 XPLR SW wheels, 3T’s own made-in-Italy Torno cranks, plus their More Integrale stem &amp; Aeroghiaia Integrale LTD flared carbon bar. That makes for a high premium $12,000 / 12,000€ pricetag +/- depending on your market. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/3T-Exploro-RaceMax-Italia-XXX-made-in-Italy-gravel-bike-with-new-raw-carbon-weave-finish_dry-filament-wound-fiber.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/3T-Exploro-RaceMax-Italia-XXX-made-in-Italy-gravel-bike-with-new-raw-carbon-weave-finish_dry-filament-wound-fiber.jpg\" alt=\"3T Exploro RaceMax Italia XXX made-in-Italy gravel bike with new raw carbon weave finish, filament-wound fibers\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/3T-Exploro-RaceMax-Italia-XXX-made-in-Italy-gravel-bike-with-new-raw-carbon-weave-finish_dry-filament-wound-fiber.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/3T-Exploro-RaceMax-Italia-XXX-made-in-Italy-gravel-bike-with-new-raw-carbon-weave-finish_dry-filament-wound-fiber-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/3T-Exploro-RaceMax-Italia-XXX-made-in-Italy-gravel-bike-with-new-raw-carbon-weave-finish_dry-filament-wound-fiber-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/3T-Exploro-RaceMax-Italia-XXX-made-in-Italy-gravel-bike-with-new-raw-carbon-weave-finish_dry-filament-wound-fiber-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/3T-Exploro-RaceMax-Italia-XXX-made-in-Italy-gravel-bike-with-new-raw-carbon-weave-finish_dry-filament-wound-fiber-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/3T-Exploro-RaceMax-Italia-XXX-made-in-Italy-gravel-bike-with-new-raw-carbon-weave-finish_dry-filament-wound-fiber-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/3T-Exploro-RaceMax-Italia-XXX-made-in-Italy-gravel-bike-with-new-raw-carbon-weave-finish_dry-filament-wound-fiber-400x225.jpg 400w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you’d prefer the Project X raw finish to show the unique 3T Italia construction, that’s also a possibility with this same build.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Is your current 3T Racemax Italia already UDH?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/3T-Italia-UDH-detail.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/3T-Italia-UDH-detail.webp\" alt=\"All made-in-Italy 3T Italia bikes go UDH, derailleur hanger detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/3T-Italia-UDH-detail.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/3T-Italia-UDH-detail-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/3T-Italia-UDH-detail-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/3T-Italia-UDH-detail-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/3T-Italia-UDH-detail-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/3T-Italia-UDH-detail-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/3T-Italia-UDH-detail-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While the EVO green ones and all future ones are sure, 3T has already been shipping UDH-ready Racemax Italia bikes since late last year – in the standard red, white, green, or raw carbon Project X finishes, too.
