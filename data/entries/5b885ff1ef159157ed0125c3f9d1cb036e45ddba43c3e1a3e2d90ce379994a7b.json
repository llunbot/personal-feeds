They are a highly personal piece of kit (probably the most, IMO), and once you find a match – you stick with it. Specialized’s Phenom is the go-to saddle for many on and off-road athletes. It was my favorite saddle until the Power saddle arrived on the scene. However, the newly minted Specialized Phenom Pro gives a new twist on an old favorite, making it the newest to receive the Mirror treatment.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-press-black-.webp\"><img width=\"960\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-press-black-.webp\" alt=\"Specialized Phenom Pro Mirror Saddle press black\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-press-black-.webp 960w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-press-black--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-press-black--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-press-black--768x432.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo: Specialized)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Specialized Phenom Pro with Mirror</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We see Specialized add some extra features to their saddles with updates like Elaston and carbon rails, but the most impactful is the Mirror upgrade.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-nose--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-nose--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Specialized Phenom Pro Mirror Saddle nose\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-nose--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-nose--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-nose--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-nose--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-nose--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-nose--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-nose--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo: Jordan Villella/BikeRumor.com)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>What is Mirror?</em></strong> Mirror technology boasts a 3D-printed matrix with 20,055 struts and 8,735 nodes in the place of traditional padding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>What does that mean?</strong> </em>It’s a 3D-printed saddle padding that helps evenly distribute weight over the full saddle, with uniquely designed padded areas that provide more or less support.

I’m a big fan of the feel, but it’s not for everyone. The Phenom Pro (hollow-titanium-railed) with Mirror claims to reduce sit bone pressure by up to 28% (most Specialized Mirror saddles boast this claim) while optimizing blood flow and protecting soft tissue. That means less pain, more performance, and more fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-press-.webp\"><img width=\"960\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-press-.webp\" alt=\"Specialized Phenom Pro Mirror Saddle press\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-press-.webp 960w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-press--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-press--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-press--768x432.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo: Specialized)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Comfort Equals Power</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Designed for maximum rider movement, the Phenom Pro with Mirror measures 27cm long, allowing riders to shift positions without restriction. I think of the Phenom as an “<a href=\"https://www.specialized.com/us/en/romin-evo-pro-with-mirror/p/1000148714?color=1000148716-1000148714\">Off-Road Romin</a>“, granting the rider some ability to edge forward on climbs while still feeling locked in. The Specialized Phenom Pro with Mirror is available in two widths (155mm and 143mm) to fine-tune your fit.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-DH-Bruni.webp\"><img width=\"960\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-DH-Bruni.webp\" alt=\"Specialized Phenom Pro Mirror Saddle DH Bruni\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-DH-Bruni.webp 960w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-DH-Bruni-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-DH-Bruni-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-DH-Bruni-768x432.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo: Specialized)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Not Just for the Spandex Crowd</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Comfort doesn’t mean fragile. The concave shell gives the Mirror padding more thickness without adding bulk, while the construction is designed to handle everything from World Tour racing to full-send DH runs. Plus, it seems to be the saddle of choice for multi-time downhill world champion Loïc Bruni.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The Phenom Pro Mirror is my new favorite saddle. I can move around easily, and it’s super comfortable and durable, making it a perfect fit for my trail and DH bikes. I’m stoked I got to help test and shape this saddle and finally see it come to life!” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>— Loïc Bruni, 6x DH World Champion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-weight--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-weight--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Specialized Phenom Pro Mirror Saddle weight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-weight--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-weight--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-weight--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-weight--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-weight--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-weight--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-weight--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo: Jordan Villella/BikeRumor.com)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech Details – Specialized Phenom Pro with Mirror </h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Saddle Length</strong>: 27cm</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Available Widths:</strong> 148mm, and 155mm</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Weight: </strong>257g, 148mm</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Availability: </strong>Now </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> $325.00</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-press-on-bike-.webp\"><img width=\"960\" height=\"540\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-press-on-bike-.webp\" alt=\"Specialized Phenom Pro Mirror Saddle press on bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-press-on-bike-.webp 960w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-press-on-bike--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-press-on-bike--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-press-on-bike--768x432.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo: Specialized)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>First Impressions:</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s been a while since I’ve ridden a <a href=\"https://www.specialized.com/us/en/phenom-comp/p/156636?color=233022-156636\">Phenom saddle</a>. As mentioned above, I switched to the Power around 2016 and never looked back. However, preferences change as time passes, and it was good to get back on a Phenom, especially on the mountain bike. When I left the Phenom, the only option was the PU foam Level 2 padding design. It was great at the time, but I remember wanting more of a cradle or perch, and the Power scratched that itch.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Specialized-Project-Black-prototype-S-Works-Phenom-with-Mirrr-saddle_Soudal-Quick-Step-Retul-fitting.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Specialized-Project-Black-prototype-S-Works-Phenom-with-Mirrr-saddle_Soudal-Quick-Step-Retul-fitting.jpg\" alt=\"Specialized Project Black S-Works Mirror prototype 3D-printed saddle, Retul fit testing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Specialized-Project-Black-prototype-S-Works-Phenom-with-Mirrr-saddle_Soudal-Quick-Step-Retul-fitting.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Specialized-Project-Black-prototype-S-Works-Phenom-with-Mirrr-saddle_Soudal-Quick-Step-Retul-fitting-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Specialized-Project-Black-prototype-S-Works-Phenom-with-Mirrr-saddle_Soudal-Quick-Step-Retul-fitting-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Specialized-Project-Black-prototype-S-Works-Phenom-with-Mirrr-saddle_Soudal-Quick-Step-Retul-fitting-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Specialized-Project-Black-prototype-S-Works-Phenom-with-Mirrr-saddle_Soudal-Quick-Step-Retul-fitting-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Specialized-Project-Black-prototype-S-Works-Phenom-with-Mirrr-saddle_Soudal-Quick-Step-Retul-fitting-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Specialized-Project-Black-prototype-S-Works-Phenom-with-Mirrr-saddle_Soudal-Quick-Step-Retul-fitting-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/specialized-2023-project-black-prototypes/\">Specialized Project Black </a>S-Works Mirror prototype 3D-printed saddle, Retul fit testing.

The 3D Mirror material cradles much more than the PU foam.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-nose-close-upper--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-nose-close-upper--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Specialized Phenom Pro Mirror Saddle nose close upper\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-nose-close-upper--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-nose-close-upper--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-nose-close-upper--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-nose-close-upper--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-nose-close-upper--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-nose-close-upper--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-nose-close-upper--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo: Jordan Villella/BikeRumor.com)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a rider who likes to move up on the nose slightly when on climbs or trying to squeeze every ounce of Power out, you’ll be able to do that on the new Phenom Mirror saddle. The shape allows for ease of movement without feeling stuck on the saddle (sometimes 3D-printed saddles can feel that way).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-close-up--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-close-up--scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-close-up--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-close-up--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-close-up--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-close-up--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-close-up--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-close-up--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo: Jordan Villella/BikeRumor.com)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Phenom’s comfort levels are high, and it’s very noticeable off-road or on anything with slight bumps. It feels like a bit of suspension (without overselling) —it’s a good feeling. The nose is extra sculpted, with more relief areas that grant extra support—not as much as the Mimic padding, but somewhere between that and the OG level 2 padding.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-back--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-back--scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-back--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-back--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-back--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-back--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-back--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-back--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-back--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo: Jordan Villella/BikeRumor.com)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Setup and Dial-in</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Setup for the 3D Mirror saddles can be tricky, and I found this to be the same with the Phenom. My default -2 deg felt like too much. This is due to the extra suppleness of the 3D padding, which causes a sensation of slipping. So, for the Mirror (and any other 3D-printed saddles), I run them a degree up from my default position.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-side--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-side--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Specialized Phenom Pro Mirror Saddle side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-side--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-side--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-side--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-side--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-side--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-side--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-side--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo: Jordan Villella/BikeRumor.com)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Having the hollow titanium rails is a nice touch. It keeps the price slightly lower than the S-Works version of the Mirror saddles. It also keeps the seatpost options open, which is nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was happy with the sensations on my rides with the Phenom Pro Mirror. Once I got the position dialed, I had zero issues with posterior pain or hot spots. I did, however, run into some “non-compatible shorts” that seemed to make a slight squeak when on the saddle. There is something about the 3D-printed Mirror material and shorts with a slight tooth, but I’ve learned to keep those bibs in the drawer when riding this saddle.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-top--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-top--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Specialized Phenom Pro Mirror Saddle top\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-top--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-top--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-top--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-top--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-top--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-top--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Specialized-Phenom-Pro-Mirror-Saddle-top--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo:Jordan Villella/BikeRumor.com)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, my experience with the Phenom Pro Mirror was excellent. I don’t know if I can trade it in for my Power anytime soon, but it’s on the shortlist.
