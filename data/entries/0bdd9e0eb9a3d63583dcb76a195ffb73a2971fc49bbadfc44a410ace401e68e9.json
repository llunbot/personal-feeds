These are expected to be priced at $1,499 USD. The 167.5mm crankset with the 5DEV 8-Bolt T-Type chainring weighs a claimed 596 grams.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/5dev-titanium-crankset-transmission-quarq-powermeter.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"437\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/5dev-titanium-crankset-transmission-quarq-powermeter-800x437.jpg\" alt=\"5dev enduro mtb crankset titanium machined cranks arms\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/5dev-titanium-crankset-transmission-quarq-powermeter-800x437.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/5dev-titanium-crankset-transmission-quarq-powermeter-297x162.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/5dev-titanium-crankset-transmission-quarq-powermeter-120x65.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/5dev-titanium-crankset-transmission-quarq-powermeter-768x419.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/5dev-titanium-crankset-transmission-quarq-powermeter-1536x838.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/5dev-titanium-crankset-transmission-quarq-powermeter.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>5DEV does offer 7075-T651 aluminum cranks and eCranks at a rather more palatable price point. Machined from billet, these crank arms see less ornate machining but are still head turners. The 5DEV aluminum eCranks for EP8, Specialized, TQ, Bosch and Brose motors retail at $449 USD, while the cranks for trail and enduro mountain bikes are yours for $559 USD. There’s also a less flashy looking DH/Freeride crankset at $349 USD.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/5DEV-Gravel-Cranks-in-with-the-new.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/5DEV-Gravel-Cranks-in-with-the-new-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"5DEV Gravel Cranks in with the new\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/5DEV-Gravel-Cranks-in-with-the-new-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/5DEV-Gravel-Cranks-in-with-the-new-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/5DEV-Gravel-Cranks-in-with-the-new-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/5DEV-Gravel-Cranks-in-with-the-new-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/5DEV-Gravel-Cranks-in-with-the-new-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/5DEV-Gravel-Cranks-in-with-the-new.jpeg 1280w\" /></a><figcaption>There’s a gravel option, too; check out Ron’s <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/5dev-factory-tour-cnc-machined-gravel-mtb-crankset-review-made-in-the-usa/#:~:text=The%20cranks%20don't%20feel,And%20they%20look%20amazing.\" target=\"_blank\">review here</a>, with bonus <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/5dev-factory-tour-cnc-machined-gravel-mtb-crankset-review-made-in-the-usa/#:~:text=The%20cranks%20don't%20feel,And%20they%20look%20amazing.\" target=\"_blank\">Factory Tour</a></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All 5DEV cranksets and other components are machined in San Diego, California.
