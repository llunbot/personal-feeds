Apple says the program is designed for anyone with \"experience repairing electronic devices,\" but says the \"vast majority\" of customers are better off visiting an Apple Store or Apple Authorized Service Provider.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple also announced that customers can now complete the post-repair System Configuration process by placing the device into Diagnostics Mode and following the on-screen prompts. Users no longer need to contact the program's support team to complete this step, which verifies that the parts are genuine and working properly.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"Running System Configuration after a repair authenticates genuine Apple parts, updates firmware, and calibrates parts to ensure maximum performance and quality,\" says Apple. \"Additionally, for repairs involving biometric authentication, such as Touch ID or Face ID, System Configuration links the biometric sensors to the Secure Enclave on the logic board to ensure device security and customer privacy.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLast, Apple said it is expanding the program to Mac desktops with M1 series chips in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, Sweden, and the U.K., and making parts available for the TrueDepth camera and top speaker on iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 models.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14-pro/\">iPhone 14 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/self-service-repair/\">Self Service Repair</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-14\">iPhone 14 (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-14-Pro\">iPhone 14 Pro (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/20/apple-expands-self-service-repair-program/\">Apple Expanding Self-Service Repair Program to iPhone 14 Lineup and More Macs</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-expanding-self-service-repair-program-to-iphone-14-lineup-and-more-macs.2393610/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a1019435f1edd2b5da2a136c25adea94a4af6617c71a4ec9e2ab6769319a8192","category":"Apple"}
