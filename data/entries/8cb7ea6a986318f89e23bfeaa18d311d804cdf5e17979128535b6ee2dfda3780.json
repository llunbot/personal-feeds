{"title":"Pulitzer-Prize-Winner Ann Telnaes Quits the Washington Post After Editors Nix Cartoon Mocking Bezos (and His Tech/Media Mogul Cohorts) for Paying Fealty to Trump","link":"https://anntelnaes.substack.com/p/why-im-quitting-the-washington-post","date":1736032193000,"content":"\n<p>Ann Telnaes, from her personal site (<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2024/11/regarding_and_well_against_substack\">alas</a>) on Substack:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I’ve worked for the Washington Post since 2008 as an editorial\ncartoonist. I have had editorial feedback and productive\nconversations — and some differences — about cartoons I have\nsubmitted for publication, but in all that time I’ve never had a\ncartoon killed because of who or what I chose to aim my pen at.\nUntil now.</p>\n\n<p>The cartoon that was killed criticizes the billionaire tech and\nmedia chief executives who have been doing their best to curry\nfavor with incoming President-elect Trump. There have been\nmultiple articles recently about these men with lucrative\ngovernment contracts and an interest in eliminating regulations\nmaking their way to Mar-a-lago. The group in the cartoon included\nMark Zuckerberg/Facebook &amp; Meta founder and CEO, Sam Altman/OpenAI\nCEO, Patrick Soon-Shiong/LA Times publisher, the Walt Disney\nCompany/ABC News, and Jeff Bezos/Washington Post owner. [...]</p>\n\n<p>As an editorial cartoonist, my job is to hold powerful people and\ninstitutions accountable. For the first time, my editor prevented\nme from doing that critical job. So I have decided to leave the\nPost. I doubt my decision will cause much of a stir and that it\nwill be dismissed because I’m just a cartoonist. But I will not\nstop holding truth to power through my cartooning, because as they\nsay, “Democracy dies in darkness”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The only thing wrong with the cartoon is that she drew it too soon <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/03/allen-tim-cook-1m-trump-inauguration\">to include Tim Cook</a>. The cartoon isn’t even particularly scathing. I’d describe it as tame even. It shows these moguls as offering money to Trump — which they are! What a bizarre decision by Telnaes’s editors. It’d be like me getting offended if someone drew a cartoon that showed me <a href=\"https://gruber.micro.blog/2025/01/04/nfl-week-picks.html\">wasting money betting on the Dallas Cowboys</a>. If the shoe fits you have to wear it.</p>\n\n<p>This isn’t a sign that the Washington Post has taken another turn for the worse. It’s simply proof of what many of us wrote before the election, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2024/10/profiles_in_cowardice_bezos_lewis_washington_post\">when Bezos kiboshed the Post editorial board’s endorsement of Kamala Harris</a>. In one fell swoop that decision collapsed the entirety of The Washington Post’s editorial integrity. This Telnaes fiasco is just more proof. More will follow <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2024/12/journalism_requires_owners_committed_to_the_cause\">until Bezos sells</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/04/telnaes-washington-post\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"8cb7ea6a986318f89e23bfeaa18d311d804cdf5e17979128535b6ee2dfda3780","category":"Tech"}
