{"title":"For $50,000, you can buy 14 Vision Pro headsets–or a pair of Apple sneakers","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2009045/sothebys-ultra-rare-apple-sneakers-50000.html","date":1690399126000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>The 1990s were a strange time for Apple, marked by the launch of its first PDA, a failed gaming console, a wacky camera, and of course, the iconic iMac. But perhaps nothing is stranger than a pair of Omega Sports sneakers adorned with the Apple logo–and you can now own a pair.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/fashion/sneaker/_Omega-Sports-Apple-Computer-Sneakers-or-Size-10.5&amp;xcust=1-1-2009045-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Sotheby’s Auction House</a> is selling the sneakers as an immediate purchase for $50,000 and describes them as “one of the most obscure in existence and highly coveted on the resale market.” While Apple had a brief line of clothing in the mid-80s, these shoes were never sold to customers but were rather a “one-time giveaway at a National Sales Conference,” according to Sotheby’s. It’s not clear how many pairs of shoes were made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sneakers themselves are somewhat unremarkable, with an all-white design adorned with a rainbow Apple logo on the tongue and sides. Sotheby’s says the shoes are new-in-box but the condition “is consistent with age, imperfections include yellowing around the midsoles and glue, and light marks on the toe boxes.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The description says more than 22,000 Apple consumers purchased clothing and accessories from the brand in 1985 before the line was retired. Apple still sells a selection of shirts and accessories at its Apple Park campus for visitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shipping is free but the buyer will need to pay local sales tax on the purchase, which will add a couple thousand bucks to the total. But anyone spending $50,000 on a pair of sneakers probably won’t mind.</p>\n\nApple Inc</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"fd3fa7697d060f3b1328d2dcf80f82f08c4cf0d62b2fca271ac4c3709cc4f131","category":"Apple"}
