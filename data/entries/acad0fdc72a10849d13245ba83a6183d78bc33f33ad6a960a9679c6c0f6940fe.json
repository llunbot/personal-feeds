It claims to have achieved supple small-bump performance with a supportive mid-stroke and a progressive bottom-out.</p>\n<p>The aim of all this is to produce a “trail bike that punches way above bikes with more [travel]”.</p>\n<h2>One Ride geometry</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Forbidden Druid V2 has updated geometry.</span></figcaption><span> <i>James Vincent / Forbidden Bike Company</i></span></div>\n<p>One Ride encapsulates Forbidden’s aim to deliver a consistent ride feel across all its sizes.</p>\n<p>By having size-specific front and rear centres, the rider’s weight distribution is identical across sizes, meaning riders of all heights will benefit from the same handling and performance.</p>\n<p>The Druid V2’s chainstays grow from 423 to 466mm through the size range. The effective seat tube angle remains consistent too, ensuring taller riders also benefit from a comfortable pedalling position.</p>\n<p>Compared to the original Druid, the head angle has been slackened by half a degree (29in configuration). The rear centre has also grown considerably on all sizes, from 438mm to 452mm in size S3, and the reach has been stretched by 15mm across the range.</p>\n<div>\n                <table><colgroup><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>Size</th><th>S1 (MX/29)</th><th>S2 (MX/29)</th><th>S3 (MX/29)</th><th>S4 (MX/29)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><b>Reach</b> (mm)</td><td>435/440</td><td>455/460</td><td>475/480</td><td>495/500</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Stack</b> (mm)</td><td>614/610</td><td>627/624</td><td>641/637</td><td>654/651</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Top tube length</b> (mm)</td><td>582/581</td><td>605/604</td><td>628/627</td><td>651/650</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Seat tube length</b> (mm)</td><td>400</td><td>420</td><td>440</td><td>470</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Seat tube angle</b> (degrees)</td><td>76.6/77</td><td>76.6/77</td><td>76.6/77</td><td>76.6/77</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Head tube length</b> (mm)</td><td>90</td><td>105</td><td>120</td><td>135</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Head tube angle</b> (degrees)</td><td>64.5/65</td><td>64.5/65</td><td>64.5/65</td><td>64.5/65</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Front centre</b> (mm)</td><td>754</td><td>781</td><td>807</td><td>833</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Rear centre</b> (mm)</td><td>423</td><td>437</td><td>452</td><td>466</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>Wheelbase</b> (mm)</td><td>1,177</td><td>1,218</td><td>1,259</td><td>1,299</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>BB drop</b></td><td>-29/-35</td><td>29/-35</td><td>29/-35</td><td>29/-35</td>        </tr><tr><td><b>BB height</b></td><td>332/337</td><td>32/337</td><td>32/337</td><td>32/337</td>        </tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n<h2>Forbidden Druid V2 spec and pricing</h2>\n<p>The Forbidden Druid V2 is available in three builds and a frame-only option.

The centre of the bike effectively moves further forward as it compresses, which causes you to lean back instinctively.</p>\n<p>Once accustomed, you can drive the front wheel harder and more confidently. If you want to break traction or flick it about, that’s also possible, but it does require more effort compared to shorter bikes.</p>\n<p>The frame has a muted and damped feel, no doubt helped by the suspension’s action and impressive Crankbrothers Synthesis wheels.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> It felt well damped and absorbent in rough terrain.</span></figcaption><span> <i>James Vincent / Forbidden Bike Company</i></span></div>\n<p>Along with its smooth, plush-feeling rear end, it feels like it has more travel than its headline figure suggests; there’s plenty of grip and control on tap.</p>\n<p>Small to medium bumps are eaten up proficiently and it enters its mid-stroke support smoothly, cushioning impacts.</p>\n<p>However, set with 35 per cent sag, I tended to use most of its travel frequently, relying on the rear shock’s hydraulic bottom-out.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Performance was improved with slightly less sag.</span></figcaption><span> <i>James Vincent / Forbidden Bike Company</i></span></div>\n<p>Decreasing sag to 29 per cent boosted its mid-stroke performance and reduced how much travel it uses, aiding control.</p>\n<p>The Maxxis Assegai front and DHR II rear tyres have suitable tread patterns, but the EXO casing MaxxTerra front is under-gunned for the Druid’s potential.
