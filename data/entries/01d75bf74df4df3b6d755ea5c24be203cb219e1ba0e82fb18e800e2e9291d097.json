{"title":"Standing in the shadows of greatness - capturing a stunning Grand Départ in Florence","link":"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/standing-in-the-shadows-of-greatness","date":1719738204000,"content":"\n      <p>It is hard to imagine the thunder of a sea of screaming fans, or the visual power of the <a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/pages/tour-de-france\">Tour de France</a> peloton passing through the Piazza del Duomo in the heart of Florence. Simply put, the combination offered an unprecedented sense of grandeur rarely seen or felt in a bicycle race, or any sport for that matter.</p>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<p>Since the Tour de France announced its Grand Départ in Florence, I dreamed of getting a shot of the pack passing in front of this mesmerising cathedral that is the crowning jewel of this Renaissance city. But while most pictures only take a split-second to create, some, like today’s shot, can take hours to prepare.</p>\n<p>Already in the days leading up to the official start on Saturday, I spent hours attempting to understand exactly where the race would pass and how I could best position myself.</p>\n<p>Riding around the city on Friday, I spotted a window just above the corner where the riders would turn before rolling in front of the Duomo. I finally located the shop, Raspini, a small but deluxe fashion store. Gildet, the shop owner, proved to be most hospitable, and after leading me upstairs to study the exact perspective, agreed that I could come on Saturday.</p>\n<p>Needless to say, I arrived early. But now the Tour was only hours away. Barriers had been installed overnight to guide the riders through, and the crowd was intense.</p>\n<p>They cheered the publicity caravan, not to mention every team car that passed, while a fruit vendor struggled to push his cart through the crowded sidewalk.</p>\n<p>But nothing matched the rapture of the fans when the Tour actually passed. I sat in my window shooting as many frames as I possibly could before the last rider passed, and when they finally did, I simply stopped and tried to reflect on what had just happened. I felt that I had just stood in the shadows of greatness. And it won’t be a moment I will likely forget any time soon. Vive le Tour!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/Rouleur_StaffBanners_desktop_JamesStartt_1024x1024.jpg?v=1719329314\" /></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Rouleur Media","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"01d75bf74df4df3b6d755ea5c24be203cb219e1ba0e82fb18e800e2e9291d097","category":"Cycling"}
