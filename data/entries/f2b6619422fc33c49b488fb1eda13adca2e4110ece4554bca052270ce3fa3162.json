Users can filter and sort their accounts based on various criteria, such as recently created accounts, credential type, or membership in shared groups. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nPasswords is also compatible with Windows via the ‌iCloud‌ for Windows app, extending its utility to users who operate across different platforms. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe developer beta versions of ‌iOS 18‌, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia are available today with official release to the public scheduled for the fall, providing an early look at the Passwords app.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud-keychain/\">iCloud Keychain</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/apple-introduces-standalone-passwords-app/\">Apple Introduces Standalone 'Passwords' App</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-introduces-standalone-passwords-app.2428694/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f2b6619422fc33c49b488fb1eda13adca2e4110ece4554bca052270ce3fa3162","category":"Apple"}
