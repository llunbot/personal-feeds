{"title":"Ivory for Mac","link":"https://tapbots.com/ivory/mac/","date":1685150771000,"content":"\n<p>Now shipping in the Mac App Store: Tapbots’s Ivory for Mac. I’ve been using it in beta for a few months, and don’t know what I’d do without it. It’s not just the best Mac Mastodon client, it’s the only good one that exists. $15/year just for the Mac client, but the real deal is Ivory’s $25/year “universal” subscription for Ivory across both MacOS and and iOS.</p>\n\n<p>Ivory for Mac is written using Catalyst, but it by no means is just Ivory for iPad with a few tweaks. (If that’s what it were, Tapbots could have shipped it months ago, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/01/24/ivory-1\">when Ivory for iPhone and iPad shipped</a>.) Ivory for Mac is a Mac app. But, numerous Catalyst-isms show through. System-wide Services menu items don’t work. Smart punctuation (automatic curly quotes and proper em-dashes when you type two hyphens) only work when you type slowly. Some views scroll via standard keyboard shortcuts (space/shift-space, Page Up/Page Down), but some don’t. A lot of these are things that I consider shortcomings in Apple’s Catalyst framework — the whole point of Cocoa from 20+ years ago is that standard controls get standard behavior out of the box, alleviating developers from the drudgery of making simple expected platform-standard features work. Catalyst isn’t like that — or at least isn’t like that yet.</p>\n\n<p>But this is Ivory for Mac 1.0. Progress during beta testing was steady, and knowing Tapbots’s high standards, I’m quite sure will continue to be. And on the whole, Ivory for Mac as it stands today is not just a glass of ice water in hell, it’s a whole pitcher. If you use Mastodon on a Mac, you’re nuts if you don’t try Ivory.</p>\n\n<p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/reviews/ivory-for-mac-review-tapbots-superb-mastodon-client-comes-to-apple-desktops-and-laptops/\">John Voorhees’s review at MacStories</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/26/ivory-for-mac\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f311a7c94b929d118b19921dd249edd1e1c757bdc650222546978b0c52756df7","category":"Tech"}
