Now going on the third year in a row, we sat down and discussed the nearly 20 different sports and fitness wearables that have been released over the course of the year. While this might have seemed like a quiet year, once in the rearview mirror it’s just as busy as any other on the watch and wearable front.</p>\n<p>Last year’s video has <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nx_JRh7_7s\">sailed past 410,000 views</a>, while the previous edition in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AX1xUy0K6PU\">2019 has more than 330,000 views</a>. As usual, we talk through what worked well, what didn’t work, and how we think things might change going forward (both at the product level and industry level). Also, a fire extinguisher was brought out at one point.</p>\n<p>We filmed for a minute shy of 2 hours, but Des has cleaned up all our inappropriate jokes to give you the easy to find version below. Of course, since the point of the video is to discuss all these units, we’ve made it easy for ya to find the parts of the discussion you’re most interested in, here’s the quick and easy legend (you can click on any of these links to skip right to it). Also, you can drag along within the video up above, and it’ll show the YouTube chapters with those same markers.
