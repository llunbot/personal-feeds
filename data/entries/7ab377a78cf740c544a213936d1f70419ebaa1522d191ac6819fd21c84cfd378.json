This will be more than twice the size of the fleet of the next-largest commercial geostationary satellite operator.</p>\n<p>The problem is that demand is waning for communication services through large geostationary (GEO) satellites. There are some large entrenched customers, like video media companies and the military, that will continue to buy telecom capacity on geostationary satellites. But there's a growing demand among consumers, and some segments of the corporate and government markets, for the types of services offered by constellations of smaller satellites flying closer to Earth.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020892#p3\">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2020892&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7ab377a78cf740c544a213936d1f70419ebaa1522d191ac6819fd21c84cfd378","category":"Tech"}
