{"title":"Best iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro cases: What to buy and what to avoid","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/541224/iphone-13-and-13-pro-cases-best-cases.html","date":1636064229000,"content":"<div>\n<section><div></div></section><p>There are just <em>too many</em> iPhone cases in the world. I mean, we get it…they’re inexpensive to manufacture with a big markup, and the potential market is in the tens of millions with each new iPhone generation. Nearly everybody puts <em>some</em> kind of case on their phone because it’s just too easy to scuff, scratch, or shatter that thousand-dollar pocket supercomputer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what case should you buy? Are they all essentially the same, and you should just buy the one that looks the way you want at a good price? Or are some cases really truly better than others? We got a few <em>dozen</em> cases in to put them to the test, so we could recommend products based on more than just their web photos. So if you don’t see anything that strikes your fancy just yet, stay tuned because we’ll be adding to it as we test more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Update 11/04/21:</strong> We’ve added several more case reviews to our roundup.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What to look for when buying an iPhone case</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously, the aesthetics of a case are critical. Really, your iPhone isn’t going to look like what Apple designed, it’s going to look like the case you stuck it in. But case design is a very personal thing, so we’re not going to pass judgment on it. You know what you like, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from a case’s look, there are several other important factors worth considering. Here’s what we looked for with every case we tested.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Craftsmanship:</strong> We can’t really test longevity without using each case for several months at least, but we <em>can</em> tell you if it fits precisely, if the seams and gaps have tight tolerances, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Buttons/Cutouts:</strong> It’s surprising how many cases have really stiff and hard-to-press buttons, or whose buttons don’t line up exactly right. Cases with cut-outs instead of buttons need them to be the right size and shape for comfortable and reliable operation. And while it’s not technically a “button,” the cutout for operating the iPhone 13’s mute switch is of critical importance, as are the cutouts for the Lightning port and speakers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Charging:</strong> Some cases (like wallet cases) aren’t even meant to work with wireless chargers, and that’s fine. But for those that are, we try it out on several wireless pads and stands to make sure they work reliably. We also make sure the Lightning port is easy to access no matter what cable you use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With those test criteria in mind, here are some recommended iPhone 13 cases from the many we’ve tested, along with a few you should probably stay away from.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Standard cases</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are <em>so many</em> cases, with <em>so many</em> gimmicks and unique features, that it’s hard to say what a “standard” case really is anymore. For the sake of this roundup, this category is a catch-all for cases that don’t explicitly fit in the other categories. They’re not thin, rugged, or wallet cases, but they could have unique features like stands, integrated PopSockets, MagSafe magnets, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiPhone 13 Leather Case with MagSafe\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/apple-ihpone-13-leather.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" /></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMSRP:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$59 (iPhone 13, iPhone 13 mini, iPhone 13 Pro, iPhone 13 Pro Max)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MM193ZM/A/iphone-13-pro-leather-case-with-magsafe-golden-brown&amp;subid1=1-1-541224-6-358438-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$59 at Apple</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p><strong>Craftsmanship:</strong> Apple sells three of its own iPhone 13 cases: this leather one, the <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MM2F3ZM/A/iphone-13-pro-silicone-case-with-magsafe-clover&amp;subid1=1-1-541224-1-0-0\">Silicone Case</a>, and the <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MM2Y3ZM/A/iphone-13-pro-clear-case-with-magsafe&amp;subid1=1-1-541224-1-0-0\">Clear Case</a>. They’re all top notch, but a little pricey. The leather case is nicest, if you don’t mind real leather. It doesn’t feel “too leathery”…there’s a nice firmness and rigidity to it. And over time, the wear will make it look even better. You can’t go wrong with the official Apple cases, but they’re not specialized–neither ultra-thin nor extra rugged, and with no special features other than MagSafe. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Buttons:</strong> The buttons work flawlessly, retaining the full clicky feel and even the size and shape of a naked iPhone’s buttons. The mute switch cutout is quite small, but tapered and perfectly positioned, so it’s not hard to use. The only real problem is that the cutout for the Lightning port can be a bit of a tight fit on the larger third-party Lightning connectors.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Charging:</strong> We had no problem with any wireless chargers we tried using Apple’s cases, with the obvious exception that the huge camera bump on the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max can sometimes get in the way. All Apple’s cases support MagSafe, meaning that they have a ring of magnets in them to help MagSafe accessories stick on tightly.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div></div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpigen Ultra Hybrid S\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/spigen-ultra-hybrid-s.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" /></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMSRP:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$34.99\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096HFDBYC?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$16.99 at Amazon</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.spigen.com/collections/iphone-13-pro/products/iphone-13-pro-case-ultra-hybrid-s?variant=39967244451887&amp;xcust=1-1-541224-6-541239-15445&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$34.99 at Spigen</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p><strong>Craftsmanship:</strong> Spigen sells several cases with “Ultra Hybrid” branding–a plain one, one with MagSafe, and this one with a built-in stand. They’re all quite similar. They’re thin but not excessively so, and clear with optional colored bands. The fold-out stand seems fairly well built and snaps in and out with a satisfying click. It’ll hold your iPhone 13 up reliably in either orientation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Buttons:</strong> The buttons all work reliably. They have a little bit of a spongey feel (as most clear plastics seem to), but they’re not too stiff. The cutouts for the mute switch, speakers, and Lightning port are all aligned well and sized right.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Charging:</strong> The model with the stand won’t really work right with most wireless chargers unless it’s small enough to fit between the stand and the camera bump. The other Ultra Hybrid models we tested work fine with every wireless charger we tried, and the MagSafe model has nice strong magnets.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div></div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSmartish Gripmunk with MagSafe\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/smartish-gripmunk-magsafe.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" /></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMSRP:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$19.99\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B097Q97PQ7?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$19.99 at Amazon</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://smartish.com/collections/iphone-13-pro/products/gripmunk-with-magsafe-slim-case-for-iphone-13-pro-6-1?variant=40359432487108&amp;xcust=1-1-541224-6-542228-17280&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$19.99 at Smartish</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p><strong>Craftsmanship:</strong> An alternative to Apple’s Clear Case that is in some ways better than the official Apple product, and certainly less expensive. It’s not quite as finely crafted as Apple’s own case but fits really well, and the textured sides make it a lot easier to grip. The Gripmunk case comes in a variety of colors, and you can get it with or without MagSafe, but it’s the clear one (“Nothin to hide”) with MagSafe that stands out, in part because Apple’s Clear Case has such a stiff feel and slick texture. And it’s half the price.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Buttons:</strong> The buttons work fine. They’re easy to locate by touch and not hard to press, though you lose a little of that “click” feel compared to a naked iPhone. The cutout for the mute switch is just slightly off-center but not enough to affect its use, and the cutouts for the Lightning port and speakers are generous.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Charging:</strong> MagSafe attraction is rock solid, and we had no problems using any wireless charger in our test suite. This case is technically <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/334301/buyer-beware-magsafe-compatible-is-not-the-same-as-made-for-magsafe.html\">“MagSafe Compatible” and not “Made for MagSafe”</a> but all that means here is that you don’t get the little animation when you first put the case on your iPhone.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div></div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPresidio2 Grip Compatible with MagSafe\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/speck-presidio2-iphone13-pro.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" /></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMSRP:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$54.95\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.speckproducts.com/apple/iphone-cases/iphone-13-pro-cases/presidio2-grip-compatible-with-magsafe-iphone-13-pro-cases/IP21P-P2G-MS.html#start=2&amp;xcust=1-1-541224-6-544053-15716&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$54.95 at Speck</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p><strong>Craftsmanship:</strong> Speck is one of those brands you can reliably find in many retail stores, but you might want to expand your search a little. This case is okay, but feels a little chintzy for something that costs at much as Apple’s official cases. The whole thing feels like low-grade plastic, and the lip on the top edge halfway covers the earpiece hole because Speck didn’t make a little cutout there as many other manufacturers do. For the price, you should expect more.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Buttons:</strong> The buttons are well-positioned, feel good, and are easy to click. The speaker and Lightning cutouts are fine, but the cutout for the mute switch is badly misaligned. You can operate the switch, but it’s not what you’d expect from a premium-priced case.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Charging:</strong> This case is MagSafe Compatible (not “<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/334301/buyer-beware-magsafe-compatible-is-not-the-same-as-made-for-magsafe.html\">Made for MagSafe</a>“) so it adheres strongly to all MagSafe accessories and chargers.

Its claim to fame is that it is made from 100% vegetable-based plastic and is fully compostable (in industrial composting facilities, not your backyard compost pile). The fit is okay, and it has an interesting look; sort of faux-distressed as if to emphasize its “green” cred. But there’s not a lot interesting or unique here beyond the environmental aspect.

It feels good and seems well-made, but the whole gimmick here is the thin silicone strap on the back. Slide a finger or two in there to act as a grip for easier one-hand operation, similar to a PopSocket or any of the many other iPhone grips. It’s surprisingly comfortable. The case comes in black and blue, but replacement bands come in a variety of colors and styles (and cost a reasonable $6).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Buttons:</strong> The buttons are aligned properly, easy to press, and retain the clicky feel of a naked iPhone. The cutouts for the mute switch and speakers are positioned and sized well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Charging: </strong>I was shocked to find I got a good connection with all my wireless chargers, when it seems like the grip band (thin though it may be) might interfere. You can’t use MagSafe, though. Unfortunately, the cutout for the Lightning port is just a little bit too smaller than I would like. Apple’s official cables, and many third-party cables, fit with no problems, but the largest Lightning plugs are a bit of a tight fit.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div></div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIncipio Duo\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/incipio-duo.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" /></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMSRP:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$29.99\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09DQ87G5Q?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$29.99 at Amazon</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://incipio.com/products/duo-for-iphone-13-pro&amp;xcust=1-1-541224-6-550058-12586&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$29.99 at Incipio</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p><strong>Craftsmanship: </strong>This is a pretty basic case, and it feels like it.

But there’s definitely a market for this stuff, and Case-Mate cases are easy to find at lots of retailers. Maybe it’s because it’s made with plant-based materials, but the plastic feels hard, unforgiving, and cheap. And the fit isn’t very precise. For example, the camera cutout has squared, instead of rounded, corners.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Buttons:</strong> The buttons protrude quite a bit and are very easy click, but the cutout for the mute switch is <em>way</em> out of alignment, to the point where it’s difficult to operate.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Charging: </strong>I did’t have any trouble with any of my good wireless charging stands, but some of the lesser ones were hard to get a good connection with.

The iPhone 13 is a heavy phone, especially the Pro models, so you’d be forgiven for not wanting to make it heavier still. A thin case necessarily offers only minimal drop protection; they’re really made to function as a sort of “skin” that’s easy to take on or off, saving your expensive phone from scuffs and scratches. Thin cases have the benefit of working great with wireless charging (usually), but on the iPhone 13 Pro you’ll see a pretty big lip around that huge camera bump, which can get in the way a little. Some are even so thin that they barely interfere with MagSafe accessories, despite not technically being “MagSafe compatible.”</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTotallee iPhone 13 Pro Case\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/totallee-clear-iphone-13.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" /></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMSRP:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$39\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.totalleecase.com/products/iphone-13-pro-case?variant=39577424298046&amp;xcust=1-1-541224-6-541219-15521&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$39 at Totallee</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G789WDT?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$39.00 at Amazon</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p><strong>Craftsmanship:</strong> Totallee makes some of our favorite ultra-thin cases.

The grippy back is nice, but the edges of that back pattern aren’t as smooth as they could be. The main draw here is that this is a super affordable case, and for the price, it’s not half bad.

Unless you have a lot of those accessories already, we suggest you avoid them in favor of the broader MagSafe ecosystem. The iGlaze XT, however, is a nice thin clear case with no SnapTo or MagSafe magnets at all. It’s fairly thin, glossy, clear, and well-made with a precise fit. The SnapTo iGlaze cases are considerable thicker. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Buttons:</strong> Nice clicky, easy-to-press action on all buttons, and the cutouts for the switches and ports are all perfectly aligned and sized well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Charging:</strong> We had no issue with any wireless charger or third-party Lightning cable.

It’s more “tough-looking” than actually tough. The back <em>looks</em> like metal, but that’s just plastic. The little flip-out kickstand is a chintzy piece of plastic we could easily bend, and will almost certainly snap off or crack in due time. And what’s the point of a rugged durable case with a huge hole in the back to show the Apple logo? I’m sure a case this thick offers nice impact resistance, but it doesn’t seem very well made.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Buttons:</strong> The rubberized buttons work surprisingly well for such a thick case, but we can’t get over how badly misaligned the cutout for the mute button is.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Charging:</strong> The Lightning port cutout is big enough for even larger third-party cables. And while most ruggedized cases don’t work with wireless chargers, this one actually did work with a few of our better ones, thanks to the fact that it only <em>looks</em> metallic but is actually all plastic. I’m sure the big hole around the Apple logo helps, too.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div></div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGripzilla\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/smartish-gripzilla.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" /></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMSRP:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$24.99\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B097Q9R33V?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$24.99 at Amazon</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://smartish.com/collections/iphone-13-pro/products/gripzilla-with-magsafe-armor-case-for-iphone-13-pro-6-1&amp;xcust=1-1-541224-6-542018-17280&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$24.99 at Smartish</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p><strong>Craftsmanship:</strong> This is not quite a big and thick as some other rugged cases, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. The scalloped and textured sides give you a serious grip, and there’s enough heft here to provide good drop protection. The front lip is substantial, with a cutout on the top edge so as not to block the top earpiece. The whole case has a slightly sandpapery texture that really does make it easy to grip even with wet or messy hands.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Buttons:</strong> Somehow, this thicker case has buttons that feel <em>less</em> stiff than Smartish’s other cases.

But the case is quite rigid and has an aluminum frame with a rubber “bubble” pattern on the inside edges, and the clear plastic back is rigid and hard. It’s not as bulky as some other ruggedized cases but definitely adds considerable heft to your iPhone 13.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Buttons:</strong> The thick sides with generous spacing are great for shock absorption but make it hard to do good buttons. They’re only slightly stiff, but the little dimple isn’t enough to easily find the button locations by touch. They’re lined up well, and the cutouts for the mute switch, Lightning port, and speakers are generous.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Charging:</strong> The back is just clear, rigid plastic and doesn’t interfere with most wireless chargers. But it’s a little thick, and finicky or weak chargers had trouble finding good alignment. If you have a good wireless charger, you’ll be fine. Third-party Lightning connectors that are larger than Apple’s had no problem with the generous cutout around the port.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div></div>\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<h2>Wallet cases</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In an increasingly tap-to-pay world, there’s less reason to carry around a bunch of stuff in your wallet. Apple’s even making state IDs and driver’s licenses available in iOS 15 (in supporting states). If you only need to carry around a couple of cards, a wallet case case be a great idea. Yeah, these tend to be bigger and thicker cases, but that can be a small price to pay to not carry around a separate wallet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Almost none of these cases will work with wireless chargers. They’re too thick because of the card holder, and they need magnetic protection to stop the MagSafe magnets in the back of your iPhone 13 from messing up the magnetic strip on your credit or debit cards. Their added bulk makes button action especially important, much like rugged cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that we’re not covering MagSafe wallet <em>attachments</em> here, only fully cases that have wallet or card-carrying features. If you want a sometimes-wallet, perhaps a MagSafe compatible case and wallet sleeve attachment is a better choice for you.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSpigen Slim Armor CS\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/spigen-slim-armor-CS.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" /></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMSRP:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$39.99\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.spigen.com/collections/iphone-13-pro/products/iphone-13-pro-case-slim-armor-cs?variant=39967246417967&amp;xcust=1-1-541224-6-541281-15445&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$39.99 at Spigen</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p><strong>Craftsmanship:</strong> Spigen typically makes pretty good products, but they blew it with this one. This is supposed to be a “slim but rugged” case with a slide-open compartment on the back to hold two or three credit cards, IDs, or a few folded-up bills. But the sliding compartment is a little chintzy, and worse, there’s only a thin piece of rubber separating it from the back of your iPhone. The back of your iPhone that is full of magnets. If you put a credit card in this case, you’re just begging for the magnetic strip to be erased. Yikes. We don’t live in a chip-and-pin card-only society yet; this is a huge design failure.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Buttons:</strong> As it does on some other cases, Spigen has cutouts along the sides of its buttons to make them easier to press. And the cutouts around the mute switch, speakers, and charge port are on point.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>Charging:</strong> As you might expect, this case doesn’t work at all with wireless chargers.

They both hold about four cards (or maybe three and a bit of cash) in a nice sleeve that holds cards securely but makes them easy to remove. They fit the iPhone 13 well, with a cutout on the top lip so as not to block the top speaker. There’s a critical flaw in both of them, though–there’s nothing but a thin strip of slicone between the cards and your iPhone 13, which is loaded with magnets. You’re begging for your card’s magnetic stripe to be erased if you use this thing. Maybe they should have called it “Card Slayer.” It’s a shame, because it’s otherwise a decent case at a good price. If you only plan to use cards with no magnetic strip (or cash), it’s not a bad choice.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Buttons:</strong> The buttons are slightly stiff, but it’s not nearly the worst we’ve seen. The cutouts for the mute switch and Lightning port are generous and centered well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Charging:</strong> As with most wallet cases, there’s just too much material in the back to work well with a wireless charger and you definitely should <em>not</em> even try to use it as such with credit cards inserted.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div></div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSmartish Dancing Queen\t\t\t\t\t\t</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/smartish-dancing-queen.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" /></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMSRP:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$29.99\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B097QCTVLT?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$29.99 at Amazon</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://smartish.com/collections/iphone-13-pro/products/dancing-queen-crossbody-wallet-case-for-iphone-13-pro-6-1?variant=40359539802308&amp;xcust=1-1-541224-6-541762-17280&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$29.99 at Smartish</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p><strong>Craftsmanship:</strong> You probably shouldn’t expect <em>too much</em> from a $30 case that has a whole wallet and wrist strap and body strap, but Smartish’s unique Dancing Queen is slightly better built than you’d think. Of course, nothing here even remotely resembles real leather, but it fits your phone well, and the flap to hold your cards and cash (up to five cards plus a few bills) is sized right and works well. There doesn’t appear to be any protection from your iPhone 13’s ring of magnets, so it could erase the magnetic stripe on any cards you put in there, but there’s a bit more material than in some other wallet cases. Still, it’s impossible to recommend a wallet case that isn’t shielded to protect magnetic stripes on cards. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Buttons:</strong> The buttons are a little on the stiff side, but still work reliably.
