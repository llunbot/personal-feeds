(I’ve gotten the notification on multiple devices, and don’t have Cupertino saved as a Weather location.)</p>\n\n<p>What a weird bug.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/02/apple-weather-excessive-heat\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"964b10edddf00d25e4811a445c17dc9bea0d40524b28d10491e18c53bac22412","category":"Tech"}
