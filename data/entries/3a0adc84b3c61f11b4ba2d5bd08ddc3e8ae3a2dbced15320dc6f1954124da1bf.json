Buoyed by <em>Drive to Survive</em>, the sport's reach rivals its popularity at any time in the past, despite having to compete with myriad more demands for our time. The car makers get cachet from their participation, and just occasionally, something they build for the racetrack trickles down into something you can buy in the showroom. Such is the case with today's car, the (deep breath) Mercedes-AMG GT 63 S E Performance four-door.</p>\n<p>Although the team hasn't had the same amount of success since the introduction of ground effects in 2022, Mercedes-AMG won seven championships on the trot between 2014 and 2020. High Performance Powertrains, based in Brixworth, got the hybrid formula just right, eclipsing the power and drivability of rivals at Ferrari, Renault, and Honda and helping Lewis Hamilton secure more Grands Prix wins than anyone else in history.</p>\n<p>The boffins at Brixworth <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/03/real-f1-to-road-car-tech-the-mercedes-amg-performance-hybrid/\">got together</a> with their counterparts at Affalterbach, where the AMG gets applied to Mercedes. The result: This plug-in hybrid powertrain uses the same 2170 cylindrical cells in its battery pack as cars like the Mercedes AMG F1 W10 EQ Power+, albeit slightly more of them, as the road car has a capacity of 6.1 kWh (4.8 kWh net). The pack feeds an electric motor with a nominal 94 hp (70 kW) and 236 lb-ft (310 Nm), but it's capable of 201 hp (150 kW) for 10-second bursts.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/f1-hybrid-tech-is-the-star-of-the-mercedes-amg-gt-63-s-e-performance/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/f1-hybrid-tech-is-the-star-of-the-mercedes-amg-gt-63-s-e-performance/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
