{"title":"★ If You Guys Are Really Us, What Number Are We Thinking Of?","link":"https://daringfireball.net/2021/07/69_dudes","date":1626215332000,"content":"\n<p>A good mid-summer silly story from earlier today. Chaim Gartenberg, writing at The Verge, “<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/7/13/22575368/apple-ios-14-weather-app-69-rounding-error-15\">Apple’s Weather App Won’t Say It’s 69 Degrees</a>”:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If you’re an iPhone user, the weather is always a particularly\nnice 70 degrees. Or 68 degrees. Any temperature but 69 degrees,\nactually, because it turns out that the built-in weather app on\nsome versions of iOS — including the current version, iOS 14.6 — will refuse to display <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2016/06/why-69-is-the-internets-coolest-number-sex.html\">the internet’s favorite number</a>, even\nif the actual temperature in a given location is, in fact, 69\ndegrees, along with several other (less meme-able) numerals like\n65 and 71 degrees.</p>\n\n<p>It’s not clear if this is a bug or an intentional attempt from\nApple to cut down on 69-related humor. The rounding is only\nvisible in the weather app itself: clicking through to Apple’s\nsource data from Weather.com will show the proper temperature, as\ndo Apple’s home screen widgets. But the iOS weather app will\nrefuse to show 69 degrees anywhere in the forecast, whether it’s\nfor the current temperature, the hourly forecast for the day, or\nthe extended forecast.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Marques Brownlee followed with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/1414974137332867072\">a quick side-by-side demo</a> with an Android phone. But it was soon pointed out by commenters on Twitter that while true for the Weather app in iOS 14.6, it’s not the case in the current betas for iOS 15. (It’s also not the case for iOS 13, which I still have running on a spare phone.) Gartenberg soon updated his story at The Verge with the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A possible explanation for the issue (as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theMarcDufresne/status/1414981789052030987\">pointed out by\nseveral</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nannerb/status/1414981582318878722\">people on Twitter</a>) is that Apple may be\nsourcing data for its iOS Weather app in Celsius and then\nconverting it to Fahrenheit. For example, 20 degrees Celsius\nconverts to 68 degrees Fahrenheit, while 21 degrees Celsius\nconverts to 69.8 degrees Fahrenheit — which rounds up to 70\ndegrees Fahrenheit. The app appears to have similar issues with\ntemperatures like 65 degrees (where 18 degrees Celsius converts to\n64.4 degrees Fahrenheit, while 19 degrees Celsius is 66.2 degrees\nFahrenheit).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This theory that it’s a side effect of converting Celsius integer values to Fahrenheit integer values strikes me as almost certainly correct — especially considering that it affects un-notable values like “65”. Or that even in iOS 14.6, <em>negative</em> 69°F <a href=\"https://twitter.com/largent_connor/status/1414976667219542016\">displays just fine</a>. But it’s amusing to me that so many people bought into the possibility that someone at Apple thought it was a good idea to avoid showing 69° as a temperature.</p>\n\n<p>Apple’s Compass app will show you 69°. The Finder will tell you if you have 69 files in a folder. Once you start down this path it’s hard to find an app from Apple that <em>won’t</em> display “69” some how, some way, if that’s the value that ought to be displayed. Apple even has <a href=\"https://www.techspot.com/news/67429-apple-replace-single-lost-or-broken-airpod-69.html\">products that cost $69</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But Apple’s reputation for prudishness precedes it.</p>\n\n<p>What didn’t pass the sniff test for me with this “won’t show 69°F” idea is that it would cross the line into losing integrity, or at least losing <em>accuracy</em>. Can I imagine a third-party weather app being rejected from the App Store because its screenshots show a big “69°F” current temperature? Yes. But to program the iPhone Weather app to avoid displaying 69°F when it really is 69°F? (Or to demand a third-party weather app not show “69°F” in the app?) No.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes a cigar is just an integer math conversion glitch.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>I’m reminded of the spate of articles a few years ago, when Apple’s original TV+ titles were ramping up production, that Apple executives were squeamish about R-rated content. E.g. <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/no-sex-please-were-apple-iphone-giant-seeks-tv-success-on-its-own-terms-1537588880\">this widely-cited report</a> by Tripp Mickle and Joe Flint for The Wall Street Journal in September 2018, which claimed, “The tech giant wants to make scripted shows for streaming, only without violence, politics and risqué story lines.” It didn’t seem preposterous in the least that Apple might have been looking for a Disney-esque “family-friendly only” image for its original content.</p>\n\n<p>Problem is: <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/02/04/cue-ny-post\">it wasn’t true</a>. <em>Ted Lasso</em> sure is a feel-good show, but Apple’s acclaimed <em>The Morning Show</em> is just as surely not. <em>Servant</em> is R-rated horror (or pretty close to R-rated). <em>See</em> was a show about a future world <a href=\"https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a29637626/see-apple-tv-masturbation-scene-queen-kane/\">where everyone is blind and they pray to their god by masturbating</a>. Disney+ probably wasn’t bidding on that.</p>\n\n\n\n    ","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"559cfad6a1244171d75462ebf8ffbdbba0834267acdeb5ba9a935145bcc919bc","category":"Tech"}
