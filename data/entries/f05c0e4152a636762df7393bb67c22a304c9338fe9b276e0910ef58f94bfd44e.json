This demonstration is a forerunner to future Starship test flights that will bring the booster, and eventually the upper stage, back to land for reuse again and again.</p>\n<p>The two-stage rocket took off from Starbase at 7:50 am CDT (12:50 UTC) and headed east over the Gulf of Mexico with more than 15 million pounds of thrust, roughly twice the power of NASA's Saturn V rocket from the Apollo lunar program of the 1960s and 1970s.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029471#p3\">Read 30 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029471&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f05c0e4152a636762df7393bb67c22a304c9338fe9b276e0910ef58f94bfd44e","category":"Tech"}
