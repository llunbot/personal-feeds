It was published by a newly formed Sir-Tech software, with just enough polish to stand out from the Ziploc-bagged crowd. And it was polished and play-tested enough to find its audience. It's likely the first party-based RPG, and it all but created the genre \"dungeon crawler.\"</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://fave.co/3reHw5E\" target=\"_blank\">Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord</a>,</em> as has been released in early access for PC today after two years of development, is a whole lot more than just \"enough.\" It's adding fine-looking graphics, a whole bunch of quality-of-life improvements to navigating and managing your party, and quicker combat and spell selection.
