But what do you do when you no longer want to run the beta?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the beta is causing havoc with your Mac, you are fed up with having to set aside time each week while the latest update is installed, or you just want to go back to the way things were then it’s time to remove the macOS beta. Now it’s here you might want to just run the full version of macOS Sequoia. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luckily once Sequoia arrived the process for ‘downgrading’ became simpler. Prior to macOS Sequoia launching downgrading wasn’t as easy as you might think. We explain what you need to do if you want to revert from a beta during the early testing process below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll run through the complex process for reverting from the macOS Sequoia beta to macOS Sonoma (which will apply when Apple starts developing the next version of macOS in June 2025), before running through the simpler process for reverting from the macOS Sequoia beta to the full <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2265062/macos-15-release-name-compatibility-features.html\">macOS Sequoia</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it’s the iOS beta program you wish to leave read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1067004/how-to-remove-ios-beta-iphone.html\">How to remove an iOS beta from your iPhone</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to stop getting the macOS Sequoia beta </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are running the macOS Sequoia beta and want to install the new version of macOS Sequoia now that it has launched, the process to revert to the full version is relatively simple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing to do is remove yourself from Apple’s macOS beta program as this will stop the beta updates from arriving on your Mac.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Open System Settings. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click on General. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click on Software Update. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click the i beside Beta updates and make sure it is set to off.  </li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you have left the Beta program the next version of macOS that is offered to you via System Settings will be a full version of macOS and you will be able to install that as usual. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s slightly more complicated if you are running a newer version of the beta than the official version. In that case, you can either wait for Apple to issue the next macOS Sequoia update and install that instead, or you can follow the steps below to revert to an older version of macOS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don’t want to wait for that next update then you can install macOS Sequoia using macOS Recovery. </p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>To enter Recovery mode press and hold the power button while your Mac starts up and continue to press and hold the button until you see a startup options window appear with an Options icon. (On an older Mac you enter Recovery by pressing the Command and R buttons during start-up).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Select Options and click Continue.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>macOS Utilities will open with the option to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671404/how-to-reinstall-macos.html\">Reinstall macOS</a> [version]. Select that option.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Enter your password if required.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wait while installation takes place (don’t let the Mac go to sleep). </li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>You may need to erase your disk, in which case you will want to make sure that important documents are backed up (not in Time Machine as that will also copy the version of macOS you are running). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If this doesn’t work for you, do a clean install following the steps below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have more advice about <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671172/how-to-update-macos.html\">installing macOS on your Mac here</a> and here’s what to do if you encounter <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671831/macos-wont-install-fixes.html\">problems installing macOS</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to revert from macOS beta to the previous macOS version</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are running the beta of macOS Sequoia and want to downgrade back to Sonoma (or if you start running the macOS 16 beta after June 2025 and want to revert to macOS Sequoia), try the following steps:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will need to wipe your Mac first. You won’t be able to install the old macOS over the top of the new macOS, unfortunately. This is why we always recommend <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671336/how-to-back-up-a-mac-or-macbook.html\">making a backup</a> before you install a beta, or any newer version of macOS.</p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div><span>1.</span>\n<h3>Leave the beta program </h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Stop-beta-updates-in-MacOS.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Stop Beta Updates in macOS\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>The first thing to do is remove yourself from Apple’s macOS Sequoia beta program as this will stop the beta updates from arriving on your Mac.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Open System Settings. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click on General. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click on Software Update. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click the i beside Beta updates and make sure it is set to off.  </li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>This will stop any further Sequoia updates being installed on your Mac, but if you want to revert back to Sonoma you will need to wipe your Mac, as per the instructions below.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div><span>2.</span>\n<h3>Wipe your Mac</h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Erase-Mac-M-and-T-chip.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Erase Mac with M or T2 chip\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Unfortunately, if you are moving from macOS Sequoia back to Sonoma you will need to erase all the data from your Mac first. You cannot install Sonoma on top of Sequoia. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luckily there is an Erase All Content and Settings option in System Settings that makes it easy to return your Mac to factory settings. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To find the Erase All Content and Settings option open System Settings &gt; General &gt; click on Reset &gt; click Erase All Contents and Settings.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you click on Erase All Content and Settings everything will be taken care of.
