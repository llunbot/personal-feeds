Apple lets you tune how notifications work so you’re not bothered too much—or too loudly. Some readers have found that, without intending to or without making any change, they receive audible notifications on all their Apple devices. That’s a lot of noise if have a Mac, an iPad, an iPhone, and an Apple Watch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how to fix this problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Modify each app’s notification settings</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First, identify each app pushing notifications for which you want to change behavior. For many of us, this will include Messages and a limited number of other apps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, check your notification settings for each device for each app:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>iPhone/iPad:</strong> Go to <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>Notifications</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Mac:</strong> Go to <em>System Settings</em> &gt; <em>Notifications</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Apple Watch:</strong> Go to the Watch app &gt; <em>Notifications</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-notifications-messages-mac-bordered.png?w=1158\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-notifications-messages-mac-bordered.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1436w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-notifications-messages-mac-bordered.png?resize=290%2C300&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 290w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-notifications-messages-mac-bordered.png?resize=768%2C796&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-notifications-messages-mac-bordered.png?resize=1158%2C1200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1158w\" width=\"1158\" height=\"1200\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>You can set Sound and other notifications options for each app.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>For each app you want to check or change the behavior, tap or click the app in the list, and look for how notifications are delivered. For audio alerts, disable “Play sound for notification.” That affects each device individually.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tweak Apple Watch mirroring of iPhone notifications</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple Watch has a unique twist, which is that many apps’ notifications are set to “Mirror my iPhone.” That means that if your iPhone plays a sound, so will your Apple Watch. The operating systems are smart enough, however, that if they know the two devices are in close proximity and in use, you may receive different notifications at that time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tap <em>Custom</em> to reveal additional options where applicable. In Messages, for instance, you choose to get audio and haptic alerts.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-watch-not-msgs-sbs.png?w=1200\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-watch-not-msgs-sbs.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1500w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-watch-not-msgs-sbs.png?resize=300%2C181&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-watch-not-msgs-sbs.png?resize=768%2C463&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mac911-watch-not-msgs-sbs.png?resize=1200%2C724&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"724\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>Some apps in the Watch app’s notifications  let you opt between mirroring iPhone settings or customizing them.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This Mac 911 article is in response to a question submitted by Macworld reader Bill.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ask Mac 911</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve compiled a list of the questions we get asked most frequently, along with answers and links to columns: <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/3077986/os-x/your-top-questions-to-mac-911-and-some-answers.html\">read our super FAQ</a> to see if your question is covered.
