Phone companies must <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/general/contribution-methodology-administrative-filings\">pay a percentage</a> of their revenue into the fund, and telcos generally pass those fees on to consumers with a \"Universal Service\" line item on telephone bills.</p>\n<p>Imposing similar assessments on broadband could increase the Universal Service Fund's size and/or reduce the charges on phone service, spreading the burden more evenly across different types of telecommunications services. Some consumer advocates want the FCC to increase the fund in order to replace the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), a different government program that gives $30 monthly broadband discounts to people with low incomes but is about to run out of money because of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/01/fcc-to-halt-sign-ups-for-internet-discounts-as-republicans-threaten-funding/\">inaction by Congress</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015506#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015506&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4d840acc30772bda9c23c8e59c6c7f4a928b11a6ca477a0ad9e8a4426f08da8c","category":"Tech"}
