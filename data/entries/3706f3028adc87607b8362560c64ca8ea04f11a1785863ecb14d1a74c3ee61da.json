According to the <a href=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2023/Pirelli-Tire-Recalls-P-ZERO-Race-TLR-Bicycle-Tires-Due-to-Fall-Hazard\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Consumer Product Safety Commission</strong></a>, Pirelli received one report of a tire unseating, leading to a minor injury and the recall. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gearjunkie.com/biking/pirelli-cinturato-s-gravel-tire\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Pirelli</strong></a> sold 14,500 of the tires in the U.S. and 550 in Canada. Both groups of tires are included in the recall. Pirelli <a href=\"https://www.pirelli.com/tires/en-us/learn/safety-notice\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>announced the news on its website</strong></a> on September 7. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users should immediately stop using P ZERO Race TLR tires (size 28-622) and check if Pirelli covers the tires under the recall. Pirelli produced the affected tires “between the tenth week of 2023 and the 24th week of 2023,” per the company. Competitive Cyclist, Trek, and Angry Catfish stores sold the tires “nationwide from March 2023 through July 2023.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think you might have one of these tires?
