That's a 14.1 percent increase from its performance in 2022, and comfortably eclipses the 2.3 million cars that Toyota sold during the same period. It had a strong year in terms of electric vehicle sales too—up 93 percent year-on-year.</p>\n<p>But a quick look at the data reveals a somewhat less rosy picture. Yes, it was a banner year for GM EVs, with 75,883 deliveries in 2023. But only because of the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/02/chevrolet-gives-the-bolt-ev-a-facelift-a-stretch-and-a-price-cut/\">Chevrolet Bolt EV</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/11/the-2023-chevrolet-bolt-euv-is-an-extremely-useful-vehicle/\">Bolt EUV</a>. Chevy delivered 62,045 Bolts in 2023, a 62.8 percent increase on the 38,120 Bolts it sold in 2022.</p>\n<p>But as Ars <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/04/gm-confirms-chevy-bolt-will-die-this-year-making-way-for-electric-pickups/\">has detailed in the past</a>, the Bolt is no more. Production ended at the Orion Assembly plant in Michigan on December 18, and GM is laying off 945 workers at the plant as it retools the factory to make electric trucks like the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/01/chevrolet-shows-off-the-2024-silverado-ev-its-first-electric-pickup/\">Chevy Silverado EV</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/10/gmc-unveils-its-first-electric-truck-the-sierra-ev-due-in-early-2024/\">GMC Sierra EV</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1993652#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1993652&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
