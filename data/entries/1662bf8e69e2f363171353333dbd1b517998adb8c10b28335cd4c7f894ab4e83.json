Preparation is key</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"671\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/11/02160007/cycling_handlebar_rain-970x671.jpg\" alt=\"cycling_handlebar_rain\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With British weather being what it is, even if you set out in glorious sunshine there’s no guarantee it won’t be pouring down before you finish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why it’s always a good idea to prepare for any eventuality, and then when the heavens do open, you won’t be hiding in a bus shelter wishing you’d read our article.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A neat way of always being prepared is to pack a lightweight rain jacket in your pocket – they may not protect you from the heaviest downpours but they will fend off showers and they won’t weigh you down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-the-best-packable-cycling-jackets\" target=\"_blank\">best packable cycling jackets</a> weigh around 50g or less and won’t take up much space in your pocket when not being worn.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Get a proper waterproof jacket</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/11/02160014/gore_race_shakedry_jacket.png\" alt=\"gore_race_shakedry_jacket\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For heavy rain, only a fully waterproof jacket will do. There are certain key features to look for when choosing a jacket.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, a high collar will keep rain from dripping down inside at the top, and a long tail to fend off any spray from the road, while extra-long sleeves will ensure there’s no wrist gap between cuffs and gloves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re putting in some effort on the bike, breathability is vital to ensure you don’t get soaked from the inside with sweat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The gold standard for lightweight waterproofs is a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/gore-race-shakedry-jacket-review\" target=\"_blank\">Gore Shakedry jacket</a> or one of its many derivatives such as the Castelli Idro (<a href=\"https://amzn.to/3sym5x2\" target=\"_blank\">from £246 at Amazon</a>). These ultra-thin single membrane jackets are waterproof and highly packable, but more breathable than traditional boil-in-the-bag rain shells. Note that Shakedry jackets are being phased out as they rely on PFAS ‘forever’ chemicals so if you want one, don’t hang about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those on a smaller budget, a standard shell like the Endura FS260 Pro (<a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1857&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;clickref=Wet+weather+cycling+&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wiggle.co.uk%2Fendura-fs260-pro-adrenaline-race-cape-jacket\" target=\"_blank\">From £62.99 at Wiggle</a>) is still a good option. The other option – for when it’s both cold and wet – is a waterproof thermal winter jacket.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our guide to the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-best-waterproof-cycling-jackets\" target=\"_blank\">best waterproof jackets</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. Protect your head</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/01/02121716/cyclist_cycling_cap.jpg\" alt=\"cyclist_cycling_cap\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In summer, a helmet with lots of vents will keep you cool, but it won’t do much to keep the rain out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A traditional <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-waterproof-and-winter-cycling-caps\" target=\"_blank\">cycling cap</a> under the helmet can be handy in wet weather, as the peak will deflect the rain away from your eyes and it will keep your head warm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A helmet with a built-in peak will do the same job, but these are largely the preserve of mountain bike and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/strava-stats-show-uk-lags-behind-global-average-in-gender-balanced-commuting\" target=\"_blank\">commuting</a> helmets, and are typically rejected by fashion-conscious roadies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could also get a waterproof helmet cover that fits over your lid with an elasticated hem, and there are even a few helmets such as the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/lazer-genesis-mips-helmet-review\" target=\"_blank\">Lazer Genesis Mips</a> that accept <a href=\"https://www.freewheel.co.uk/lazer-genesis-aeroshell-vargenshl\" target=\"_blank\">an optional removable aero cover</a> that doubles as a useful rain barrier.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5. Choose slick tyres for more grip</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/10/05204737/continental_gp5000_s_tr_1_0-970x645.jpg\" alt=\"continental_gp5000_s_tr_1_0\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike car tyres, there’s no danger of aquaplaning on wet roads when cycling due to the more rounded profile of bike tyres, which easily displace water.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, for riding on tarmac, there’s no need to fit tyres with a grooved tread. The <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-road-cycling-tyres-the-best-tyres-for-all-occasions\" target=\"_blank\">best road bike tyres</a> have a slick or near-slick tread which works better in all conditions, since it means there’s more rubber in contact with the tarmac and thus grip is better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thing you can do to improve grip is to let a little air out of your tyres (reduce the pressure by as much as 15-20psi), which provides a larger contact patch on the road, and therefore more rubber in contact with the tarmac at all times, even on rough road surfaces. Read our full guide to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bike-tyre-pressure\" target=\"_blank\">bicycle tyre pressure</a> for more. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Tubeless all-weather tyres: Continental GP5000 AS TR <a href=\"https://fave.co/3tO7Q7p\" target=\"_blank\">from £59.99 at Merlin Cycles (RRP £100)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>7. Watch out for punctures</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/07/02113935/in_praise_of_fixing_punctures_2-970x692.jpg\" alt=\"in_praise_of_fixing_punctures_2\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Anecdotally, cyclists suffer more punctures in wet weather. This is likely because rain washes all the debris out of the gutter and into the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s also a popular theory that water acts as a lubricant, so those flints and glass shards cut through your tyres more easily than in dry conditions, but there’s little hard evidence to support or refute this notion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, while many of us don’t bother to change our tyres with the season, it’s a good idea to look for tyres with extra puncture protection in autumn and winter, when rain is likely.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our guide to the </strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-puncture-repair-kits\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>best puncture repair kits</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>8. Consider going tubeless</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the preserve of mountain bikers, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/cyclist-guide-to-road-bike-tubeless-tyres\" target=\"_blank\">tubeless road tyres</a> are increasingly popular with road cyclists, especially with the fashion for go-anywhere adventure bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their main advantage in wet weather is the sealant, which means any small punctures are healed almost instantly, preventing air escaping.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another advantage is that they can be run at much lower pressures than conventional clinchers, giving you a larger contact patch which is a real help on slippery roads.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our guide to the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/cyclist-guide-to-road-bike-tubeless-tyres\" target=\"_blank\">best tubeless road tyres</a> and equip yourself with the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-tubeless-repair-tool\" target=\"_blank\">best tubeless repair tools</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<div></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>9. Use your brakes wisely</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/05/02131007/giant_tc_advanced_sl_braking-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"giant_tc_advanced_sl_braking\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In normal riding conditions, most of your stopping should be done with the front brake. However, this changes when there’s water on the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reduced grip makes it far more likely that you’ll lock up the front wheel if you brake hard, and once your front wheel loses traction, it’s almost impossible to stay upright on a bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Try to feather your brakes to slow down gradually, and make more use of the rear brake, which lacks the stopping power of the front brake but is useful for scrubbing off excess speed.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our tips on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/5-tips-to-avoid-crashes-while-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">how to avoid crashing your bike</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>10. Check your brake pads</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"840\" height=\"460\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/discpads6.jpg\" alt=\"SwissStop brake pad\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/discpads6.jpg 840w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/discpads6-300x164.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/discpads6-768x421.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/discpads6-750x411.jpg 750w\" /><figcaption>SwissStop</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Riding in the rain can leave your bike coated with water and grime, which will eat through brake pads and wheel rims very quickly if you’re riding <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/rim-brakes-a-buyers-guide\" target=\"_blank\">rim brakes</a>, and wear out pads and rotors faster with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-cyclist-guide-to-road-bike-disc-brakes\" target=\"_blank\">disc brakes</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Disc brake performance barely suffers in the wet, but rim brakes will have reduced stopping power, particularly if you have carbon rather than aluminium rims. Intermittently feathering your rim brakes while riding will also help keep your braking surfaces relatively clean and make braking safer and more effective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With rim brakes, be sure to wipe down your wheel rims and inspect the brake pads for any embedded grit and consider fitting <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-road-bike-brake-pads\" target=\"_blank\">brake pads</a> made with a compound designed for all-weather riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For discs, switching from organic to sintered (metallic) brake pads is worth considering if you’re wearing out your pads quickly – these perform better in the wet.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>11. Steady in the corners</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/11/02160029/fuji_sl_1-1_cornering-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"fuji_sl_1-1_cornering\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Grit washed into the road by rain doesn’t just cause punctures – loose material on the road surface can significantly reduce grip when cornering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, cornering is perhaps the biggest challenge for cyclists in wet conditions. The key to cornering safely in the rain is to take it steady as you approach the bend – do your braking before you start turning, and stay away from the edge of the road where you’ll find the worst of the debris.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also look out for painted road markings, which can be slippery when wet, while in autumn, fallen leaves are a major hazard.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our guide to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cornering-perfection\" target=\"_blank\">road bike cornering technique</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>12.
