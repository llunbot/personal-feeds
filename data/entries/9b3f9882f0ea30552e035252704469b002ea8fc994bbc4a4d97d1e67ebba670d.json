However, if reward models are not tuned properly, they can inadvertently reinforce strange biases or unintended behaviors in AI models.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/researchers-astonished-by-tools-apparent-success-at-revealing-ais-hidden-motives/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/researchers-astonished-by-tools-apparent-success-at-revealing-ais-hidden-motives/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9b3f9882f0ea30552e035252704469b002ea8fc994bbc4a4d97d1e67ebba670d","category":"Tech"}
