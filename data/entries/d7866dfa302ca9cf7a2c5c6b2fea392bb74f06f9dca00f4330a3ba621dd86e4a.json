I’ve been here a number of times before so I know it well enough, but this morning when I pull back the curtains it doesn’t look like the Skye I recognise from previous visits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For starters, I can see the sky. It’s a strange blue colour, and there’s a fiery orange ball emitting a warmth unfamiliar in this part of the Highlands. When I leave the hotel, the first thing I have to do is strip off my rain jacket and armwarmers – the usual minimum for a summer ride in the Western Isles – and return to my room to leave them behind. </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/hardknott-pass\">Why the Hardknott Pass is the hardest climb in England</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/islay-cycling\">Whisky galore: Islay UK ride</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/gravel-cycling-scotland\">Wee bit hill and glen: Scotland gravel ride</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>I won’t be needing them because today I have been gifted that most rare and precious of gems: a perfect day for a ride in Scotland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To my mind, there is no more beautiful place in the world than the Highlands of Scotland when the sun shines, and the fact that it happens so infrequently only serves to make it more special when the situation arises.

I would call it the capital of Skye but that might give the impression of a bustling metropolis, when in fact it is a harbour town with just enough shops and bars to service the influx of tourists over the summer months, but which is still small enough that someone on a bike can get from its centre to its outskirts in under a minute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am that someone, and approximately a minute after leaving my hotel I find myself alone on a long strip of road, heading north past clumps of forest and between low, bracken-covered hills. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-03-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"UK Ride Skye\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-03-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-03-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-03-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-03-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-03-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>A calm, sunny morning in the harbour town of Portree.

The dashed white line down its centre occasionally withers and disappears, leaving only a narrow smear of tarmac that struggles to accommodate two vehicles passing in opposite directions. Fortunately for me, traffic is light today and no one seems to be in much of a hurry.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-04-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"UK Ride Skye\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-04-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-04-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-04-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-04-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-04-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-04.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>I make my way up the island’s northeast coastline, the road rising and falling gently like the ripples of an unmade bed. To my right I can see across the sea to the Isle of Raasay, and beyond that the mainland and the Applecross peninsula, home to the infamous Bealach na Bà climb. Behind me, the view is dominated by the jagged outline of the Cuillin Mountains spread across the south of the island.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-05-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"UK Ride Skye\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-05-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-05-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-05-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-05-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-05-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-05-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-05-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-05.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Heading north along Skye’s eastern coast, with the jagged outline of the Cuillin Mountains fading in the background.</figcaption><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>I remember climbing them back in my school days, the dark rock so rough it ripped at my hands, and the ridges between peaks so narrow and precipitous that it required us to be roped together. The instruction from our mountaineering club leader was simple: ‘If the person in front of you falls off one side, you jump off the other.’ </p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately we were never required to implement this procedure, but it acted as a reminder of just how wild the Scottish Highlands can be, and that, if you know where to look, Britain can serve up mountains every bit as technically challenging as those found in the Alps.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Slip sliding away</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-06-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"UK Ride Skye\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-06-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-06-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-06-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-06-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-06-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-06.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>The road north from Portree goes for 29km before you arrive at the first turning.

A few centuries later, it seems it’s still the perfect place to make an escape.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How we did it</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-17-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"UK Ride Skye\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-17-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-17-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-17-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-17-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-17-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-17-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-17-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-17-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-17.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h3>Travel</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the Skye Bridge opened in 1995, the island of Skye is accessible by car without requiring a ferry. The drive from either Glasgow or Edinburgh is around five hours. It’s just about feasible to get there by public transport, but would involve very lengthy train and bus journeys, and there’s no guarantee you would be able to carry a bike with you.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-18-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"UK Ride Skye\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-18-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-18-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-18-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-18-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-18-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-18-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-18-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-18-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/uk-ride-skye-18.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>An 8km detour from the main route allows for a visit to the Talisker whisky distillery.</figcaption><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h3>Accommodation </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Portree is the best place to find hotels and B&amp;Bs. A quaint harbour town, it has a good selection of bars, cafes and restaurants, with local seafood being a speciality. We stayed at the Pink House on Quay Street, which was no frills but comfy, and dined at Sea Breezes next door, which served scallops to die for (<a href=\"https://sea-breezes-skye.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">sea-breezes-skye.co.uk</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>• This article originally appeared in issue 144 of <em>Cyclist </em>magazine. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to subscribe</a></strong></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/skye-cycling\">Skye’s the limit: Skye UK Ride</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"d7866dfa302ca9cf7a2c5c6b2fea392bb74f06f9dca00f4330a3ba621dd86e4a","category":"Cycling"}
