It turns out that some USB-C battery packs are not working properly with Apple's ‌iPhone 15‌, resulting in charging issues.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/iPhone-15-USB-C-Port-Keynote.jpeg\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"898\" />\r<br />\nAs highlighted <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/iPhone15Pro/comments/16rtpvf/i_plugged_my_iphone_15_pro_into_this_brand_new/\">on Reddit</a> and <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/anker-power-bank-not-charging-15pm-due-to-reverse-charging.2403990/\">the <em>MacRumors</em> forums</a>, not all existing USB-C power banks can be used with the ‌iPhone 15‌ models, perhaps due to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>'s reverse charging feature. In some cases, the ‌iPhone 15‌ will fail to charge, or the ‌iPhone 15‌ will charge the power bank.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA range of different power banks are affected, and because of the wide number of them on the market, it is impossible to list the models that are non-functional. One version that fails to work is the Anker PowerCore Slim 10K PD, and a customer who contacted Anker was told that the only way to get the power bank to charge the ‌iPhone‌ is to use the USB-A port.\r<br />\n<blockquote>It seems that due to the iPhone 15 series' reverse charging function, the USB C's port charging of Anker PowerCore Slim 10k PD will be influenced, which does not have a solution currently. The only way to get your iPhone charged is to use the USB A port.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAnker will do more tests on all of our power banks to see whether this is the issue with certain power banks and try to get a solution.</blockquote>\r<br />\nThe ‌iPhone 15‌ models are able to charge an Apple Watch, AirPods, or another ‌iPhone‌ through the USB-C port, and there is a possibility that this functionality is what's impacting some power banks. Most USB-C power banks with Power Delivery seem to be working as intended, including a number of models tested by <em>MacRumors</em>, but ‌iPhone 15‌ owners should be aware that some could be incompatible.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15\">iPhone 15 (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/28/iphone-15-usb-c-power-banks/\">Some USB-C Power Banks Fail to Work With iPhone 15</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/some-usb-c-power-banks-fail-to-work-with-iphone-15.2405365/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"809e82682a7167f439b0c9dd1bf4ac9141e3659034475beabec770fec86cd98d","category":"Apple"}
