The phone is also a little smaller than past models, thanks to slimmer display bezels. The screen sizes stay the same—6.1 inches for the base model and 6.7 inches for the big one.</p>\n<div><img alt=\"The iPhone 15 Pro comes in four colors.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Screenshot-2023-09-12-at-1.59.20-PM.jpeg\" /><p>The iPhone 15 Pro comes in four colors.

By default, it still serves as a mute switch, but users can change it to launch apps or the camera, or even to launch custom Shortcuts workflows.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1964599#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1964599&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4b382439fab91318e8d0bca6ea30b2049aa79ef381f4f28b79edcedbcfa7e175","category":"Tech"}
