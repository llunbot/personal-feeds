Elsewhere are what look like detachable earpads, similar to AirPods Max, and behind them is a \"user-visible name plate\" showing the model and serial number. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nSpecs-wise, aside from support for fast charging and Bluetooth 5.3, the filing doesn't reveal much about the \"Wireless Noise Canceling Stereo Headset,\" but they are made in Malaysia and described as an engineering prototype rather than pre-production â€“ just like the XM5 filing, which turned out to be accurate.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/sony-wh1000-xm5-filing.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1080\" height=\"640\" /><div><em>Image credit: The Walkman Blog</em></div>\r<br />\nWith so much going for the current model, it's difficult to know what improvements Sony is aiming for in the XM6's, but anticipation for their release is likely to be high nevertheless. Comparing the filing's short term confidentiality (STC) date to the XM5 filing, <em>The Walkman Blog</em> believes we can expect the headphones to be announced around late April to early May, 2025.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sony/\">Sony</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/24/sony-wh-1000xm6-headphones-fc-filing/\">Unreleased Sony WH-1000XM6 Headphones Appear in FCC Filing</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/unreleased-sony-wh-1000xm6-headphones-appear-in-fcc-filing.2448026/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0337c4dfaa18fcc8b51b8ce4e1c0b9b9983a9400f1174deca94f851d2c39754a","category":"Apple"}
