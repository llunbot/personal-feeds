Reports from the talk published on Chinese social media and by state-run news agencies were short on technical details and did not discuss any of the preparations for the mission.</p>\n<p>Public pronouncements by Chinese officials on future space missions typically come true, but China is embarking on challenging efforts to explore the Moon and Mars. China aims to land astronauts on the lunar surface by 2030 in a step toward eventually building a Moon base called the International Lunar Research Station.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047760#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047760&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"91d1106c9fa0128679b0a21cd85fe42c854100dcec8514ff71af76ff662217c6","category":"Tech"}
