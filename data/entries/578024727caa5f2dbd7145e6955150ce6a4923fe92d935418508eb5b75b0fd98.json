The bug is about as bad as you can get, with users having \"unusable\" devices due to getting locked out of device storage. A few users are <a href=\"https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/305766503#comment284\">likening</a> the experience to getting hit with \"ransomware.\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/16/23919957/pixel-6-android-14-upgrade-bugs-multiple-user-profiles\">Earlier reports</a> had this bug limited to the Pixel 6, but Google seemed to ignore those reports, and now with a wider rollout, this does not seem device-specific.
