What struck me was the Yeti-inspired top tube cable routing, the unique fork with corked ends (for stashing), a stunning head badge, Paul Components parts, and NOS Odyssey Svelte skewers that were mis-assembled from the factory with the incorrect orientation. I loved the turned-down/milled brass bits and black Cerakote chainrings, with the outer acting as a bash guard, which Too Tired engraved.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Alonukis-Frameworks-Sidetracker-38.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Alonukis-Frameworks-Sidetracker-38.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Alonukis-Frameworks-Sidetracker-38.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Alonukis-Frameworks-Sidetracker-38.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Spending time poring over bikes with my lens is one of my favorite parts about framebuilder showcases, and each time I thought I was done with the Sidetracker, some new detail would reveal itself.

Rigid mountain bikes make for great all-rounders, and when they’re bomber like this, they encourage curb jibs and singletrack runs along the way. That’s what BTR Fabrications’ new production line, Rat Bikes, displayed with its Dad Rat bike. Paul Burford explained the intent behind the bike to me as I documented its jet-black sleekness on the second morning at Bespoked UK.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-BTM-Rat-Bikes-Dad-Rat-23.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-BTM-Rat-Bikes-Dad-Rat-23.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-BTM-Rat-Bikes-Dad-Rat-23.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-BTM-Rat-Bikes-Dad-Rat-23.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>These bikes feature a series of folded sheet metal details at the chainstay yoke, dropouts, and brake mounts. Paul has an in-production photo on the <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/DI8Ir7KMgj6/\" target=\"_blank\">BTR Instagram that showcases it wonderfully</a>. The intention here is to make as much of the bike in-house, saving money and fabrication time, to offer these frames as affordably as possible (£650 frame). Paul’s personal bike, pictured here, features a brilliant truss fork and a clean build, featuring <a href=\"https://www.hopetech.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Hope Tech</a> parts. We’ve got a deeper, more in-depth look at the Rat Bikes project coming later this year, so expect future updates!</p>\n<p>Until then, I just wanted to shout out Paul, who made me feel very welcome in the Bespoked UK family this past weekend.</p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/btr_fabrications/\" target=\"_blank\">@BTR_Fabrications</a></h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Cotic-FlareMax-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Cotic-FlareMax-1.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Cotic-FlareMax-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Cotic-FlareMax-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Cotic-FlareMax-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Cotic-FlareMax-2.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Cotic-FlareMax-2.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Cotic-FlareMax-2.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Cotic-FlareMax-12.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Cotic-FlareMax-12.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Cotic-FlareMax-12.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Cotic-FlareMax-12.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.cotic.co.uk/product/flareMAX\" target=\"_blank\">Cotic Bikes FlareMAX 29er Full Suspension</a></h3>\n<p>What can I even say about the FlareMAX here that hasn’t already been <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/cotic-flaremax-gen5-review/\" target=\"_blank\">said multiple times on this very website</a> over the past year and a half?

The first 100 frames were ordered in grey colour code 817. They were agented by a business that had done pink frames, and the agent just thought it was a mistake. Pink is color code 718. So, the first 100 Cotic Souls were bright Barbie pink,” Cy explained to me. This prompted them to repaint many of them grey, and some orange.

When she’s not hauling around two full-size dogs in an Omnium Cargo (non-electric, mind you!) through the streets of Berlin, she’s in the shop, mitering and fillet brazing frames. The elegantly sloped top tube allows for standover height, and the tire clearance with an MTB drivetrain allows for 27.5 x 2.3″ tires to clear the perfectly-shaped chainstays. While the bike’s paint covers Kata’s fillet brazing work, she left the stem raw to showcase her talents.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Rasch-First-Frame-26.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Rasch-First-Frame-26.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Rasch-First-Frame-26.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Rasch-First-Frame-26.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>On the last day of the show, she requested photos in a spot she had picked out in the Victoria Baths, with light flooding the beautiful green tile wall from a pre-war skylight. I just wanted to thank not only <a href=\"https://www.hopetech.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Hope Tech</a> but also <a href=\"https://seido-components.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Seido Components</a> for helping Kata present her first bike at Bespoked UK. Getting to hang out with the next generation of framebuilders is always a treat, and Kata’s style and energy were wonderful.</p>\n<p>Kata wants to one day open a class for women and other non-male people who would like to learn how to build frames. I asked her for a quote about the project:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I think working with metal is still very male-dominated and can be a barrier for those who are not cis-male socialized. I currently work in a metal shop at university, teaching students the basics of metalworking. Often, non-male students are nervous about working on the lathes, but after a short while, they usually really enjoy it, and I’m happy to support them. I want to do the same with what I enjoy the most, and that’s framebuilding.</p>\n<p>I think an experience like building your own bike can sometimes have a big impact on your life. I also did a course at Drust Cycles once, and that confirmed my decision to apply for a job in the metal workshop. I would be very happy if people would also like to share such an experience and especially the passion for bikes and cycling. But until then, I want to learn more myself.”</p></blockquote>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/rasch.cycles/\" target=\"_blank\">@RaschCycles</a></h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Sideways-Carbon-Scraps-Pub-Bike-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Sideways-Carbon-Scraps-Pub-Bike-1.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Sideways-Carbon-Scraps-Pub-Bike-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Sideways-Carbon-Scraps-Pub-Bike-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Sideways-Carbon-Scraps-Pub-Bike-16.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Sideways-Carbon-Scraps-Pub-Bike-16.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Sideways-Carbon-Scraps-Pub-Bike-16.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Sideways-Carbon-Scraps-Pub-Bike-16.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Sideways-Carbon-Scraps-Pub-Bike-3.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Sideways-Carbon-Scraps-Pub-Bike-3.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Sideways-Carbon-Scraps-Pub-Bike-3.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Sideways-Carbon-Scraps-Pub-Bike-3.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Sideways-Carbon-Scraps-Pub-Bike-12.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Sideways-Carbon-Scraps-Pub-Bike-12.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Sideways-Carbon-Scraps-Pub-Bike-12.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Sideways-Carbon-Scraps-Pub-Bike-12.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://sideways.bike/\" target=\"_blank\">Sideways Scraps Carbon Scraps Pub Bike</a></h3>\n<p>As Viola Townsend rolled her bikes through the Bespoked UK showcase on setup day, I caught up with the first-year SRAM Inclusivity scholarship winner. “The coverage on The Radavist last year sold my first bike,” she exclaimed.

Wow. I’ve known “Super” Ted since 2008, during the peak of fixed-gear madness. Ted and I have ridden in New York and Japan. The bike control this man possesses is outstanding.

Lifting it into position, I could feel a few loose linkage components, but the intent was there and it was surprisingly light. Ted mentioned the bike’s modularity, “It has a 27.5-inch rear wheel now and a 29er front, but I want to put a 26-inch wheel in the rear and a 27.5-inch wheel in the front.” Ted designed the bike to be built with 140 mm or 160 mm of rear travel, and the model can be made for 120 through 180 mm front travel. He’s also offering a titanium version which will be considerably lighter.

AND what is <em>fucking mind-blowing</em> about all this is that Ted simply sketches out by hand, without using CAD at all. It’s all in the man’s head. “I had to flip the shock around because the piggyback hit the downtube.”</p>\n<p>I could write 1000 words alone on everything we discussed, but we’ve got two more bikes to look at…</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Ted-James-Designs-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Ted-James-Designs-1.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Ted-James-Designs-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Ted-James-Designs-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Ted-James-Designs-6.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Ted-James-Designs-6.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Ted-James-Designs-6.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Ted-James-Designs-6.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Ted-James-Designs-11.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Ted-James-Designs-11.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Ted-James-Designs-11.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Ted-James-Designs-11.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Ted-James-Designs-8.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Ted-James-Designs-8.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Ted-James-Designs-8.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Ted-James-Designs-8.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://tedjamesdesign.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ted James Design Mini Velo</a></h3>\n<p>“The client is in his sixties. He was one of the early adopters of mountain bikes in the UK and just wants something to ride around in the city on.” Again, this is mad genius material from Ted James. The fully stainless steel mini velo features a Cannondale Delta V-inspired design, with a longer rear-center to keep the bike stable in cornering. Ted’s stainless mixture consists of Reynolds 953, 931, and 921. For a seatstay break, instead of using a coupler, Ted drilled and threaded the dropout, attaching the seat stay to it with a button-head bolt. (Of course, the one photo I missed focusing on this weekend was of that detail.) An eccentric bottom bracket maintains belt tension, and the custom stainless steel rack attaches to the Pacenti fork crown.</p>\n<p>This bike won “Best City/Utility” at the 2025 Bespoked UK showcase.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Ted-James-Designs-49.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Ted-James-Designs-49.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Ted-James-Designs-49.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Ted-James-Designs-49.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Ted-James-Designs-52.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Ted-James-Designs-52.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Ted-James-Designs-52.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Ted-James-Designs-52.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Ted-James-Designs-53.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Ted-James-Designs-53.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Ted-James-Designs-53.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Ted-James-Designs-53.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Ted-James-Designs-50.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Ted-James-Designs-50.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Ted-James-Designs-50.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://radavist-static-production.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Bespoked-UK-Ted-James-Designs-50.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://tedjamesdesign.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Elwood’s Ted James Design Titanium BMX</a></h3>\n<p>“I put the logo on the underside of the downtube because I figured it’d be best for photos when I’m doing tabletops,” Elwood remarked to me as I requested he pause for a second with the bike for a few photos. He’d been zipping around the car park on this titanium BMX bike, which he’s already outgrowing. “Take another run, please!” I shouted as I dialed in my shutter speed for a panning shot of him feeble grinding a Corten steel bench. “As soon as we rolled up, the security guard saw us and shook their head,” Ted laughed. Metal on metal clanged, my shutter trickled, and I had a quick chimp afterward. “Got it.
