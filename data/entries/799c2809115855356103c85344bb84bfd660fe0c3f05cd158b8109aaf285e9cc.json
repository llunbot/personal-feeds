According to several user reports online, the 17.5 update may restore photos that you have deleted long after the 30-day restore period has expired.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which could make for an embarrassing situation. A post on <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/1cryayx/latest_ios_update_has_brought_back_some_pictures/&amp;xcust=1-1-2335929-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Reddit</a> said that some of the resurrected photos had “nsfw material,” and another post said, “my photos appeared on my OLD iPad I gave to a friend.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One user in the Reddit thread <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/1cryayx/comment/l46c0ah/&amp;xcust=1-1-2335929-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">claims to be an Apple QA employee</a> and says that what’s happening is that photos that have been sent through Messages are being saved to the Photo library, and the solution is to delete the old Messages. However, a separate user replied that their restored photos were not messaged to anyone. Also, some users with this problem are using iCloud Photos, while others aren’t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As others have pointed out (in the Reddit thread and in other reports), when you delete a file–including a photo–the file isn’t really wiped out. What happens is that the reference to it is gone, but the file is still there until another file is written over it. Though you’d think that if a photo was deleted years ago and you’re regularly shooting new ones, there would be many opportunities for that old photo to be overwritten.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has not commented on the issue, but you can probably expect a point-one update to address it soon. Several users have reported that this issue existed in the 17.5 betas, but it’s not known if this is a widespread issue. I installed the iOS 17.5 update after its release on Monday and have not had any old deleted photos come back to haunt me, thank goodness.</p>\n\niOS, iPad, iPhone</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"799c2809115855356103c85344bb84bfd660fe0c3f05cd158b8109aaf285e9cc","category":"Apple"}
