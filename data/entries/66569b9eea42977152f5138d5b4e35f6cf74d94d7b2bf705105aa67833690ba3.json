The \"custom Nvidia processor\" has a GPU \"with dedicated [Ray-Tracing] Cores and Tensor Cores for stunning visuals and AI-driven enhancements,\" writes Nvidia Software Engineering VP Muni Anda.</p>\n<p>This means that, as rumored, the Switch 2 will support Nvidia's Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) upscaling technology, which helps to upscale a lower-resolution image into a higher-resolution image with less of a performance impact than native rendering and less loss of quality than traditional upscaling methods. For the Switch games that can render at 4K or at 120 FPS 1080p, DLSS will likely be responsible for making it possible.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/nvidia-confirms-the-switch-2-supports-dlss-g-sync-and-ray-tracing/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/nvidia-confirms-the-switch-2-supports-dlss-g-sync-and-ray-tracing/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"66569b9eea42977152f5138d5b4e35f6cf74d94d7b2bf705105aa67833690ba3","category":"Tech"}
