One thing we can say against it, however, is the price, because at $799, it’s certainly expensive. But if you’ve balked at the high price before, this refurbished model is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C7PJTHVM\" target=\"_blank\">down to $449 at Amazon, a good $350 under its MSRP</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, yes, we know—it’s not a new model, but it’s perfectly safe to purchase. The product was inspected, tested, and brought to its best possible shape, and instead of an Apple warranty, Amazon says it “can be returned in its original condition for a full refund or replacement within 365 days of receipt.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that that’s out of the way, here’s what you’ll love about the smartwatch. We <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1364168/apple-watch-ultra-review.html\">reviewed the Apple Watch Ultra</a> and gave it a near-perfect score, as well as our Editors’ Choice award. Our expert appreciated the rugged design and the excellent battery life, as well as the fact that you can customize the Action Button to whatever suits your needs best.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn’t just an upgrade to the regular Apple Watch model but rather a watch built with one specific target in mind: People who need a rugged tool on their wrist to safely navigate trips off the beaten path or athletes who need a reliable companion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, if you’ve been waiting for the perfect moment to get an Apple Watch Ultra – now’s the time.
