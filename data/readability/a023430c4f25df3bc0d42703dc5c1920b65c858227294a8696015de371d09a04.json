In fact, it has nearly 1,500 five-star Amazon ratings. If your primary goal is to be able to tow kids on calm roads and bike paths, and you won’t get into any majorly rugged territory, the Instep Quick-N-EZ is a great option—and we love it for running errands (like grocery shopping) long after your kids have outgrown it!</p><p>Admittedly, what you see is what you get. At this low price point, you likely won’t be able to resell it once your kids outgrow it, and it will be creakier and less durable than the higher-price options on this list. The weight limit is also 20 pounds lower than the others at 80 pounds, making it less ideal for seating two kids as they grow.

Honestly, clamps are clumsy, can scratch your paint, and some versions never feel very secure. But, they can be quick and easy to move from bike to bike.</span></p><p><span>For the axle mounts, you’ll need to make sure you order the correct parts based on whether you have Quick Release skewers or Thru-Axles. Some brands have quick-connect hardware that lets you leave the mount on your bike permanently, then just disconnect the trailer at a pivot point.</span></p><p>Keep in mind that this adds stress to your frame and axle, so they’re best placed on commuter bikes or mountain bikes, not your lightweight road racing bike.</p><p>If you’re mounting it to an e-bike, double check the axle type and that it won’t interfere with any wheel speed sensors or wiring. E-bikes that use a mid-mount motor (at the cranks) should mostly have regular axle setups, but bikes with rear hub motors might have more specialized hardware.</p><p><b>One seat or two?<br></b><span>Yes, size matters in this instance. If you know you’re only going to need it for one child it will be a lot lighter and more maneuverable, taking up less space when stored – and not to mention cheaper – than if it’s wide enough for two. However, it might be nice to have that second seat as room for a friend or bag of supplies. (All of the options we listed above have room for two children.)</span></p><p><span>Some models come with cargo space behind the seats, but your kid won’t be able to access them while riding along…which could be a good thing. All the models we recommend come with 5-point harness restraints for safety.</span></p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/20082929/thule-chariot-cross-2.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/20082929/thule-chariot-cross-2.jpg\" alt=\"child bike carrier converted to jogger stroller\" width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/20082929/thule-chariot-cross-2.jpg 1280w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/20082929/thule-chariot-cross-2-297x223.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/20082929/thule-chariot-cross-2-800x600.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/20082929/thule-chariot-cross-2-120x90.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/20082929/thule-chariot-cross-2-768x576.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/20082929/thule-chariot-cross-2-696x522.jpg 696w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/20082929/thule-chariot-cross-2-1068x801.jpg 1068w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/20082929/thule-chariot-cross-2-560x420.jpg 560w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/20082929/thule-chariot-cross-2-80x60.jpg 80w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/20082929/thule-chariot-cross-2-265x198.jpg 265w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\"></a></p><p><b>Is it Convertible?</b><br><span>Does the trailer come with attachments to convert into a jogger (large front center wheel) or stroller? Some units include these options, some sell the conversion kits separately. Either way, it’s nice to have the option of wheeling the kids around on foot once you get to your destination by bike. A good bike trailer should at minimum convert to a stroller so you can run errands by bike with ease.</span></p><p>Some even have kits to convert into snow sleds… And others have waist attachments for hands-free hauling:</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/20083542/thule-chariot-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/20083542/thule-chariot-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"938\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/20083542/thule-chariot-1.jpg 1200w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/20083542/thule-chariot-1-297x232.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/20083542/thule-chariot-1-800x625.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/20083542/thule-chariot-1-120x94.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/20083542/thule-chariot-1-768x600.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/20083542/thule-chariot-1-696x544.jpg 696w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/20083542/thule-chariot-1-1068x835.jpg 1068w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/20083542/thule-chariot-1-537x420.jpg 537w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"></a></p><p><span><strong>Ease of use<br></strong>How heavy is it?

Or something else entirely?<br></b><span>We have known some parents to take their kids in the trailer out on a mountain bike trail or two – though the trails were not super rough and rugged, it’s still something to consider. Burley’s luxury model comes with a plastic molded undercarriage to protect from rough trails, and all of its X models have added suspension on the rear wheels. (Note that none of the bike trailers we’ve listed here are truly capable of tackling singletrack—stick to wide ATV trails at most!)</span></p><p><span>In all cases, having air-filled tires (as opposed to solid rubber tires) and spoked wheels (as opposed to hard plastic wheels) will help absorb some of the vibrations and make for a smoother ride for your kiddos whether you’re on the road or a trail.</span></p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions about Kid Trailers</h2><h3>What features are most important in a kid bike trailer?</h3><p>These are the top features we’d look for on any kid hauler:</p><ul><li><strong>Inflatable tires</strong> – will ride smoother than solid rubber, easier to replace</li><li><strong>Wheels with metal spokes</strong> – makes it easier to true and repair with standard parts</li><li><strong>5-Point harness</strong> – keeps your kids securely in their seats, even if you tip it over</li><li><strong>Ventilation</strong> – front and rear panels that zip open to let air flow through</li><li><strong>Mesh front panel</strong> – lets air flow in, but protects against bugs and dirt from your rear tire</li><li><strong>Windshield</strong> – clear front window panel that zips over the mesh panel if it starts raining</li><li><strong>Solid floorboard</strong> – prevents things from poking kids feet, more stable for cargo</li><li><strong>Larger Front wheel</strong> – extends use off the bike for jogging</li><li><strong>Locking hand brake</strong> – helps you slow it down and stop when jogging with it &amp; park it on hills</li></ul><h3>Are bike trailers safe for my kids?</h3><p>Yes, but you need to take all of the normal precautions, follow the rules of the road, and make sure your kids are wearing helmets inside the trailer. But there are a few more tips for keeping them safe…and upright.</p><ol><li>The trailer is wider than your bike, so you’ll need to ride farther from the edge of the road lest it roll one wheel off the side (or up onto a curb). This might be scary at best, or cause you to wreck at worst.</li><li>If you’re going to take it on the trails, make sure your singletrack is wide enough for the trailer and your increased turning radius.</li><li>Yep, you’ll have to take turns wider, too…just like semi trucks pulling a trailer, you’ll need more room to get around a corner.</li><li>The trailer is essentially a tricycle, which means you can flip it if you corner too fast or sharp. We’ve done that, fortunately only while hauling cargo in ours, and it’s not fun.</li><li>Kids like to climb around, so be sure to use the seatbelt straps in the trailer to keep them safely inside.</li><li>Kids should be wearing helmets (and so should you!)</li></ol><h3>Should I buy new or used?</h3><p>This Bikerumor staffer lucked out when it was time for us to find a trailer – we purchased it for $50 from a friend who didn’t need it anymore. At that point we weren’t being choosy, it fit two kids safely and attached to our bike, the wheels weren’t falling off (yet), and we had only one minor fabric tear to repair.</p><p>If you’re not picky, or you’re on a tight budget, keep in mind that kids outgrow these all the time, so there’s a healthy used market for them. That said, make sure you look it over well for signs of damage, wobbly wheels, or tears in the supporting material. Most kid trailers’ fabric panels are stitched around the frame, so if those are showing signs of wear, the weight of your kids could tear the fabric quickly and make it unsafe to use.</p><p>Connect it to your bike, put your kids in it, and give it a test ride. Does it roll smoothly…and straight? Is it clean? Free of weird odors? Kids spill stuff, sometimes from a cup, and sometimes from a hole in their body, so give it a thorough look over. And a sniff test if you dare.</p><p>The upside to buying new is that you’ll likely be able to pass it along to family or friends for years to come, then sell it once everyone in your clan has outgrown it.</p><h3>Can I put my dog in my children’s bike trailer?</h3><p>You can, yes, but if you’re shopping for a trailer specifically for Fido, you may be better served with a dog specific one, since they have different needs than your three-year-old! <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2021/07/05/best-bike-gear-for-your-trail-dog/\">(We have a whole list of our favorite dog accessories for the ride right here.)</a></p><h3>What’s the difference between a Jogger and a Stroller wheel?</h3><p>A jogger wheel will be larger diameter, helping it roll over bumps and potholes easier, especially since they’re usually air-filled pneumatic tires like a regular bicycle tire. The larger wheel will roll more quietly and feel a lot smoother, but it’s usually fixed to roll in a straight line. That means you’ll have to lift it slightly to turn, but don’t worry, it’s easy…just push down on the handlebar slightly as you round the corner.</p><p>A stroller wheel is smaller, and can be solid rubber or another firm material. It’s usually on a pivot, like a shopping cart front wheel, to make it easy to cut sharp corners, like between racks in a store. It won’t roll smoothly or quietly enough to work for jogging, but it’s easier to maneuver in crowded spaces.</p><hr><p><em>Disclosure: Some of these links are affiliate links that may earn a small commission for Bikerumor if you click on them and buy something.
