Given that there’s no defined metrics by which to measure such a thing, the answer will always be subjective. For you, the best climb in the world might be the testing little leg-stretcher half a mile from your front door, and more power to you if that’s the case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But canvas enough opinions and the same names will start to repeat themselves: the Galibier, Tourmalet and Mont Ventoux, Sa Calobra… and the Passo dello Stelvio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Stelvio is in many ways the ultimate climb. It has the altitude and the difficulty, the hairpins and the grand vistas, but it also has the heritage – both in cycling terms and as a focal point in local history.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/new-issue-163-1-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/new-issue-163-1-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/new-issue-163-1-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/new-issue-163-1-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/new-issue-163-1-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/new-issue-163-1-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/new-issue-163-1-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/new-issue-163-1-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/new-issue-163-1-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/new-issue-163-1.webp 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Not for nothing did it take top spot in our <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/introducing-the-cyclist-100-classic-climbs\" target=\"_blank\">guide to the 100 best climbs in the world</a>.

The Swiss time-trial and Classics specialist racked up plenty of race wins across his impressive career, and bowed out from the sport in 2016 while still very much at the peak of his powers. Nearly a decade removed from his retirement, Cancellara chats candidly about the challenges he faced when hanging up his wheels, both in embracing life as a family man and finding a new role within cycling as a team owner.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Web_163_Event_BrightMidnight12-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Web_163_Event_BrightMidnight12-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Web_163_Event_BrightMidnight12-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Web_163_Event_BrightMidnight12-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Web_163_Event_BrightMidnight12-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Web_163_Event_BrightMidnight12-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Web_163_Event_BrightMidnight12-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Web_163_Event_BrightMidnight12-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Web_163_Event_BrightMidnight12-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Web_163_Event_BrightMidnight12.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>And stepping well away from the sharp end of pro cycling, our June issue switches gear as we step into the world of The Bright Midnight Norway, an 1,100km race through the Norwegian wilderness that takes place in mid-summer, when the sun barely sets.
