You can send this mélange to a friend over any communication platform—Telegram, WhatsApp, Google Chat, etc.—and then they run it through Nahoft on their device to decipher what you've said.</p>\n<p>Released last week on Google Play by United for Iran, a San Francisco–based human rights and civil liberties group, Nahoft is designed to address multiple aspects of Iran's Internet crackdown. In addition to generating coded messages, the app can also encrypt communications and embed them imperceptibly in image files, a technique known as <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/steganography-hacker-lexicon/\">steganography</a>. Recipients then use Nahoft to inspect the image file on their end and extract the hidden message.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1796375#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1796375&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0acb9b80ff7f102d2540c0011008a65f8e7816388f543836e74caf4a6f12a13c","category":"Tech"}
