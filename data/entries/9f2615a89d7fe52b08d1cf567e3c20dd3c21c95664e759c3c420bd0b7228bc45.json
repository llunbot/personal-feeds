Ashamed, she smiled with lips pressed closed. Her dentist offered to fix most of her teeth with root canals and crowns, Carroll said, but she was wary of traveling a long road of dental work.</p>\n<p>Then Carroll saw a TV commercial for another path: ClearChoice Dental Implant Centers. The company advertises that it can give patients “<a href=\"https://www.clearchoice.com/why-clearchoice/one-day-dental-implants/\">a new smile in as little as one day</a>” by surgically replacing teeth instead of fixing them.</p>\n<p>So Carroll saved and borrowed for the surgery, she said. In an interview and a lawsuit, Carroll said that at a ClearChoice clinic in New Jersey in 2021, she agreed to pay $31,000 to replace all her natural upper teeth with pearly white prosthetic ones.
