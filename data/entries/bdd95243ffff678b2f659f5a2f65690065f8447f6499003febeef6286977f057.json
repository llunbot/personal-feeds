The work, which remains early, seeks to make the device lighter and slightly smaller to address complaints that the first-generation Vision Pro feels too heavy on the head.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is also apparently exploring how to make a headset purchase simpler for those who wear glasses. The first-generation Vision Pro requires wearers of glasses to separately purchase Zeiss prescription lenses that snap on to the displays using magnets. The company reportedly made this decision to reduce the overall thickness of the headset, but the need to stock thousands of different lens combinations is reportedly proving difficult.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith the second-generation, Apple is considering shipping custom-built Vision Pro headsets with preinstalled prescription lenses directly from the factory. Gurman notes that this invokes a different set of problems with sharing a headset, reselling it, and when a user's optical prescription changes over time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to other reports, the second-generation Vision Pro headset is not expected to launch until around <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/16/apple-second-gen-headset-low-high-end/\">2025</a> to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/low-cost-vision-pro-canceled/\">2027</a>. The first-generation launches early next year.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/09/vision-pro-2-focusing-on-size-weight-lenses/\">Gurman: Vision Pro 2 Development Focusing on Size, Weight, and Prescription Lenses</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-vision-pro-2-development-focusing-on-size-weight-and-prescription-lenses.2406901/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"bdd95243ffff678b2f659f5a2f65690065f8447f6499003febeef6286977f057","category":"Apple"}
