The bombastic commissioner, with his swoop of white hair, became the public face of Brussels’ irritation with American tech giants, touring Silicon Valley last summer to personally remind the industry of looming regulatory deadlines.</p>\n<p>Combative and outspoken, Breton warned that Apple had spent too long “<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/apple-hits-a-major-roadblock-as-eu-targets-app-store/\">squeezing</a>” other companies out of the market.
