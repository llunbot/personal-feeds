Dangerholm says it shifts from looking green, gold and almost blue to completely transparent so that you can see the black carbon fibre, depending on the lighting. In low light, it’s said to look olive green. </span></p>\n<p><span>The painting process started by stripping the frame and parts down to bare carbon before adding the paint, which Dangerholm says weighs only 38g.</span></p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Dangerholm Scott Foil Liquid\" title=\"DANGERHOLM_2023_SCOTT_BIKE_PHOTO_BY_DANGERHOLM 24\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Liquid Gold paint extends to the bars and even the brake levers.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Gustav Gullholm </i></span></div>\n<p><span>The Syncros Creston iC SL Aero cockpit has also had the paint treatment. The bars are wrapped in Syncros Super Light bar tape and fitted with a Syncros computer mount.</span></p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Dangerholm Scott Foil Liquid\" title=\"DANGERHOLM_2023_SCOTT_BIKE_PHOTO_BY_DANGERHOLM 11\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Coco Designs carbon saddle weighs just 65g.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Gustav Gullholm </i></span></div>\n<p><span>The Foil has two seatpost options: the standard solid post and the CFT comfort variant, which has a cut-out at the rear for a light. </span></p>\n<p><span>Dangerholm has added a custom-painted 65g Coco Designs Spline saddle for the lightweight version. He says the saddle’s flex makes it very comfortable, despite the absence of padding.</span></p>\n<h2>New Kogel Kolossos Aero OSPW system</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Dangerholm Scott Foil Liquid\" title=\"DANGERHOLM_2023_SCOTT_BIKE_PHOTO_BY_DANGERHOLM 07\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The bike features aero titanium chainrings.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Gustav Gullholm </i></span></div>\n<p><span>The groupset for the Scott Foil Liquid is </span><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/sram-12-speed-red-etap-axs-hrd-review/\"><span>SRAM Red AXS</span></a>, <span>but with plenty of customisation. </span></p>\n<p><span>Even the brake levers have been stripped and repainted to match the bike. The standard Red crankset has been replaced by a Sturdy Cycles titanium one, which includes 3D-printed aero crank arms, a 50-tooth aero chainring and a titanium axle housed in a Kogel Ceramic bottom bracket.</span></p>\n<p><span>Dangerholm says that, with his mountain biking background, the larger jumps between ratios from </span><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/1x-drivetrains/\"><span>going 1x</span></a><span> didn’t bother him – plus it’s more aero.</span></p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Dangerholm Scott Foil Liquid\" title=\"DANGERHOLM_2023_SCOTT_BIKE_PHOTO_BY_DANGERHOLM 26\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Kogel Kolossos Aero derailleur cage is a pre-production model.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Gustav Gullholm </i></span></div>\n<p><span>At the rear is a </span><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/gravel-groupset/sram-red-etap-axs-xplr/\"><span>SRAM Red AXS XPLR</span></a><span> wide-range derailleur, which was taken apart and polished, so that it matched the pre-production Kogel Kolossos Aero OSPW system, a new model due to be launched this summer. Dangerholm says he swaps between a 10-36t and a 10-44t SRAM Force cassette, dependent on the terrain.</span></p>\n<p><span>There’s a standard SRAM Red flattop chain and </span><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2021-wahoo-speedplay-pedals/\"><span>Wahoo Speedplay Nano</span></a><span> pedals to round the drivetrain off.</span></p>\n<h2>Logo-less tyres</h2>\n<p><span>The brake calipers are from German brand Trickstuff, whose brakes are claimed to be the lightest in the mountain bike world, while its Power brake pads make them among the most powerful too. </span></p>\n<p><span>Dächle Ultra Light 160mm front and 140mm rear brake rotors are also from Trickstuff.</span></p>\n<p><span>The wheels are Bike Ahead Composites Aero six-spoke, one-piece carbon, which Dangerholm says weigh 1,450g. </span></p>\n<p><span>They’re shod with 25mm front and 28mm rear </span><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/michelin-power-cup/\"><span>Michelin Power Cup</span></a><span> Competition Line tyres, which have had their logos sanded off to avoid sullying the bike’s lines. No tubeless here: they’re set up with Revoloop Ultra Race 25g tubes.</span></p>\n<p><span>Despite all the upgrades, the Dangerholm Scott Foil RC weighs 7.1kg, so the UCI commissioners shouldn’t be put out too much if one turns up at the next pro race. They won’t like the unsanctioned solid-spoked wheels, though.</span></p>\n<h2>Dangerholm Scott Foil RC Liquid specifications</h2>\n<ul><li><b>Frame:</b><span> Scott Foil RC HMX Size L/56cm</span></li>\n<li><b>Fork:</b><span> Scott Foil HMX      </span></li>\n<li><b>Crankset:</b><span> Sturdy Cycles 3D Printed Titanium 175mm/Aero 50t chainring</span></li>\n<li><b>Bottom bracket: </b><span>Kogel Ceramic Road</span></li>\n<li><b>Pedals:</b><span> Wahoo Speedplay Nano            </span></li>\n<li><b>Bars: </b><span>Syncros Creston iC SL Aero 90x400mm                                                                 </span></li>\n<li><b>Saddles: </b><span>Coco Design Spline 3K 130mm / Syncros Belcarra V 1.0 Cut-Out                 </span></li>\n<li><b>Seatpost:</b><span> Syncros Duncan SL Aero / Syncros Duncan SL Aero CFT + Campbell 20 Aero Light                                   </span></li>\n<li><b>Cassette: </b><span>SRAM Force 10-36T + optional 10-44T</span></li>\n<li><b>Rear derailleur: </b><span>SRAM RED AXS XPLR</span></li>\n<li><b>Rear derailleur cage:</b><span> Kogel Kolossos Aero</span></li>\n<li><b>Shifters/brake levers: </b><span>SRAM RED AXS</span></li>\n<li><b>Brake calipers:</b><span> Trickstuff C22 Flatmount with Trickstuff Power Pads</span></li>\n<li><b>Brake discs:</b><span> Trickstuff Dächle UL 160mm + 140mm</span></li>\n<li><b>Brake hardware: </b><span>Trickstuff bolts rear, SRAM titanium front</span></li>\n<li><b>Wheels:</b><span> Bike Ahead Composites AERO</span></li>\n<li><b>Tyres:</b><span> Michelin Power Cup Competition Line 25mm + 28mm</span></li>\n<li><b>Tubes: </b><span>Revoloop Ultra Race</span></li>\n<li><b>Bottle cages: </b><span>Syncros Coupe SL</span></li>\n<li><b>Total weight: </b><span>7.11kg/15.67lbs</span></li>\n</ul>","author":"Paul Norman","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"08bd815545c4ec2152b4671fa83a64eb42ac76b63f9d793dc39740ba50ad5d4c","category":"Cycling"}
