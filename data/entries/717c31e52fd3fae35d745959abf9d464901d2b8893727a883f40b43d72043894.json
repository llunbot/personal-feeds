But you can’t just record something on your phone and then expect it to gain traction.

It’s easy to use, has features built in — such as anti-collision tech and one-key return — for ensured safety, and you can connect it to your phone so you can see what it’s capturing in real-time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, to make sure all the angles are covered, the package includes a second drone — the Alpha Z Pro — which is also capable of capturing video in 4K. It doesn’t run as long as the Phantom K (7 minutes as opposed to 15 minutes), but having a second drone means you’ll spend more time getting the footage you need and less time waiting for batteries to charge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Last Chance:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2027926/dont-miss-it-this-two-day-flash-sale-gets-you-a-lifetime-license-to-microsoft-office-for-34-97.html\">Purchase a lifetime license to MS Office for just $34.97.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a content creator and want to bring your production values up a notch, then this bundle is worth checking out.
