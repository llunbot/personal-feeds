He did not comment on the iMac or other Macs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://superchargednews.com/2023/10/14/apple-launching-new-ipads-this-week/\"><em>Supercharged News</em></a> and <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2023/10/15/apple-to-announce-new-ipad-models-this-week-featuring-upgraded-chips/\"><em>9to5Mac</em></a> this weekend both independently reported that Apple plans to announce updated iPad Air, iPad mini, and entry-level iPad models this week, citing sources. Both publications said the iPad Air will be updated with the M2 chip, and said the iPad mini will be updated with the A16 Bionic chip.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt should be a fascinating week ahead for the rumor mill. Who will be right?
