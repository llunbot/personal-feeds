According to Mark Gurman, that’s not going to change with the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1351959/iphone-15-plus-pro-ultra-rumors-specs-release-price.html\">iPhone 15</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Gurman claims that Apple is preparing an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/831417/apple-september-iphone-event-date-time.html\">iPhone launch event</a> with “recorded video + people watching at the Apple campus + hands on afterwards.” That’s the same format as WWDC and last year’s iPhone 14 event, which also didn’t have a live stage component. Apple’s last live event was “By Innovation Only” on September 10, 2019, where it unveiled the iPhone 11, Apple Watch Series 5, and 7th-generation iPad.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>Not that there was any doubt, but Sept 12 event is being prepared as an in-person launch. So recorded video + people watching at the Apple campus + hands on afterwards. Same as the iPhone 14. Here’s what to expect <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://t.co/mFZbdRMugD&amp;xcust=1-1-2025824-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">https://t.co/mFZbdRMugD</a> <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://t.co/ljf0DW95zj&amp;xcust=1-1-2025824-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">https://t.co/ljf0DW95zj</a></p>— Mark Gurman (@markgurman) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1689088616772026368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-2025824-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">August 9, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is expected to use the September event to unveil the iPhone 15 family, Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2, and possibly a new iPad mini. All signs point to an event on either Tuesday, September 12, or Wednesday, September 13. Last week, 9to5Mac reported that the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2019105/apple-fall-event-september-12-13-iphone-15.html\">event would be on Wednesday, September 13,</a> but Gurman claims “signs are increasingly pointing” to an event on Tuesday, September 12.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone 15 is expected to feature a number of upgrades, including a new design with curved edges, USB-C instead of Lightning, and the expansion of the Dynamic Island to all four models. Most notably, the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1487037/iphone-15-pro-max-ultra-design-display-camera-price-rumors.html\">iPhone 15 Pro Max</a> will reportedly have a new periscope telephoto lens for stronger zoom.</p>\n\niPhone</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"172158909819fb4bdad777e8cb06c9d6bfcc10c4d709920d54cfe54155049aef","category":"Apple"}
