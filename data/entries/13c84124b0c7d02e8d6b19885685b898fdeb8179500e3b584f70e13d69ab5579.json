It resulted in over 400 failed 911 calls.</p>\n<p>\"The 911 outage occurred during testing of portions of AT&amp;T's 911 network,\" the FCC said. \"During the testing, an AT&amp;T contractor's technician inadvertently disabled a portion of the network, and AT&amp;T's system did not automatically adjust to accommodate the disabled portion of the network, resulting in the outage. The testing was not associated with any planned maintenance activities and, thus, did not undergo the stringent technical review that would have otherwise been conducted.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045525#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045525&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"13c84124b0c7d02e8d6b19885685b898fdeb8179500e3b584f70e13d69ab5579","category":"Tech"}
