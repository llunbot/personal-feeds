Eagle-eyed viewers might recall this photo from that weekend by Mr. John Watson.</em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/08/DSC04402.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /> <img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/08/DSC04392.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/08/DSC04401.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>In the past 6 years, I’ve raced &amp; ridden &amp; toured on this beauty in Louisiana, North and <a href=\"https://www.goldrushgravelgrinder.com/\" target=\"_blank\">South Dakota</a>, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. By the end of last season, the frame was showing some beauty marks, including a little surface rust under the downtube so I sent it back to Breadwinner early this year for a repaint. Rather than a straight redux of the white/baby blue, I knew I wanted something fresh. I grew up racing BMX, then graduated to mountain biking. Back then road bikes simply meant “ten speeds” and held no allure. However, like many, I was intrigued by <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2017/01/a-chat-with-a-legend-20-questions-with-john-tomac/\" target=\"_blank\">John Tomac’s drop-bar mountain bikes</a>, and stoked to see images of North Dakota native <a href=\"https://pezcyclingnews.com/latestnews/gavia-1988-andy-hampstens-epic-stage/\" target=\"_blank\">Andy Hampsten in the snow on the Gavia in the ’88 Giro</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/08/DSC04411.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/08/DSC04429.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/08/DSC04409.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I quickly developed a penchant for long, exploratory days in the saddle, which ultimately led me to the realization that road riding is about as punk rock as it gets, Being a lover of all things bicycling, I found few things quite as liberating as riding drop bars in the dirt, dipping into rogue single track connectors while on a 5-hour ride. Back then if you could stuff a 28c in your road bike you were lucky. I started with a Bridgestone RB-2, then a Surly Pacer, and eventually picked up an Eddy Merckx Corsa that could fit 32c Vittoria file treads.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/08/New-Project-2021-08-17-19_57_03.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Anyone who’s ridden a classic steel Eddy Merckx can tell you that the ride is just sublime, the perfect blend of resilience, acceleration, and comfort evenly matched. That Corsa frame moved on to a good friend of mine, and I did briefly actually own, then sold a 7-11 replica Merckx w DA 7400, but I later scored (and still have and ride) one of Andy Bishop’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7hQuLcFsI4\" target=\"_blank\">Team Motorola Merckx frames</a>, built with 25th Anniversary Dura Ace. When it came time to repaint the <a href=\"https://breadwinnercycles.com/product/b-road/\" target=\"_blank\">B-Road</a> I bounced a few ideas back and forth with <a href=\"https://breadwinnercycles.com/tag/ira-ryan-cycles/\" target=\"_blank\">Ira Ryan</a>, an equally obsessed fan of classic cycling style.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/08/DSC04441.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/08/DSC04452.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>An early contender was the Team Z Lemond bikes, but then I had an epiphany: the classic, elegant 7-11 paint job is just too good to resist. I emailed a photo to Ira and, *boom* we both agreed that was the one. Ironically, this all transpired before I took the job at <a href=\"https://sugarwheelworks.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sugar Wheel Works</a> and moved to Portland, where I now get to see the magic happen on a daily basis at Breadwinner. When the Bready Merckx came back from the painter I was basically picking my jaw up off the floor, then set to work tracking down a crucial silver 105 kit.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/08/DSC04445.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/08/DSC04431.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The white <a href=\"https://onyxrp.com/store/mtb-hubs/onyx-vesper-mtb-iso-hg-11spd-135-qr-rear-hub/\" target=\"_blank\">Onyx Racing hubs</a> were already waiting in the wings, along with my favorite tires, <a href=\"https://www.panaracerusa.com/collections/gravel/products/gravelking-slick-folding-gravel-tires?variant=34825709551778\" target=\"_blank\">Panaracer Gravelking Slicks</a>. An 20-year-old OG Moots seat post made the cut, along with a silver Whisky Parts Co. cockpit. But I think the piece de resistance is really the <a href=\"https://www.paulcomp.com/shop/components/brakes/disc-brakes/i-s-klamper/\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Component Klampers</a> (silver, natch) with the custom green + red dial adjusters. I finished assembling it and taped the bars at midnight on Friday the 13th, then rode it 104.7 miles the next day at the Swift Summit 100.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/08/DSC04478.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>This thing is a work of art and I’m grateful and thankful every time I throw a leg over it. xoxo. – Hurl Everstone</p>\n<p>____</p>\n<p><em>We’d like to thank all of you who have <a href=\"mailto:readersrides@theradavist.com\" target=\"_blank\">submitted Readers Rides</a> builds to be shared over here.
