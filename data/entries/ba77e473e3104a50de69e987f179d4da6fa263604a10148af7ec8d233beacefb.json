The steering lock, locking brake lever mod, and removable (yet secure) basket for a tiny dog kept the gears turning in my mind while creating the design.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/PBE-2021-CHAPMAN-13.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/PBE-2021-CHAPMAN-18.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Building with classic Nervex Professional lugs was a rarity for me and they ended up requiring lot more work than modern castings.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/PBE-2021-CHAPMAN-35.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The combination front cable hanger and steering lock design had been in the back of my mind for some time. If you only knew the hours that went into designing and making this little thing! I obviously can’t charge an hourly rate for this little guy but I learned a lot and that’s worth something. I was inspired by Mike Barry from <a href=\"https://mariposabicycles.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Mariposa Bicycles</a> when I saw a similar mechanism on one of his touring creations at <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efao4N4OzPY\" target=\"_blank\">J.P. Weigle’s French Fender Day</a> some years ago.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/PBE-2021-CHAPMAN-21.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/PBE-2021-CHAPMAN-37.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I was also inspired by 80s BMX rear brake de-tanglers that utilized the pressure between the upper headset cup and head tube to hold the lower cable plate in place. This proved to be a much cleaner option than attaching a special braze-on to the head lug.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/PBE-2021-CHAPMAN-6.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/PBE-2021-CHAPMAN-43.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I fabricated the rack, along with the stem. For the basket that attaches to the front rack (not pictured) there will have to be a bottom or lining put in for the pup.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/PBE-2021-CHAPMAN-26.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/PBE-2021-CHAPMAN-24.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/PBE-2021-CHAPMAN-20.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The drivetrain is Dura Ace 7800 and the brakes are vintage MAFAC Competition with a combination of <a href=\"https://cyclesgrandbois.com/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Grand Bois</a> and <a href=\"https://www.renehersecycles.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Rene Herse</a> hardware.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/PBE-2021-CHAPMAN-5.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I cut down the <a href=\"https://www.sim.works/collections/fenders-simworks-by-honjo\" target=\"_blank\">Honjo fenders</a> so the bike can stand vertical on the rear wheel if necessary (without dog in basket obviously!)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/PBE-2021-CHAPMAN-6.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>One point of minor irritation with this project was the Challenge 30mm tires measured small at 26mm. They are definitely the skinniest tires I’ve had on one of my bike builds in a long while! That said, they are <em>nice</em> tires.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/PBE-2021-CHAPMAN-29.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/12/PBE-2021-CHAPMAN-45.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The paint was also done by me in-house — It’s a one-person show over here building complete bikes at a glacial pace! Ultimately, this design and build took me longer than usual, but I think it was worth it!</p>\n<p><em>Check out more of Brian’s designs at <a href=\"https://www.chapmancycles.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Chapman Cycles</a>.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2021/12/chapman-cycles-basket-commuter/\">2021 Philly Bike Expo: Chapman Cycles Basket Commuter</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"Josh Weinberg","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"ba77e473e3104a50de69e987f179d4da6fa263604a10148af7ec8d233beacefb","category":"Cycling"}
