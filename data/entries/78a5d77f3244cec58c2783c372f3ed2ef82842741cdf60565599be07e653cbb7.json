The device will apparently feature a USB-C port, moving the ‌iPhone SE‌ away from Lightning for the first time. It will also purportedly have <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/\">Face ID</a>, dispelling previous rumors that the ‌iPhone SE‌ <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/28/no-sign-of-iphone-se-4-with-touch-id-side-button/\">could retain a Touch ID</a> button.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMost interestingly, they claim that the device will sport an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/26/ios-17-beta-action-button-iphone-15-pro/\">Action Button</a> like the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a> and ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max. This would be a clear differentiator between the ‌iPhone SE‌ and the ‌iPhone 15‌ and ‌iPhone 15‌ Plus, which are not expected to offer the feature. The ‌iPhone SE‌ will also reportedly retain a single rear camera setup like the current model.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEarlier this week, it was reported that manufacturers are currently <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/11/suppliers-bidding-on-iphone-se-4-displays/\">bidding to receive orders</a> from Apple for the fourth-generation ‌iPhone SE‌'s OLED display panels. The third-generation ‌iPhone SE‌ has an LCD display. The next-generation device is also expected to sport Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/12/iphone-se-5g-modem-2025-launch-rumor/\">long-rumored custom 5G modem</a>, but it is not expected to launch until 2025.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<strong>More to follow...</strong><div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/unknownz21/\">Unknownz21</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE\">iPhone SE (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/13/iphone-se-4-to-feature-action-button-and-more/\">iPhone SE 4 Rumored to Feature Action Button, USB-C, Face ID, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-se-4-rumored-to-feature-action-button-usb-c-face-id-and-more.2398517/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"78a5d77f3244cec58c2783c372f3ed2ef82842741cdf60565599be07e653cbb7","category":"Apple"}
