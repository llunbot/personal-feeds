Whatever it is called in the future, Project Q confirms a long-standing rumor: It's a new PlayStation handheld.</p>\n<p>The device will be focused on streaming; Sony says it will allow users to stream any non-VR game from a local PlayStation 5 console using Remote Play over Wi-Fi. In fact, it won't be able to play games on its own; it's all about the streaming functionality.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1942039#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1942039&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1c1361033df32ab7a9c93722cab2fab2871a79103c96c5bad2b9e5de6f445c1f","category":"Tech"}
