This clump of proliferative cells, which are similar to stem cells, can repopulate body parts by dividing over and over again. While the cells are still undifferentiated in the beginning, they eventually form specific cell types like muscle and skin.</p>\n<p>The process of blastema formation in some other animals has been studied, but how they form in jellyfish was still a mystery. Led by postdoctoral researcher Sosuke Fujita, the team at the University of Tokyo and Tohoku University in Japan wanted to establish a baseline for non-bilaterian regeneration by finding out how a blastema helps regrow tentacles in jellyfish. Would their blastema formation process be different from that in bilaterians?</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1993428#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1993428&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Elizabeth Rayne","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"53d4f4f87d38099c2f6c9f196bd741f24c471f11f4385cda0d3774e6d8887093","category":"Tech"}
