That brand new top-of-the-line PC could be fun, but it’s also wildly expensive and begging to become another distraction. If you want a low-cost, efficient option, check out this <a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/apple-macbook-pro-2015-15-4-i7-2-2ghz-16gb-ram-512gb-ssd-refurbished?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=apple-macbook-pro-2015-15-4-i7-2-2ghz-16gb-ram-512gb-ssd-refurbished&amp;utm_term=scsf-608591&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000002XOqYIAW&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\">MacBook Pro</a> on sale for $394.97 (reg. $899). There aren’t many left, so if it sounds right for you, hop on it before they’re gone. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What can it do?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This MacBook Pro is powered by an Intel Core i7 processor and 16GB of RAM, so it’s more than ready to handle assignments, research, and even a few late-night Netflix sessions. With 512GB of SSD storage, there’s plenty of space for class projects, photos, and favorite apps. It has a few years on it, so gaming might not be an option, but for students who need to limit distractions, that might not be a bad thing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 15.4-inch Retina display ensures that everything looks sharp and vibrant, whether you’re typing up papers or streaming educational videos. Plus, the battery life lasts up to 9 hours, so students can tackle a full day of classes without trying to find a spare outlet in a packed classroom. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Grade “B” refurbished rating means this MacBook shows a little wear, but it’s nothing a case can’t cover. Bonus: a few scuffs might mean whoever gets this computer will feel fine bringing it with them everywhere they need it instead of leaving it home to keep it safe. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon can’t beat this price. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have until January 12 at 11:59 p.m. PT to get an <a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/apple-macbook-pro-2015-15-4-i7-2-2ghz-16gb-ram-512gb-ssd-refurbished?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=apple-macbook-pro-2015-15-4-i7-2-2ghz-16gb-ram-512gb-ssd-refurbished&amp;utm_term=scsf-608591&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000002XOqYIAW&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\">Apple MacBook Pro</a> for $394.97. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/apple-macbook-pro-2015-15-4-i7-2-2ghz-16gb-ram-512gb-ssd-refurbished?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral-cta&amp;utm_campaign=apple-macbook-pro-2015-15-4-i7-2-2ghz-16gb-ram-512gb-ssd-refurbished&amp;utm_term=scsf-608591&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000002XOqYIAW&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\"> </a></p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://cdnp1.stackassets.com/bdb9c15409369a1385b1e73eea3cab2f354c6748/store/357b528fe2dd519632ccdc77d935fac5a149b73bed7b777411d62f869b74/sale_323995_primary_image.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Apple MacBook Pro 15.4″ (2015) 2.2GHz i7 16GB RAM 512GB SSD (Refurbished) – $394.97</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/apple-macbook-pro-2015-15-4-i7-2-2ghz-16gb-ram-512gb-ssd-refurbished?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=referral-cta&amp;utm_campaign=apple-macbook-pro-2015-15-4-i7-2-2ghz-16gb-ram-512gb-ssd-refurbished&amp;utm_term=scsf-608591&amp;utm_content=a0xRn000002XOqYIAW&amp;scsonar=1\" target=\"_blank\">See Deal</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.stacksocial.com\" target=\"_blank\">StackSocial</a> prices subject to change. </em></p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"ea45aae4ee96be7fe83b139d20779a8b7b7246a9b51dffbe7e35c7d64a7a1584","category":"Apple"}
