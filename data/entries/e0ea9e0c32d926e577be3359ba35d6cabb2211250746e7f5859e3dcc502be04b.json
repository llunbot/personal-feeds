But there sometimes comes a point when you find yourself tiring of your regular routes and want to go further afield and explore the big wide world instead. If that’s the case, you should consider giving bikepacking a try.</span></p>\n<p>Like backpacking, but with the wheels to carry you faster and further, bikepacking is a great option for cyclists of any level to get out and explore under their own steam – and at their own pace. But before you set out, there’s a big question that needs answering: where will your next bikepacking adventure take you?</p>\n<p><span>A great way of exploring the many options out there is through komoot’s mobile app. The app features a new bikepacking section – all you need to do is to select ‘find your next adventure’ and choose the bikepacking option to discover a wealth of collections brimming with information, ideas and options for riders of all levels.</span></p>\n<p><span>Each collection is written by an experienced contributor who offers a day-by-day tour breakdown (or a selection of handpicked tours that can easily be combined into a multi-day route). These include stories of their own adventures coupled with useful information for anyone looking to replicate their bikepacking route – as well as photographs, highlights of the route, stats and a detailed elevation profile – so you can get a clear picture of what the tour involves, and will know what to expect if you choose to travel it too.</span></p>\n<p><span>Users can leave comments and observations, adding extra details to the collections as more people ride them. You can bookmark collections for later, saving it to your profile, and can even save individual tours and edit them to better suit your requirements.</span></p>\n<p><span>Komoot offers several options for discovering bikepacking tours. Using your location, you can find nearby collections. Alternatively, you can explore worldwide or search a specific area to discover the routes it has to offer. Highlights include:</span></p>\n<p><span>• <strong>Edinburgh's bikepacking escape: The Capital Trail</strong></span><span> – Delivering exactly what it says on the tin, this 245km route makes a loop of the Scottish capital winds through the Firth of Forth, the Lammermuir Hills, the Southern Upland Way and Borders and Abbey Way, the 7Stanes MTB trails in Glentress and Innerleithen, the Cross Borders Drove Road and the Pentland Hills. With easy access to Edinburgh and plentiful accommodation options, beginners can also choose to take on shorter sections of the Capital Trail if they’re not ready to tackle the full route.</span></p>\n<p><span>• <strong>History, chalk, grassland and forest: King Alfred's Way</strong></span><span> – The latest result of Cycling UK’s plan to create a network of cycleable off-road trails across the UK, King Alfred’s Way is a draw for keen cyclists and history buffs alike. Named for the legendary Saxon king Alfred the Great, this trail links the South Downs Way, the Ridgeway and the Thames Path National Trails and the North Downs Way, taking in thousands of years of English history including the Avebury stone circles, Stonehenge, Salisbury and Winchester Cathedrals and Farnham Castle. The route sticks conveniently close to villages and towns, so you’re rarely far from accommodation or public transport.</span></p>\n<p><span>• <strong>Rough stuff of the North: Second City Divide</strong></span><span> – This challenging 638km trail links Glasgow and Manchester, winding its way through some of the best routes the North of England and Scottish Borderlands have to offer. Highlights include Kielder Forest Park, the Pennine Bridleway and the Yorkshire Dales, and Scotland’s ‘right to roam’ legislation means that you can even enjoy some wild camping north of the border. </span></p>\n<p><span>• <strong>Lush green, heat and red gravel: Journey around Rwanda</strong></span><span> – Come face-to-face with the lush heart of Africa in this stunning 958km of Rwanda. This is a great way to get to know the country and its welcoming locals and to experience amazing spots of natural beauty from lakes to volcanoes. The greatest challenge is the heat, so come prepared.</span></p>\n<p><span>• <strong>7,600 km across the continent: European Divide Trail</strong></span><span> – At an incredible 7,603km, this trail from Grense Jakobselv in Norway to Cabo St Vincent in Portugal is the longest predominantly off-road bikepacking route in the world. An opportunity to see the European Union like no other, the route breaks down into 37 stages so you can take your pick from shorter trails in Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, France and Spain too.</span></p>\n<p><span>• <strong>Bikepacking the roof of the world: Annapurna Circuit in Nepal</strong></span><span> – This circuit through some of the highest mountains in the world offers an unforgettable cycling experience, passing from subtropical lowlands through green alpine meadows and pine forests to the snow-covered peaks. While an incredibly challenging ride, it is one of the easier mountain routes to plan logistically, with plenty of mountain villages along the way where you can find simple but much-needed food and rest.</span></p>\n<p><span>Bikepacking has something to offer everyone regardless of experience or fitness, and with komoot you can explore locally or far and wide to find the trail that suits you best. There’s literally a whole world to discover.</span></p>\n<p><em><strong><span>Visit <a href=\"http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=5750197678&amp;iu=/359/impcount.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\">komoot.com/g</a> and enter the code CYCLISTBP to choose your free region bundle of offline maps (standard price £8.99).
