It’s built together by the \ndevelopers of all major browser engines: Blink, Gecko, and WebKit \nwith hundreds of contributions from companies like Apple, Google, \nIntel, Microsoft, and Mozilla. This post is a deep dive into how \nthe collaborative Speedometer project improved the benchmark’s \nmeasurements methods and test content. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I care about Speedometer not for comparing different browser engines against each other on the same machine (even though that’s Speedometer’s primary purpose), but as a benchmark for measuring CPUs. It measures something very real and utterly practical: how fast web rendering is in an actual browser.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/14/speedometer-3\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d0cdb762739149e150621f88d213f3557d18f63191d524d991c77550e8454db2","category":"Tech"}
