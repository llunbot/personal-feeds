In a demo question about a Roman emperor, o1 took 14 seconds for an answer, and 1 preview took 33 seconds. According to OpenAI, o1 makes major mistakes 34 percent less often than o1-preview, while \"thinking\" 50 percent faster. The model will also reportedly become even faster once deployment is finished transitioning the GPUs to the new model.</p>\n<p>Whether the new <a href=\"https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-pro/\">ChatGPT Pro</a> subscription will be worth the $200 a month fee isn't yet fully clear, but the company specified that users will have access to an even more capable version of o1 called \"o1 Pro Mode\" that will do even deeper reasoning searches and provide \"more thinking power for more difficult problems\" before answering.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/openais-new-200-mo-chatgpt-subscription-will-buy-you-more-compute-time/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/openais-new-200-mo-chatgpt-subscription-will-buy-you-more-compute-time/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards and Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"377da113f3a4720683605d5046c83f423690d2ab9f2b22e339e0cfdd461e8063","category":"Tech"}
