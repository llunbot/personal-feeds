But for most people, the Apple Watch SE is perfect, especially when it’s on sale for the lowest price we’ve ever seen: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Smartwatch-Midnight-Aluminum-Detection/dp/B0CHXCXKPD/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Amazon is selling the 40mm Apple Watch SE for $179</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Smartwatch-Midnight-Aluminum-Detection/dp/B0CHXH39GN/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">44mm Apple Watch SE for $209</a>, savings of $70 each and the best price we’ve ever seen aside. <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/321564/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/search?q=apple+watch+se&amp;subid1=1-1-2151802-1-0-0\">Walmart also has the same deal</a> on the <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/321564/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-Watch-SE-2023-GPS-40mm-Starlight-Aluminum-Case-with-Starlight-Sport-Band-S-M/5033741510&amp;subid1=1-1-2151802-1-0-0\">40mm</a> and <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/321564/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-Watch-SE-2023-GPS-44mm-Midnight-Aluminum-Case-with-Midnight-Sport-Loop/5053502759&amp;subid1=1-1-2151802-1-0-0\">44mm</a> models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple Watch SE has the same design as the Series 6 from 2020 but is missing a few features, namely an always-on display, blood-oxygen sensor, and ECG sensor. It also has an older S8 chip but <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1383536/apple-watch-series-8-se-2-design-performance-features-price.html\">everything else that makes the Apple Watch great</a> is included: an optical heart rate sensor, irregular heart rhythm notifications, fall and crash detection, noise monitoring, always-on altimeter, sleep monitoring, 18-hour battery life, and 50M water resistance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And since Apple won’t be updating the SE until at least next September, go grab one now before the price goes back up.</p>\n\nApple Watch</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"e7cb3cb22ac5cc0a23ace09197c5e570355beb6ec86ff9e0e1348deb8eab728a","category":"Apple"}
