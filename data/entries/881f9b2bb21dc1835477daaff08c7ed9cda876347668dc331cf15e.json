Romain Bardet (Team DSM) and Lilian Calmejane (Intermarché-Circus-Wanty) are the only two French riders to have won both races, and Czech rider Petr Vakoč (Alpecin-Fenix). </span></p>\n<p>Last year, Danish rider Jonas Vingegaard (Jumbo-Visma) stormed to a telling victory in the Drôme Classic, but this year saw two-time world champion Julian Alaphilippe (Soudal - Quick-Step) take the title, proving that he is ready to return to the main stage of racing after a frustrating 2022 season with a convincing win in the Ardèche Classic.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/the-rouleur-journal/do-we-have-a-new-king-of-the-classics-mens-omloop-het-nieuwsblad-2023-in-review\"><em><strong>Read more: Do we have a new King of the Classics?</strong></em></a></p>\n<p><span>Meanwhile, menacing mistral winds threatened to cancel Sunday's Drôme Classic with gusts of more than 60 kilometers per hour. Instead, the peloton went on the attack, splintering the field mid-way through the race, before Frenchman Anthony Perez upset the favourites with a long solo attack. </span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/01_peloton01_classic_2023.jpg?v=1677490606\" alt=\"Men's peloton racing through France\" />The peloton races towards Toulland, just one of the many French hilltop villages that are commonplace in these races that skirt up both sides of the Rhône River Valley.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/02_echappe06_classic_2023.jpg?v=1677490670\" alt=\"Man racing through the streets of France\" />Frenchman Rémi Cavagna is a local favorite here. The time trial specialist is frequently driving the breakaway in the Faun Ardèche Classic, a race he won back in 2020. This year he was not so fortunate, but his move set up his team-mate Julian Alaphilippe nicely. <img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/03_peloton02_classic_2023.jpg?v=1677490698\" alt=\"Men's peloton racing through France\" />The peloton races past one of the several quarries that are found in the Ardèche.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/04_alaphilippe_peloton06_classic_2023.jpg?v=1677490720\" alt=\"Julian Allaphilipe racing \" />Alaphilippe and his Soudal - Quick-Step team drove the pace at the front over the Cornas climb, peppering the legs of his competition before his convincing attack.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/05_peloton05_classic_2023.jpg?v=1677490757\" alt=\"Men's peloton racing through the vineyards in France \" />Wine vineyards lace the hills around the final loop of the Ardèche Classic.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/06_gaudu_alaphilippe02_classic_2023.jpg?v=1677490869\" alt />After breaking away with Julian Alaphilippe, Groupama-FDJ rider David Gaudu appeared more at ease on the final climb of the Ardèche Classic, but he had little chance of dropping Alaphilippe.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/07_alaphilippe_finish_Ardeche_classic_2023.jpg?v=1677490928\" alt=\"Julian Alaphilipe celebrating his victory \" />Alaphilippe raises his arms in victory for the first time in 2023.
