For the first time, scientists at Wellesley College have documented these so-called \"anti-predator pipes,\" which serve as clarion calls to the hive members to initiate defensive maneuvers. You can hear a sampling in the (rather disturbing) video, embedded above, of bees under a hornet attack.</p>\n<p>“The [antipredator] pipes share traits in common with a lot of mammalian alarm signals, so as a mammal hearing them, there's something that is instantly recognizable as communicating danger,” <a href=\"https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/934056?\" target=\"_blank\">said co-author Heather Mattila</a> of Wellesley College, who said the alarm signals gave her chills when she first heard them. “It feels like a universal experience.”</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/02/attack-of-the-murder-hornets-is-a-nature-doc-shot-through-horror-sci-fi-lens/\" target=\"_blank\">I've written previously</a>, so-called murder hornets rocketed to infamy after November 2019, when a beekeeper in Blaine, Washington, named Ted McFall, was horrified to discover thousands of tiny mutilated bodies littering the ground—an entire colony of his honeybees had been brutally decapitated. The culprit: the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_giant_hornet\" target=\"_blank\">Asian giant hornet</a> species <em>Vespa mandarinia</em>, native to Southeast Asia and parts of the Russian Far East. Somehow, these so-called \"murder hornets\" had found their way to the Pacific Northwest, where they now pose a dire ecological threat to North American honeybee populations. </p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1810997#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1810997&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"28db4fbd9db114656979bd95de18ef50ad431365f54976c7298ef09176431d41","category":"Tech"}
