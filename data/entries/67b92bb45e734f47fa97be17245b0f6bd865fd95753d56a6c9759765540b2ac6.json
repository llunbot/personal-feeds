The new benchmark also reflects \"consumer usage patterns, and what is actually available from and marketed by Internet service providers,\" the FCC said.</p>\n<p>The previous standard of 25Mbps downstream and 3Mbps upstream lasted through the entire Trump era and most of President Biden's term. There's been a clear partisan divide on the speed standard, with Democrats pushing for a higher benchmark and Republicans arguing that it shouldn't be raised.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2010386#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2010386&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"67b92bb45e734f47fa97be17245b0f6bd865fd95753d56a6c9759765540b2ac6","category":"Tech"}
