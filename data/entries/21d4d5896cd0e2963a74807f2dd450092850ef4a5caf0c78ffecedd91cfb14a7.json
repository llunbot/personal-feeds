T-Mobile was not mentioned in that post, but the person selling the data told <em><a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en/article/akg8wg/tmobile-investigating-customer-data-breach-100-million\">Motherboard</a></em> that it had come from T-Mobile's servers, thus leading T-Mobile to look into it. The hacker who spoke to <em>Motherboard</em> claimed that several T-Mobile servers had been breached.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nT-Mobile has now confirmed that there was indeed unauthorized access to some customer data, but T-Mobile does not yet know if personal customer data has been accessed.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to the original forum post, the data for sale includes social security numbers, phone numbers, names, physical addresses, IMEI numbers, and driver licenses information.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Motherboard</em> said that it was provided with some samples of data and was able to confirm that they contained accurate information on T-Mobile customers. At the time, T-Mobile said that it was aware of claims made and was \"actively investigating their validity.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nT-Mobile should soon be following up with more information on what data was accessed in the breach.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/t-mobile/\">T-Mobile</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/16/t-mobile-data-breach/\">T-Mobile Confirms Data Breach, Unclear If Personal Customer Data Was Accessed</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/t-mobile-confirms-data-breach-unclear-if-personal-customer-data-was-accessed.2307748/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=wQ_dioE237k:KUE8p5reSJA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=wQ_dioE237k:KUE8p5reSJA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/wQ_dioE237k\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"21d4d5896cd0e2963a74807f2dd450092850ef4a5caf0c78ffecedd91cfb14a7","category":"Apple"}
