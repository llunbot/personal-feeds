In general, Labor Day sales won't top Black Friday or Cyber Monday when it comes to the quality or quantity, but if you can't wait another couple of months to pick up your gadget of choice, this year's holiday brings a few deals of note.</p>\n<p>Our roundup includes a number of strong prices on Apple products, for one, including the \"Product Red\" edition of the <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305166/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-40mm-PRODUCT-RED-Aluminum-Case-with-Sport-Band-Regular%2F478251261&amp;subid1=ArsLaborDay21\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Watch Series 6 for $249</a>.
