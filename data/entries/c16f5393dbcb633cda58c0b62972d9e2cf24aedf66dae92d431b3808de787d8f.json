The site spoke to Vision Pro owners experiencing headaches and neck pain, among other issues.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/apple-vision-pro-orange.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nEmily Olman, marketing chief of Hopscotch Interactive, said she got two \"superdark black eyes\" after wearing the Vision Pro for the first time, likely caused by the weight on the cheeks. Ian Beacraft, CEO of consulting firm Signal, told <em>MarketWatch</em> that he had pain at the base of his skull and his upper back.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere have <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1apmvy2/discomfort_and_headaches_with_vision_pro/\">also been complaints</a> about the Vision Pro on Reddit from users experiencing ongoing headaches, eye strain, and pain <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1bv4fg2/avp_is_just_too_heavy_for_me/\">from the weight</a> of the device. Some users have had luck <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1by760m/the_most_comfortable_avp_strap_that_works_in_any/\">with modified straps</a> and third-party products, and other people <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/VisionPro/comments/1bz2fp1/today_ive_been_on_my_avp_for_about_3_hours_or_so/\">have no issue</a> with the headset and the default band options.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple declined to comment on the customer complaints, directing <em>MarketWatch</em> to its user guidelines. Apple recommends taking a break from the headset every 20 to 30 minutes during the acclimation period, and to stop using the headset when feeling unwell. Apple does not recommend that people experiencing eye strain, headache, or pain continue to use the device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHave you had problems with the Vision Pro headset?
