A relatively simply setup can cost hundreds of dollars, with things like glass-break and leak sensors driving process up. Or you can use this iPhone trick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scroll a bit down in the <em>Accessibility</em> tab in Settings, you’ll find a tab for <em>Sound Recognition</em>. Switch it on and your iPhone will listen for over a dozen sounds using on-device intelligence and “notify you when sounds may be recognized.” Sounds are organized by category and include many common sounds:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Alarms:</strong> Fire, Siren, Smoke</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Animals:</strong> Cat, Dog</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Household:</strong> Appliances, Car Horn, Door Bell, Door Knock, Glass Breaking, Kettle, Water Running</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>People:</strong> Baby Crying, Coughing, Shouting</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/ios-sound-recognition.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" /></figure><p>IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>You can select as many as the sounds as you like, and it’s all very automatic. When your iPhone is within range of one of the sounds, you’ll get a notification and an alert tone and vibration to let you know. I’ve tested it for a few of them and it works impressively well. I got notifications for water running from several rooms away and a door bell. I haven’t tested glass breaking but it’s definitely the most intriguing, as most of the alarm glass-break sensors I’ve had are very hit-or-miss.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s meant as an aid for people with hearing issues, and it obviously won’t (and shouldn’t) replace a home monitoring or smart alarm system, but it’ll work in a pinch if you want a little extra peace of mind without buying or setting up any equipment in your home. Getting a timely alert could help you call the authorities or fix a leak before it becomes a problem.</p>\n</div>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"64cfc7a3130f6ca5fe0f7b9d56a5b07cddf44c65518e7b92ded4c37b6b8b3daf","category":"Apple"}
