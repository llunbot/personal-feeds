The <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2023/07/pixel-fold-review-the-first-foldable-that-actually-feels-like-a-tablet/\">Pixel Fold</a>, Google's biggest and most expensive phone, now has <a href=\"https://www.ifixit.com/Parts/Google_Pixel_Fold\">a whole parts selection</a> up at iFixit.</p>\n<p>The big-ticket item is a repair kit for the 7.6-inch inner display. If you were to somehow break the flexible OLED panel (<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2023/06/rip-to-my-pixel-fold-dead-after-four-days/\">who would ever do that?</a>), the part will cost you a whopping $900. That's a lot for the display, but you're not actually buying <em>just</em> the top display. Even the \"part only\" option for $900 is the entire top half of the Pixel Fold. We're talking the display, the bezels around it, the entire metal frame and sides of the phone, the all-important hinge, side buttons, fingerprint sensor, and a whole bunch of wires. You wouldn't buy this and connect it to your original phone; you would part out your original phone and move a few pieces over into this, like the motherboard, batteries, cameras, and back plate.</p>\n<p>There's also a flexible display \"Fix Kit\" for just $10 more that includes a bevy of iFixit tools, like screwdrivers, a few soft-pry tools, a heat pad, a suction cup, 14 different custom-cut adhesive strips, the heat-dissipating graphite sheet, and thermal paste; and for some reason there are even two brand-new batteries.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1970142#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1970142&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e41761171d5001101206147b0d2863261c3b4524490060d513aef883320f97d6","category":"Tech"}
