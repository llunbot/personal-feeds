The Vuelta is the one Grand Tour that the reigning Giro d’Italia champion and 2019 Tour de France champ has yet to win in his career, and assuming his lingering back issues don’t cause him too much trouble, he should find that the challenging climbs on the profile suit his skill set.</p><p>At the same time, he will be joined by multiple other stars with serious Grand Tour credentials in a line-up that will surely be among the strongest in the race.</p><p>Last year’s Vuelta runner-up – and 2019 Giro winner – Richard Carapaz will also make the start for the Ineos Grenadiers, fresh off of a podium performance at the Tour de France and a gold medal in the Olympic road race. Carapaz finished the 2020 edition of the Vuelta just 24 seconds behind Primož Roglič (Jumbo-Visma) in what was the narrowest GC margin for the race so far in the 21st century.</p><p>Adam Yates, meanwhile, will be making his first Grand Tour start of his season for the Ineos Grenadiers, having joined the team this year. The Vuelta is the only Grand Tour in which he has not yet registered a top 10 in his career.</p><p>Providing even more firepower for the squad will be Pavel Sivakov, Jhonatan Narváez, Salvatore Puccio, Dylan van Baarle, and recently crowned Olympic mountain bike champ Tom Pidcock, who will be making his first ever Grand Tour start at the race.</p></div></div>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"6dfd1a10a3973c69c3397278eb1ecf5511f20750eed33cc8d1510bf772fbf2b7","category":"Cycling"}
