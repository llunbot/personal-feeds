But rising prices and the number of services now available can make it hard to afford all the subscriptions required to deliver the content you want to watch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That means it’s tempting when you come across websites like MyFlixer, which offers loads of AAA titles at no cost. Of course, there’s no such thing as a free lunch, and you should always be deeply suspicious of sites that contain free versions of premium content. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>MyFlixer has already been banned or blocked in several countries, but mirror sites reappear quickly, making it hard to stop people accessing the portal. It’s not just the fact that the content is provides is very likely pirated, but more importantly you could soon find yourself with intrusive ads or even malware on your system that puts your personal information at risk. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how to protect yourself against the dangers that lurk on MyFlixer and its various mirror sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><div><p>PROMOTION</p><p><strong>CleanMyMac: Total Cleanup and Protection</strong></p></div><div><div><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/WidgetIDGCleanMyMac-1600x900-1.png?w=1240&amp;h=697&amp;crop=1\" loading=\"lazy\" /></div><p>\n</p><p>CleanMyMac’s advanced malware protection safeguards your Mac from viruses, miners, keyloggers, Trojans, and other threats.

But you’ll very quickly be prompted to accept new content alerts, push notifications or browser extensions. If you do this, you’ll then be pestered by adware to download things like companion apps, which will most likely turn out to be malware.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The approaches differ for each mirror-site, but the method of getting an infection onto your system is usually similar. If you’ve already fallen for the tricks the sites employ, then you’ll need to clean up your browser prompts, remove any extensions or apps, and use anti-virus software to restore your machine back to full health. We’ll cover all these steps below so that you fix the problems that can be caused by using MyFlixer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to remove the MyFlixer browser extension</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s quite easy to remove the MyFlixer extension from your browser. Here’s the methods needed for some of the most popular browers on macOS.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How to remove the MyFlixer Safari browser extension</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Removing the MyFlixer Safari extension is easy and is the same way you’d remove any extension from the browser.

Basically, if you’re being offered something that you know you’d normally have to pay for, then the chances are it’s some kind of scam or delivery method for malware. So, to stay safe, don’t visit those sites and certainly don’t download anything from them. That’s just asking for trouble.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you really want to enjoy movies and TV shows on your Mac, then the safest way is through a paid service. It means you’re not ripping off the people that work hard to create the content and aren’t playing into the hands of cybercriminals that want to steal your data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don’t have to sign up to all of them at the same time though. Most services offer free trials, so you could always work your way through those first. When you’ve exhausted those, simply sign up to one and binge what you want, then cancel your subscription and repeat the process on the next one. This way you minimise what you have to pay, while ensuring you don’t get any dangerous malware on your computer.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><h2> FAQ </h2><hr />\n<div><div><span>1.</span>\n<h3>What is MyFlixer?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<p>A site that offers free TV and movie streaming, often of pirated content from other studios.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div><span>2.</span>\n<h3>Is MyFlixer safe?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<p>No. There are usually prompts for notifications, extensions and downloads that can contain adware and malware.</p>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div><span>3.</span>\n<h3>Is MyFlixer legal?</h3>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<p>Distrubuting content for which the site doesn’t have copyright is illegal.
