Titled <em>Army Talks</em>, the series was designed “to help\n[the personnel] become better-informed men and women and\ntherefore better soldiers.” On March 24, 1945, the topic for the\nweek was “FASCISM!” [...]</p>\n\n<p>The War Department thought it was important for Americans to\nunderstand the tactics fascists would use to take power in the\nUnited States. They would try to gain power “under the guise of\n‘super-patriotism’ and ‘super-Americanism.’” And they would use\nthree techniques:</p>\n\n<p>First, they would pit religious, racial, and economic groups\nagainst one another to break down national unity. Part of that\neffort to divide and conquer would be a “well-planned ‘hate\ncampaign’ against minority races, religions, and other groups.”</p>\n\n<p>Second, they would deny any need for international cooperation,\nbecause that would fly in the face of their insistence that their\nsupporters were better than everyone else. “In place of\ninternational cooperation, the fascists seek to substitute a\nperverted sort of ultra-nationalism which tells their people that\nthey are the only people in the world who count. With this goes\nhatred and suspicion toward the people of all other nations.”</p>\n\n<p>Third, fascists would insist that “the world has but two choices — either fascism or communism, and they label as ‘communists’\neveryone who refuses to support them.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s downright spooky how this pamphlet from 80 years ago describes <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-fbi-justice-department-purge-1234743318/\">Trumpism</a> and the MAGA movement to a T. <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/ArmyTalkOrientationFactSheet64-Fascism/mode/2up\">Here’s the original pamphlet</a>.
