He stopped and said ‘Why are you writing \nthis down? You should be smart enough to remember this. If you’re \nnot smart enough to remember this you shouldn’t be in this \nmeeting’. We all stopped taking notes and learnt to just listen \nand be part of the conversation and remember what we were supposed \nto do. And that became how we worked.” Mr Schiller testified. </p>\n\n<p>“It was very action-oriented. It was built to be like a small \nstart-up where we all are working together on the same things, and \nwe all know what our plans are and what we’re doing.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Nor is there much talk in meetings of how profitable the Apple App \nStore is, despite the fact it would be the 63rd biggest company on \nthe Fortune 500 if it were hived off as a separate entity. </p>\n\n<p>“Are you telling His Honour that you have no idea whether ... the \nApp Store has been profitable?” asked an incredulous Neil Young, \nKC, leading the cross-examination on behalf of Epic Games. </p>\n\n<p>“I <em>believe</em> it is [profitable],” replied Mr Schiller, who has \nbeen in charge of the App Store since the beginning. “I’m simply \nsaying ‘profit’ as a specific financial metric is not a report I \nget and spend time on. It’s not how we measure our performance as \na team,” he said. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sounds like Epic is getting its hat handed to it once again.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/16/no-notes\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f8c2b7f90c731e8eafd0df6d5c73d26ee2a6217cedef63b2aafd031c271fd390","category":"Tech"}
