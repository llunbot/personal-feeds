More specifically, the shim accompanying virtually all Linux distributions plays a crucial role in secure boot, a protection built into most modern computing devices to ensure every link in the boot process comes from a verified, trusted supplier. Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows attackers to neutralize this mechanism by executing malicious firmware at the earliest stages of the boot process before the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFI\">Unified Extensible Firmware Interface</a> firmware has loaded and handed off control to the operating system.</p>\n<p>The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-40547, is what’s known as a buffer overflow, a coding bug that allows attackers to execute code of their choice. It resides in a part of the shim that processes booting up from a central server on a network using the same HTTP that the the web is based on. Attackers can exploit the code-execution vulnerability in various scenarios, virtually all following some form of successful compromise of either the targeted device or the server or network the device boots from.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2001542#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2001542&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1eedd42df57e03a1b81be34189863b6d9afaaafa881237641d7ff7e6cb7f9318","category":"Tech"}
