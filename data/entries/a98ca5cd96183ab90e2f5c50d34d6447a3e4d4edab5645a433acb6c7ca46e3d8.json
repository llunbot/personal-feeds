Throughout December and early January, teams on the WorldTour have unveiled their new jerseys in preparation for the Town Down Under.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, we’ll be placing a critical eye on these jerseys, casting our brutal judgment on the fresh designs, from Arkéa B&amp;B-Hotels to UAE Team ADQ. We won’t hold back, giving our score out of ten based on how they stack up in our opinion.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Worst</h2>\n\n\n\n<h2>26. Intermarché – Wanty</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Intermarche-2025-970x647.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Intermarche-2025-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Intermarche-2025-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Intermarche-2025-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Intermarche-2025-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Intermarche-2025-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Intermarche-2025-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Intermarche-2025-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Intermarche-2025-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Intermarche-2025.png 1500w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s tough being an Intermarché jersey designer. Since their promotion to the WorldTour in 2021, the squad have resigned their heavily fluorescent jersey at the beginning of each season. They’ve also picked up a habit of releasing a special edition kit for the Giro d’Italia and<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-pro-jerseys-of-the-2020s-so-far\" target=\"_blank\"> sometimes the Tour de France</a>. However, I have a feeling they might have reached the bottom of the barrel in 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking past the overstimulating barrage of sponsor names and logos, the jersey has been completely reworked for 2025. Notably, Intermarché’s logo has now split into two parts, separating the ‘Inter’ from the ‘Marché’. To pair with the red ‘Marché’, the right sleeve has turned red.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously, fluorescent yellow pairs with red – or so the designer was told. These bright flashes appear on the left sleeve, providing some continuity with previous kits. However, there’s another colour to add to this nauseating palette: navy blue. The colour of the darker bib shorts bleeds onto the bottom third of the jersey, which, to its credit, does help to frame the countless sponsor logos on the chest of the kit. This blue appears out of nowhere on the back of the jersey, however, and on a panel connecting the collar to the sleeves. It looks very strange given that the other sleeve is entirely one colour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m baffled by this one.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Note: </strong>Deary me</h4>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Score: </strong>1/10</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+2\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-2-970x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-2-970x300.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-2-300x93.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-2-768x238.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-2-1536x476.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-2-2048x634.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-2-750x232.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/Subs-flash-159-for-web-2-1140x353.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>25.

There’s only so much you can do with red and white I guess. Well, that colour binary has been broken for the 2025 season courtesy of this visually arresting kit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s where the compliments end, however. This kit is an assault on the senses, mixing red with burgundy and yellow. This blend is barbaric in all honesty. The yellow sleeves are a criminal addition to the rather tasteful blend of burgundy and red shown on the main body of the kit. Overall, it looks very disjointed, resembling a jersey designed by someone on an online Pro Cycling Manager forum during the early 2010s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To add to the visual mismatch, the team’s helmets are white and the bikes will also be white. There’s a lack of colour continuity here – although I’m somewhat glad they haven’t mixed burgundy with yellow on all equipment fronts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Note:</strong> Ignorance of the colour wheel</h4>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Score:</strong> 2/10</h4>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/pro-cycling-news-2025-cyclocross\">Pro Log: The latest in cyclocross; Olympians get New Year honours; New year, new kit</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/neo-pros-2025\">5 first year pro cyclists to follow in 2025</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pro-cycling-new-years-resolutions-2025\">9 New Year’s resolutions for the pro cycling peloton in 2025</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/mens-worldtour-preview-2025\">What to expect from every men’s WorldTour team in 2025</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/maap-jayco-alula\">Maap joins the WorldTour with Jayco-AlUla and Liv-Jayco-AlUla</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>24.

There appears to be an oil spill on the new jersey, however. Perhaps this is a very on-the-nose nod to the team’s petrol-rich state backers now supported by the state-owned renewable investment fund XRG.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This jersey is a step down from last year, I’ll say. The oily effect meets a gruesome and abrupt end on the shoulders with little consideration for the sleeves. It looks OK when the riders have their hands on their hips for the off-the-bike photos, but it looks a bit odd when the riders are crouched over the handlebars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The jackets and long-sleeved jerseys also look a bit strange with a smokey grey effect taking hold towards the cuffs. It almost looks like they’ve faded while drying outside on a washing line.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Notes:</strong> Luckily Pogačar will be in the rainbow jersey all year</h4>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Score: </strong>4/10</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2>20.

There’s now a geometric effect placed on the red part of the jersey. This helps to give it a little pizzazz, however, I do find the whole thing a little uninspiring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite its eye-catching look, this is just a tad boring for my liking.

This identity was cultivated quickly, adopting a playful identity, colourful Trek bikes and supermarket press conferences (yes, this happened).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that the Lidl name is in it for the long run, the jersey has been cleaned up ahead of 2025. The team have added more colour to make this harlequin motif look a little more organised than before. The top half of the jersey is dominated by a red block, offset by flashes of yellow and lighter blue. This appears a lot neater and tastefully vibrant than the previous iteration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although this jersey doesn’t light my fire, it’s certainly an improvement. That said, I fail to understand why the team can’t use the Lidl logotype instead of the blocky square-shaped logo that appears all over the jersey and shorts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Notes:</strong> At home in the middle aisle</h4>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Score: </strong>4/10</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2>18.

First of all, the team has adopted a new moniker, sporting the brand name of a Dutch delivery service. Secondly, they’ve swapped out Scott bikes for the French brand Lapierre. And thirdly, the team have decided to return to its dark-coloured roots for 2025 after spending a year in white and turquoise as DSM-Firmenich-PostNL.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, the squad’s new kit is a much darker affair than their – let’s say – abstract outfit from last year. The main body of the jersey is navy, although the team advertised it as purple in the kit reveal in December. The two ‘Keep Challenging’ lines remain, this time in orange. However, the new sponsor Picnic’s red appears on the sleeve to balance out the blue and orange.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, it’s very safe. I don’t mean that in the sense of safety, it’s just very clinical and corporate-looking. The only contentious aspect is the mix of red and orange, which does look a little unsettling, but only from a close-up image. Far away, it looks fine. Just fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Notes: </strong>Plain Jane</h4>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Score: </strong>4/10</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2>Mid</h2>\n\n\n\n<h2>17.

In psychology, this is known as ‘enclothed cognition’. In essence, when you dress in a way that aligns with your goals, your mindset shifts in a positive way. After a 2024 filled with drama, poor results and squabbling, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/ineos-grenadiers\" target=\"_blank\">Ineos Grenadiers </a>should have looked into this. Instead, they’ve opted for a similar look to last year, with an orange and blue gradient through the main body of the jersey. If ‘enclothed cognition’ is anything to go by, Ineos are setting themselves up for another year of disappointment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The eagle-eyed will have realised a slight change here, though. The blue and orange have been reversed to allow riders to be more visible on European roads with the lighter orange on the left side of the rider. Apart from this switcheroo, much of the jersey has remained the same. That said, the line that runs down the back of the jersey and through the team’s Kask helmets has been switched to white for 2025. This might be down to visibility, but it might be subtly symbolic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This line once stood for the team’s forward thinking and innovation – at least according to the designers back in 2010 – so it could be somewhat foreboding for the team to ditch the classic blue for a white stripe of surrender.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Notes:</strong> I have a feeling this might become a cursed kit</h4>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Score: </strong>5/10</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2>14.

The bath bomb aesthetic is thankfully gone. Instead, the new jersey is a tricolour of white, purple and orange. The Emirati flag still looks a little oddly placed, but at least it’s more subtle this time, masked by the tasteful gradients behind it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The three colours work together well and the use of white is much needed to calm the busy mix of sponsor logos. In addition, the white makes it onto the helmet, which is a welcomed addition after a couple of seasons spent wearing a torrid pastel-coloured helmet.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Notes:</strong> Bonus points for sock co-ordination</h4>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Score: </strong>5/10</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2>13.

The team slotted inside the top five of the UCI rankings with Ben O’Connor making the podium of the Vuelta and fourth place overall at the Giro. On the back of this miracle season, the French outfit have unveiled their third jersey in the span of just twelve months. The revised galaxy design used for most of the 2024 season has been put to bed in favour of a less space age blue number.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In ditching its former design, a tame blue colour has been adopted for the main body of the jersey. This is flanked by two different hues on either sleeve: turquoise and aquamarine. These colours refer to the brand colours of both Van Rysel and long-term sponsor AG2R La Mondiale. This is a smart idea to keep all parties happy, but it does look a bit odd, even if asymmetry is the way to go in modern jersey design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite my scepticism, I am a fan of the aquamarine featured on the right sleeve. This is complemented by the helmets and sunglasses’ frames, which adopt the same shade. This colour isn’t enough to pull Decathlon-AG2R out of the ‘mid tier’, however.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Notes:</strong> Why have one shade of blue when you can have three?</h4>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Score: </strong>6/10</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2>12.

They rocked a navy blue and green number throughout most of the 2010s before switching it up towards the end of the decade. Nowadays, they’ve focussed on a blue jersey with a big ‘M’ placed right at the centre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For 2025, they’ve switched it up once more and delivered a light number filled with glitch-style blue blocks through the centre. This has split opinion online, but I side on the positive side of the fence (for once). Yes, it does look like a permanent young rider’s jersey, but it ticks plenty of boxes. It’s visually intriguing and asymmetrical and it can be spotted quite easily within the peloton.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All in, it’s different and a little experimental.

It’s a playful take on the boring selection of blue jerseys that keep on appearing within the bunch. Paired with the denim effect shorts, this double denim number is classy, kitsch and fun. I, for one, am glad that it’ll make a return in 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The blue, white and red colour combination is classic. Plus, the placement of the Canyon logo on the hems looks clean, as do the subtle yet plentiful array of sponsor logos that have been scattered around the jersey with little visual noise.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Notes: </strong>Yee haw</h4>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Score: </strong>7/10</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2>7.

This has often been to much avail, but this year something seems off-kilter. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pastel colour palette continues into the new design. That’s a plus. Similarly, the glitchy abstract effects and motifs also appear throughout the jersey. That said, the mint contours that appear on the chest seem a little manufactured.

The squad are deep within <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/uci-rankings-promotions-and-relegations\" target=\"_blank\">the relegation zone</a> and it’s looking unlikely that they’ll be able to salvage something from the 2025 season, especially with Vauquelin rumoured to be considering a move elsewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, they’ve made the most of their final year at WorldTour level with a cracking kit. Despite its difficult circular shape, the B&amp;B Hotels logo is neatly positioned on the blood-red body of the jersey.<strong> </strong>The side panels of the jersey recycle the Breton mythology-inspired design from last year’s offering. This is a nice touch that harks back to the team’s local identity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the sleeves, this does look like the riders forgot to take off their red gilets. In a similar vein, it looks very similar to Trek’s kit from the first half of the 2019 season. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Notes:</strong> A year-round gilet <em>trompe</em>–<em>l’œil</em></h4>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Score: </strong>8/10</h4>\n\n\n\n<h2>3.

It feels somewhat cabaret at times, but a playful edge given through the kitsch diamonds and visual easter eggs dotted all over this kit. I imagine Rapha’s design team were aiming for a theme inspired by playing cards. This maybe leans into EF’s position as jokers in the peloton, free from the constraints of being a plain sprint, GC or Classics squad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/ef-education-easypost\" target=\"_blank\">EF </a>have certainly had better kits, but it’s not bad at all.
