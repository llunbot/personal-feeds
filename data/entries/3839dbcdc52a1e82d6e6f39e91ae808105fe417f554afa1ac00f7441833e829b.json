Chinese consumers apparently see Apple's diminutive selection of AI features as contradictory to its image as a pioneering brand. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>‌DigiTimes‌</em> reiterated <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/ios-18-slew-of-new-ai-features/\">previous rumors</a> suggesting that ‌iOS 18‌ will contain a number of new AI features, but cautioned that Apple needs to make significant progress in the AI space to meet consumer expectations and revive the company's popularity in China amid fierce competition from brands like Huawei, which are heavily investing in AI research and development. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nOn an earnings call earlier this year, Apple CEO <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a> said the company was working on generative AI and would <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-ai-details-coming-later-this-year/\">share details \"later this year.\"</a> Apple is expected to preview ‌iOS 18‌ at its annual developers conference WWDC in June, and the update should be released in September. Some new AI features could be exclusive to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> models later in the year, with the lineup rumored to get a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/14/iphone-16-upgraded-neural-engine-rumor/\">\"significantly\" upgraded Neural Engine</a>.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/\">China</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digitimes-com/\">DigiTimes</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/26/ios-18-could-revive-iphone-sales-in-china/\">iOS 18's AI Features Could Revive iPhone Sales in China</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18s-ai-features-could-revive-iphone-sales-in-china.2420448/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3839dbcdc52a1e82d6e6f39e91ae808105fe417f554afa1ac00f7441833e829b","category":"Apple"}
