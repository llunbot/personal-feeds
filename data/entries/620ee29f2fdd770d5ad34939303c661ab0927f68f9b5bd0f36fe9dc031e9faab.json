In many cases, the customers physically handed their iPhones to an Apple Store employee in person, so there is no possible way they could be at fault. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"Because you didn't trade in your iPhone, we are unable to complete the trade-in process,\" the email says, according to a screenshot shared with us by reader Quinn Everett. \"The associated loan on this iPhone will resume.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEverett and others said the Apple Store app also shows their iPhone's trade-in status has changed to \"canceled,\" suggesting that Apple's email is legitimate. The email has been widely shared across the <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/weird-iphone-upgrade-program-email-questions.2424868/\">MacRumors Forums</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/applehelp/comments/1ccjcsk/your_tradein_has_been_canceled_the_associated/\">Reddit</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helloandrewc/status/1783352173675315592\">X</a>, with many customers receiving it in the early hours of Thursday morning in the United States.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMany customers who received the email completed their iPhone trade-in last September, when the iPhone 15 series launched, so the delayed timing of the email suggests that it was sent as a result of a system glitch. Apple did not immediately respond to our request for comment, but we will update this story if we receive an explanation.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>No but actually what is going on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@Apple</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AppleSupport?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@AppleSupport</a>? I got an email saying my trade-in from September was canceled and your Apple Store app is showing that too in one place, but not everywhere. Receipt of returned iPhone 14 Pro is below. I think there’s been a glitch. <a href=\"https://t.co/VXnpg5I13s\">https://t.co/VXnpg5I13s</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/H2LtcHwijl\">pic.twitter.com/H2LtcHwijl</a></p>— Quinn (@quinneverett) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/quinneverett/status/1783365212118106396?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 25, 2024</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<strong>Update:</strong> We have confirmed that this email was sent erroneously and that customers who received it do not need to take any action.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-trade-in/\">Apple Trade-In</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/25/apple-email-says-iphone-trade-in-canceled/\">Apple Mistakenly Tells Customers Their iPhone Trade-Ins Are 'Canceled' [Updated]</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-mistakenly-tells-customers-their-iphone-trade-ins-are-canceled-updated.2424897/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"620ee29f2fdd770d5ad34939303c661ab0927f68f9b5bd0f36fe9dc031e9faab","category":"Apple"}
