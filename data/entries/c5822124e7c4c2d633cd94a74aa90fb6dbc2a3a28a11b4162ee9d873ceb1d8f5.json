But it may point the way for machines to learn new tricks.</p>\n<p>The virtual robot army was developed by researchers from <a href=\"https://ethz.ch/en.html\">ETH Zurich</a> in Switzerland and chipmaker <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/nvidia/\">Nvidia</a>. They used the wandering bots to train an <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/tag/algorithms/\">algorithm</a> that was then used to control the legs of a real-world robot.</p>\n<p>In the simulation, the machines—called <a href=\"https://www.anybotics.com/anymal-autonomous-legged-robot/\">ANYmals</a>—confront challenges like slopes, steps, and steep drops in a virtual landscape. Each time a robot learned to navigate a challenge, the researchers presented a harder one, nudging the control algorithm to be more sophisticated.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1802542#p3\">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1802542&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c5822124e7c4c2d633cd94a74aa90fb6dbc2a3a28a11b4162ee9d873ceb1d8f5","category":"Tech"}
