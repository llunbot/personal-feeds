Record Your Own Video with Built-in QuickTime Player</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>QuickTime Player is mainly used as a video player on Mac. But it can also serve as a screen recorder for Mac. If you want a tool to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668304/how-to-screen-record-on-a-mac.html\">screen record on a Mac</a> computer, this is a good choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Video recordings by QuickTime Player are saved as MOV files by default. You can view it after recording directly on the Mac. One thing to note is that if you want to record the internal audio at the same time, you need to install Soundflower first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The steps below show you how to record yourself with QuickTime:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Run QuickTime Player on your Mac and choose “File” &gt; “New Movie Recording”.

Then, click the “Stop” button to finish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Then, you need to choose “File” &gt; “Save” to name and save the recording.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/quicktime.png\" alt=\"how to record yourself on a mac Quicktime\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/quicktime.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 700w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/quicktime.png?resize=300%2C135&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w\" width=\"700\" height=\"316\" /></figure><p>EaseUS</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> You need to choose the video quality carefully, as different qualities take up different amounts of space. For instance, Maximum-quality recordings produce uncompressed files, which can take up large amounts of storage space. Below are the descriptions of different quality settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Quality</td><td>Description</td></tr><tr><td>High</td><td>H.264 video and 44100 Hz AAC audio</td></tr><tr><td>Maximum</td><td>Apple ProRes 422 video and Linear PCM audio</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Method 3. Record You and Screen in Photo Booth for Further Editing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>How to record yourself on a MacBook Air? There is a built-in app called Photo Booth that can do it. Although it is usually used to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/226469/how-to-take-screenshots-on-your-mac.html\">take screenshots on your Mac</a> with special effects, more and more people are using it to record videos recently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can record the webcam and the screen at the same time.

If you don’t see the “Import” button, click “Media” first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If Image Capture, Photos, or another photo app opens, close the window.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Select the built-in camera in the “Cameras” section of the sidebar, and a live video image from the camera will appear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 3. </strong>You may also select to record the microphone by clicking the “Record Voiceover” button below the viewer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Then, specify the event you want to record by choosing from an existing event, create a new event, or choose the open project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Click the “Record” button below the live video image to start recording.

What can you do to ensure a high recording quality?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><a></a>Choose a Screen Recorder with Advanced Recording Functions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If the recording environment is not ideal, you will need advanced screen recording software with noise-cancellation and automatic recording functions. In this case, EaseUS RecExperts is exactly what you are searching for.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Choose a High-Quality Camera/External Webcam</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Nowadays, with the introduction of the 24-inch iMac, M1 MacBook Pros, and M2 MacBook Air, Full HD 1080p built-in cameras have become a reality. However, if you want a camera with advanced functions like automatic light filling, try a third-party one.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>XPCAM webcam:</strong> this is a web camera with a full HD glass lens that delivers razor-sharp video. With automatic light correction and HDR technology, the computer camera auto-adjusts color and brightness for natural lighting. 1080P, 720P, 480P supported.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Logitech Brio:</strong> this is a camera that can be used in the office, at home, or somewhere else. It is four times the resolution of a typical HD webcam and can adjust the light automatically.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>NexiGo N930E:</strong> this camera has a built-in light ring that offers lighting compensation at three different levels with touch control. Offering a 1080P quality, it is perfect for <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/561974/how-to-record-share-zoom-mac.html\">recording Zoom meetings on Mac</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Try to Make Sure the Environment is Quiet and Bright</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Try to make sure your face is lit as evenly as possible. To do this, you may bounce a lamp light off a wall directly in front of you and adjust window blinds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, you may get a good external microphone that can cancel noise during recording. Or, try to get something soft and cushiony behind the microphone to absorb noises.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><a></a>Final Words</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This article offers five feasible methods to record yourself on a Mac.
