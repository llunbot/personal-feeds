Made by the same producers as F1’s popular <em>Drive to Survive</em>, the eight episodes follow the stories on the way to Jonas Vingegaard’s eventual victory in the fight for the <em>maillot jaune</em>, with a wider look at the teams and personalities in the peloton.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s something I would watch again, and each of the 45-minute episodes were crafted with stunning visuals and personal revelations. Anything that has the potential to get new fans into the sport is welcomed by me and it looks like a second season could be on the way at the 2023 Tour de France too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, spoiler alerts ahead for this review.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Who are the key players?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2019/10/02193048/tadej_pogacar_and_jonaas_vingegaard_by_michael_steele_via_getty_-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"tadej_pogacar_and_jonaas_vingegaard_by_michael_steele_via_getty_\" /><figcaption>Michael Steele via Getty </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The first episode begins with an introduction to the ‘Wolfpack’, or the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/soudal-quickstep\" target=\"_blank\">Soudal-QuickStep</a> team, one of eight teams featured in the docuseries. Understandably they cover Fabio Jakobsen’s background, from his horror crash at the Tour of Poland (repeated throughout the series a few more times than maybe necessary, given that so-called ‘crash porn’ has faced criticism in recent years) and his role as a sprinter within the team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/jumbo-visma\" target=\"_blank\">Jumbo-Visma</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/ef-education-easypost\" target=\"_blank\">EF Education-EasyPost</a> are also shown in the first episode, albeit missing Magnus Cort’s impressive run in the King of the Mountains jersey, before AG2R-Citroën, Alpecin-Deceuninck, Groupama-FDJ, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/ineos-grenadiers\" target=\"_blank\">Ineos Grenadiers</a> and Bora-Hansgrohe are introduced in subsequent episodes. While covering eight out of 22 teams is a decent size sample, it might have been beneficial to cut this number down. I understand the French connection with AG2R-Citroen, but we still get this angle with fellow French outfit Groupama-FDJ. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, with more teams come more opportunities to display the more human side of being a professional cyclist. Viewers were treated to camera crews at home with riders such as Wout van Aert (Jumbo-Visma) and his family, at the farm of Thibaut Pinot (Groupama-FDJ), and we learned why Jasper Philipsen (Alpecin-Deceuninck) has the ‘Jasper Disaster’ nickname. Covering so many teams means narratives naturally jump back and forth, which is easier to follow for more knowledgeable watchers aware of the outcome of the race than for newcomers, but still digestible enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lack of Tadej Pogačar and his UAE Team Emirates was not a surprise, but the docuseries not covering a key rival of the eventual winner left others having to fill in the gaps of his story. It would have been ideal to secure his participation, though this is not the fault of those filming the docuseries – you can’t force Pogačar to sit down when his team did not make the decision to be included. One thing that was a surprise, however, was the omission of arguably the key shot of the entire 2022 Tour de France.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><p>An incredible act of sportsmanship <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2764.png\" alt=\"❤\" /><br /><br />After <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TamauPogi?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">@TamauPogi</a> crashes on the final descent of Stage 18, Jonas Vingegaard waits for his rival to catch up and the duo exchange a handshake before the final summit finish of the 2022 Tour de France <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f91d.png\" alt=\"🤝\" /><br />___________<br /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f1eb-1f1f7.png\" alt=\"🇫🇷\" /> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TDF2022?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">#TDF2022</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/11LH1zWBi0\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/11LH1zWBi0</a></p>— Velon CC (@VelonCC) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VelonCC/status/1550190939850907651?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">July 21, 2022</a></blockquote>  </div>\n\n\n\n<p>It was the handshake felt around the world. All right, I’m being dramatic now, but this sign of sportsmanship between the Tour’s two leading protagonists sparked articles and coverage galore at the time. It was a handshake that signalled a temporary ceasefire between the two rivals, who were pushing each other to the limit and then some, with Vingegaard unclipping and almost coming off his bike and Pogačar hitting the ground on the fast-paced Stage 18 descent of the Col de Spandelles towards the Hautacam. To exclude this was certainly an… interesting choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How ‘behind-the-scenes’ is it?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Crews were given access before, during and after stages through a mix of rider interviews to the camera and in-car videos, the latter comparable to the Orica-GreenEdge <em>Backstage Pass</em> <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/dan-jones-cyclist-profile\" target=\"_blank\">brilliance from Dan Jones</a>, and it’s refreshing to see riders sit down and tell their own story in their own words.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><p>Our highlight of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TDFUnchained?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">#TDFUnchained</a> so far.

Just in case he forgot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’re also able to see preparations in the build-up to the race. At one point, Alpecin-Deceuninck’s Mathieu van der Poel is on the floor retching from his efforts (no-one said pro cycling was glamorous) and Thibaut Pinot feeds a bottle to one of his baby goats before brushing his donkeys on his farm in Mélisey. He delivers emotional quotes, such as ‘sometimes I feel like I’m more popular than I am talented. There are days when I wish I got less love and more wins.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s the verdict?</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><p>The moment we’ve all been waiting for… Tour de France: Unchained is now streaming on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/netflix?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">@netflix</a>!<br /><br />We’re almost as excited as Rigo and Magnus for the premiere.

Perhaps they should’ve gone all-in for one or another, while framing the leading standings at the start and finish of the episodes could’ve helped the narrative, as could the inclusion of Tadej Pogačar and The Handshake. As a counterpoint, <em>Drive to Survive</em> managed without Max Verstappen for the fourth season, and in fairness the producers of <em>Unchained</em> have done a decent job of working around the lack of participation of one of the race’s key players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s no doubt that Soudal-QuickStep’s Yves Lampaert’s quote from episode one, which sees him win the opening stage time-trial and wears the first yellow jersey of the race, is an all-timer in drawing viewers straight into how emotional cycling can be: ‘I’m just a farmer’s son from Belgium.’ </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The docuseries goes more in-depth than TV coverage at the time, and can provide a good day-or-so of watching. I really hope we gain some new fans of the sport with this. It’s glitzy enough to grab attention episode to episode if you’re not too invested but doesn’t stray too far from its overall narrative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All in all, Netflix’s <em>Tour de France: Unchained</em> comes down to a level of personal preference. If you want documentaries with more detailed analysis, you can find them elsewhere, such as team-made documentaries. But if you want to watch a binge-able recap of the 2022 Tour de France in the run-up to the 2023 edition, no matter how much you know about cycling or remember about the race, this docuseries does a good job. Plus, it has Orla Chennaoui in, so that’s an added bonus for me.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/netflix-unchained-review\">Netflix’s Tour de France Unchained review: An entertaining recap with a Pogačar-shaped hole</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Robyn Davidson &#124; Editorial Assistant","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"e784aca15b352e959edfa7dd8a1202c634ece02090709cf2be36ecda6bfd9f2f","category":"Cycling"}
