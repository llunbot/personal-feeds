{"title":"Apple’s MLS Deal Seems to Be Doing Well","link":"https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/Journal/Issues/2023/07/24/Insiders/sports-media.aspx?ana=top_stories","date":1690330382000,"content":"\n<p>John Ourand and Alex Silverman, reporting for Sports Business Journal:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As Apple’s Eddy Cue began speaking to a room filled with MLS\nowners and executives last week in Washington, D.C., he harked\nback to conversations he had with league officials a year\nearlier, just as Apple was signing a 10-year deal for the\nleague’s media rights.</p>\n\n<p>At that time, Cue recalled last Wednesday, when several MLS owners\nand league executives came up to him and asked what the teams\ncould do to help ensure that the groundbreaking deal was\nsuccessful, Cue would offer the same response — sign good\nplayers.</p>\n\n<p>Addressing the MLS board of governors just days before the world’s\ngreatest soccer player, Lionel Messi, would debut for Inter Miami\nCF, Cue smiled and told the group of MLS owners and officials,\n“Boy did you deliver.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Messi’s debut on Friday was spectacularly dramatic — <a href=\"https://twitter.com/InterMiamiCF/status/1682575130269032448\">a game-winning free kick in extra time</a>. If you put that in a movie script people would roll their eyes.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The number of MLS Season Pass subscribers is a closely guarded\nsecret. Viewership figures for individual games are never shared\npublicly. Multiple high-level club business executives said they\nwere required by [Apple, <em>sic</em>] to sign non-disclosure agreements in order to see\nany numbers pertaining to the number of MLS Season Pass\nsubscribers. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Sources said MLS Season Pass is approaching 1 million subscribers,\na number that includes season-ticket holders who are provided\naccess as part of their purchase. In early June, those same\nsources had the MLS Season Pass subscriber base at 700,000, which\nleague executives believe shows good growth, and they expect that\nnumber to balloon even further once Messi starts playing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One of the striking differences between traditional TV broadcasting and streaming — not just for sports, but everything — is that with traditional TV, viewership ratings are public. The networks brag about high ratings. With streaming, viewership is a tightly-held secret. Is 1 million subscribers an accurate count for MLS Season Pass? Only Apple knows. Is that a good number? It’s hard to say, because the NFL, NBA, and MLB keep the numbers for their equivalent subscription packages secret too.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/25/mls-apple\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"47a7978754aac01be4aa24da5741f5a407dadbf6913383a835af57e400d1bc6d","category":"Tech"}
