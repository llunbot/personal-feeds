Whether you're deploying to Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, other cloud and SaaS offerings, or an on-premises datacenter, Terraform can be your single control plane, using infrastructure as code for infrastructure automation to provision and manage your entire infrastructure.</p>\n<img src=\"https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1718378819-screenshot-2024-06-14-at-11-26-26-am.png\" alt=\"Terraform\" /><h2><strong>HCP Terraform integrations</strong></h2>\n\n<p>HCP Terraform (earlier known as Terraform Cloud) is a fully managed SaaS platform for teams and organizations to adopt and scale their Infrastructure Lifecycle Management, including state management, policy as code enforcement, drift detection, continuous health checks, and more. </p>\n\n<h3><strong>ServiceNow</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Version 2.5 of the <a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/integrations/service-now/service-catalog-terraform\">ServiceNow Service Catalog for Terraform</a>, now <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/servicenow-catalog-for-terraform-adds-no-code-integration\">generally available</a>, has the ability to provision <a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/cloud/no-code-provisioning\">no-code workspaces</a> through the Service Catalog. This update gives ServiceNow administrators the option to link Catalog Items in the Terraform Catalog to no-code modules in the HCP Terraform private registry instead of directly connecting to version control system (VCS) repositories. This feature opens up a new avenue for creating Terraform workspaces and provisioning infrastructure using no-code modules, empowering users to seamlessly deploy pre-approved modules without writing any Terraform code. </p>\n\n<h2><strong>Terraform Enterprise integrations</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Terraform Enterprise is the self-managed distribution of HCP Terraform that allows teams and organizations to adopt and scale their Infrastructure Lifecycle Management, including state management, policy as code enforcement, drift detection, continuous health checks, and more.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Red Hat</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Terraform Enterprise is now fully supported for deployment on Podman with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and above. With the<a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/terraform-enterprise-adds-podman-support-and-workflow-enhancements\"> general availability</a> of Podman support in <a href=\"https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/enterprise/releases/2024/v202404-2\">Terraform Enterprise v202404-2</a> and above, organizations that have standardized on Red Hat Enterprise Linux can continue to leverage their preferred platform with a fully supported upgrade path.</p>\n\n<h2><strong>Terraform providers</strong></h2>\n\n<p>As part of our focus on helping drive innovation through new Terraform integrations and AI, we recently launched our AI Spotlight Collection on the <a href=\"https://registry.terraform.io/\">HashiCorp Terraform Registry</a>.  Our goal is to accelerate Terraform users’ IT operations and support AIOps implementations by integrating with our AI and ML partners. Make sure to keep an eye on the spotlight section as we continue to expand our listed offerings in the coming months.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, we had 15 new verified Terraform providers from 11 different partners over the previous quarter:</p>\n\n<h3><strong>CAST.AI</strong></h3>\n\n<p>CAST.AI, makers of a Kubernetes automation platform, released a new <a href=\"https://registry.terraform.io/providers/castai/castai/latest\">Terraform provider for CAST AI</a> that can be used to onboard your cluster and manage resources supported by CAST AI.</p>\n\n<h3><strong>Cisco Systems</strong></h3>\n\n<p>Cisco delivers software-defined networking, cloud, and security solutions to help transform businesses.
