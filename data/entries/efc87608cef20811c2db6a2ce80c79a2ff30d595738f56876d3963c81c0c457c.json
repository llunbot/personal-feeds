On Tuesday, the Supreme Court <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/supreme-court-declines-to-hear-apple-vs-epic-case/\">declined</a> to hear separate requests from both Apple and ‚ÄåEpic Games‚Äå in their long-standing lawsuit against each other regarding <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> rules, effectively closing a case that has run since <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/13/apple-removes-fortnite-from-app-store/\">August 2020</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/05/app-store-blue-banner-epic-1.jpg\" width=\"1794\" height=\"1009\" />\r<br />\nIn multiple rounds of the dispute, Apple has won on every count with the exception of just one regarding Apple's \"anti-steering\" rule, which the company <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/us-app-store-alternative-purchase-option/\">promptly addressed on Tuesday</a>. As a result of the Supreme Court's decision, the previous rulings stand and Apple is able to continue to disallow third-party payment processing within apps.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNow though, Apple has asked the court to allow it to bill Epic for its litigation expenses, which amount to a whopping $73,404,326. According to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/games_fray/status/1747504306532630858\"><em>gamesfray</em>'s Florian Mueller</a>, Apple came up with the number by totaling up the $82,971,401 in legal costs it spent on the case, and then adjusted that number down to $81,560,362. Apple then deducted 10% since Epic prevailed on 1 of 10 counts (Apple's anti-steering rule).\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple bases the claim on Epic's original violation of its developer agreement, when out of the blue its Fortnite game offered an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/13/fornite-adds-direct-payment-option-on-ios/\">in-app payment alternative</a> on the ‚ÄåApp Store‚Äå. Epic previously accepted that it would owe damages if it lost its antitrust claims against Apple. Now that it has, Apple has issued the bill.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Apple</a> wants <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/EpicGames?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#EpicGames</a> to reimburse $73 MILLION AND COUNTING (the dispute isn't over yet) in litigation expenses.
