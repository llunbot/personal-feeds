The claim is part of a wider  leak allegedly revealing that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/10/both-iphone-17-pro-models-three-48mp-cameras/\">both iPhone 17 Pro models will have three 48MP cameras</a> for the first time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe sensor size notation originates from an old system used for video camera tubes, where the fraction represents the sensor's \"type\" rather than its actual physical dimensions. In this system, a 1/1.3\" sensor is slightly smaller than a 1/1.28\" sensor, despite the denominator being larger. (For comparison's sake, the 48MP Fusion camera on the standard iPhone 16 model uses a smaller 1/1.56\" sensor.)\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe difference however is minimal, with the existing 1/1.28\" sensor offering a marginally larger surface area than a 1/1.3\" sensor. In practical terms, this size difference is unlikely to result in a noticeable impact on everyday photography. Apple's shift to using a smaller main camera could represent a worthwhile trade-off, with potential advancements elsewhere in the camera system to maintain or enhance overall performance. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf the downgrade is true, Apple's shift from 1/1.28\" to 1/1.3\" could be due to space constraints caused by the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/25/first-iphone-17-pro-design-leak/\">rumored new camera bump design</a>.  As part of a return to using aluminum, Apple is believed to be using a larger rectangular-style camera bump on the iPhone 17 Pro models that is made from aluminum rather than glass. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nSupply chain leaks have <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/12/iphone-17-pro-redesign-backed-by-supply-chain-info/\">backed up</a> a report by <em>The Information</em> about a camera design change. Leaks coming out of China suggest that the module is an \"elongated oval shape,\" rather than a rectangular shape, with a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/06/iphone-17-design-smoother-edge-to-back/\">smoother transition</a> between the camera bump and the rear cover. The iPhone 17 series is expected to arrive around the usual mid-September time frame.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digital-chat-station/\">Digital Chat Station</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/10/iphone-17-pro-main-camera-sensor-smaller/\">iPhone 17 Pro Main Camera Sensor 'Smaller' Than iPhone 16 Pro Sensor</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-pro-main-camera-sensor-smaller-than-iphone-16-pro-sensor.2447120/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"40ed022d34d586c5609d1302fa36d4e83ceb67b6d7e4f4f1cb90a08535cca65a","category":"Apple"}
