The release notes state that, “This update provides important bug fixes and security updates and is recommended for all users.” There are no other details in the notes, and Apple’s <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201222&amp;xcust=1-1-2130011-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">security releases website</a> states that 14.1.1 has, “no published CVE entries,” which means that it does not address any security concerns in the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://cve.mitre.org/&amp;xcust=1-1-2130011-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures database</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has also released macOS Ventura 13.6.2, which does not appear on Apple’s Developer website, but it is mentioned in Apple’s security releases. It’s possible the 13.6.2 is for the new 14-inch M3 MacBook Pro because some customers have reported that the laptop has <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2129494/m3-macbook-pros-macos-ventura-13-5-sonoma-14.html\">Ventura instead of Sonoma</a>, and upgrades are not being allowed. The 13.6.2 patch could allow that laptop to upgrade.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to install macOS Sonoma 14.1 and Ventura 13.6.2</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before installing the update, we recommend backing up your Mac’s data.
