It would be a sequel to the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/09/google-merges-chromecast-and-android-tv-with-the-chromecast-with-google-tv/\">aging 2020 model</a> that was never really fit for the job in the first place. It would also sit alongside the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/09/the-new-chromecast-is-official-its-30-runs-google-tv-and-has-a-remote/\">2022 HD model</a>.</p>\n<p>The report says the new device would stay at the $50 price point and come with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1699886923328745634\">a new remote</a>. A new chip would be the primary motivation for a new device. The current 4K dongle has an Amlogic S905X3 (it's just for Cortex A55 CPUs), and if Google sticks with Amlogic, a good upgrade would be the upcoming <a href=\"https://androidtvbox.eu/sei-robotics-unveils-next-gen-amlogic-s905x5-ai-sr-atv-box-at-ibc-2023/\">Amlogic S905X5</a>. Besides a faster CPU and GPU, it also supports the AV1 video codec, something Google has <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/04/youtube-is-now-building-its-own-video-transcoding-chips/\">been pushing</a> across its ecosystem because it can cut down on what must be an incredible YouTube bandwidth bill. It has made AV1 a requirement for some new devices in order to get the YouTube app, and despite forcing it on competitors <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/04/roku-vs-google-part-2-the-youtube-tv-app-gets-pulled-from-the-roku-store/\">like Roku</a>, Google's best dongle doesn't have hardware support for the codec yet. Technically the S905X5 is not official yet, so we don't have a full spec sheet, but partners have been talking about it since last year.</p>\n<p>The No. 1 thing a new Google TV dongle needs, and has needed for years, is more storage. Google Hardware is supposed to make devices that are purpose-built for Google's software, but the 4K and HD Chromecasts with Google TV have never really been up to the task thanks to the 8GB of total device storage. Back in the early Chromecast days when these dongles ran a custom OS and only showed video streams, that was fine. These new devices run full-fat Android now, complete with a Play Store, access to millions of apps, and lots of preinstalled software. 8GB is not nearly enough.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019305#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019305&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ad9fd041bb42d8c902ec4eac026d8007825d8843b1995254e0b398275a1db8a2","category":"Tech"}
