Fallon – wearing Apple Vision Pro – met Cook with mock disbelief while picking up his new iPhone, with Cook personally handing him the device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/tim-cook-jimmy-fallon.jpg\" width=\"3016\" height=\"1694\" />\r<br />\nAs they strolled to Apple's Upper East Side store, Cook explained that he tries to visit the Fifth Avenue location during every major launch. Fallon joked about Cook's rockstar-like reception from fans, but Cook humbly attributed it to people's love for Apple.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe two discussed Cook's 27-year journey at Apple, during which Cook admitted he never expected to become CEO. On the tech front, Cook expressed excitement about Apple Intelligence, which is set to begin rolling out next month. Cook talked up upcoming features like automatic email summarization and fun new creative tools such as Genmoji and Image Playground.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nThe chat ended on a playful note, with Fallon showing off his \"psychic\" skills by guessing Cook's mustard preference on hot dogs, before gifting him some New York-themed swag — though not all of it made the cut for Cook's local look.
