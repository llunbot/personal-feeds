The answer is “yes,” according to the promising results achieved by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), which has saved thousands of hours of labor for local governments by creating a tool called SolarAPP+ (Solar Automated Permit Processing Plus) for residential solar permits.</p>\n<p>“We estimate that automatic SolarAPP+ permitting saved around 9,900 hours of… staff time in 2022,” NREL staff wrote in the report, “<a href=\"https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy23osti/85827.pdf\">SolarAPP+ Performance Review (2022 Data)</a>. “Based on median timelines, a typical SolarAPP+ project is permitted and inspected 13 business days sooner than traditional projects… SolarAPP+ has eliminated over 134,000 days in permitting-related delays.”</p>\n<p>SolarAPP+ automates over 100 compliance checks in the permitting process that are usually the responsibility of city, county, or town employees, according to Jeff Cook, SolarAPP+ program lead at NREL and first author of the report. It can be more accurate, thorough, and efficient than a time-pressured local government employee would be.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992559#p3\">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992559&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9b6a8979937ffe03f2baa58e3d904961e5621ec1d4ef76311e070d3ff2157678","category":"Tech"}
