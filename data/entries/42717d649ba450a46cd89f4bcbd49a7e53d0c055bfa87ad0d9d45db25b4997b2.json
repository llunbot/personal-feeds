Corima says the shallower depth caters for mountainous routes, and the deeper rim provides versatility and strikes “the balance between performance and comfort”.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/buyers-guide-to-road-bike-wheels/\">road bike wheelsets</a> are constructed with carbon fibre wrapped around foam on the inside of the rim, which aids stiffness.</p>\n<p>The wheelsets feature a new ratchet system in their hubs. Corima claims the hub in the MCC EVO provides riders with a 17 per cent faster engagement and transmission rate than Corima’s previous D2T Ratchet hub.</p>\n<p>The MCC EVO is the more expensive of the two wheelsets, costing £3,590/$4,200/€3,690.</p>\n<p>The WS EVO retails for £1,890/$2,300/€1,990.</p>\n<h2>MCC EVO wheelset</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Corima MCC Evo wheelset.\" title=\"_O5A9692\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The carbon spokes are bonded to the hub and rim.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Stan Portus / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Corima describes the MCC EVO as the “pinnacle” of its range and says the wheelset is aimed at racers.</p>\n<p>The wheelset has a complete carbon fibre construction featuring a 3K carbon fibre construction, carbon Corima D2T hub and patented carbon fibre spokes.</p>\n<p>The wheels have 12 carbon fibre spokes each. While this is fewer spokes than many of the best carbon fibre road bike wheels, Corima says the wheelset has the best stiffness-to-weight ratio on the market.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Corima MCC Evo wheelset.\" title=\"_O5A9690\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The wheelset has a 21mm internal rim width.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Stan Portus / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The carbon spokes are bonded to the rim rather than threaded through it, as with conventional spokes.</p>\n<p>This enables Look to further decrease the weight of the wheelset because it does not have to add more carbon fibre to the inside of the rim where a conventional spoke would be tensioned.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Corima wheel showing foam inside rim.\" title=\"corima wheel\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Here you can see the foam inside the rim.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Stan Portus / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Corima says the MCC EVO in its 47mm depth has an average of more than 15 per cent stiffness compared to its competitors.</p>\n<p>At Eurobike, Corima revealed it tested the wheels against five competitors from top-brand manufacturers.</p>\n<p>The top competitor matched the MCC Evo 47 for efficiency.</p>\n<p>Corima has not said who the five competitors are.</p>\n<p>The brand says the stiffness will help extend the lifetime of the product due to the minimising of warping in the wheel.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, the wheelset has an internal <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/rim-width-explained-for-road-bikes-mountain-bikes-and-gravel-bikes/\">rim width</a> of 21mm and an external width of 26mm. Corima says it is compatible with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bike-tyres/\">road bike tyres</a> ranging from 25mm to 32mm.</p>\n<p>Corima says the hookless version of the MCC EVO weighs a claimed 1,445g (32mm deep) or 1,480g (47mm deep).</p>\n<p>The tubular wheelset weighs a claimed 1,280g (32mm deep) or 1,330g (42mm deep).</p>\n<h2>WS EVO wheelset</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Corima WS wheelset.\" title=\"_O5A9696\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Corima WS wheelset has a more standard spoke design compared to the MCC Evo.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Stan Portus / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>As the lower-priced of the two wheelsets, it should be no surprise the WS EVO has a lower spec than the MCC EVO, even if it retains many of the same features.</p>\n<p>The wheelset also has a 3K carbon fibre construction, but each wheel trades 12 carbon fibre spokes for 20 R2 spokes.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Corima MCC Evo wheelset.\" title=\"_O5A9699\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> You can see the carbon weave in the rim.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Stan Portus / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>This contributes to an increase in weight. The hookless version of the wheelset weighs a claimed 1,505g (32mm deep) or 1,540g (47mm deep). The tubular version weighs a claimed 1,390g (32mm deep) or 1,490gg (47mm deep).</p>\n<p>The wheelset also forgoes a carbon fibre hub, instead featuring Corima’s EVO S Ratchet hubs.</p>\n<p>These hubs share the same ratchet engagement system as the Corima D2T hubs, but, filling in the blanks left by Corima, do not offer the same 17 per cent faster engagement rate.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Corima WS wheelset.\" title=\"_O5A9698\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The hub uses the new ratchet system, providing 10 degrees of engagement.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Stan Portus / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The WS EVO has the same internal and external rim widths as the MCC EVO, and can also fit 25-32mm tyres.</p>\n<h2>Lifetime warranty and crash replacement</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Corima WS wheelset.\" title=\"_O5A9693\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Both wheelsets come with QR codes printed on them to provide information about the wheels.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Stan Portus / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>With the launch of these wheels, Corima has also announced a new rim lifetime warranty and crash replacement scheme.</p>\n<p>The rim warranty scheme should protect against any defects in the wheelsets’ rims.</p>\n<p>The crash replacement scheme lasts for three years and you must register your wheelset within one month of purchase.</p>\n<p>The wheelsets also feature a QR code, which links to a website where you can find out information such as optimal <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/road-bike-tyre-pressure/\">tyre pressure</a>, a list of compatible tyres and instructional videos about the wheels.</p>\n\n<p> </p>","author":"Stan Portus","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"42717d649ba450a46cd89f4bcbd49a7e53d0c055bfa87ad0d9d45db25b4997b2","category":"Cycling"}
