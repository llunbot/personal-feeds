In this latest <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/tag/bike-hacks/\" target=\"_blank\">Bike Hacks</a> installment, Hailey shares some tips for how to maximize carrying capacity while minimizing negative bike-handling effects with the best bikepacking gear for hardtails she’s found.</em><span></span></p>\n<p>I’ve been taking bikepacking trips on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/tag/hardtails/\" target=\"_blank\">hardtails</a> for a few years now. Although you trade some of the liveliness of a drop-bar bike, I’ve found the extra capability afforded by a hardtail’s MTB geo and front suspension makes for a reliable — and more confidence-inspiring — ride when loaded down, at least on terrain that strays beyond pure and predictable gravel.</p>\n<p>Going up the steeps, I love the feeling of climbing with a flat bar and, on the other side, going full-send with the dropper down. And, the ergonomics of mountain bike brake levers feel more forgiving on my hands on sustained or rough descents. Speaking of hands, the broader cockpit that a flat bar creates also allows for more variety in hand positions, to alleviate pressure on the palms day-in and day-out.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/DSC05430.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/DSC05430.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/DSC05430.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/DSC05430.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The higher stack of most hardtails coupled with their stable handling makes it easier for me to rest my forearms on the bars on smoother terrain, too. For maximal hand comfort, my cockpit setup includes <a href=\"http://ergonbike.com/en/product-details.html?anr=42410038&amp;s=gpmtb&amp;a=griffe\" target=\"_blank\">Ergon’s GP3 BioKork</a> grips for their big comfy platform and the integrated bar ends, and a second pair of inboard-positioned bar ends (no-name Amazon find) for straight-line riding when I want to tuck down out of the wind.</p>\n<p>There’s a lot to recommend a hardtail as the ideal bikepacking rig, the only drawback that I’ve found is… packing them.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><em>My touring setup for riding the Monumental Loop in winter 2023. </em></p>\n<h3>Packing Woes: Bikepacking on a Hardtail</h3>\n<p>Packing a hardtail with bikepacking gear is a game of Tetris, maximizing small triangles of space here and there. If I’m taking a hardtail out for a night or longer, I’m planning on riding at least some technical terrain and I pay more attention to how I balance my cargo on the bike than I might when loading up a drop-bar bike. Because of their higher trail (as compared to gravel bikes), mountain bikes are more susceptible to the drunken-goat handling effect of putting too much weight on the handlebars, so I try to prioritize bulky-but-lightweight items here, like my sleeping bag, or puffy jacket and warm clothes.</p>\n<p>On the other end, dropper posts can limit seatbag storage, and too much weight in the rear can have its own negative impact on handling, especially on steep descents (more on this later).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><div>\n<a href=\"https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/IMG_2276.mp4\">https://radavist-static-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/04/IMG_2276.mp4</a></div></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The lower standover of MTBs is a benefit for riding trails, but it eats into main triangle packing space for loaded riding. I’ve found that Oveja Negra’s stock Superwedgie™ and Bodega frame bags fit surprisingly well in a couple different hardtail frames I’ve ridden, but it’s also common to go the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/making-your-own-bicycle-frame-bags/\" target=\"_blank\">fully custom</a> route to maximize frame fittage when outfitting a hardtail for bikepacking. Regardless, I typically use main triangle space for heavier items, like electronics and my repair kit. Tool cans and down-tube bags, like <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/tailfin-v-mount-pack-review/\" target=\"_blank\">the ones from Tailfin</a>, are other creative storage options; I’ve used the former with success, but I’ve found that the latter are a little too finicky to keep clear of my chainring.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/DSC05433.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/DSC05433.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/DSC05433.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/DSC05433.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Stem bags and segmented top-tube bags (for either stem or seatpost attachment) are my go-to for keeping snacks on hand, and full-length top-tube bags are becoming more commonplace (but even if you can stack a a few six-inch subs in there, I have to say, I don’t love the look).</p>\n<p>Factoring in all of these nooks-and-crannies storage options, I still come up short when packing my hardtail for solo bikepacking trips. Leaving with my pockets stuffed full of burritos and bars and wearing a hydration pack are inevitabilities I’ve accepted for solo trips with singletrack and/or rough miles on the menu. When riding with my partner, I can get away without wearing a pack as we’re able to split up necessities like electronic charging bricks, repair kit, stove and water filter, but I’ve found the extra water and snack capacity of a hydration pack essential on run-out or backcountry independent missions.</p>\n<p>My hardtail bikepacking setup is one that I’m constantly tweaking and trying to optimize (I hate riding with a pack); it has been both maddening and rewarding to find marginally improved solutions to carrying all my stuff. And while some of the gains have been indeed marginal, others have been significant thanks to a few new and less-new products out there. To hopefully save you some of the same headache, here’s an overview of the best gear for bikepacking on a hardtail that I’ve found.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails-09.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails-09.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails-09.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails-09.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;merchant_id=9810ede6-4922-46d9-b096-e2993c490cc6&amp;website_id=6ec3743b-a948-4c16-9d12-4b79ac107f25&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Foldmanmountain.com%2Fproduct%2Faxle-pack-3%2F%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOoqM5wGBIA9d44NoIE4cjFsGY-1FNJXi4sZCu7lhiOAMzS9gnjx-\" target=\"_blank\">Old Man Mountain Axle Pack — $60</a></h3>\n<p>Spencer shared an enthusiastic <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/old-man-mountain-axle-pack-first-ride-review/\" target=\"_blank\">first-ride review</a> of Old Man Mountain’s Axle Pack when it first launched, and in my experience, after a few trips with this setup, it has lived up to the hype. While I’ve gone the hose-clamp route on rigid forks without mounts, I’ve always been leery of using this hack on suspension forks for fear of causing damage to the internals. Still, fork blades are an incredibly useful place to mount some extra cargo via micropanniers or bottles, as the position allows the weight to ride low enough to minimize negative handling effects.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails-08.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails-08.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails-08.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails-08.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails-10.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails-10.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails-10.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails-10.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Running the Axle Pack requires getting a bespoke thru-axle (available on OMM’s site, not included in list price) that the aluminum struts then mount to. The clamping hardware comes with burly, UV-resistant zip ties (though, as pictured above, I’ve used standard ones in a pinch) and each strut is rated to carry up to 5 kg (~11 lb), versus the 1.5 kg (~3.3 lb) that Old Man Mountain states most 3-pack mounts are rated to carry. For reference a liter of water weighs about 2.2 lb, so think of a 3-pack mount as not being rated to carry much more than that. In short, after picking up an Axle Pack last spring, it’s now become a staple in my backcountry bikepacking setup.</p>\n<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>A safe and tested way to mount cargo on suspension forks, as well as carbon forks without 3-pack mounts</li>\n<li>Rated to carry more weight than most 3-pack mounts</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Custom thru-axle cannot be removed without detaching the rack.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails%E2%80%9411.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails%E2%80%9411.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails%E2%80%9411.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails%E2%80%9411.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://rockgeist.com/product/barjam-brackets/\" target=\"_blank\">Rockgeist BarJam Brackets and Carbon Bar 2.0 — $130</a></h3>\n<p>The Rockgeist BarJam is a nifty piece of hardware that made it into my <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/haileys-2024-summer-product-picks/\" target=\"_blank\">Summer ’24 Product Picks</a> list and the more I use it, the more I appreciate its functionality. The aluminum brackets (paired with stainless steel bolts) are compatible with 31.8 or 35 mm handlebars and are weight-rated far beyond what one would ever consider carrying on the bars, even if you were actually carrying a drunk goat (728 lb).</p>\n<p>Although it doesn’t technically increase cargo storage, the BarJam adds coveted handlebar real estate for mounting computers, GPS trackers, and lights, while also distancing a bar-roll harness or handlebar bag from your cables. I’ve heard horror stories about bags rubbing through hydro brake cables on the Tour Divide, and I also have some bikes with scarred head badges thanks to cable rub under bags.</p>\n<p>Before having the BarJam, I would typically run out of space on my handlebars to strap my Garmin InReach. A couple summers back, on a two-night tour on the Colorado Trail, I had my InReach strapped to my hydration pack and it bounced off somewhere on the rough descent off of Georgia Pass (I was riding South/West starting in Denver). I rode all the way into Breckenridge for dinner before I realized. That night, I rode back up to the start of the climb (via a more direct fire road), ditched my bike where I planned to bivvy and then hiked a total of six miles in the dark in my bike shoes, by headlamp light with my phone out like a divining rod, trying to relocate my InReach (I did find it). Moral of the story being, I now always ride with my InReach in sight on the bars.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails%E2%80%9413.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails%E2%80%9413.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails%E2%80%9413.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails%E2%80%9413.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails%E2%80%9412.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails%E2%80%9412.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails%E2%80%9412.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails%E2%80%9412.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>When out on a multi-day ride, the cockpit of my bike feels like my control center: lights, computer, InReach, maybe dynamo charging—it’s where all the mental action happens.

But hear me out. First of all, you don’t have to run the panniers (duh) and, in fact, I would recommend <em>not</em> running the panniers in conjunction with the AeroPack for really steep, winding, and technical riding (to use my much-referenced backyard example: the Colorado Trail).</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails-07.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails-07.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails-07.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails-07.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I recently tested out this setup on a short overnighter through Canyonlands in Utah, and I definitely felt like the extra weight of the full setup impacted the bike’s handling: rear braking felt less-than-instantaneous on some short-lived sections of ledgy step-downs (meaning I walked some terrain I might have otherwise ridden); I found it more difficult to bring the rear wheel around when turning on off-camber descents; and — in flat-but-banked sandy two-track — I noticed the rear wheel had a tendency to slide down toward the road’s center-line, pulling me off balance with it.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Canyonlands_Overnighter_March_2025-4.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Canyonlands_Overnighter_March_2025-4.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Canyonlands_Overnighter_March_2025-4.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Canyonlands_Overnighter_March_2025-4.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Canyonlands_Overnighter_March_2025-1.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Canyonlands_Overnighter_March_2025-1.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Canyonlands_Overnighter_March_2025-1.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Canyonlands_Overnighter_March_2025-1.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Canyonlands_Overnighter_March_2025-3.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Canyonlands_Overnighter_March_2025-3.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Canyonlands_Overnighter_March_2025-3.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Canyonlands_Overnighter_March_2025-3.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>All that said, I’d probably use this same setup again for that trip, with maybe a little more due diligence in weight distribution. At some point, when space is limited, you have to make some compromises, and the Tailfin AeroPack delivers 18 L of convenience and ease of use, despite the handling drawbacks. The benefits of being able to easily carry ample water, a JetBoil, extra layers, and two-days worth of food outweighed the handling annoyances, at least on this route where the climbing wasn’t crazy and — with the exception of some limited hike-a-bike, both up and down — sand largely posed the most technical challenge. I could see using this system on popular routes like the Tour Divide or the Monumental Loop.</p>\n<p>It’s hard to give concise figures for the AeroPack’s cost and weight. With choices like alloy or carbon construction, pannier mounts or not, five options for add-on panniers (and, I might add, three options for strap-closure configuration that you can modify on the panniers’ yourself), three axle/frame attachment designs, and various other adjustable doodads, it is almost infinitely <a href=\"https://www.tailfin.cc/product/rear-systems/aeropacks/aeropack/?v=0b3b97fa6688\" target=\"_blank\">configurable</a>. In short though, the cost/weight breaks down how you might expect: carbon is lighter and more expensive, alloy is cheaper and a tad heavier.</p>\n<p>For either option, the AeroPack is impressively featured. Perhaps most compellingly, it is easy to make compatible with dropper posts (with the use of an extender that creates more distance from the seatpost attachment point), and custom thru-axle design with fast-release dropouts means that it can be readily swapped between bikes—from a ‘cross bike turned lite tourer to a hardtail.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails-02.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails-02.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails-02.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails-02.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails-05.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails-05.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails-05.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails-05.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>When I think of the best use-case for this system, I think of someone who owns two bikes: maybe a svelter gravel bike that is fast on the road and capable enough when loaded down on dirt and a hardtail for mountain biking. With an extra bespoke axle, I could imagine someone investing in this setup and a handlebar roll and be largely set for bikepacking or touring (or commuting!) on either without too much fuss.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails-03.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails-03.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails-03.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails-03.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails-04.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails-04.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails-04.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Bike-Hacks-Bikepacking-Gear-for-Hardtails-04.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>One additional note: the initial setup seems a little daunting (there are lots of small parts), but Tailfin has very helpful tutorials on their YouTube on how to set up the AeroPack. I had mine fully assembled in about half an hour. Once it’s put together, the AeroPack and rack are one unit. The price tag is high, but the AeroPack offers far more storage capacity for hardtail bikepacking than just about anything else I’ve found.

All of their tools and accessories show a lot of intentionality to solving real-world bike problems. The <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/wolf-tooth-b-rad-system-review/\" target=\"_blank\">B-RAD system</a> is no different.</p>\n<p>Rather than offering a piece of hardware with a single use, the B-RAD system is designed to add more flexibility to mounting bottle cages and bags across your bike. The system uses B-RAD mounting bases as a foundation: three sizes of aluminum plates that mount to frame bosses and then allow you to bolt your bottle cage (or bag) anywhere along the base’s groove. Essentially, the mounting base could serve the same function as a drop cage by allowing you to lower the placement of a bottle inside your triangle (maybe squeeze in a taller bottle), but it can also go the other way, allowing you to slide the mounting point higher on whatever plane you’re working with.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Otso-Cycles-Hoot-Ti-Review-52.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Otso-Cycles-Hoot-Ti-Review-52.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Otso-Cycles-Hoot-Ti-Review-52.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/Otso-Cycles-Hoot-Ti-Review-52.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>In addition to the Mounting Base options, the B-RAD system includes half and double Bottle Adapters; the half works with the base to rotate the bottle cage slightly outward (say, to clear a rear shock) and the double allows you to run two bottles side-by-side from a single Mounting Base. Other B-RAD accessories include the B-RAD Everywhere Base which lets you mount a cage, or bag, in a spot without frame mounts, and two sizes of the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/travis-favorite-products-2023/\" target=\"_blank\">Wolf Tooth B-Rad TekLite Roll-Top Bags</a>, which earned a call-out in one of Travis’ previous Favorites lists.</p>\n<p>If you’re inclined to tinkering than the B-RAD system has a lot to offer. And because frame sizes and bikepacking setups can vary so drastically across riders, rather than outline how I configure my B-RAD accessories, I’d just suggest perusing the <a href=\"https://www.wolftoothcomponents.com/collections/b-rad-system?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw7pO_BhAlEiwA4pMQvEh32ZhnDfPiyzUEL5DuAgKCzZKRU0zduz1Qrr7-m2RvyDri64DTNxoCZKkQAvD_BwE\" target=\"_blank\">collection page</a> and finding what works in the gaps on your setup.</p>\n<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mounting Bases are an innovative accessory that lets you work around the limitations of frame mounts</li>\n<li>Lots of compelling accessories</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>…?</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>What about your experiences packing a hardtail?
