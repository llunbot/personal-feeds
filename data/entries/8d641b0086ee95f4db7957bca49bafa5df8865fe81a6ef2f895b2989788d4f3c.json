There is a little too much darkness in this world and not enough light, a little too much pseudoscience and not enough science. We'll let other publications offer you a daily horoscope. At Ars Technica, we're going to take a different route, finding inspiration from very real images of a universe that is filled with stars and wonder.</em></p>\n    \n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Good morning. It's February 12, and today's image is a real treat from the surface of Mars.</p>\n<p>In it we see the larger of Mars' two moons, Phobos, passing in front of the Sun. NASA's Mars Perseverance rover acquired this image using its Left Mastcam-Z camera, one of two powerful cameras located high on the rover's mast. It was acquired on February 8, 2024 (Sol 1056). Phobos is rather small, with a radius of just 11 km. But since its orbit is less than 10,000 km from the surface of Mars, it still appears rather impressive against the distant Sun.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2002552#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2002552&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8d641b0086ee95f4db7957bca49bafa5df8865fe81a6ef2f895b2989788d4f3c","category":"Tech"}
