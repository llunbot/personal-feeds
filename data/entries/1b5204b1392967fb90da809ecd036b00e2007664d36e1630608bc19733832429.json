10”.</p>\n<p>Previously, membership to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/zwift-your-complete-guide/\">Zwift</a>, one of the most popular <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-indoor-cycling-apps/\">indoor cycling apps</a>, was only available on a monthly basis, for £12.99 / $14.99 / €14.99 (unless you got a year’s subscription bundled with a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-smart-trainer/\">smart trainer</a>, such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/indoor-trainers/zwift-hub-review/\">Zwift Hub</a>).</p>\n<p>Now, though, users can sign up for a full year for £129.99 / $149.99 / €149.99.</p>\n<p>This represents a saving of £25.89 / $29.89 / €29.89 compared to a year charged on a monthly basis.</p>\n<h2>Better value, less flexibility</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Zwift Hub One\" title=\"Zwift Hub One\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Annual Zwift memberships were only previously available bundled with certain hardware, such as Zwift’s Hub smart trainer.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Zwift</i></span></div>\n<p>As well as being cheaper overall, Zwift says new users can sign up for an annual membership with a “30-day money-back guarantee”.</p>\n<p>This means that if you change your mind within the opening 30 days, you’ll be able to get a refund.</p>\n<p>Existing monthly members can switch over to an annual membership, but are not eligible for the 30-day money-back guarantee.</p>\n<p>Zwift notes that existing users who have subscribed via the Apple app store need to cancel their existing subscription and then subscribe via <a href=\"https://eu.zwift.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Zwift.com</a> to switch to an annual membership.</p>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Zwift\" title=\"Zwift_SvB_2023-10-20_16-58-23_2_clean\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Signing up for an annual membership is cheaper, but you’ll lose the flexibility to pause it during the year.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Zwift</i></span></div>\n<p>Monthly memberships will still be available, offering what Zwift calls “the most flexible way to Zwift”.</p>\n<p>With a monthly membership, you can pause your Zwift subscription during months when you’re not planning to use it.</p>\n<p>If, for example, you only use Zwift during the winter, you can pause your membership during the warmer months of the year and then reactivate it at a later date.</p>\n<p>The trade-off is that it works out as more expensive if you have an active membership for more than 10 months of the year.</p>\n<h2>How does Zwift’s price compare to the competition?</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n

plan brings Zwift’s annual price in line with Wahoo SYSTM’s.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Zwift</i></span></div>\n<p>The addition of an annual membership plan brings Zwift’s pricing in line with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/wahoo-systm-guide/\">Wahoo’s SYSTM</a>, one of its largest competitors in this space.</p>\n<p>Wahoo SYSTM costs $14.99 per month, or $149 a year. New users can sign up for a 14-day free trial, but as of 31 October 2023 Wahoo SYSTM no longer includes the now-defunct virtual indoor cycling app, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/rgt-cycling-guide/\">Wahoo RGT</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/trainerroad\">TrainerRoad</a> – another of Zwift’s key competitors – costs a little more, at $19.95 per month or $189 per year.</p>\n<p>In contrast to Zwift, TrainerRoad’s app is defined by a laser focus on training and a lack of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/opinion/indoor-cycling-gamification/\">gamified features</a> such as virtual climbs or power-ups.</p>","author":"Simon von Bromley","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"1b5204b1392967fb90da809ecd036b00e2007664d36e1630608bc19733832429","category":"Cycling"}
