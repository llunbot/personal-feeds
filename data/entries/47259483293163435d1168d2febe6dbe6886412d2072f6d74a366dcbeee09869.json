We will be working with MDLT to host a free volunteer event at Palisades Ranch, which is notable for being one of the few locations along the Mojave River where water flows above ground year-round.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2022Mojave-95.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2022Mojave-95.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2022Mojave-95.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2022Mojave-95.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2022Mojave-95.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2022Mojave-95.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2022Mojave-95.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/2022Mojave-95.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>The event will begin with a presentation by a USFWS biologist and MDLT project coordinator Yanina Aldao Galvan. This will cover the history of the ranch, and info about some of the endangered birds present in this incredibly diverse ecosystem, among other topics. Volunteers will then help with tasks including vertical mulching, fence repair, removal of invasive plants and tire dumps in the Palisades Ranch Area. Volunteers will be expected to handle light tools, and foot travel will be on trails and roads, as well as washes and fields.</p>\n<p>Learn more at the <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/earth-week-event-with-mojave-desert-land-trust-tickets-760903261137\" target=\"_blank\">Mojave Desert Land Trust</a>!</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/you-can-help-out-at-the-earth-week-event-with-mojave-desert-land-trust-on-palisades-ranch/\">You Can Help Out at the Earth Week Event With Mojave Desert Land Trust on Palisades Ranch</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"47259483293163435d1168d2febe6dbe6886412d2072f6d74a366dcbeee09869","category":"Cycling"}
