Like those cables, the cord will match the color of the iPhone but the connector will remain white.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>Yaay…yes?<br />But seems more likely as purple for me <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://t.co/0kWPk6YdeM&amp;xcust=1-1-2037639-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">pic.twitter.com/0kWPk6YdeM</a></p>— Kosutami (@KosutamiSan) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/KosutamiSan/status/1693671269852643780?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-2037639-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">August 21, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>An image shared by Kosutami shows five colors for the cables: pink, blue, purple, yellow, and black. Macrumors <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/21/iphone-15-could-come-with-color-matched-cables/&amp;xcust=1-1-2037639-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">also reported</a> that the iPhone 15 Pro models will come with color-matching cables as well. Kosutami also claims the cable will <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/kosutamisan/status/1693978301507973213&amp;xcust=1-1-2037639-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">increase in length</a> by 50 percent from 1 meter to 1.5 meters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cables will certainly be a step up from the Lightning-to-USB-C cables Apple currently supplies. For years, Apple has shipped a thin white cable that has been known to fray. These new cables will be much more durable and should be able to withstand years of use and abuse. Apple does make braided Lightning-to-USB-C cables, but they only ship with Mac accessories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don’t like the color of your cable, you’ll likely be able to buy a different color. Apple sells the <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-2037639-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MLYV3AM/A/USB-C%20to%20MagSafe%203%20Cable%20(2%C2%A0m)%20-%20Silver\">MagSafe cables for the M2 MacBook Air for $49</a> in silver, space gray, starlight, and midnight. Since the current 1-meter Lightning-to-USB-C cable is already fairly pricey at $19, a price hike to $29 would make it one of the highest-priced USB-C cables. Even so, many iPhone 15 buyers will surely want to collect them all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone 15 is expected to be unveiled at <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/831417/apple-september-iphone-event-date-time.html\">an event in September</a>.
