Apple will also be surveying the Region of Durham immediately east of Toronto.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple says it is committed to protecting the public's privacy while conducting these surveys. In line with Google's Street View, Apple censors faces and license plates in imagery made available through its Look Around feature. If you have comments or questions about this process, your privacy rights, or would like to request that a face, license plate, or your own house be censored, Apple says to email mapsimagecollection@apple.com.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIntroduced in iOS 13, Look Around provides 3D street-level imagery that can be zoomed and panned. The feature is already available in Canada, but Apple periodically revisits some locations \"in an effort to maintain a high-quality, up-to-date map.\" Look Around is also available in parts of the United States, UK, Ireland, and Japan.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-maps/\">Apple Maps</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/13/apple-maps-canada-backpack-surveys/\">Apple Surveying Canada's Largest Cities With Specialized Backpacks to Improve Maps</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-surveying-canadas-largest-cities-with-specialized-backpacks-to-improve-maps.2310554/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=BlSjk4cP8MI:Xkl6VACMYCM:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=BlSjk4cP8MI:Xkl6VACMYCM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/BlSjk4cP8MI\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c2121787fa23c255fe5ad6b384bc490944e6f2c3c21df5c44e761d266d6c24b3","category":"Apple"}
