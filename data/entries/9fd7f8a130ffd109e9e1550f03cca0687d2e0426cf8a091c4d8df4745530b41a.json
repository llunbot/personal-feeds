At the time, the analyst said Apple would likely release a large-screen foldable iPad or MacBook in that timeframe before launching a higher-volume foldable iPhone in late 2026.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPu had said one Apple foldable with a 20.3-inch display would start production in late 2025, which was sooner than previously expected. However, Pu now thinks Apple will join the foldable market in the second quarter of 2026 due to \"display durability issues.\"<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jeff-pu/\">Jeff Pu</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-ipad/\">Foldable iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/02/apple-foldable-ipad-delays/\">Apple's First Foldable iPad Could Face Delays Into 2026</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-first-foldable-ipad-could-face-delays-into-2026.2432754/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9fd7f8a130ffd109e9e1550f03cca0687d2e0426cf8a091c4d8df4745530b41a","category":"Apple"}
