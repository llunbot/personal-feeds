Last year it updated the DB12 with a smart new face, plenty of power, and the sort of infotainment you'd hope for from a luxury GT. The Vantage, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/11/aston-martin-reveals-its-all-new-vantage-a-503hp-v8-sports-car/\">the firm's 'entry-level' car</a>, has been given similar treatment in the hopes that it can peel a few more people away from Porsche dealerships.</p>\n<p>Aston's looking not only to make better cars, but to shift its imageâ€”it's aiming to be seen as more luxurious than before, as well as throwing as much power at the cars as possible. At first glance, it looks like Aston's cooked up something truly delightful.</p>\n<p>The new car is more than 150 hp (112 kW) more powerful than the one it replaces, with 656 hp (490 kW) and 590 lb-ft (800 Nm) from a wonderfully appointed turbocharged 4.0 L V8. 0-60 mph is quoted at 3.4 seconds, and Aston reckons that if you have enough space (and no speed limits) you'll see the far side of 200 mph (321 km/h). It is not slow.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023712#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2023712&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"17f4b013e0c3879ab217678aae9cf241d4692bd6bc06a95a249897563a9c3c82","category":"Tech"}
