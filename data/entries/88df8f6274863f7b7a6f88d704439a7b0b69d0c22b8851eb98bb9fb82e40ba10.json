Video is recorded at 30 frames per second at 1080p, and one minute of video takes up 130MB of storage space.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSpatial Videos taken with an ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ can be viewed on the ‌iPhone‌ as well, but the video appears to be a normal video and not a Spatial Video. Spatial Videos feature a \"Spatial\" label to denote that they can be viewed in 3D on the Vision Pro.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOn the Vision Pro headset, Spatial Videos are not shown full screen by default. If you expand the video, Apple warns that the video \"has excess motion\" and \"could cause discomfort if expanded.\"<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/ios-17-2-spatial-video-recording/\">iOS 17.2 Beta 2 Includes Feature for Recording Spatial Video on iPhone 15 Pro</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-2-beta-2-includes-feature-for-recording-spatial-video-on-iphone-15-pro.2410484/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"88df8f6274863f7b7a6f88d704439a7b0b69d0c22b8851eb98bb9fb82e40ba10","category":"Apple"}
