It really\ndoes provide a filmic, dreamy quality to the video that I was\npreviously only able to get with quick and continuous focus\nadjustments on an SLR shooting video with a manually focused lens.</p>\n\n<p>That, I think, is the major key to understanding Cinematic Mode.\nDespite the marketing, this mode is intended to unlock new\ncreative possibilities for the vast majority of iPhone users who\nhave no idea how to set focal distances, bend their knees to\nstabilize and crouch-walk-rack-focus their way to these kinds of\ntracking shots. It really does open up a big bucket that was just\ninaccessible before. And in many cases I think that those willing\nto experiment and deal with its near-term foibles will be\nrewarded with some great looking shots to add to their iPhone\nmemories widget.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That sounds right to me.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/21/panzarino-iphone-13-disneyland\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"076e348700e1d9677d7fc96f439bd5786a49ea064c56a4b951d9b27709fa0303","category":"Tech"}
