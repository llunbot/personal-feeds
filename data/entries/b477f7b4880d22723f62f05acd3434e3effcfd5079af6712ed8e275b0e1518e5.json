If you’re new to road riding, an endurance road bike is probably the right choice for you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s almost 20 years now since the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/specialized-tarmac-roubaix\">Specialized Roubaix</a> kicked off the endurance road bike revolution. Its fancy Zertz gel inserts were designed to reduce road buzz and its upright geometry placed the rider in a comparatively relaxed position.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although pitched at the amateur rider, the original Roubaix notched up some notable pro wins, particularly under <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/tom-boonen-on-life-after-racing-there-are-a-lot-of-things-on-the-table-but-give-me-a-few\">Tom Boonen</a> in the early season <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-classics-monuments-cobbles\">Classics</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Endurance road bikes have come a long way since then, but many of the bikes today share some key design principles and core technologies. Keep reading to the end for full details of every bike listed below plus a guide to the features we look for in an endurance road bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Reviews of the best endurance road bikes</h2>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Ribble Endurance AL Disc 105: RRP from £1,274 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/ribble-endurance-al-disc-105-review\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Specialized Allez Sport: RRP £1,600 –<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-allez-review\"> Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Canyon Endurace CF 7 eTap: RRP £2,899 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/canyon-endurace-cf-7-etap-review\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Mason Resolution: RRP £3,740 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/mason-resolution-review-2\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Lauf Úthald Race Wireless: RRP $5,080 <strong>–</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/lauf-uthald-race-wireless-review\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Enve Fray: RRP £5,500 (frameset)</strong> <strong><strong>–</strong> <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/enve-fray-road-bike-review\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Specialized Roubaix SL8: RRP £6,000 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-roubaix-sl8-review\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>BMC Roadmachine 01 Three:</strong> <strong>RRP £6,900 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/bmc-roadmachine-01-three-review\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>J.Laverack J.Ack III Di2: RRP £8,385 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/jlaverack-jack-iii-di2-review\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Open Min.D: RRP £8,450 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/open-mind-review\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cannondale Synapse Carbon 1 RLE:</strong> <strong>RRP £9,000 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/cannondale-synapse-carbon-1-rle-review\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Trek Domane SLR: RRP £9,500 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/trek-domane-slr-review\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Giant Defy Advanced SL 0: RRP £11,499 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/giant-defy-advanced-sl-0-2024-review\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Why trust Cyclist’s reviews?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/trek-madone-slr-17-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/trek-madone-slr-17-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/trek-madone-slr-17-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/trek-madone-slr-17-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/trek-madone-slr-17-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/trek-madone-slr-17-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/trek-madone-slr-17-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/trek-madone-slr-17-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/trek-madone-slr-17-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/trek-madone-slr-17-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/trek-madone-slr-17.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At <em>Cyclist</em>, we’ve been bringing you our pick of the best road bikes since 2012, with our print and online reviews covering everything from the budget to the money-no-object.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <em>Cyclist</em> team led by tech editor <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/authors/sam-challis\" target=\"_blank\">Sam Challis</a> have thousands of miles under their belts riding and writing about bikes and can spot what makes a great endurance bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve ridden every bike in this guide and our detailed reviews behind each will tell you what marks each out as an enjoyable long distance ride.

As with all Ribble’s bikes, you can alter the spec; we reckon a carbon seatpost in place of the standard alloy would be high on our list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a lively bike, helped by the specced Shimano 105 groupset, which gives smooth shifting and plenty of range for hillier rides.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, it’s an option you can swap out for something higher up the groupset food chain or with different gear ratios if you want. The Ribble still offers excellent value, even if the price has increased since we reviewed it.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a

The base model Allez is equipped with 8-speed Shimano Claris and mechanical disc brakes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The swap to disc brakes allowed Specialized to increase the tyre clearance to 35mm, which gives a lot more rubber on the road for increased grip and comfort. This leads to assured handling, although the wheels and/or tyres would merit an upgrade to bring out more of the frame’s potential.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-allez-review\">Specialized Allez Sport review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Canyon Endurace CF 7 eTap</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/Cyclist-Badge_Eds-1.png\" /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/canyon-endurace-cf-7-etap-review-1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Endurance road bike\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/canyon-endurace-cf-7-etap-review-1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/canyon-endurace-cf-7-etap-review-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/canyon-endurace-cf-7-etap-review-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/canyon-endurace-cf-7-etap-review-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/canyon-endurace-cf-7-etap-review-1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/canyon-endurace-cf-7-etap-review-1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/canyon-endurace-cf-7-etap-review-1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/canyon-endurace-cf-7-etap-review-1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/canyon-endurace-cf-7-etap-review-1-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/canyon-endurace-cf-7-etap-review-1.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Matthew Loveridge / Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>£2,899 (£2,849 as tested) | <a href=\"https://www.canyon.com/en-gb/road-bikes/endurance-bikes/endurace/cf/endurace-cf-7-axs/3708.html\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Full carbon frame offers a comfortable, lively ride</li>\n\n\n\n<li>SRAM Rival eTap groupset gives plenty of gear range</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Canyon Endurace CF frame is the third tier of the German brand’s carbon Endurace framesets, which are made to be comfortable, with a lively ride quality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It shares its geometry with the higher spec carbon models, just made with slightly lower grade carbon fibre, which adds a little weight to the frame.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canyon includes bosses for a top tube bag, although no mudguard mounts.

The bike is equipped with 32mm tyres but there’s room for 35mm measured width. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The test bike came well equipped with a 48/35t, 10-36t SRAM Force AXS 2x groupset, Zipp 303S wheels and Lauf Smoothie Road vibration-absorbing carbon handlebars, but without the price tag of many similarly specced bikes. There’s a new top spec equipped with SRAM Red AXS. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We enjoyed the wide tyres’ ability to cushion everything including gravel tracks and the wide-range gearing which made Dartmoor climbs easy work.

Key features to look for</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Upright riding position</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Key to riding any bike for a long time is a comfortable riding position and for most people that means a more upright riding position than can be found on the average race bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Endurance bikes will have a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-to-measure-stack-and-reach\">shorter reach and higher stack</a> than more race-oriented machines, so you’re less stretched out, although there are gradations in just how upright an endurance bike will place you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Stable geometry</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than being edgy like a bike tuned for the sharp end of racing, endurance bikes are designed for more predictable, stable handling. You don’t want a bike that’s a handful to pilot if you’re going long.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically, endurance bikes will have a longer <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-is-a-bikes-wheelbase\">wheelbase</a> and slacker <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-does-frame-geometry-affect-a-bike\">frame and fork angles</a> than a more race-oriented bike. They will also have longer chainstays for less snappy handling.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Increased tyre clearance</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"650\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/orbea_gain_3-970x650.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/orbea_gain_3-970x650.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/orbea_gain_3-300x201.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/orbea_gain_3-768x514.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/orbea_gain_3-1536x1029.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/orbea_gain_3-2048x1371.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/orbea_gain_3-750x502.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/orbea_gain_3-1140x763.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Longer chainstays also increase tyre clearance. Tyres (<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/road-gravel-bike-rim-width\">and rims</a>) are still <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/can-wider-tyres-and-lower-pressures-make-you-faster\">getting wider</a>, but increased tyre clearance has been common on endurance bikes for years as an easy way to increase comfort and grip by increasing the volume of air under the rider, allowing lower tyre pressures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>28mm tyres are the minimum, but expect clearance to fit tyres up to 40mm on some models.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Lower gearing</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>To take steep climbs with ease and reduce fatigue on long, hilly rides, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-cyclist-guide-to-the-right-gear-ratios-for-climbing\">low gearing</a> will let you spin up rather than engage in <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/should-you-sit-or-stand-when-climbing\">out-of-saddle</a> grinding. It’s typical for endurance bikes to be fitted with a 50/34-tooth compact crankset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-to-road-bike-groupsets\">road groupsets</a> will let you pair that with a cassette providing range up to 11-36, so you get some really low ratios. With the latest groupsets shifting to 12-speed cassettes, the wide range is often achieved with smallish differences between gear ratios mid-cassette, where the bulk of your riding is likely to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SRAM’s 12-speed<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/sram-groupsets-buyers-guide\"> AXS groupsets</a> give you even wider gear ratios, with the option of a 10-36t cassette paired with either a 46/33 or 48/35 crankset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That gives a similar top ratio to a conventional groupset that has an 11-tooth smallest sprocket, but a very low bottom gear.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Disc brakes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-cyclist-guide-to-road-bike-disc-brakes\">Disc brakes</a> are the norm for bike manufacturers these days, with hydraulic braking rather than cable-operated on mid-range models and up. They bring improved braking in all weathers while coming with only a minor weight penalty. They are also pivotal in allowing those bigger tyre clearances.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>6. Fancy seatposts</h3>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"771\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/big_ride_ethiopia_36_canyon_endurace-771x970.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/big_ride_ethiopia_36_canyon_endurace-771x970.jpg 771w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/big_ride_ethiopia_36_canyon_endurace-238x300.jpg 238w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/big_ride_ethiopia_36_canyon_endurace-768x966.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/big_ride_ethiopia_36_canyon_endurace-750x944.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/big_ride_ethiopia_36_canyon_endurace-1140x1435.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/big_ride_ethiopia_36_canyon_endurace.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>A slim and flexible 27.2mm seatpost is typical for road bikes and carbon fibre is the most common material even on lower priced endurance bikes, for its increased vibration damping.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond that, endurance bikes will often have seatposts with extra features to make your saddle time more enjoyable, like the Canyon/Ergon VCLS split shaft seatpost and BMC and Giant’s D-shaped posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>7. Vibration damping</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There have been many solutions to vibration damping over the years – some more gimmicky than others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally they involve adding an additional material to the frame to dissipate vibration, like Bianchi’s <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/bianchi-specialissima-unveiled\">Countervail</a>, designing the rear triangle with flex zones or extra compliance, as in the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cannondale-synapse-2022\">Cannondale Synapse</a> or built-in flex features as in the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/trek-domane-slr-review\">Trek Domane</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/wilier-granturismo-slr-2023\">Wilier Granturismo SLR</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Front end comfort may be catered for by features to add extra vertical travel like the Future Shock 2.0 found in the latest generation of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-roubaix-sl8-review\">Specialized Roubaix</a> or the pivoting stem found in the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/bmc-roadmachine-01-amp-x\">BMC Roadmachine X AMP</a> (okay, that one’s an electric bike).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other cases, vibration damping comes from the design and layup of carbon handlebars and fork blades.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>8. Mudguard mounts</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-best-bicycle-mudguards\">Mudguard</a> fixing points used to be a rarity on any bike, but they’re pretty much standard on modern endurance bikes. If you’re going to be out on long rides in all weathers you want to be kept a bit drier; wheel spray wetting your seat pad is never comfortable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’d say proper mudguard mounts are essential if you plan on riding through winter.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>9.

Cannondale’s SmartSense system uses a central battery to power front and rear lights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many road bike designs, even performance race models, now allow you to add an integral rear light to your seatpost.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>10. Electric assistance</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many brands now offer e-bike versions of their endurance bikes. It’s a useful option if you want to go long and value the extra assistance of a motor to help with climbs or if you get fatigued.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Often you’ll be riding at over the 25kmh at which assistance cuts out (in Europe), so the motor is only there for when things get harder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best electric road bikes are not much heavier than a normal endurance bike. The extra mass may not affect handling or ride feel on the flat, but the motor provides a get-out on the hills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It may increase the distance that you feel confident riding or allow you to take on more difficult terrain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more about electric bikes, visit our sister site <a href=\"https://www.cyclingelectric.com/\" target=\"_blank\">cyclingelectric.com</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Endurance road bike vs. gravel bike – what’s the difference?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/bmc-kaius-review-1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/bmc-kaius-review-1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/bmc-kaius-review-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/bmc-kaius-review-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/bmc-kaius-review-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/bmc-kaius-review-1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/bmc-kaius-review-1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/bmc-kaius-review-1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/bmc-kaius-review-1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/bmc-kaius-review-1-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/bmc-kaius-review-1.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Increasingly little. Although they started off as different bike categories, there are now plenty of bikes that blur the boundary. Some bike brands will offer gravel and endurance specs of the same bike, like the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/wilier-rave-slr-gravel-bike\">Wilier Rave SLR</a>, just altering tyre tread patterns and gearing between the two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An endurance bike with wide tyre clearance and low gear ratios can easily be set up with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-the-best-gravel-bike-tyres\">gravel tyres</a> for more grip, allowing you to head off tarmac and explore the less gnarly tracks and trails you find.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conversely, some gravel-light bikes like the aforementioned Wilier Rave SLR or the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/bmc-kaius-review\">BMC Kaius</a> are equally at home on the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s yet another category of bike (don’t bike makers love to define yet another genre?), the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-all-road-bikes\">all-road bike</a>, that looks to straddle the endurance/gravel gulf and which overlaps with both, being designed for light gravel alongside road riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span><i>Not sure if an endurance road bike is for you?
