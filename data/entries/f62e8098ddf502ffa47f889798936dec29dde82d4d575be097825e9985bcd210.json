These workloads are generally very sensitive to I/O latency, and require plenty of random read/write IOPS along with high CPU performance.</p> \n<p>Here are the specs:</p> \n<table> \n <tbody> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>Instance Name</strong></td> \n   <td><strong>vCPUs<br /> </strong></td> \n   <td><strong>Memory<br /> </strong></td> \n   <td><strong>Storage<br /> </strong></td> \n   <td><strong>Network Bandwidth<br /> </strong></td> \n   <td><strong>EBS Bandwidth<br /> </strong></td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>i4g.large</strong></td> \n   <td>2</td> \n   <td>16 GiB</td> \n   <td>468 GB</td> \n   <td>up to 10 Gbps</td> \n   <td>up to 40 Gbps</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>i4g.xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>4</td> \n   <td>32GiB</td> \n   <td>937 GB</td> \n   <td>up to 10 Gbps</td> \n   <td>up to 40 Gbps</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>i4g.2xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>8</td> \n   <td>64 GiB</td> \n   <td>1.875 TB</td> \n   <td>up to 12 Gbps</td> \n   <td>up to 40 Gbps</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>i4g.4xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>16</td> \n   <td>128 GiB</td> \n   <td>3.750 TB</td> \n   <td>up to 25 Gbps</td> \n   <td>up to 40 Gbps</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>i4g.8xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>32</td> \n   <td>256 GiB</td> \n   <td>7.500 TB<br /> (2 x 3.750 TB)</td> \n   <td>18.750 Gbps</td> \n   <td>40 Gbps</td> \n  </tr> \n  <tr> \n   <td><strong>i4g.16xlarge</strong></td> \n   <td>64</td> \n   <td>512 GiB</td> \n   <td>15.000 TB<br /> (4 x 3.750 TB)</td> \n   <td>37.500 Gbps</td> \n   <td>80 Gbps</td> \n  </tr> \n </tbody> \n</table> \n<p>The I4g instances make use of AWS Nitro SSDs (read <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-nitro-ssd-high-performance-storage-for-your-i-o-intensive-applications/\">AWS Nitro SSD – High Performance Storage for your I/O-Intensive Applications</a> to learn more) for NVMe storage.
