Or when you were 15 and athletes and musicians still played hard and hadn’t sold out.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have more nostalgia for the 1990s, when I was in my 20s, than I do the 1980s, but I can see why these answers tend toward the decade of one’s teenage years.</p>\n\n<p>(<a href=\"https://kottke.org/24/05/0044699-poll-results-show-that-am\">Via Kottke</a>.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/05/29/americas-best-decade\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"3927660347d5c44ec9f6703cb9a12fd0c3dcb2804a2ac7e0799a401f35acadf3","category":"Tech"}
