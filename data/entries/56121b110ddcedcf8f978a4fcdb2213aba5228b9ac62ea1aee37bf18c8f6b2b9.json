In men’s road cycling, the opening five seasons of the 2020s have been filled with fresh faces, stratospheric achievements and new records. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2020s have seen <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tadej-pogacar\" target=\"_blank\">Tadej Pogačar</a> grow into one of the greatest cyclists of all time. With his debut Tour de France victory in 2020, it feels like a page was turned. Likewise, the unique talent of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/remco-evenepoel\" target=\"_blank\">Remco Evenepoel</a> has shot into the limelight, winning Monuments, rainbow jerseys and Olympic golds. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/wout-van-aert\" target=\"_blank\">Wout van Aert</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/mathieu-van-der-poel\" target=\"_blank\">Mathieu van der Poel </a>have also waltzed onto the road scene this decade after spending their formative years doing cyclocross. These riders, however, are just a handful of those who have shaped the sport over the past five seasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/50-best-women-cyclists-2020s\" target=\"_blank\">As we did for the women’s peloton last week</a>, here we will be ranking our top 50 men’s riders of the decade so far. This will be weighed up using road results alone. We’ll back this up by analysing Grand Tour performances, WorldTour feats and UCI points accumulated over the past five seasons, stretching back to the strange 2020 season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that, kick back and prepare yourself for our top 50 riders of the 2020s so far. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>50. Kasper Asgreen</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/04/06175514/tour-of-flanders-auld-15-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"tour-of-flanders-auld-15\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The first rider on our list is Monument winner Kasper Asgreen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Dane has been a consistent presence at the front of the peloton, in breakaways and on the steep cobbled climbs of Belgium throughout the past few seasons. After a strong 2020 campaign, he improved on his form to chart his best season to date in 2021. After a relentless win at the E3 Prijs, Asgreen followed this up with a surprising win at the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/gallery-kasper-asgreen-rips-up-the-script-at-the-tour-of-flanders\" target=\"_blank\">2021 Tour of Flanders</a>. On that day, the Quickstep rider toppled both Van der Poel and Van Aert at the race they have tamed to such great avail in recent years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After playing his role in the leadout for Fabio Jakobsen and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/mark-cavendish\">Mark Cavendish</a> over the years, Asgreen claimed his own Tour stage victory at the 2023 <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tour-de-france\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de France</a>. This is still his only Grand Tour stage win to date.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some patchy form has prevented him from sustaining his record in the Classics. However, he has just signed a new contract with EF Education-EasyPost for 2025. Let’s hope he gets back to winning ways at <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-pro-jerseys-of-the-2020s-so-far\" target=\"_blank\">the pink team</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/50-best-women-cyclists-2020s\">The top 50 women’s road cyclists of the 2020s so far</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-pro-jerseys-of-the-2020s-so-far\">The 21 best pro cycling jerseys of the 2020s so far</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-21-best-mens-one-day-races-of-the-2020s-so-far\">The 21 best men’s one-day races of the 2020s so far</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-21-best-womens-grand-tour-stages-of-the-2020s-so-far\">The 21 best women’s Grand Tour stages of the 2020s so far</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-mens-grand-tour-stages-of-the-2020s-so-far\">The 21 best men’s Grand Tour stages of the 2020s so far</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>49.

However, there’s a lot to praise to be sung when looking at the American’s palmarès.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, McNulty has two Grand Tour stages to his name, one from the breakaway at the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/giro-ditalia\" target=\"_blank\">Giro d’Italia</a> and one prologue victory at the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/vuelta-a-espana\" target=\"_blank\">Vuelta a España</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Arizonan has taken a couple of big WorldTour stage wins, particularly over the past three seasons. McNulty has also worn the leader’s jersey at a plethora of top-level races such as Paris-Nice, the UAE Tour and the Vuelta. McNulty has GC capabilities as well, with an overall title at Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana on his palmarès. Don’t forget his role as domestique for Pogačar, particularly in the earlier part of the decade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is that enough to justify his place in this ranking? If you’re still not convinced, McNulty has been in the top 50 of the UCI rankings over the past three seasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>48.

Able to climb well, sprint with some of the fastest and master a breakaway day, Cort has been a prolific winner so far in the 2020s, even despite lacking a  top-level GC, time-trial or sprinting skillset. In essence, he’s been one of the most effective racers in the bunch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anchoring this claim, Cort has won stages at all three Grand Tours during the 2020s. In fact, he’s won six stages in total, all on different terrain and from different situations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of these Grand Tour successes, Cort has scooped up some other stages at the Critérium du Dauphiné and Paris-Nice, for example. The thorn in his side is still one-day racing, but otherwise he refuses to be categorised quite as plainly as other riders on this list.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>47.

The German has completed a trilogy of Grand Tour stages during the 2020s, all from the breakaway. He’s carried this expertise over to other stage races, with wins at the Volta Catalunya, Critérium du Dauphiné and the Vuelta a Andalucia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The German has been toying with the idea of going for GC. He’s seen some success in this realm, with a top ten overall at the 2023 Giro and a couple of solid stage race results. Otherwise, Kämna has also served as a teammate for his Bora-Hansgrohe leaders.

The Norman has certainly left his mark on the Grand Tours during his time on the UCI WorldTour level. His now-characteristic game of GC snakes and ladders has become a formality. It’s led him to become a perennial feature of Grand Tour top 15s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, that might sound like I’m clutching at straws, but Martin has finished inside of the top ten of the Tour twice and the Vuelta once. You might not be convinced still, but remember that he won the polka-dot jersey at the November Vuelta in 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have I mentioned that he has a new book out?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>45.

Although he’s often visible towards the front of races, he doesn’t slot into a specific rider type. If I have to categorise him, I’d say he’s a breakaway climber. That said, he doesn’t swerve away from a GC bid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his role as a breakaway escape artist, Ciccone won a stage of the 2022 Giro d’Italia up in the Valle d’Aosta. After a week of attacking in the Alps, the Italian added a Tour de France polka-dot jersey to his collection in 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ciconne is a vibrant rider who doesn’t shy away from attacking the head of the race. This spirit has yielded some WorldTour stage wins at the Volta Catalunya and Critérium du Dauphiné. This year he poached a podium at Il Lombardia, adding a prestigious one-day result to his palmarès.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>44.

For this, we need to park Pidcock’s Olympic success and cyclocross rainbow jersey to one side. With that out of the way, let’s dive in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pidcock is a unique rider. He’s skilled on multiple terrains and different races, varying between hills, cobbles and mountains. Of course, his victory atop <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/alpe-d-huez-sarenne-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">Alpe d’Huez</a> at the 2022 Tour was a real coming of age on the road. Elsewhere, his record in one-day races features some heavyweight race trophies – notably in the form of Brabantse Pijl, Strade Bianche and Amstel Gold Race. These were all done in impressive manner, especially his Strade Bianche win in 2023 which saw the Yorkshireman break free over a downhill gravel sector. To add extra prestige to this list, Pidcock has climbed onto the podium of Liège-Bastogne-Liège.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the British rider’s real inconsistency and lack of GC results – despite his bullish promise – hold him back from climbing further up this list.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>42.

He’s the kind of rider who can take to anything.

Emulating the style of Marcel Kittel, he continued his strong form as the race progressed, using his powerhouse style to capture the <em>maglia cicclamino </em>in Rome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After signing for Lidl-Trek at the beginning of the season, Milan has truly emerged as one of the most talented sprinters in the world.  This year, he stepped up his level with stage wins at Tirreno-Adriatico, the Renewi Tour and the Giro d’Italia. His <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/lidl-trek\" target=\"_blank\">Lidl-Trek</a> leadout, mostly anchored by Simone Consonni, has proved to be a winning formula this year, particularly at the Giro where he took three stages and the <em>maglia cicclamino</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully, we’ll see Milan at the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de France next year</a>.

This is, of course, the biggest of his stage wins, but he has also rounded up stage wins at Itzulia Basque Country, the Tour Down Under and the Tour of the Alps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of GC, Bilbao has finished inside the top ten of a Grand Tour on four occasions since 2020. The best of these performances was a pair of fifth places at the Giro d’Italia in 2020 and 2022. His results in one-week stage races are equally impressive and consistent, with podium finishes at the Tour de Pologne, Tour Down Under and the UAE Tour.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>37.

During those two pandemic-ridden seasons, Vlasov would climb onto the podium at Il Lombardia and finish fourth overall at the Giro d’Italia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next year, Vlasov signed to Bora-Hangrohe and led one faction of the team’s GC ambitions. He’d claim a win at the Tour de Romandie, a stage of the Tour de Suisse – which he was forced to retire from whilst wearing the leader’s jersey – before a top five finish at the 2022 Tour de France.

Essentially, if there’s a lower-level Italian one-day race, Hirschi has been somewhere near the top ten.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2024, we saw glimpses of the old Hirschi, particularly during the second half of the season. To pair with his bucket loads of second and third-tier races, Hierschi claimed the Klassikoa and Bretagne Classic during the summer. This has all factored into Hirschi’s remarkable top ten finish in the UCI rankings. That’s not bad for a man who failed to make a Grand Tour startlist this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>29.

The following year, Ayuso would burst onto the cycling scene with a series of impressive results at the under-23 level, notably at the Baby Giro. Some even touted him as<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-next-pogacar\" target=\"_blank\"> ‘the next Pogačar’</a> given their resemblance on the bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ayuso was picked up by UAE Team Emirates by the end of that year and he was soon funnelled into a team leader role at the stacked WorldTour squad. That same year, Ayuso made a splash at his debut Grand Tour with a podium finish overall at the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/vuelta-a-espana\" target=\"_blank\">Vuelta a España</a>. This began the Ayuso hype train, that’s for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then, the Spaniard’s palmarès has been padded out with stage wins at the Tour de Suisse, Tirreno-Adriatico and Tour de Romandie, as well as an overall win at Itzulia Basque Country. He’s continued to perform well at Grand Tours. This year, he rode in support of Pogačar at the Tour de France, but was forced to abandon due to a Covid positive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s be honest, Ayuso’s going to be hanging around near the front end of pro cycling for a while. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>28.

On the one hand, he’s won the Giro d’Italia this decade, but on the other, he hasn’t won a WorldTour race of any kind since 2022. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To sing his praises first, Bernal began the decade as one of the top GC riders in the peloton. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/egan-bernal-faces-months-on-sidelines-with-spine-issue\" target=\"_blank\">After a 2020 punctuated by ebbs and flows </a>in form and injury, Bernal bounced back in 2021 to finish on the podium of Strade Binache before sailing to Giro d’Italia glory, with two stage wins along the way. The Colombian contested the Vuelta later that year, finishing in sixth place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, a crash the following winter would write off his 2022 season and taint his 2023 recovery year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bernal has bounced back to some extent. He’s not on Grand Tour-winning level yet, however, he finished inside the top ten overall at every one-week stage race he took part in this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>24.

With his daredevil descent of the Poggio at the 2022 edition of<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/milan-san-remo\" target=\"_blank\"> Milan-San Remo</a>, he took his biggest win to date. Elsewhere in the Classics, Mohorič has finished inside the top ten of major cobbled and Ardennes Classics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mohorič has also become a core figure in Tour de France breakaways. In 2021, he sailed away to two solo victories whilst in 2023 the Slovenian took another stage win, this time in a photo finish. The Slovenian has claimed stages at the Tour de Pologne and Renewi Tour. He won the GC at the former in 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>22.

In reality, he hasn’t quite taken the throne left behind by Chris Froome and Geraint Thomas. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/simon-yates-profile\" target=\"_blank\">He still remains a reliable package </a>when it comes to stage racing, I can’t deny that. However, Yates may have been looking for more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yates continued to target the Giro through the 2020s, at least until 2022. The British rider managed to claim three stages along the way, most surprisingly in a time-trial on Stage 2 of the 2022 <em>Corsa Rosa</em>. A podium finish in the GC at the Giro in 2021 would prove to be Yates’ GC highlight of the 2020s so far. However, the now-former <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/jayco-alula\">Jayco-AlUla</a> rider crept up the standings at the 2023 Tour de France to finish in fourth place overall. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along the way, Yates has picked up stages at the Tour Down Under, Paris-Nice and Tirreno-Adriatico, the latter which he won overall in 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Bury-born rider will move across to Visma-Lease a Bike in the winter.

A top five finish at the Giro – and a starring role as Egan Bernal’s motivational speaker – demonstrated his broad skillset. At Ineos, he was often third in line, but he still managed to claim wins at Itzulia Basque Country and the Volta ao Algarve before moving across to Bora-Hansgrohe last winter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the German team, Martínez finished second overall at the 2024 Giro d’Italia, his highest finish at a Grand Tour. This result points towards further Grand Tour results, but his unwavering support of Roglič at the Vuelta this year proved that he still has that lieutenant mindset in him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He’s unpredictable, fiery, and has a classic riding style.

The Lidl-Trek rider has also collected stage victories at Paris-Nice, the Critérium du Dauphiné and the Renewi Tour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It took him some time to warm up to the Tour de France, but Pedersen has now won two stages at the French race. Likewise, Pedersen completed a swift Grand Tour trilogy by winning stages of the following Vuelta and Giro. At the Vuelta in particular, Pedersen shone brightly, winning the points classification.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a hardy finale, Pedersen is usually a good pick. Throw in some bad weather or an attritional day and he’s a strong card to play. At another time, Pedersen would be considered one of the greats – at least in my opinion. He’s greatly overshadowed by the likes of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/mathieu-van-der-poel\" target=\"_blank\">Van der Poel</a> and Van Aert.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>11.

Well, he’s among just the eight Grand Tour winners this decade, but he’s managed to finish inside the top ten at four Grand Tours and win three stages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cyclist-magazine-podcast-episode-15-jai-hindleys-giro-ditalia\" target=\"_blank\">Hindley followed a crucial move up the slopes of the Stelvio</a>, paving the way to stage glory on that day and a stint in the pink jersey. He would ultimately miss out on the Giro title that year, instead finishing as runner-up. This was already a big surprise. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The season after was far from ideal, with little glimpses of this previous form. However, after signing for Bora-Hangrohe, Hindley found his legs again. After taking a stage up to Blockhaus at the 2022 Giro d’Italia, the Australian would go on to play a pragmatic game before launching <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/gallery-giro-ditalia-2022-stage-20\" target=\"_blank\">a convincing move on the penultimate day of racing</a>, sealing the <em>Trofeo Senza Fine</em>. Hindley’s triumph at the 2022 Giro d’Italia proved that he was more than just a Covid anomaly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hindley tasted success at the following year’s Tour de France, winning Stage 5 to Laruns in dominant fashion and landing himself in the overall lead. The Bora leader’s time in the <em>maillot jaune</em> was short – just one day – but he went on to finish inside the top ten despite crashing heavily during the second week.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>10.

Proved to be one of the most influential riders of the decade. Kuss played a key role in Jumbo-Visma’s Tour de France domination, Roglic’s 2023 Giro win as well as in Roglic’s stage race sweeps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Colorado-born climber has delivered some killer pulls for Roglič and VIngegaard. He’s been able to isolate favourites, drop rivals and even contest for the podium at points. By doing this job, Kuss has altered much of the results books at Grand Tours, usually in favour of his Visma teammates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, Kuss has claimed stage wins at the Tour and Vuelta this decade, plus he’s bagged a couple of GC top ten finishes alongside that aforementioned Vuelta win.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>9.

He’s appeared on the Grand Tour podium on three occasions since 2020 – twice in second and once in third. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since 2020, Carapaz added four Grand Tour stage wins to his collection and two mountains classifications. Outside of the three-weekers, Carapaz earned an overall victory at the Tour de Suisse as well as a couple of WorldTour stage wins in one-week stage races.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be honest, Carapaz might be the only rider able to compete with the climbers further up this list. He proved this at the Tour de France in 2021 and in almost beating Roglič at the 2020 Vuelta, he could have come closer to entering that elite circle of riders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also can’t forget about Carapaz’s <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/olympics\" target=\"_blank\">Olympic</a> gold medal from the Tokyo Games held in 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>8.

However, you can’t deny his impact on road cycling this decade so far.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To truly appreciate Alaphilippe, we need to look back on his 2020 and 2021 seasons. Not only did he win <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/julian-alaphilippe-the-most-worthy-of-world-champions\" target=\"_blank\">both years’ World Championships</a> Road Race title, but he was a Tour de France stage winner and yellow jersey wearer. Alaphilippe was also still at the top of his Classics game. He won Flèche Wallonne in 2021 and finished runner-up at Liège-Bastogne-Liège and Strade Bianche that same year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To further his case, Alaphilippe acted as an influential rider in the cobbled Classics, either for himself or teammates.

After swapping from UAE Team Emirates to Alpecin-Deceuninck at the end of that 2020 season, the Belgian stepped up his sprinting results. He’s left all bar one Grand Tour he’s competed in this decade with at least one stage victory. He’s rounded up 12 stages in total, plus a green jersey at the<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tour-de-france\" target=\"_blank\"> Tour de France</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He’s the only pure sprinter on this list to have won a Monument, having done so at this year’s Milan-San Remo. Along with this Classics title, Philipsen has a bundle of notable one-day races under his belt in the form of Scheldeprijs, Eschborn-Frankfurt and Classic Brugge-De Panne.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Philipsen has commanded Alpecin-Deceuninck into the team to beat in the sprints. He has also become the most decorated sprinter of the 2020s if you’re judging that by win count alone. In total, he has won 49 races during the 2020s, five more than his closest opponent Tim Merlier.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>6. Wout van Aert</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/07/03032955/goding11-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"goding11\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re certainly shifting up a gear with our next pick, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/wout-van-aert\" target=\"_blank\">Wout van Aert</a>. One of the most versatile riders in the pack, Van Aert’s list of strengths is exhaustive. He’s among the best sprinters, time-trialists, domestiques, <em>puncheurs </em>and cobble riders in the bunch. It’s remarkable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/wout-van-aert-2022-tour-de-france\" target=\"_blank\">Van Aert’s Grand Tour record is impressive</a>, particularly at the Tour de France. Since 2020, the Belgian has won a total of eight stages at the Tour and three at the Vuelta. The profiles in question have varied from flat time-trials to sprint and <em>puncheur </em>stages up to the extreme of<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-mens-grand-tour-stages-of-the-2020s-so-far\" target=\"_blank\"> a double ascent of Mont Ventoux</a>. The Red Bull-sponsored athlete has also spent a couple of days in both the yellow and red jerseys and won a well-deserved points classification at the 2022 Tour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Van Aert is somewhat overshadowed by the other galacticos to follow on this list. This is definitely the case when it comes to Monuments and one-day races. Van Aert is known for his podium finishes, but he rarely tops the podium in these big races. He has one Monument win during the 2020s back at the 2020 Milan-San Remo as well as other notable feats at Gent-Wevelgem, Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, Strade Bianche and the Amstel Gold Race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite never topping an international championship podium, Van Aert has won silver medals at the Olympics, World and European Championships over the past few seasons. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5.

He’s remained at the top of his game since 2020, however, his rivals have changed and the Slovenian’s circumstances have certainly evolved over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/primoz-roglic-legacy\" target=\"_blank\">has found fertile ground at the Vuelta a España in particular</a>. His three overall wins there since the turn of the decade, and accompanying 14 stage wins at the Spanish three-weeker should garner plenty of respect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His 2023 Giro d’Italia victory clarified that he could win a Grand Tour outside of Spain, while his relationship with the Tour de France has become increasingly turbulent. As for the <em>Grand Boucle</em>, the Slovenian has failed to reach the finish line of the 21-stage-long race after his bitter second place at the 2020 Tour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To keep up the praise, Roglič topped the UCI rankings in 2020, secured a Monument title that same year at Liège-Bastogne-Liège and has won six WorldTour stage races. This is more than any other rider on this list. They aren’t Mickey Mouse races either, Roglič has picked up Tirreno-Adriatico, Critérium du Dauphiné and Paris-Nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4.

Everyone was talking about him. Rightly so, when the season restarted in 2020, he looked untouchable. A crash in August 2020 at Il Lombardia would ruin the Belgian’s chances for the rest of that season and much of the following season too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once fully recovered in 2022, Evenepoel would begin to show is what the hype was all about. Since making his comeback, he has won Liège-Bastogne-Liège twice, added two Olympic golds and three world titles to his palmarès, as well as a Tour de France white jersey and a Vuelta trophy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Evenepoel’s exploits this summer at the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/mens-olympic-road-race-paris-2024-gallery\" target=\"_blank\">Paris 2024 Olympics </a>certainly help his case on this list. By winning Olympic gold, he’s won the Olympic, World and national titles in both road race and time-trial since 2020. No male rider has ever done this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking beyond one-day races and time-trials, Evenepoel is still a Grand Tour champion. Yes, he’s only won a single Grand Tour, the 2022 Vuelta a España, and has managed to podium only one other three-weeker. That said, Evenepoel has left a lasting impact on Grand Tours having won eight stages since 2022. That’s far from the only impact Evenepoel has left on the sport, however. He’s grown into one of the most lucrative and recognisable faces in the sport.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3.

He’s won six Monuments since 2020, three at the Tour of Flanders, two at Paris-Roubaix and a single victory at Milan-San Remo. He’s finished on the podium of a further five Monuments and has won other headline one-day races like the E3 Prijs, Strade Bianche, Dwars door Vlaanderen. Van der Poel’s mitre was on show at the 2023 UCI Road World Championships –<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-21-best-mens-one-day-races-of-the-2020s-so-far\" target=\"_blank\"> a race we recently ranked as the best men’s Classic of the decade</a> – finally proving that he’s unequivocally the best Classics rider in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Van der Poel has also added two Grand Tour stages to his record. After both, he spent a couple of days in the yellow and pink jerseys of the Tour and Giro respectively. However, it must be pointed out that Van der Poel’s Grand Tour record is not as impressive as the other riders in this top six.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That aside, Van der Poel is a phenomenon. His ancestral ties to cycling and his classy way of riding is captivating, I’ll say that. His list of achievements is eye-watering and he’s likely to go down amongst the best Classics riders of all-time once the decade comes to an end.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2.

Beginning the decade as an unknown name at <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/visma-lease-a-bike\" target=\"_blank\">Jumbo-Visma</a>, the Dane quickly rocketed through the ranks to become a double Tour de France champion and one of the sport’s most electric GC talents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2022 and 2023, Vingegaard was undoubtedly the best rider at the Tour. This was highlighted in particular through his scintillating moves on the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-mens-grand-tour-stages-of-the-2020s-so-far\" target=\"_blank\">Col du Granon and Hautacam in the 2022 Tour de France</a> and his imperial performance against the clock in Combloux at the 2023 Tour de France. Helped by these moves, Vingegaard built the decade’s biggest Tour-winning margin at the 2023 race, defeating Pogačar by over seven minutes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outside of the Tour de France, Vingegaard has left a mark on the WorldTour scene. The Visma-Lease a Bike leader has won the Critérium du Dauphiné, Itzulia Basque Country and has finished runner-up at the Vuelta, albeit behind his teammate and Tour domestique Kuss.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1.

To name just a few, he’s won Paris-Nice, Tirreno-Adriatico, Strade Bianche, Amstel Gold Race and 23 total Grand Tour stage wins. No one on this list has a palmarès anywhere near as versatile and impressive as this. In terms of Grand Tours, stage races, Monuments and international championships, Pogacar has the best record by far.

With two Monuments, two Grand Tours and a rainbow jersey packed into the same season, Pogačar has achieved a great deal so far in the 2020s.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/50-best-women-cyclists-2020s\">The top 50 women’s road cyclists of the 2020s so far</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-pro-jerseys-of-the-2020s-so-far\">The 21 best pro cycling jerseys of the 2020s so far</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-21-best-mens-one-day-races-of-the-2020s-so-far\">The 21 best men’s one-day races of the 2020s so far</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-21-best-womens-grand-tour-stages-of-the-2020s-so-far\">The 21 best women’s Grand Tour stages of the 2020s so far</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-mens-grand-tour-stages-of-the-2020s-so-far\">The 21 best men’s Grand Tour stages of the 2020s so far</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-50-best-mens-road-cyclists-of-the-2020s-so-far\">The 50 best men’s road cyclists of the 2020s so far</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Ewan Wilson &#124; Staff Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"56121b110ddcedcf8f978a4fcdb2213aba5228b9ac62ea1aee37bf18c8f6b2b9","category":"Cycling"}
