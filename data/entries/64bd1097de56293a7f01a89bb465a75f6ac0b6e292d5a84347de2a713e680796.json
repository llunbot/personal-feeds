At WWDC last year, Apple announced that No Man's Sky would be available for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> and Mac would by the end of 2022. Hello Games missed that deadline and the game has yet to release for Apple devices, meaning that the two emoji teasers could indicate that the launch of No Man's Sky for the ‚ÄåiPad‚Äå and Mac is now imminent.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGiven widespread anticipation about Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/03/gurman-apple-still-plans-headset-reveal-at-wwdc/\">expected announcement</a> of a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ar-vr/\">mixed-reality headset</a> at WWDC in less than a week, there is now speculation that Hello Games could be working on a game for the new device. No Man's Sky is already available on multiple VR platforms, including on PC and PlayStation VR. When the game was demoed at WWDC last year, it was played on a Mac with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> chip. Since Apple's headset is rumored to feature at least one chip that is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/15/kuo-apple-well-prepared-headset-unveiling/\">based on the M2 chip</a> in addition to a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/03/report-reveals-wave-of-features-for-apple-headset/\">dedicated image signal processor</a>, it should be more than capable of running the game.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>üçè <a href=\"https://t.co/D0DSBqCZgL\">https://t.co/D0DSBqCZgL</a></p>‚Äî Sean Murray (@NoMansSky) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NoMansSky/status/1663231070664376323?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 29, 2023</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHello Games has also worked with Apple to publish <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/27/the-last-campfire-comes-to-apple-arcade/\">games on Apple Arcade</a>. Given Apple's discussions with Hello Games in recent years, No Man's Sky being among the initial wave of games available on Apple's mixed-reality headset is not out of the question.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile some rumors have suggested Apple's headset is not particularly focused on gaming, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> has repeatedly referred to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/05/apple-headset-focus-on-gaming-media-communication/\">gaming, media, and communication</a> as the three main priorities of the device. Apple has reportedly been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/18/apple-ar-vr-headset-app-development/\">working with a number of gaming developers</a> to help them update their existing content for mixed reality and the company is expected to provide a robust set of developer tools for creating experiences for the headset.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ar-vr/\">AR/VR Headset</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/\">WWDC 2023</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mac-gaming/\">Mac Gaming</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-glasses-ar-and-vr.209\">Apple Glasses, AR and VR</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8\">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/30/no-mans-sky-maker-teases-apple-announcement/\">'No Man's Sky' Maker Teases Apple Announcement Ahead of WWDC</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/no-mans-sky-maker-teases-apple-announcement-ahead-of-wwdc.2390851/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"64bd1097de56293a7f01a89bb465a75f6ac0b6e292d5a84347de2a713e680796","category":"Apple"}
