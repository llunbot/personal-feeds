He also suggests the move could also aid Apple's retail sales strategy for its Vision Pro headset, which will be complicated by the many different custom combinations of head bands, light seals, and prescription lens inserts. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf any aspect of the customer's required Vision Pro setup is out of stock at the store, the missing part can be shipped directly to them, thereby avoiding a potential no-sale.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to a memo sent to retail store staff, the new program is called EasyPay Online Ordering and will roll out in early August. <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/retail/\">Retail</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/24/apple-retail-stores-home-delivery-option/\">Apple Retail Stores to Offer Customers Home Delivery Option</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-retail-stores-to-offer-customers-home-delivery-option.2396714/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e2a3d5795e594cb65ccf3dbc14dd03a777118783b5766de1c54eed4133e80993","category":"Apple"}
