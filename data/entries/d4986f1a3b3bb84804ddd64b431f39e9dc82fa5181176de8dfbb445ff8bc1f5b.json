With that timeline, we can expect new software like <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/\">macOS Sequoia</a> to come out a few days ahead of the September 20 hardware launch.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has not yet officially announced the date for its September event, with Gurman instead citing sources familiar with Apple's plans. Apple is expected to send out media invites as soon as next week.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌iPhone 16‌ models will include more powerful A18 chips that work with Apple Intelligence, and the entire ‌iPhone 16‌ lineup is expected to support the new ‌iOS 18‌ update. Apple plans to make the display of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a> and Pro Max slightly bigger, and all four models will get a new Capture Button for taking photos.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nStandard ‌iPhone 16‌ models will adopt the Action Button for the first time, and there is an improved Ultra Wide 48-megapixel camera coming to the ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ lineup.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs for the Apple Watch models, we are expecting an Apple Watch Series 10, a new version of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/\">Apple Watch SE</a>, and a refreshed Apple Watch Ultra. There are design changes in the works for the standard Apple Watch, with Apple set to introduce a thinner design and larger displays.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-4/\">AirPods 4</a> are coming as well, with Apple planning to debut two models for the first time.
