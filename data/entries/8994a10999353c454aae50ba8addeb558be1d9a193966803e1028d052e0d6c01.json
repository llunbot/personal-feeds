Otherwise, the machines are identical, with the same excellent ProMotion displays and ports as the M3 model (three Thunderbolt ports, an SD card reader, and HDMI 2.1). You can’t get it in space black, of course, but we like the classic space gray anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you want <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1480214/16-inch-macbook-pro-m2-pro-review.html\">an excellent laptop</a> without breaking the bank, check out this deal instead and save a bundle. </p>\n\nMacBook</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"8994a10999353c454aae50ba8addeb558be1d9a193966803e1028d052e0d6c01","category":"Apple"}
