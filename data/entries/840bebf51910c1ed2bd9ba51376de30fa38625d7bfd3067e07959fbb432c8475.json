All features may not be available for all countries or regions.</blockquote>\r<br />\nApple has approval for the ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2 to function as an over-the-counter hearing aid in the United States. The hearing aid capabilities will boost conversations and other environmental sounds for those who have hearing loss issues.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe update also includes a Hearing Protection feature that will continuously monitor the wearer's environment to reduce the impact of loud sounds. This functionality will be limited to the U.S. and Canada at launch.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHearing Health will be introduced in iOS 18.1, which is set to be released next Monday.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple doesn't have a way to manually upgrade AirPods software, but firmware is generally installed over-the-air when the AirPods are in a charging case and connected to an iOS device or Mac.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro\">AirPods Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/24/apple-releases-airpods-pro-2-firmware-7b19/\">Apple Releases New AirPods Pro 2 Firmware Ahead of Hearing Aid Feature Launch</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-new-airpods-pro-2-firmware-ahead-of-hearing-aid-feature-launch.2440886/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"840bebf51910c1ed2bd9ba51376de30fa38625d7bfd3067e07959fbb432c8475","category":"Apple"}
