The recent graduates have reportedly been told they must do repeated unpaid training in order to remain eligible to work at Infosys.</p>\n<p>Last week, the Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate (<a href=\"https://nites.co.in/about-us/\">NITES</a>), an Indian advocacy group for IT workers, sent a letter [<a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Infosys.pdf\">PDF</a>], shared by <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2024/08/27/infosys_freshers_wait/\">The Register</a>, to Mansukh Mandaviya, India’s minister of Labor and Employment. It requested that the Indian government intervene “to prevent exploitation of young IT graduates by Infosys.\" The letter, signed by NITES president Harpreet Singh Saluja, claimed that NITES received “multiple” complaints from recent engineering graduates “who have been subjected to unprofessional and exploitative practices” from Infosys after being hired for system engineer and digital specialist engineer roles.</p>\n<p>According to NITES, Infosys sent these people offer letters as early as April 22, 2022, after engaging in a college recruitment effort from 2022–2023, but never onboarded the graduates. NITES has previously <a href=\"https://nites.co.in/infosys-delays-onboarding-for-over-2-years-nites-demands-government-action/\">said</a> that “over 2,000 recruits” are affected.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045697#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045697&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"36406dbceedb9d004ab4d7db0c2432e50db54451882fd5080bd47868c891b886","category":"Tech"}
