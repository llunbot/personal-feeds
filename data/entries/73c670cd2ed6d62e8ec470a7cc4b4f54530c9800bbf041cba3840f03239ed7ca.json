What's different this time is that Kosmos 482 was designed to land on Venus, with a titanium heat shield built to withstand scorching temperatures, and structures engineered to survive atmospheric pressures nearly 100 times higher than Earth's.</p>\n<p>So, there's a good chance the spacecraft will survive the extreme forces it encounters during its plunge through the atmosphere. Typically, space debris breaks apart and burns up during reentry, with only a small fraction of material reaching the Earth's surface. The European Space Agency, one of several institutions that track space debris, says Kosmos 482 is \"highly likely\" to reach Earth's surface in one piece.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/a-soviet-era-spacecraft-built-to-land-on-venus-is-falling-to-earth-instead/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/05/a-soviet-era-spacecraft-built-to-land-on-venus-is-falling-to-earth-instead/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"73c670cd2ed6d62e8ec470a7cc4b4f54530c9800bbf041cba3840f03239ed7ca","category":"Tech"}
