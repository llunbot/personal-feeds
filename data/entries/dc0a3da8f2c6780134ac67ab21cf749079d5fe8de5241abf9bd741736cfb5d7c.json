The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, Mac, and Apple Watch were all targeted in the suit for using Caltech technology.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2016/08/03/apple-countersues-caltech-settles-dot-23/\">ended up countersuing</a> in an attempt to have the patents invalidated, a tactic that was unsuccessful. In 2020, a jury decided that Apple and Broadcom had indeed infringed on Caltech's patents, and Apple was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/01/29/apple-caltech-patent-infringement/\">ordered to pay $838 million</a>, while Broadcom was told to pay $270 million.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe two companies combined were ordered to pay $1.1 billion, which would have been one of the largest payouts in U.S. history for a patent dispute. Apple and Broadcom <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/02/04/apple-dispute-with-caltech-granted-new-trial/\">appealed the decision</a>, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ultimately decided that while the two companies had infringed on Caltech patents, the damages award was not justified. The prior court had used a two-tier system to award damages based on different royalty rates, which the appeals court said was \"legally unsupportable.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA new trial was ordered, which would recalculate the amount that Apple and Broadcom would need to pay to Caltech. Rather than undergoing a second trial, Apple, Broadcom, and Caltech back in August told the court that a potential settlement was in the works, and now the settlement is official.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/broadcom/\">Broadcom</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/caltech/\">Caltech</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/patent-lawsuits/\">Patent Lawsuits</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/12/apple-caltech-wi-fi-lawsuit-settlement/\">Apple Settles 7-Year Wi-Fi Chip Patent Dispute With Caltech</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-settles-7-year-wi-fi-chip-patent-dispute-with-caltech.2407352/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"dc0a3da8f2c6780134ac67ab21cf749079d5fe8de5241abf9bd741736cfb5d7c","category":"Apple"}
