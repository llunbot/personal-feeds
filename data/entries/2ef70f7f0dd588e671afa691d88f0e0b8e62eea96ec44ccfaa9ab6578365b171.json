{"title":"Foldable MacBooks: Six Things to Know About Apple's Future Plans","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/31/foldable-macbook-rumor-recap/","date":1717191900000,"content":"Rumors from multiple reliable sources suggest that Apple is working on a MacBook that has a foldable screen, and it could in fact be Apple's first foldable device, coming before a foldable <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>. We've rounded up six key features that we've heard about the device so far.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/05/Foldable-Screen-MacBook-Concept-Astropad.jpg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" /><em>Concept by <a href=\"https://astropad.com/foldable-mac-screen/\">Astropad</a></em></div>\r<br />\n<h2>Design</h2>\r<br />\nThe all-display design of the foldable MacBook would be distinct from the current MacBook, which has a display and keyboard. It would feature a single large screen that's able to be folded in half.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen unfolded, the MacBook could be used as a monitor when paired with a keyboard and a trackpad or mouse, and when folded, it could serve as a notebook machine. Presumably this kind of design would not have a separate keyboard, instead using an on-screen keyboard with digital keys and haptic feedback for a key-like feel.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Size</h2>\r<br />\nDisplay research analyst Ross Young claims the foldable MacBook will have <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/23/18-8-inch-foldable-macbook-rumor/\">an 18.8-inch display</a>, with Apple aiming to make the screen \"as crease-free as possible\" when it is unfolded. Apple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> has also suggested Apple is planning for a screen around 19 inches.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Display Technology</h2>\r<br />\nApple has been rumored to be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/04/01/foldable-oled-ipads-and-macbooks-in-development/\">working with LG Display</a> to develop a foldable OLED panel, and LG has been developing foldable ultra-thin cover glass for the last several years.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has also tested <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/05/17/kuo-apple-testing-eink-display-foldable-devices/\">electronic paper display</a> (EPD) technology that it could use in future foldable devices. EPD could potentially be used in the outer-most display in a foldable device, if Apple goes with some kind of dual display design with an outside and inside screen.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEPD is a form of e-ink technology, which is known for being much more viewable than LED or OLED screens in bright light.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAt an 18.8-inch size, the foldable notebook would likely have a 5K or higher resolution.\r<br />\n<h2>M-Series Chip</h2>\r<br />\nMass production on foldable display panels for a future MacBook could begin in the fourth quarter of 2025 for a launch in late 2025 or early 2026. That would be timed with the future M5 chip, a successor to the 2024 M4.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe don't know what to expect from the M5, but it is likely to be manufactured on a next-generation 3-nanometer node or even a 2-nanometer node. TSMC is working on 2nm chips, and they're supposed to be ready somewhere around the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/24/apple-tsmc-first-2nm-chips/\">second half of 2025</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/3nm/\">3nm</a> and 2nm reference the architecture that TSMC is using for its chips, and a decrease in node size corresponds to a decrease in transistor size, allowing more transistors to fit on a processor. This often results in faster performance and better energy efficiency. Right now, Apple's M4 chips are built on a 3-nanometer mode, much like the M3 chips.\r<br />\n<h2>Price</h2>\r<br />\nApple will need to use high-cost components for the foldable MacBook, and Kuo believes it could be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/23/20-inch-foldable-macbook-crease-free-rumor/\">almost as expensive</a> as the $3,500 Vision Pro headset when it launches. The 16-inch MacBook Pro currently starts at $2,500, so presumably the larger foldable model would be more expensive than that.\r<br />\n<h2>Release Date</h2>\r<br />\nIf rumors are accurate and Apple is planning to have LG Display begin mass production on a foldable MacBook in the fourth quarter of 2025, the device could launch in 2025 or 2026. Kuo estimates that Apple will ship more than one million units in 2026.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple analyst Ross Young believes that a foldable MacBook could come <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/31/apple-foldable-notebook-2025/\">as soon as 2025</a>, the same timeline suggested by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/23/18-8-inch-foldable-macbook-rumor/\">analyst Jeff Pu</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRumors about a foldable MacBook have been all over the place, however, and just two months prior to suggesting a Q4 2025 mass production schedule, Kuo said a foldable MacBook wouldn't come until 2027. It's best not to read too much into launch date rumors at this point, because Apple's plans could change.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/31/foldable-macbook-rumor-recap/\">Foldable MacBooks: Six Things to Know About Apple's Future Plans</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/foldable-macbooks-six-things-to-know-about-apples-future-plans.2427855/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2ef70f7f0dd588e671afa691d88f0e0b8e62eea96ec44ccfaa9ab6578365b171","category":"Apple"}
