The new beta comes a little over two weeks after Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/12/macos-sonoma-public-beta-now-available/\">released the first beta</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/macos-sonoma-feature-purple-green.jpg\" alt width=\"2585\" height=\"1454\" />\r<br />\nIn addition to the new public beta, Apple has also released a revised version of the fourth developer beta, presumably to address issues that were resulting in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/25/macos-sonoma-beta-4-issues/\">installation problems for some users</a> following last week's developer release.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPublic beta testers can download the macOS 14 Sonoma update from the Software Update section of the System Preferences app after <a href=\"https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/\">signing up on Apple's beta testing website</a> and opting into the public beta under the Beta Updates section.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌macOS Sonoma‌ introduces interactive widgets for the desktop, making widgets more useful and more prominent.
