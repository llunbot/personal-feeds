So, Kogel just launched a more affordable version of the oversized derailleur cage – the Kolossos ST. You get much of the same benefits as the top-tier premium Kolossoses, but at a 30% lower price. Not quite affordable yet, but more affordable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot less money, for just a smidge more drag.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Kogel Kolossos ST oversized derailleur pulley upgrade for less</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/A85I0125-scaled.webp\" alt=\"The exposed stainless balls at the center of the Kolossos ST bearing. \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/A85I0125-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/A85I0125-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/A85I0125-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/A85I0125-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/A85I0125-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/A85I0125-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/A85I0125-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/A85I0125-720x480.webp 720w\" /><figcaption>The stainless balls at the center of the Kolossos ST bearing only result in a friction increase of “a fraction of a watt” according to Kogel. <em>(All photos/Kogel)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Kogel’s new Kolossos ST uses the same pulley cage design and materials and the original <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?s=kolossos\" target=\"_blank\">Kolossos</a>, but substitutes that cage upgrade’s pulley wheel’s hybrid ceramic bearings with stainless steel, resulting in a 30% price decrease. The stainless steel bearings of the Kolossos ST use nearly all the same components as the top-of-the-line hybrid ceramic bearings. Only the ceramic balls are replaced by ‘super-hardened’ stainless steel balls that match the already stainless corrosion-resistant races.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Kogel-Kolossos-ST-oversized-derailleur-pulley-upgrade-for-less_in-gold-with-stainless-steel-bearings.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Kogel-Kolossos-ST-oversized-derailleur-pulley-upgrade-for-less_in-gold-with-stainless-steel-bearings.webp\" alt=\"Kogel Kolossos ST oversized derailleur pulley upgrade for less\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Kogel-Kolossos-ST-oversized-derailleur-pulley-upgrade-for-less_in-gold-with-stainless-steel-bearings.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Kogel-Kolossos-ST-oversized-derailleur-pulley-upgrade-for-less_in-gold-with-stainless-steel-bearings-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Kogel-Kolossos-ST-oversized-derailleur-pulley-upgrade-for-less_in-gold-with-stainless-steel-bearings-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Kogel-Kolossos-ST-oversized-derailleur-pulley-upgrade-for-less_in-gold-with-stainless-steel-bearings-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Kogel-Kolossos-ST-oversized-derailleur-pulley-upgrade-for-less_in-gold-with-stainless-steel-bearings-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Kogel-Kolossos-ST-oversized-derailleur-pulley-upgrade-for-less_in-gold-with-stainless-steel-bearings-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Kogel-Kolossos-ST-oversized-derailleur-pulley-upgrade-for-less_in-gold-with-stainless-steel-bearings-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The top pulley has 12 teeth and the bottom pulley has 19, so your chain takes a more gentle arch around the lower pulley, reducing friction. Another claimed practical benefit of most oversized pulley systems – and especially the Kolossos ST – is how easy the pulleys are to clean compared with stock pulley systems. Considering excessive muck on the pulley wheels can more than negate any watt savings from their bigger size, the cages’ open design and the pulley’s minimal mass are both key to ensuring optimal performance for those who are attentive to cleanliness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Kogel, that 30% reduction in price will only increase drivetrain friction by “a fraction of a watt”, making the Kolossos ST more of a more accessible value proposition, rather than a downgrade or compromise compared to its ceramic bearings counterpart. The benefits of oversized pulleys – reduced friction, improved shifting accuracy, and enhanced chain retention-  are why Kogel decided it was important to bring the Kolossos to a broader audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Practical Bling: ST Pricing, options &amp; availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1441\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/A85I0093-2-edited-1-scaled.webp\" alt=\"The black and silver colorways of the Kolossos ST with packaging.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/A85I0093-2-edited-1-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/A85I0093-2-edited-1-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/A85I0093-2-edited-1-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/A85I0093-2-edited-1-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/A85I0093-2-edited-1-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/A85I0093-2-edited-1-2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/A85I0093-2-edited-1-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /><figcaption>For a more subdued aesthetic, black and raw silver are great picks.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“Kolossos” is the Greek word describing a statue that is much larger than its original subject, and the application here is apt. The CNC-machined aluminum cage is massive. And the shiny gold anodized option will bring your bike a lot of bling, in addition to the reduction in drivetrain friction. For more classic looks, though, black and raw silver round out the color choices, too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Kogel Kolossos ST cage is offered only for road bike drivetrains only for now – compatible with all Shimano 11- &amp; 12-speed and SRAM 12sp AXS road derailleurs. The Kolossos ST retails for $325, and is available now. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is 30% cheaper than the other similar truss-shaped Kolossos cages for various road, gravel &amp; MTB drivetrains. But it’s also 35% cheaper than their newest <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/kogel-speed-kolossos-oversized-cage-upgrade-reshaped-for-more-stiffness-less-drag/\" target=\"_blank\">Speed Kolossos</a>, which is now the only other option for these same Shimano &amp; SRAM road derailleurs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.kogel.cc/\">Kogel.cc</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/kogel-kolossos-st-cuts-cost-of-oversize-pulley-performance-by-30-35-with-steel-balls/\">Kogel Kolossos ST Cuts Cost of Oversize Pulley Performance by 30-35% with Steel Balls</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Bennett Shane","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"3d0b298bbb823d31d6a3d4eeaf5a5d707b71044277fe621db8ca0ef2b1a59c91","category":"Cycling"}
