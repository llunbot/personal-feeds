These features went through a beta period that started at Apple’s WWDC, but they are now available to the general public as a firmware update. Here are the new features and updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<h2>AirPods and iOS 17: New and updated features</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Adaptive Audio</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a new listening mode that’s a cross between Transparency mode and Active Noise Cancellation. It can block noises such as leaf blowers but also allow other noises through, such as passing cars. Adaptive Audio is good in situations where you want to enjoy your listening experience without compromising safety.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Compatible with</strong>: 2nd-gen AirPods Pro</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<h3>Conversation Awareness</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For those times when someone talks to you while you’re still wearing your AirPods, Conversation Awareness comes in handy. It can detect human speech and lower the volume of what you’re listening to, but then it enhances the voices in front of you and reduces background noise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Compatible with</strong>: 2nd-gen AirPods Pro</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<h3>Personalized Volume</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ever feel like you’re constantly adjusting the audio quality? With Personalized Volume, machine learning is used to understand your environmental conditions and listening preferences over time, eventually leading to the AirPods being able to automatically adjust and fine-tune the audio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2nd-gen AirPods Pro</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<h3>Automatic Switching</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has tweaked this existing feature so that it’s faster and more reliable when you’re moving from, say, your iPhone over to your Mac.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Compatible with</strong>: All AirPods</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/airpods-pro-mute-unmute.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"The AirPods firmware update includes the ability to put and unmute the mic during a phone call by pressing the stem.\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>The AirPods firmware update includes the ability to mute and unmute the mic during a phone call by pressing the stem.</p>\n</figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mute and Unmute</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When using AirPods during a phone call, users can press the AirPods stem (or press the Digital Crown on the AirPods Max) to mute or unmute the microphone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Compatible with</strong>: 3rd-gen AirPods, 1st- and 2nd-gen AirPods Pro, AirPods Max</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<h2>AirPods and iOS 17: How to update to iOS 17</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The new features and upgrades are added to the AirPods via a firmware update, for free.
