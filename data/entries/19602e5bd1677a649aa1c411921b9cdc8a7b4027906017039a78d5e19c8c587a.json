The front tire then focuses primarily on reduced aero drag through the clean airflow at the front of the bike and low rolling resistance. The rear prioritizes low rolling resistance, but then also improved reliability through increased puncture protection and longer wearing rubber.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Schwalbe-Pro-One-Aero-front-specific-rear-specific-aerodynamic-racing-TT-road-bike-tires_front-on-road.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Schwalbe-Pro-One-Aero-front-specific-rear-specific-aerodynamic-racing-TT-road-bike-tires_front-on-road.jpg\" alt=\"Schwalbe Pro One Aero front-specific &amp; rear-specific aerodynamic racing TT road bike tires, front road\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Schwalbe-Pro-One-Aero-front-specific-rear-specific-aerodynamic-racing-TT-road-bike-tires_front-on-road.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Schwalbe-Pro-One-Aero-front-specific-rear-specific-aerodynamic-racing-TT-road-bike-tires_front-on-road-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Schwalbe-Pro-One-Aero-front-specific-rear-specific-aerodynamic-racing-TT-road-bike-tires_front-on-road-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Schwalbe-Pro-One-Aero-front-specific-rear-specific-aerodynamic-racing-TT-road-bike-tires_front-on-road-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Schwalbe-Pro-One-Aero-front-specific-rear-specific-aerodynamic-racing-TT-road-bike-tires_front-on-road-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Schwalbe-Pro-One-Aero-front-specific-rear-specific-aerodynamic-racing-TT-road-bike-tires_front-on-road-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>By optimizing the shape of the new aero front tire on modern wide 23-25mm internal rims in the wind tunnel, Schwalbe claims to have achieved “<em>22% less aero resistance</em>” between the new Pro One Aero Front in comparison to the Pro One TT (<em>measured at 45 km/h and on a 28mm wide tire</em>).

Yes, that still sounds incredibly thin, and we are putting in the kilometers to see how long they will really last. But it’s really the RaceGuard protection layer that is going to increase durability here. Schwalbe claims actual widths of 29.5 to 30.5mm from the rear tire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Designed to be fit on modern wide tubeless road bike rims (23-25mm internal), the tires are TLE tubeless-ready and compatible with hookless rims. That also means they have reduced <a href=\"https://www.schwalbe.com/en/road-bike-technology\" target=\"_blank\">max allowable tire pressure on hookless setups</a> of up to 5bar, which is in the realm of where you will get the most low rolling resistance benefits from road tubeless anyway. Of course, you can also still ride them on hooked rims with tubes at higher pressures too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>First Rides: Both 28mm, but actually narrower/taller up front &amp; wider/shorter out back</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Schwalbe-Pro-One-Aero-front-specific-rear-specific-aerodynamic-racing-TT-road-bike-tires_photo-by-Michal-Cerverny_Syncros-riding-Switss-gravel-too.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Schwalbe-Pro-One-Aero-front-specific-rear-specific-aerodynamic-racing-TT-road-bike-tires_photo-by-Michal-Cerverny_Syncros-riding-Switss-gravel-too.jpg\" alt=\"Schwalbe Pro One Aero front-specific &amp; rear-specific aerodynamic racing TT road bike tires, Swiss gravel\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Schwalbe-Pro-One-Aero-front-specific-rear-specific-aerodynamic-racing-TT-road-bike-tires_photo-by-Michal-Cerverny_Syncros-riding-Switss-gravel-too.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Schwalbe-Pro-One-Aero-front-specific-rear-specific-aerodynamic-racing-TT-road-bike-tires_photo-by-Michal-Cerverny_Syncros-riding-Switss-gravel-too-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Schwalbe-Pro-One-Aero-front-specific-rear-specific-aerodynamic-racing-TT-road-bike-tires_photo-by-Michal-Cerverny_Syncros-riding-Switss-gravel-too-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Schwalbe-Pro-One-Aero-front-specific-rear-specific-aerodynamic-racing-TT-road-bike-tires_photo-by-Michal-Cerverny_Syncros-riding-Switss-gravel-too-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Schwalbe-Pro-One-Aero-front-specific-rear-specific-aerodynamic-racing-TT-road-bike-tires_photo-by-Michal-Cerverny_Syncros-riding-Switss-gravel-too-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Schwalbe-Pro-One-Aero-front-specific-rear-specific-aerodynamic-racing-TT-road-bike-tires_photo-by-Michal-Cerverny_Syncros-riding-Switss-gravel-too-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption>c.

The new tubeless-ready Schwalbe Pro One Aero tires come in just one 28mm size that Schwalbe seems to think is the perfect balance of speed, grip &amp; control. Don’t forget, they are actually a bit different width front to back, anyway. The dark gray sidewall front- and rear-specific Pro One Aeros sell for 80€ each, and will be available in shops from this coming October. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Schwalbe-Pro-One-Aero-front-specific-rear-specific-aerodynamic-racing-TT-road-bike-tires_photo-by-Michal-Cerverny_Syncros-riding-Switzerland.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Schwalbe-Pro-One-Aero-front-specific-rear-specific-aerodynamic-racing-TT-road-bike-tires_photo-by-Michal-Cerverny_Syncros-riding-Switzerland.jpg\" alt=\"Schwalbe Pro One Aero front-specific &amp; rear-specific aerodynamic racing TT road bike tires, riding Switzerland\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Schwalbe-Pro-One-Aero-front-specific-rear-specific-aerodynamic-racing-TT-road-bike-tires_photo-by-Michal-Cerverny_Syncros-riding-Switzerland.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Schwalbe-Pro-One-Aero-front-specific-rear-specific-aerodynamic-racing-TT-road-bike-tires_photo-by-Michal-Cerverny_Syncros-riding-Switzerland-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Schwalbe-Pro-One-Aero-front-specific-rear-specific-aerodynamic-racing-TT-road-bike-tires_photo-by-Michal-Cerverny_Syncros-riding-Switzerland-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Schwalbe-Pro-One-Aero-front-specific-rear-specific-aerodynamic-racing-TT-road-bike-tires_photo-by-Michal-Cerverny_Syncros-riding-Switzerland-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Schwalbe-Pro-One-Aero-front-specific-rear-specific-aerodynamic-racing-TT-road-bike-tires_photo-by-Michal-Cerverny_Syncros-riding-Switzerland-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Schwalbe-Pro-One-Aero-front-specific-rear-specific-aerodynamic-racing-TT-road-bike-tires_photo-by-Michal-Cerverny_Syncros-riding-Switzerland-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Schwalbe-Pro-One-Aero-front-specific-rear-specific-aerodynamic-racing-TT-road-bike-tires_photo-by-Michal-Cerverny_Syncros-riding-Switzerland-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>c.
