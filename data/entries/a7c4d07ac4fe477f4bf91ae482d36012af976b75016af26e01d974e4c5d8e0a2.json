Before the days of the Internet, a \"magazine\" was a big bundle of paper full of articles you could get shipped to your door, sort of like if you printed out a website. For a time, you could pay cold, hard cash for a digital copy of a paper magazine through Google and then view that content through whatever the latest Google magazine/news app was.</p>\n<p>Magazine content sales were shut down <a href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/01/03/google-news-killing-digital-magazines-refunds-subscriptions/\">in 2020</a>, though, and soon, Google's magazine content will no longer be hosted online. The <a href=\"https://support.google.com/googlenews/thread/243673441/an-update-to-google-news-magazine-support\">company announced</a> on a support page that purchased content will be shut down starting December 18. You can see if you have purchased (or freebie) magazines at <a href=\"https://news.google.com/my/magazines\">this link</a>.</p>\n<p>Let's see if we can put on our \"Google archeology\" hats and figure out where this all came from. Google started selling magazines in 2012 with \"<a href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/2012/06/27/google-play-store-updated-to-bring-new-tv-shows-magazines-and-movies-for-purchase/\">Google Play Magazines</a>.\" You could buy individual magazine issues for around $8 or subscribe yearly for $11. These were all hosted by Google, with access available through the app and web. One year later, in 2013, Play Magazines was merged with another Google news app, Google Currents, to create <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/11/google-launches-play-newsstand-a-hybrid-magazine-store-and-rss-reader/\">Google Play Newsstand</a>. Newsstand featured paid magazines and free website content. Google spent 2013â€“2016 rolling out purchasing support across more and more countries.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984392#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984392&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a7c4d07ac4fe477f4bf91ae482d36012af976b75016af26e01d974e4c5d8e0a2","category":"Tech"}
