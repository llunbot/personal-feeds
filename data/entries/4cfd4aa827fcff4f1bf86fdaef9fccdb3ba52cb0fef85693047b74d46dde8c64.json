The three-time Tour de France winner appeared alongside Rouleur magazine editor Ed Pickering to regale the crowd with stories from his eventful career, having also taken to the Zwift stage earlier on in the day.</p>\n<p>As usual, there was a stacked line-up on the main stage for the last day of the show. A strong EF presence opened proceedings; Kim Cadzow and Esra Tromp from the women's team were first up, before the team's gravel and adventure star Lachlan Morton appeared with Matt Stephens to talk about his monstrous ride around Australia earlier this year.</p>\n<p>Champions of the future Cat Ferguson and Lorenzo Finn discussed what the coming year will be like for them and what they hope to achieve, while another rising star Josh Tarling chatted to Hannah Walker in the penultimate talk on the main stage.</p>\n<p>Track gold medallists Katie Archibald and Finucane talked everything Olympics with Matt, who also appeared as part of the Eurosport special on the art of commentary.</p>\n<p>Across the other side of Truman Brewery, Simon Smythe led a tech talk with Reap, Bastion, and Storck about whether we've reached the peak of bike design on the Zwift stage, which also played host to detailed talks on bike fitting and planning for a multi-day bike trip with some of the show's other exhibitors.</p>\n<p>Saturday saw the close of Rouleur Live 2024, our biggest celebration of cycling culture yet. Thank you to everyone attended and made it such a memorable three days.
