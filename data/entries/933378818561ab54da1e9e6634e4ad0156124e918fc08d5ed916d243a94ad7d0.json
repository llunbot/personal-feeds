There is a little too much darkness in this world and not enough light, a little too much pseudoscience and not enough science. We'll let other publications offer you a daily horoscope.

It's March 28, and today's photo comes from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory as well as a host of other observatories.</p>\n<p>It is a composite image of supernova remnant SNR 1181. The name of the object gives us a clue to when this object went supernova: the year 1181. For about half a year, the 'new' star appeared in the constellation Cassiopeia. It took a long time before astronomers using modern telescopes were able to find the remnant of this supernova, but they finally did so in the last decade.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012976#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012976&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"933378818561ab54da1e9e6634e4ad0156124e918fc08d5ed916d243a94ad7d0","category":"Tech"}
