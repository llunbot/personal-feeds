You can also pair your Apple Watch as a heart rate monitor, and new jerseys and accessories have been added to the Drop Shop.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Level up, and do it faster</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/new-zwift-levels-go-to-100.jpg\"><img width=\"1541\" height=\"866\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/new-zwift-levels-go-to-100.jpg\" alt=\"more zwift levels\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/new-zwift-levels-go-to-100.jpg 1541w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/new-zwift-levels-go-to-100-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/new-zwift-levels-go-to-100-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/new-zwift-levels-go-to-100-120x67.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/new-zwift-levels-go-to-100-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/new-zwift-levels-go-to-100-1536x863.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/new-zwift-levels-go-to-100-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Zwift now has 100 levels, up from 60, and the leveling-up process has been tweaked so you can progress faster. More levels mean more items to unlock, and there are new jerseys and accessories to trade your virtual sweat for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They’ve also adjusted pricing (perhaps they’re feeling the pinch of pandemic excess, too?) on bikes and wheels so you can get more for your virtual buck.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zwift-streak-level-booster.jpg\"><img width=\"1661\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zwift-streak-level-booster.jpg\" alt=\"zwift streaks screenshot\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zwift-streak-level-booster.jpg 1661w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zwift-streak-level-booster-297x193.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zwift-streak-level-booster-800x520.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zwift-streak-level-booster-120x78.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zwift-streak-level-booster-768x499.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zwift-streak-level-booster-1536x999.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A new Streaks feature amplifies your earning and leveling when you ride more consistently. And they’re not asking for much…just ride at least two weeks in a row and you’ll get extra XP for the first two rides of each week in your streak. No limit on how long your streak can last, either, so you can level up your digital street cred faster.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2023-zwift-climb-portal-scaling.jpg\"><img width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2023-zwift-climb-portal-scaling.jpg\" alt=\"zwift climb portal app screen shots\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2023-zwift-climb-portal-scaling.jpg 1920w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2023-zwift-climb-portal-scaling-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2023-zwift-climb-portal-scaling-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2023-zwift-climb-portal-scaling-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2023-zwift-climb-portal-scaling-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2023-zwift-climb-portal-scaling-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2023-zwift-climb-portal-scaling-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Climb Portal has new scaled versions of popular climbs. Choose the climb you want to do, many based on real-world climbs, then select the scale – 50%, 75% or 100% of the actual incline. Consider the first two as warmups, because once you complete a climb at 100% of its actual grade and intensity, it’ll unlock the option to ride it at 125%. Note that only the 100% scale will appear on Strava leaderboards.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Play Events &amp; Ride Queues</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zwift-streaks-boost-level-up-progress-.jpg\"><img width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zwift-streaks-boost-level-up-progress-.jpg\" alt=\"zwift boosts and streaks\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zwift-streaks-boost-level-up-progress-.jpg 1920w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zwift-streaks-boost-level-up-progress--297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zwift-streaks-boost-level-up-progress--800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zwift-streaks-boost-level-up-progress--120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zwift-streaks-boost-level-up-progress--768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zwift-streaks-boost-level-up-progress--1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zwift-streaks-boost-level-up-progress--1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Zwift Play Beta is adding more events that incorporate steering, braking, and gamification using <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/zwift-play-video-game-controllers-for-indoor-bike-trainer/\">the Play controller</a> that launched in June.

Now you can choose from all of Zwift’s available faces and hairstyles regardless of your profile’s selected gender. So, males can look like females and vice versa. Your racing category is still tied to your selected gender, so this is only about your avatar’s appearance, not which events and classes you can race in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Avatar faces are also getting an update with crisper, more detailed graphics and dimensionality.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apple Watch now works as a HR monitor</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zwift-apple-watch-heart-rate-monitor.jpg\"><img width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zwift-apple-watch-heart-rate-monitor.jpg\" alt=\"zwift apple watch HR compatibility\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zwift-apple-watch-heart-rate-monitor.jpg 1920w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zwift-apple-watch-heart-rate-monitor-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zwift-apple-watch-heart-rate-monitor-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zwift-apple-watch-heart-rate-monitor-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zwift-apple-watch-heart-rate-monitor-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zwift-apple-watch-heart-rate-monitor-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/zwift-apple-watch-heart-rate-monitor-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Pretty self explanatory.

Mix and match, or do them all as one giant stage. Races run throughout the day, every day, so you can find a time that works for you and unlock new race routes, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best racers will qualify for three Elite Championships Races and an overall championship classification. Eight champions will share Zwift’s biggest prize purse and unlock a special gold Zwift icon. All championship events will be broadcast live and participants will have pre- and post-race performance verification for every event. Full details on qualification coming December 15th.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-zwift-zfondo-gran-fondo-series.jpg\"><img width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-zwift-zfondo-gran-fondo-series.jpg\" alt=\"zwift Zfondo series 2024\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-zwift-zfondo-gran-fondo-series.jpg 1920w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-zwift-zfondo-gran-fondo-series-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-zwift-zfondo-gran-fondo-series-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-zwift-zfondo-gran-fondo-series-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-zwift-zfondo-gran-fondo-series-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-zwift-zfondo-gran-fondo-series-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2024-zwift-zfondo-gran-fondo-series-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2024 zFondo Series is bringing back the Bambino, Medio, and Gran Fondo distances, and each one has it’s own theme.
