{"title":"Aliens: Fireteam Elite review: Finally, co-op action worthy of this franchise","link":"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1787505","date":1629727225000,"content":"<div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n      <ul><li>\n        <div>  \n        <div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/20210816121601_1-980x551.jpg\" /></div>\n        <p>\n          It's hard to get a good look at the titular monsters in <em>Aliens: Fireteam Elite</em>, mostly because they're otherwise flanking your squad and raising interstellar hell. The results are a surprising blast.                  </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul><p>2013's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/02/aliens-colonial-marines-review-xenophobia/\"><em>Aliens: Colonial Marines</em></a> was arguably the last huge video game to focus on the \"<em>Aliens</em> with an S\" side of all things <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/08/the-throwaway-line-in-aliens-that-spawned-decades-of-confusion/\">xenomorphic</a>. Between flashy trailers and Gearbox's reputation at the time, series fans got their hopes up that the 1986 James Cameron film would finally inspire a modern shooter worth a loud oorah. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/04/sega-forced-to-admit-wrongdoing-in-alien-colonial-marines-advertising/\">Not so much</a>.</p>\n<p>This week, the letter S returns to PCs and game consoles with far lower expectations in the form of <em>Aliens: Fireteam Elite</em>. And I gotta say, this three-player co-op romp's success makes me angry about <em>Colonial Marines</em> all over again.While losing hours to this new game's faithful, no-frills fun, I imagined Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford sitting next to me. Between missions, I would ask him why his development teams couldn't surpass a little-known indie studio's slimmed-down excuse to rev up machine guns and flamethrowers with friends.</p>\n<p>Still, a genuinely fun <em>AliensÂ </em>game is better late than never. And this is <em>much</em> better.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1787505#p3\">Read 26 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1787505&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8ee3bd95c80b28e2a8e5657a7e726bdaf7a193fdddc15324c1dbd81220be1c98","category":"Tech"}
