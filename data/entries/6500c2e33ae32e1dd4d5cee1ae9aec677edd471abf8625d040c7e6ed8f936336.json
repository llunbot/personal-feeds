But the new model is estimated to cost Nintendo only about $10 more to produce, increasing the company's profit margins on the high end of its still-hot gaming hardware.</p>\n<p>That cost estimate <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-14/nintendo-switch-s-big-price-hike-takes-gamers-into-new-territory\">comes from Bloomberg News' Takashi Mochizuki</a>, who breaks down the estimated production cost increase like this:</p>\n<ul><li>7-inch Samsung OLED screen: $3 to $5 more per unit (according to Yoshio Tamura, co-founder of industry research firm <a href=\"https://www.displaysupplychain.com/\">DSCC</a>)</li>\n<li>32GB of additional internal storage: $3.50 per unit (according to <a href=\"https://omdia.tech.informa.com/\">Omdia</a>’s Akira Minamikawa)</li>\n<li>New dock w/ LAN port and other improvements: \"a few dollars more\" per unit</li>\n</ul><h2>Loss leaders and profit centers</h2>\n<p>Historically, many console-makers have sold their hardware at cost or <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/02/sony-shipped-4-5m-ps5s-in-2020-but-is-struggling-to-speed-up-production/\">at a loss</a> in order to attract a bigger audience of potential customers for software (and the console-maker licensing fees that come with it). But while Nintendo <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/10/why-nintendo-is-losing-money-on-each-wii-u-launch-unit/\">initially sold the Wii U at a loss</a>, it has made a profit on every Switch hardware sale <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ynakamura56/status/826336418863525888\">since its launch</a>, with estimates at the time suggesting that the $300 system <a href=\"https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2017/04/nintendo_switch_teardown_suggests_production_cost_is_around_usd260_per_unit\">cost about $260 to produce (per unit) in 2017</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1780541#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1780541&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6500c2e33ae32e1dd4d5cee1ae9aec677edd471abf8625d040c7e6ed8f936336","category":"Tech"}
