We would suggest a front light with a minimum of 400 lumens for riding on unlit roads.</p>\n<p>Don’t be fooled into thinking that the lumen rating of a bike light is the only thing that matters, though. A super-bright light that only has enough battery power to put out that headline figure for half an hour isn’t likely to be particularly useful, especially if you’ll need to use the most powerful setting for extended periods.</p>\n<p>Make sure you check the claimed battery life at all of the various power levels to find the most suitable light for your style of riding.</p>\n<h3>Are LEDs good for bike lights?</h3>\n<p>The filament bulb is thankfully a thing of the past. Virtually all of today’s high-end front lights have Cree LEDs, which offer better brightness, more versatility, less heat, longer life and are smaller.</p>\n<p>Most rear lights now use COB LEDs. COB stands for ‘chip on board’ – essentially multiple LED chips forming a single module. They produce less heat, are brighter and can come in a variety of colours – but remember the law in most countries dictates a rear light must be red.</p>\n<h3>Battery life</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Most road lights are all-in-one units that include the battery, but more powerful lights will usually have a separate battery.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Alex Evans</i></span></div>\n<p>Unlike mountain bike lights, which often use dedicated external battery packs, lights for road bikes and commuting usually have internal batteries, so there’s always going to be a trade-off between power, battery life and the size of the light.</p>\n<p>For example, a more powerful light, with a longer battery life will require a physically larger battery and will therefore increase the overall size of the unit.</p>\n<p>This isn’t necessarily a problem in itself, but many road cyclists won’t want something overly large to spoil the sleek looks of their road bike or clutter the handlebar. Likewise, some commuters will want lights that are small enough to be stuffed easily in a work bag.</p>\n<p>For others, especially those who ride on unlit roads or enjoy particularly long rides and commutes, a larger light with more lumens and battery capacity will be essential.</p>\n<h3>What about dynamo-powered lights?</h3>\n<div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2019/10/Lauf-Anywhere-Weekend-Warrior-Edition-07-66f26e5.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Dynamo hubs, such as the pictured SONdelux, provide battery-free lighting.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2019/10/Lauf-Anywhere-Weekend-Warrior-Edition-02-147a2eb.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The Exposure Revo is one of our favourite dynamo lights.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>Astute readers will notice that we have only covered battery-powered lights in this guide.</p>\n<p>Dynamo-powered lights – which, most commonly, are powered by a generator hub built into a wheel – are a very popular option on touring and town bikes, and with good reason. They offer infinite run time and the optics in the lights are often very high quality.</p>\n<p>However, they require a significant investment in terms of both money and research, and to cover both systems would be beyond the scope of this guide. We’ve covered <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-dynamos/\">bike dynamos</a> in a separate explainer, including our pick of the best dynamo lights.</p>\n<h3>Balance and beam pattern</h3>\n<p>When buying a set of lights, it’s also wise to consider the balance between the front and the rear.</p>\n<p>The front light will almost always have much more power because its role includes lighting dark roads and cycle paths. However, while the outright lumen count of most rear lights won’t come close to the front, the spec is just as important.</p>\n<p>A rear light’s main role is to help make you visible to other road users, so having decent brightness and battery life is essential because it needs to last the length of whatever ride you’re taking on while also being powerful enough for other road users to see it from a good distance.</p>\n<p>Some lights are now also marketed for daytime use, with the appropriate brightness and flash patterns to help keep you seen in bright sunshine and low light.</p>\n<p>Both front and rear lights should also balance range and peripheral lighting. A highly-focused beam can be great for lighting the road in front of you for fast riding, but for the sake of both being able to spot hazards and to enable road users approaching from different angles to see you better, it’s important that some of the light beam spreads into the periphery as well.</p>\n<h4>What about StVZO lights?</h4>\n<p>StVZO lights conform to German Road Traffic Licensing Regulations, with beam patterns shaped to avoid dazzling other road users.</p>\n<p>You don’t need to use StVZO-approved lights anywhere other than on German roads – however, if you ride solely on the road, investing in a StVZO light could be a good idea.</p>\n<p>The narrow beam might not suit mountain bikers or bike packers cycling at night, but there are more StVZO light options becoming available that let you change between high and low beams to get around this issue.</p>\n<p>We’ve got a separate explainer on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/stvzo-bike-lights/\">StVZO bike lights</a> that runs through all the pros and cons.</p>\n<h3>Mount systems</h3>\n<p></p><div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2020/09/Exposure-Sirius-MK9-06-60e6820.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>How the light mounts to the bike is also worth considering.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2020/09/Exposure-Sirius-MK9-04-e12c340.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>This light uses a U-clip attached to the handlebar via an O-ring.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\nIn an ideal world, you would be able to have a mounting system that is perfectly simple, lightning-quick to install and remove, totally secure and infinitely durable… But in reality, there’s usually a bit of a compromise between those various characteristics.\n<p>The simplest mounts use heavy-duty rubber bands and dedicated grooves on the light mount. These systems have the advantage of being extremely quick and easy to install and remove, and can usually be easily adjusted to different types and sizes of handlebar, seat posts, etc.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, it’s easy to lose these elastic bands when the lights aren’t mounted on the bike and they’re more susceptible to movement over rough ground. Given long-term use, they’re also more likely to degrade and eventually break than a solid mount.</p>\n<p>Solid plastic or metal mounting systems, which clip on to the handlebars and are secured with bolts, tend to offer much better security on bumpy roads as well as much greater long-term durability.</p>\n<p>Installing or removing these types of mounts can often be a much more involved process though, sometimes even requiring a specific tool (such as a small hex key).</p>\n<p>Usually, manufacturers will look to mitigate this inconvenience by making the light separately removable from the actual mount itself (so, for example, you can quickly take the light unit with you after locking up your bike), but not every light offers this function, so it’s worth checking before you buy.</p>\n<h3>Other features</h3>\n<p>Waterproofing is important, particularly if you regularly ride in poor weather conditions. The IP Code is a measurement of protection against the ingress of water and dust. IP4 protects against splashing of water, while an IP7 product will survive immersion in water for 30 minutes.</p>\n<p>Some front lights not only power their own LEDs but have USB ports that allow you to charge mobiles or GPS computers – particularly useful for long-distance riders.</p>","author":"Alex Evans","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"9ff1889d58bc63c8eb248a3bb60942be0faff3222a6e90d2ae1098b65203a152","category":"Cycling"}
