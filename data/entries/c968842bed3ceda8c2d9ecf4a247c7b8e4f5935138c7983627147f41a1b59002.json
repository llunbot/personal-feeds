The Swiss brand cites several cases where specific steerer tubes have separated under<em> “heavy-duty riding conditions.”</em> While the issue seems limited, BMC is erring on the side of caution and replacing affected forks with a more robust version.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BMC-Kaius-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_riding-jpg.webp\"><img src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BMC-Kaius-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_riding-jpg.webp\" alt=\"BMC Kaius aero carbon gravel race bike, riding\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>What BMC Kaius 01 Owners Need to Know</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>BMC is asking all Kaius 01 owners to stop riding immediately and take their bikes to a BMC retailer for inspection. If a fork replacement is needed, the retailer will install a new one at no cost to the rider.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How dealers will determine if a fork needs replacing is still unclear. However, what is clear is that BMC is getting ahead of this issue before an official CPSC (Consumer Product Safety Commission) announcement—<a href=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2020/BMC-Recalls-Bicycles-and-Framesets-Due-to-Fall-Hazard\">not the first time the brand has had to issue a recall related to steerer tubes</a>, like the stop ride notice for the Teammachine SLR01 DISC bicycles and framesets.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BMC-Kaius-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Kaius-01-ONE-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BMC-Kaius-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Kaius-01-ONE-800x440.jpg\" alt=\"BMC Kaius aero carbon gravel race bike, ONE\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BMC-Kaius-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Kaius-01-ONE-800x440.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BMC-Kaius-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Kaius-01-ONE-297x163.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BMC-Kaius-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Kaius-01-ONE-120x66.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BMC-Kaius-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Kaius-01-ONE-768x422.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BMC-Kaius-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Kaius-01-ONE-1536x845.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BMC-Kaius-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Kaius-01-ONE.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BMC-Kaius-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Kaius-01-TWO-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BMC-Kaius-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Kaius-01-TWO-800x440.jpg\" alt=\"BMC Kaius aero carbon gravel race bike, TWO\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BMC-Kaius-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Kaius-01-TWO-800x440.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BMC-Kaius-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Kaius-01-TWO-297x163.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BMC-Kaius-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Kaius-01-TWO-120x66.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BMC-Kaius-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Kaius-01-TWO-768x422.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BMC-Kaius-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Kaius-01-TWO-1536x845.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BMC-Kaius-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Kaius-01-TWO.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BMC-Kaius-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Kaius-01-THREE-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BMC-Kaius-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Kaius-01-THREE-800x440.jpg\" alt=\"BMC Kaius aero carbon gravel race bike, THREE\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BMC-Kaius-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Kaius-01-THREE-800x440.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BMC-Kaius-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Kaius-01-THREE-297x163.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BMC-Kaius-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Kaius-01-THREE-120x66.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BMC-Kaius-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Kaius-01-THREE-768x422.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BMC-Kaius-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Kaius-01-THREE-1536x845.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BMC-Kaius-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_Kaius-01-THREE.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Which Bikes Are Affected?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you own any of the following 2023, 2024, or even 2026 Kaius 01 models, your bike is subject to the recall:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>2023 BMC Kaius 01 ONE, TWO, THREE</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2024 BMC Kaius 01 LTD, ONE, TWO, THREE</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2026 BMC Kaius 01 THREE, FRS</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BMC-Kaius-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_integrated-Aerocore-bottles-jpg.webp\"><img src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BMC-Kaius-aero-carbon-gravel-race-bike_integrated-Aerocore-bottles-jpg.webp\" alt=\"BMC Kaius aero carbon gravel race bike, Aerocore bottles\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>What to Do Next</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>BMC is working to replace affected forks as quickly as possible and apologizes for the inconvenience.
