It’s a huge globe around two metres in diameter, and on a plinth underneath are the words ‘When the bicycle is art’. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perched on top of the world is a metal rendering of Colnago’s C42 time-trial bike. It’s ironic because that was one of the brand’s earliest carbon fibre frames, but it leaves no doubt as to the esteem in which Ernesto Colnago holds his bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The man does have an ego, but I think that comes with the territory because, as bike designers go, he’s a genius,’ Gabriele Sirtori, Colnago’s digital manager, tells <em>Cyclist</em> as we consider the monument. ‘This thing takes some upkeep as well. It’s so heavy the plinth steadily collapses under it, so it has to be periodically rebuilt.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-02-647x970.webp\" alt=\"Colnago insider\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-02-647x970.webp 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-02-200x300.webp 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-02-768x1152.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-02-1024x1536.webp 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-02-1365x2048.webp 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-02-750x1125.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-02-1140x1710.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-02.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>In any other bike company’s HQ, such a feature would be viewed as extravagant, but if any brand can justify having it, it’s Colnago. In a country that lays claim to being the spiritual home of performance bicycle manufacturing, Colnago is the most celebrated name of the lot. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To recount its history in a way that does it justice would take more words than this features allows, plus we’ve attempted it before (Colnago was the subject of the first <em>Cyclist</em> ‘Insider’ back in issue one), so we’ll keep the origin story brief.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-03-647x970.webp\" alt=\"Colnago insider\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-03-647x970.webp 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-03-200x300.webp 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-03-768x1152.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-03-1024x1536.webp 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-03-1365x2048.webp 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-03-750x1125.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-03-1140x1710.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-03.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>A sculpture of a Colnago C42 atop the world.

A prolific career followed, and Colnago remains one of the most successful brands ever in terms of both pro cycling (there isn’t a major race it hasn’t won at least once) and technological innovation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has pioneered features that have both been consigned as quirks of history, such as the twin down tubes of its 1989 Carbitubo, and credited with changing the game, such as 1987’s Precisa straight-bladed steel forks.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>A new chapter</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The brand continues without its founder now, Ernesto having retired in 2020 after 66 years in charge, although he still lives over the road, aged 93. The huge wrought iron <em>Asso di Fiori</em> – Ace of Clubs, the Colnago logo – adorning his front gates is a dead giveaway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite functioning without his guiding hand, the brand is going from strength to strength. Tadej Pogačar is ensuring Colnago’s dominance on the WorldTour and its portfolio is healthier than ever, including the new radically aero Y1Rs, the Steelnovo with 3D printed steel junctions, and new all-road and gravel versions of its iconic C-Series.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-04-647x970.webp\" alt=\"Colnago insider\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-04-647x970.webp 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-04-200x300.webp 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-04-768x1152.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-04-1024x1536.webp 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-04-1365x2048.webp 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-04-750x1125.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-04-1140x1710.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-04.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Sales have tripled in the past three years, according to CEO Nicola Rosin, who says, ‘I think we have a distinct position in the market versus other brands. We do high-end road and gravel only – just a few things but done very, very well. Our messaging and how we are perceived has never been so clear.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rosin credits the influence of UAE’s Chimera Investments LLC, which bought a controlling stake in the company from Ernesto in 2020, for giving Colnago the freedom to focus on such a specific stratum of the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Of course, the money they invested was important, but just as influential was their attitude towards how we wanted to build the brand. They recognised the opportunities we had to maintain and grow our success, so let us get on with it rather than imposing their agenda.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-05-970x647.webp\" alt=\"Colnago insider\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-05-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-05-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-05-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-05-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-05-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-05-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-05-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-05-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-05.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>The C68 bikes are the only carbon models made in-house.

If they can appropriately mix that with the capabilities of modern technology, it’s a winning formula.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-06-647x970.webp\" alt=\"Colnago insider\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-06-647x970.webp 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-06-200x300.webp 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-06-768x1152.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-06-1024x1536.webp 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-06-1365x2048.webp 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-06-750x1125.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-06-1140x1710.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-06.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>Colnago’s bike room is filled with historical models, serving as a reminder for how far frame design (and gearing options) have come over the years.</figcaption><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Colnago arguably has no better asset to do that with than its C-Series bikes, which have been made in-house since the very first model, 1989’s C35 – the ‘C’ standing for Colnago, the number for the age of the company at the time. This is despite the widespread move towards outsourcing production to the Far East in the early 2000s by almost every bike brand, including Colnago itself for some models in its range.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From that first true monocoque model – the C35 frame was made in one piece – the design shifted in 1994 with the arrival of the C40, a carbon version of Colnago’s famed tube-and-lug steel frames, replete with their hallmark crimped tube shapes. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\"

We have to make the fastest bike possible. For now at least, that’s better done in Asia.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the successful modernisation of the C-Series has shown, Colnago’s knack for innovation paired with its desire to be faithful to its heritage means it wouldn’t be surprising to see in-house production return on a larger scale in the future.

There’s said to be at least one of every model it has made, and more than a few prototypes that have never seen the light of day. Prominent among the collection are the skinny tubes and orange paint of Eddy Merckx’s Molteni bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Ernesto made Eddy 25 to 30 bikes a year,’ says Alessandro Turci, Colnago’s content manager, presenting one bike that he says Merckx rode to win Liège-Bastogne-Liège in 1972. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Merckx was so finicky when it came to fit, always adjusting his setup, and expected an updated frameset to be ready for him in two days. As particular as he was when it came to fit though, he told his mechanics that under no circumstances were they to ever clean his chain. Merckx thought they ran faster when a little dirty.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Turci, although Tadej Pogačar is similar in talent to Merckx, he is worlds apart in approach: ‘Tadej is far more relaxed. He is happy to use what he’s given, and just lets the sports scientists work out his best fit.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-14-647x970.webp\" alt=\"Colnago insider\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-14-647x970.webp 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-14-200x300.webp 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-14-768x1152.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-14-1024x1536.webp 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-14-1365x2048.webp 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-14-750x1125.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-14-1140x1710.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/colnago-insider-14.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>Going for gold</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The story behind Colnago’s first – and arguably most striking – marketing tool</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The Colnago Mexico Gold is one of our rarest bikes, but more than one was made,’ says Alessandro Turci, Colnago’s content manager and self-proclaimed ‘Colnagologist’. ‘This model was made in the 1970s, the first in 1972 following Merckx’s Hour record. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Mexico itself was an evolution of the Super.
