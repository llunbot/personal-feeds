The start, Flam_Hill said, was simply an external observation of the staging area for Event Horizon Expeditionaires (EHE), a 299-member in-game corporation that dates back to 2011. That observation phase revealed the encouraging and crucial sign that the CEO and directors in charge of maintaining the corporation were \"minimally active,\" as Flam_Hill put it.</p>\n<p>With that information in hand, Flam_Hill used a \"very clean account with a character with a little history\" to apply for new membership in EHE. After weeks of waiting, corporate leadership finally logged in to perform some basic social/security checks and approve the applications for Flam_Hill and a confederate.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1931135#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1931135&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5d307c9d7d189e79f942b0246fedeff2980d67c8d8404efe9e00876c019dca1e","category":"Tech"}
