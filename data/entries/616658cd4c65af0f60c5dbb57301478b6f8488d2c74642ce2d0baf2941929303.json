It incorporates the magnetic charging profile from <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a>, and it supports faster 15W charging on compatible <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> models. The current Qi standard is limited to 7.5W.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith Qi2 available, manufacturers do not have to license official ‌MagSafe‌ charging functionality from Apple, so we can expect to see more affordable 15W wireless charging options. Nomad's Stand will work with any ‌MagSafe‌ or Qi2-enabled device, and it comes with a USB-C to USB-C cable, but customers will need to supply a 20W+ USB-C power adapter.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNomad plans to begin selling the Qi2 Stand in the coming weeks from the Nomad website, and customers can sign up to be <a href=\"https://nomadgoods.com/products/stand-qi2-white\">notified when it becomes available</a>.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/19/nomad-qi2-charging-stand/\">Nomad Announces $100 Qi2 Charging Stand</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/nomad-announces-100-qi2-charging-stand.2414203/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"616658cd4c65af0f60c5dbb57301478b6f8488d2c74642ce2d0baf2941929303","category":"Apple"}
