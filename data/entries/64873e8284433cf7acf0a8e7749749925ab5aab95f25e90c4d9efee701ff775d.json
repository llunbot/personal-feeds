Battle highlights that “Bikepacking Roots maintains a long-term commitment to doing what we can to support diversity and inclusion in the bikepacking community.  A key thing we have heard repeatedly is to support the BIPOC community leaders and organizations who are already out there doing great work.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2378\" height=\"3567\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/Photo-credit-Dessa-Lohrey-1.jpg?fit=1200,3567&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/Photo-credit-Dessa-Lohrey-1.jpg?w=2378&amp;quality=75 2378w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/Photo-credit-Dessa-Lohrey-1.jpg?resize=1200,1800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/Photo-credit-Dessa-Lohrey-1.jpg?resize=2000,3000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/Photo-credit-Dessa-Lohrey-1.jpg?resize=768,1152&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/Photo-credit-Dessa-Lohrey-1.jpg?resize=1024,1536&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/Photo-credit-Dessa-Lohrey-1.jpg?resize=1365,2048&amp;quality=75 1365w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"4680\" height=\"3120\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/Photo-credit-Dessa-Lohrey.jpg?fit=1200,3120&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/Photo-credit-Dessa-Lohrey.jpg?w=4680&amp;quality=75 4680w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/Photo-credit-Dessa-Lohrey.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/Photo-credit-Dessa-Lohrey.jpg?resize=2000,1333&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/Photo-credit-Dessa-Lohrey.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/Photo-credit-Dessa-Lohrey.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/02/Photo-credit-Dessa-Lohrey.jpg?resize=2048,1365&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>For 2024, awards will focus on providing grants to BIPOC Community Leaders to host trips, develop gear libraries, and other community building activities. Bikepacking Roots hopes to develop long term relationships with these leaders and to support diversity within their Regional Stewards Program.</p>\n<p>Bikepacking Roots is currently looking to fundraise at least $25,000 to launch this 3rd round of grantmaking. The organization is seeking support from individuals and organizations in the community who share in the belief that bikepacking should be accessible to all, and that we all benefit from fostering a supportive and inclusive community.</p>\n<p>Visit Bikepacking Roots’ website to find out more about the grant, sign up for updates, and to donate today: <a href=\"Bikepacking Roots BIPOC Adventure Grant\" target=\"_blank\">https://bikepackingroots.org/<wbr></wbr>the-bipoc-bike-adventure-<wbr></wbr>grant/</a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/bikepacking-roots-announces-the-2024-bipoc-adventure-grant/\">Bikepacking Roots Announces the 2024 BIPOC Adventure Grant</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"64873e8284433cf7acf0a8e7749749925ab5aab95f25e90c4d9efee701ff775d","category":"Cycling"}
