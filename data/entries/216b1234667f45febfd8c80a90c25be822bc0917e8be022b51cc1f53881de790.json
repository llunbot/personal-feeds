Another was Texas-based grocery store chain H-E-B, which is also gradually starting to accept Apple Pay this month.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn a <a href=\"https://newsroom.heb.com/h-e-b-rolls-out-digital-tap-to-pay-at-its-stores/\">press release</a> this week, H-E-B said it will begin rolling out the ability to pay with Apple Pay and other tap-to-pay methods at all of its stores throughout October. The company's other chains Central Market and Joe V's Smart Shop already began accepting Apple Pay earlier this year, and now it will be accepted in actual H-E-B stores.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWalmart is now one of the only major retailers in the U.S. that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/21/walmart-still-doesnt-accept-apple-pay/\">still does not accept Apple Pay</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/\">Apple Pay</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-music-apple-pay-card-icloud-fitness.134\">Apple Music, Apple Pay/Card, iCloud, Fitness+</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/09/home-depot-and-heb-rolling-out-apple-pay/\">The Home Depot and H-E-B Finally Rolling Out Apple Pay in Stores</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/the-home-depot-and-h-e-b-finally-rolling-out-apple-pay-in-stores.2439662/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"216b1234667f45febfd8c80a90c25be822bc0917e8be022b51cc1f53881de790","category":"Apple"}
