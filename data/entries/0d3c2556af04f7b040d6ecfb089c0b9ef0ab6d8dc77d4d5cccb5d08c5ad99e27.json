Martin <a href=\"https://martincmartin.com/2024/06/14/how-i-found-a-55-year-old-bug-in-the-first-lunar-lander-game/\">announced</a> that he recently discovered a bug in the original <em>Lunar Lander</em> computer game's physics code while tinkering with the software. Created by a <a href=\"https://technologizer.com/2009/07/19/lunar-lander/index.html\">17-year-old high school student named Jim Storer</a> in 1969, this primordial game rendered the action only as text status updates on a <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/news/the-forgotten-world-of-teletype-computer-games\">teletype</a>, but it set the stage for future versions to come.</p>\n\n<p>The legendary game—which Storer developed on a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-8\">PDP-8</a> minicomputer in a programming language called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOCAL_(programming_language)\">FOCAL</a> just months after Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin made their historic moonwalks—allows players to control a lunar module's descent onto the Moon's surface. Players must carefully manage their fuel usage to achieve a gentle landing, making critical decisions every ten seconds to burn the right amount of fuel.</p>\n<p>In 2009, just short of the 40th anniversary of the first Moon landing, I set out to find the author of the original <em>Lunar Lander</em> game, which was then primarily known as a graphical game, thanks to the <a href=\"http://www.brouhaha.com/~eric/retrocomputing/dec/gt40/\">graphical version</a> from 1974 and a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Lander_(1979_video_game)\">1979 Atari arcade title</a>. When I discovered that Storer created the oldest known version as a teletype game, I interviewed him and wrote up <a href=\"https://technologizer.com/2009/07/19/lunar-lander/index.html\">a history of the game</a>. Storer later <a href=\"https://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~storer/LunarLander/LunarLander.html\">released the source code</a> to the original game, written in FOCAL, on his website.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031700#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031700&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0d3c2556af04f7b040d6ecfb089c0b9ef0ab6d8dc77d4d5cccb5d08c5ad99e27","category":"Tech"}
