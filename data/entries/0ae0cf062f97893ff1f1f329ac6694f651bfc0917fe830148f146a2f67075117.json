During day three of Google's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/chrome-on-the-chopping-block-as-googles-search-antitrust-trial-moves-forward/\">antitrust remedies trial</a>, the company presented a slide showing that Gemini reached 350 million monthly active users as of March 2025. That's a massive increase from last year, showing that Google is beginning to gain traction among competing chatbots, but Google's estimation of ChatGPT's traffic shows it still has a long climb ahead of it.</p>\n<p>The slide was presented <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/googles-gemini-user-numbers-revealed-court\">during the testimony of Sissie Hsiao</a>, who until recently was leading Google's Gemini efforts. She was <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/google-shakes-up-gemini-leadership-google-labs-head-taking-the-reins/\">replaced earlier this month</a> by Josh Woodward, who also runs Google Labs. The slide listed Gemini's 350 million monthly users, along with daily traffic of 35 million users.</p>\n<p>These numbers represent a huge increase for Gemini, which languished in the tens of millions of monthly users late last year. Gemini's daily user count at the time was a mere 9 million, according to Google. Since then, Google has released its Gemini 2.0 and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/google-says-the-new-gemini-2-5-pro-model-is-its-smartest-ai-yet/\">2.5 models</a>, both of which have shown demonstrable improvements over the previous iterations. It has also begun adding Gemini features to more parts of the Google ecosystem, even though some of those integrations can be more frustrating than useful.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/gemini-usage-is-exploding-but-google-is-a-long-way-from-catching-chatgpt/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/04/gemini-usage-is-exploding-but-google-is-a-long-way-from-catching-chatgpt/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ryan Whitwam","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0ae0cf062f97893ff1f1f329ac6694f651bfc0917fe830148f146a2f67075117","category":"Tech"}
