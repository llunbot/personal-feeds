This caused Voyager to point its antenna slightly away from Earth.</p>\n<p>At the time, the space agency said it wasn't panicking. The mission's scientists believed they had several options to restore communications with the half-century-old probe. And so they did.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasa-mission-update-voyager-2-communications-pause\">In an update posted Friday</a>, NASA said all is now well once again with Voyager 2. NASA's Deep Space Network facility in Canberra, Australia, was able to send a \"shout\" command to Voyager instructing the spacecraft to reorient itself into a proper position to facilitate communication with Earth.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1959104#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1959104&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"af03b52efd94b162c8378d57cbec7507a4becf11dd50a079191223f77b4a465d","category":"Tech"}
