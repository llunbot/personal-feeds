It accounts for around 60% of the\ntotal dollar amount of U.S. debit-card purchases and about 50% of\nU.S. credit-card purchases, according to the Nilson Report, a\ntrade publication. Its closest competitor, Mastercard, accounts\nfor around 22% and 23%, respectively. Visa’s profit totaled $17.3\nbillion in its 2023 fiscal year, after more than tripling in the\nlast decade.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Amex accounts for about 19% of U.S. credit card transactions (and doesn’t support debit), and Discover is down around 3 or 4%. I really thought Visa and Mastercard had comparable market share, but it turns out Visa is far bigger, and it’s Mastercard and Amex that are around the same size.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/03/us-transaction-shares-for-visa-mastercard-and-amex\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"c9a3a3b05278f51dbc1ae2960e38b2fd73e49f2b0d81e77c859de3b7981ff2d6","category":"Tech"}
