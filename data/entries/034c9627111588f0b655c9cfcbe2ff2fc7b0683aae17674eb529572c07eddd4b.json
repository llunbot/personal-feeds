Travel budgets and the pandemic conspired to keep us apart, but we are finally gathering Team Ars in New York City later this week. We’d love for you to be there, too, in spirit. </span></p>\n<p><span>As we gear up for our big fall meeting, we want to hear from </span><i><span>you</span></i><span>! We've set up a special email address, <a href=\"mailto:Tellus@arstechnica.com\">Tellus@arstechnica.com</a>, just for reader feedback. We won’t harvest your email for </span><span>spam or some nonsense—we just want to hear from you. </span></p>\n<p><span>What would we like to hear about? We're eager to know your thoughts on what we're doing right, where we could improve, and what you'd like to see more (or less) of. What topics do you think we should be covering that we aren’t? Are we hitting the right balance in our reporting? Is there too much doom and gloom, or not enough? Feel free to be as specific and loquacious as you wish. </span></p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/staff/2024/11/calling-all-ars-readers-your-feedback-is-needed/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/staff/2024/11/calling-all-ars-readers-your-feedback-is-needed/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ken Fisher","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"034c9627111588f0b655c9cfcbe2ff2fc7b0683aae17674eb529572c07eddd4b","category":"Tech"}
