The ground team sent a command up to Voyager 1 on Thursday to recode part of the memory of the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/02/humanitys-most-distant-space-probe-jeopardized-by-computer-glitch/\">spacecraft's Flight Data Subsystem (FDS)</a>, one of the probe's three computers.</p>\n<p>“In the minutes leading up to when we were going to see a signal, you could have heard a pin drop in the room,\" said Linda Spilker, project scientist for NASA's two Voyager spacecraft at JPL. \"It was quiet. People were looking very serious. They were looking at their computer screens. Each of the subsystem (engineers) had pages up that they were looking at, to watch as they would be populated.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019258#p3\">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019258&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"864a4ac487a2dc48573e85ed29310e708a108221a9021818bc863bdf2ad5a081","category":"Tech"}
