The Wireless Charging Stand has a cable for the ‌AirPods‌ charger and the Apple Watch Charger, but you will need a separate power adapter for the ‌MagSafe‌ cable.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMophie's stand offers all of the benefits of ‌MagSafe‌, including support for landscape or portrait modes, magnetic attachment, easy placement and fitting, and 15W wireless charging (12W for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12 mini</a>).\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe 3-in-1 Stand for ‌MagSafe‌ Charger can be <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/HPP82ZM/A/mophie-3-in-1-stand-for-magsafe-charger\">purchased from Apple</a> or <a href=\"https://www.zagg.com/3-in-1-wireless-charging-stand-magsafe-apple-exclusive\">from Mophie</a> for $89.95.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mophie/\">Mophie</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/15/mophie-magsafe-wireless-charging-stand/\">Mophie Debuts 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Stand That Works With Apple's MagSafe Charger</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mophie-debuts-3-in-1-wireless-charging-stand-that-works-with-apples-magsafe-charger.2304366/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=CPGrdG8cx_c:_ZPPL9uanjA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=CPGrdG8cx_c:_ZPPL9uanjA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/CPGrdG8cx_c\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b574d17707b72f1d19ee5915d0d9b9cb3b78d5351f407a7e706a12c65c07e0d9","category":"Apple"}
