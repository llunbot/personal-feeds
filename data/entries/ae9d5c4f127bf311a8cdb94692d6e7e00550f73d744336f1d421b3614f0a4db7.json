From three-point seatbelts to side-impact protection to blind-spot monitoring and much more, the Swedish automaker focuses its innovation on making its cars safer rather than faster around the NÃ¼rburgring. (Although in the past, it has <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2017/08/the-2017-s60-polestar-a-volvo-with-a-nurburgring-lap-record/\">set records there too</a>.) As part of its efforts, Volvo has collected data from tens of thousands of car crashes, which it's now leveraging in virtual worlds to put simulated cars and SUVs through the wringer with the help of something amusingly named \"Gaussian splatting.\"</p>\n<p>\"We've been visiting crash sites since the '70s. We've been recording event data from a fleet of cars for many, many years,\" said Alwin Bakkenes, head of global software engineering at Volvo Cars. \"And all of those data points have actually helped us create safety innovations... from the three-point safety belt to whiplash protection systems and now also, as we're introducing in the ES90, a function called 'lidar AS,' which helps the car steer away from vulnerable road users in the dark,\" he said.</p>\n<p>Like some others in the industry, Volvo is an early adopter of the software-defined vehicle, or SDV. As a quick refresher, SDVs are clean-sheet designs in terms of their electronic architecture. Instead of dozens or even a hundred discrete black boxes, each with its own hardware and running its own software, each doing a discrete job (like controlling the air conditioner or managing traction control), four or five powerful central computers take over those roles, overseeing domains like infotainment, advanced driver assistance systems, handling and powertrain, and interior comfort.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/volvo-reconstructs-crashes-with-ai-in-virtual-worlds-to-make-safer-cars/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/volvo-reconstructs-crashes-with-ai-in-virtual-worlds-to-make-safer-cars/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
