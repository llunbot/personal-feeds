The frame kit focuses on adaptability and works seamlessly with a wide range of aftermarket components, making it perfect for creating everything from a relaxed all-road bike to a rugged off-road touring machine. With a maximum measured tyre size of 55mm on 700c rims the frame can handle almost any modern gravel bike tyre. The frame features mudguard mounts and a large number of bottle and accessory mounting points.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sturdy-Cycles-SC-G-Geometry-Chart.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sturdy-Cycles-SC-G-Geometry-Chart.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sturdy-Cycles-SC-G-Geometry-Chart.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sturdy-Cycles-SC-G-Geometry-Chart.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Geometry</h3>\n<p>The geometry is typical of a modern gravel bike. Longer chainstays provide stability at speed and on rough terrain as well as additional traction on steep or loose surfaces. A slightly higher stack height allows for a more upright position for comfort on long or tiring rides. The headtube angle provides the straight line stability often favoured on extremely rough terrain.<br />\n<b></b></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sturdy-Cycles-SC-G-_-Bike-05.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sturdy-Cycles-SC-G-_-Bike-05.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sturdy-Cycles-SC-G-_-Bike-05.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sturdy-Cycles-SC-G-_-Bike-05.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sturdy-Cycles-SC-G-_-Bike-06.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sturdy-Cycles-SC-G-_-Bike-06.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sturdy-Cycles-SC-G-_-Bike-06.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sturdy-Cycles-SC-G-_-Bike-06.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sturdy-Cycles-SC-G-_-Bike-04.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sturdy-Cycles-SC-G-_-Bike-04.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sturdy-Cycles-SC-G-_-Bike-04.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Sturdy-Cycles-SC-G-_-Bike-04.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Tech and Assembly Standards</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The frame kit features 3D printed titanium junctions which are CNC machined before being welded to drawn titanium tubes at the workshop in Somerset.
