The <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/olympics\" target=\"_blank\">Olympics </a>is on, but she isn’t there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It was hard mentally,’ she says, ‘because I was really looking forward to it. I was sure I would be selected. I didn’t race any Classics and apparently the selection was done there. We had no idea.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Missing selection for her home Olympics has been a blow for the FDJ-Suez rider, who grew up in Lons-le-Saunier, at the foot of the Jura Massif in eastern France, which shaped her into the cyclist she is today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I think that’s why I really love the ten-minute climbs in a race. Where I was born is so peaceful with lots of climbs that don’t go on for too long.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That punchy climbing ability helped her to victory at the French National Championships Road Race in 2021 and stage wins at the La Vuelta Femenina and the Giro Rosa. She only needs a stage of the Tour de France Femmes to complete the ‘triple’.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"646\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/WhatsApp-Image-2024-08-01-at-16.09.44-646x970.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/WhatsApp-Image-2024-08-01-at-16.09.44-646x970.jpeg 646w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/WhatsApp-Image-2024-08-01-at-16.09.44-200x300.jpeg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/WhatsApp-Image-2024-08-01-at-16.09.44-768x1153.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/WhatsApp-Image-2024-08-01-at-16.09.44-1023x1536.jpeg 1023w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/WhatsApp-Image-2024-08-01-at-16.09.44-750x1126.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/WhatsApp-Image-2024-08-01-at-16.09.44.jpeg 1066w\" /><figcaption>FDJ-Suez</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Muzic was introduced to cycling through her parents. Her father, Thierry, owned a bike shop and her mother, Laurence, rode with younger riders in a club. Perhaps it was inevitable that she would find her way to the bike at almost three years of age and take to the start lines of competitions at five.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking back at one of her earlier races, she recalls being one of three riders in the leading group, her racing rivals being boys. On the last corner, she accidentally rode straight and missed the turn. ‘I was crying,’ she remembers, ‘and my dad wasn’t very happy. But when I was younger, I raced with the men a lot of the time.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Family is a big part of Muzic’s life. When off the bike, the 25-year-old tries to spend as much time as possible with her family and boyfriend Eddy Finé, who races for Cofidis, as it’s hard to see each other often throughout the season. But even on the bike, she manages brings her cats with her. The paws of Pablito (or ‘<em>Toto’</em>) and Trésor (<em>‘treasure’</em>) have decorated the frame of her bike since winning the national road race title in 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/WhatsApp-Image-2024-08-01-at-16.08.51-970x646.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/WhatsApp-Image-2024-08-01-at-16.08.51-970x646.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/WhatsApp-Image-2024-08-01-at-16.08.51-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/WhatsApp-Image-2024-08-01-at-16.08.51-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/WhatsApp-Image-2024-08-01-at-16.08.51-1536x1023.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/WhatsApp-Image-2024-08-01-at-16.08.51-750x500.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/WhatsApp-Image-2024-08-01-at-16.08.51-1140x760.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/WhatsApp-Image-2024-08-01-at-16.08.51-465x310.jpeg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/WhatsApp-Image-2024-08-01-at-16.08.51-620x413.jpeg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/WhatsApp-Image-2024-08-01-at-16.08.51-350x233.jpeg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/WhatsApp-Image-2024-08-01-at-16.08.51.jpeg 1600w\" /><figcaption>Thomas Maheux</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Of her victories, one that Muzic is most proud of was beating Demi Vollering (SD Worx-Protime) on Stage 6 of La Vuelta Femenina earlier this year. The day ended with the La Laguna Negra climb, which at 6.5km long suited Muzic perfectly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It’s funny, someone asked me before the race how I could beat Vollering. I said that I’ll try to follow her wheel. It’s easy to say, but it’s what I did that day. It was amazing. A dream to win. Especially a stage like this with a hard climb, ahead of Vollering. For me now, I have more confidence. I have beaten her once so I can do it again.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravel is another area where Muzic feels she could aim for stage victories, having come second on<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-femmes-2022-stage-4-gallery-reusser\" target=\"_blank\"> the gravel stage</a> at the inaugural Tour de France Femmes in 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Personally, I really love gravel. You need to be good on the day and have the ability to deal with punctures. In a Grand Tour, it’s always special.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"646\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Evita-Muzic-1-646x970.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Evita-Muzic-1-646x970.jpg 646w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Evita-Muzic-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Evita-Muzic-1-768x1153.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Evita-Muzic-1-1023x1536.jpg 1023w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Evita-Muzic-1-750x1126.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/Evita-Muzic-1.jpg 1066w\" /><figcaption>FDJ-Suez</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>With the Tour de France Femmes starting on 12th August, Muzic knows that as a French rider on a French team in a French race, all eyes will be on her. It’s a challenge she relishes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘If I had to choose between the Olympics or the Tour de France, it would be the Tour de France. It can be a lot of pressure, but I’ve learnt how to ride with it.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A stage victory at the Tour de France Femmes would complete the iconic Grand Tour triple, and there are two hilly stages at this year’s Tour that look perfect for Muzic, especially the one that finishes in Liège and which incorporates some of the short and punchy climbs that normally make up Amstel Gold Race and Liège-Bastogne-Liège.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However it’s not only in the stage races that she looks to win. One-day Classics races are on her mind too, such as Strade Bianche – one of her most anticipated races on the calendar – as well as La Flèche Wallonne and Liège-Bastogne-Liège. And her plans don’t end there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘When I was younger, my dream was to be the French Champion. I became the French Champion. Now, I want to be the World Champion too.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/olympics-2024-preview\">Paris 2024 Olympics Cycling: Events, schedule, TV guide and everything you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/back-where-it-belongs-inside-the-tour-de-france-femmes\">Back where it belongs: inside the Tour de France Femmes</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-femmes\">Tour de France Femmes 2024 route announced ft.
