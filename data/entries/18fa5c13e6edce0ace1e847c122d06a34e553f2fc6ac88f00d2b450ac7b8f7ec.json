Amid that black market, one such Chinese-language service on the messaging platform Telegram blossomed into an all-purpose underground bazaar: It has offered not only cash-out services to scammers but also money laundering for North Korean hackers, stolen data, targeted harassment-for-hire, and even what appears to be sex trafficking. And somehow, it's all overseen by a company legally registered in the United States.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.elliptic.co/blog/xinbi-guarantee\">new research</a> released today by crypto-tracing firm Elliptic, a company called Xinbi Guarantee has since 2022 facilitated no less than $8.4 billion in transactions via its Telegram-based marketplace prior to Telegram’s actions in recent days to remove its accounts from the platform. Money stolen from scam victims likely represents the “vast majority” of that sum, according to Elliptic's cofounder Tom Robinson. Yet even as the market serves Chinese-speaking scammers, it also boasts on the top of its website—in Mandarin—that it's registered in Colorado.</p>\n<p>“Xinbi Guarantee has served as a giant, purportedly US-incorporated illicit online marketplace for online scams that primarily offers money laundering services,” says Robinson. He adds, though, that Elliptic has also found a remarkable variety of other criminal offerings on the market: child-bearing surrogacy and egg donors, harassment services that offer to threaten or throw feces at any chosen victim, and even sex workers in their teens who are likely trafficking victims.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/incorporated-in-us-8-4b-money-launderer-for-chinese-speaking-crypto-scammers/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/incorporated-in-us-8-4b-money-launderer-for-chinese-speaking-crypto-scammers/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andy Greenberg, wired.com","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"18fa5c13e6edce0ace1e847c122d06a34e553f2fc6ac88f00d2b450ac7b8f7ec","category":"Tech"}
