But not today. Amazon’s Woot! has an amazing deal for Apple’s official Braided Solo loop bands, which <a href=\"https://electronics.woot.com/offers/apple-watch-braided-solo-loop-discovery-box-buy-1-band-get-1-free?ref=mwj_cd_deal_9\">lands you two for just $30</a>. These bands usually sell for $99 <em>each</em>, so you’re getting an incredible savings of $168 or 85 percent off!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The twist for this offer is that it’s a complete surprise which bands you’re actually getting. You just pick the size of the band and the size of the watch you want to use it with, and Woot will send you a pair of bands in two of 23 colors. They promise not to duplicate colors in boxes, so you’ll definitely have two bands to match multiple outfits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just note, it’s crucial to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/675111/new-apple-watch-straps-how-to-find-the-perfect-size.html\">get the Solo Loop size right</a> because it lacks a buckle for adjustments. Apple provides <a href=\"https://store.storeimages.cdn-apple.com/4982/store.apple.com/shop/Catalog/US/Images/bxxd/size-guide_US.pdf\">straightforward instructions</a> to help you determine your wrist size accurately, which requires printing out a set of instructions and cutting out a ruler. Additionally, keep in mind that there are two Solo Loop widths available, designed to correspond with your Apple Watch size (either 38mm/40mm/41mm/42mm Apple Watch models, or 44mm/45mm/46mm/49mm models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suffice to say this <a href=\"https://electronics.woot.com/offers/apple-watch-braided-solo-loop-discovery-box-buy-1-band-get-1-free?ref=mwj_cd_deal_9\">buy one and get one free offer for just $30</a> is a fantastic deal for an official Apple Watch. There’s a limit of three per customer, so you can get up to six colorful bands. Since this deal is on Woot, you’ll have to hurry up because it’s only available for a limited time (three days to go) or until sold out, whichever comes first.</p>\n\n\n<span>Buy one get one Apple Watch Braided Solo Loop band free</span><div><a href=\"https://electronics.woot.com/offers/apple-watch-braided-solo-loop-discovery-box-buy-1-band-get-1-free?ref=mwj_cd_deal_9\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now at Woot!</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"579053c6e53a4178bc827bdaf124852d8f215d8d8db8a54a80c64249c132ab79","category":"Apple"}
