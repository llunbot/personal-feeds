As part of the Republican Party's ongoing war against <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/nsf-director-resigns-amid-55-budget-cut-mass-layoffs-from-trump-admin/\">science</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/trump-admin-may-be-trying-to-sabotage-the-national-climate-assessment/\">the environment</a> under President Trump, committee chairperson Sam Graves (R-Mo.) has included some new annual fees that will cost all drivers some, but some drivers more.</p>\n<p>The Republicans plan to use the <a href=\"https://www.cbpp.org/research/introduction-to-budget-reconciliation\">budget reconciliation process</a> to pass this legislation, which is an expedited process that removes some of the US Senate's ability to stall. They're proposing a new annual federal motor vehicle registration fee, which state DMVs would have to collect and pass back to the federal government.</p>\n<p>If it passes, all battery EVs would be subject to a new $200 tax. Hybrids—defined as a vehicle that is propelled by both an electric motor and an internal combustion engine or other power source (which would include fuel cell EVs)—will pay $100. But someone who commutes 90 miles a day in a particulate-belching Ford F-350 Duramax diesel pickup truck gets away with a mere $20 a year, and only from October 1, 2030; until then they get to drive for free.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/republicans-want-to-tax-ev-drivers-200-year-in-new-transport-bill/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/republicans-want-to-tax-ev-drivers-200-year-in-new-transport-bill/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
