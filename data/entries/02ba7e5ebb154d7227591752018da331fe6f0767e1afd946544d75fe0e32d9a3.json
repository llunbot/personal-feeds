The Pro CF is equipped with what  Silverback calls POP geometry that uses a modified “Faux bar” suspension layout, “creating an enduro-ready, long-travel, 29” wheeled eBike” that is also 27.5″ wheel compatible.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Silverback-Bikes-S-Electro-Pro-CF-fork.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"444\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Silverback-Bikes-S-Electro-Pro-CF-fork-800x444.jpeg\" alt=\"Silverback Bikes S-Electro Pro CF fork\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Silverback-Bikes-S-Electro-Pro-CF-fork-800x444.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Silverback-Bikes-S-Electro-Pro-CF-fork-297x165.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Silverback-Bikes-S-Electro-Pro-CF-fork-120x67.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Silverback-Bikes-S-Electro-Pro-CF-fork-768x427.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Silverback-Bikes-S-Electro-Pro-CF-fork.jpeg 1280w\" /></a><figcaption>Optional fork for the Pro CF-2 </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Silverback-Bikes-S-Electro-Pro-CF-dropper.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"444\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Silverback-Bikes-S-Electro-Pro-CF-dropper-800x444.jpeg\" alt=\"Silverback Bikes S-Electro Pro CF dropper\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Silverback-Bikes-S-Electro-Pro-CF-dropper-800x444.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Silverback-Bikes-S-Electro-Pro-CF-dropper-297x165.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Silverback-Bikes-S-Electro-Pro-CF-dropper-120x67.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Silverback-Bikes-S-Electro-Pro-CF-dropper-768x427.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Silverback-Bikes-S-Electro-Pro-CF-dropper.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pro CF uses a carbon frame that includes full internal cable/hose routing. The Metric trunnion mount rear shock is custom tuned to work with the Pro CF’s suspension. They claim that the CF Pro has an efficient climbing platform when in climbing mode, switch it to open mode to get the bike set up as a “race-ready” descender.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Silverback-Bikes-S-Electro-Pro-CF-drive-system.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"444\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Silverback-Bikes-S-Electro-Pro-CF-drive-system-800x444.jpeg\" alt=\"Silverback Bikes S-Electro Pro CF drive system\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Silverback-Bikes-S-Electro-Pro-CF-drive-system-800x444.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Silverback-Bikes-S-Electro-Pro-CF-drive-system-297x165.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Silverback-Bikes-S-Electro-Pro-CF-drive-system-120x67.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Silverback-Bikes-S-Electro-Pro-CF-drive-system-768x427.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Silverback-Bikes-S-Electro-Pro-CF-drive-system.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p> The Shimano pedal-assist drive system makes getting your S-Electro Pro CF to the top of the trails much easier, saving your energy for the descents, and leaving the need for the chair lifts in the dust. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The S-Electro Pro-CF is powered by the Shimano EP8 electric motor. It’s paired with a 36v, 720Wh internal battery that charges to 80% in 3 hours.
