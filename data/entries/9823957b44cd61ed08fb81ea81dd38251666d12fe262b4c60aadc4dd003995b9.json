Mixpanel had previously indicated that<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/22/ios-15-adoption-mixpanel/\"> iOS 15's adoption was slower than iOS 14's release in the fall of last year</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple does release iOS adoption numbers but has yet done so for ‌iOS 15‌. <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/support/app-store/\">Apple's last publicly reported data</a> shows 85% of all devices running iOS 14 as of June 3, 2021. All devices that were compatible with iOS 14 remain compatible with updating to ‌iOS 15‌. However, customers on iOS 14 still <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/07/apple-wont-make-you-upgrade-to-ios-15/\">can continue to receive critical security updates without updating to the latest major iOS version</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nCompared to iOS 14, ‌iOS 15‌ remains a relatively modest update, focusing on providing users more controls over their notifications and updates to stock iOS apps, such as Safari. ‌iOS 15‌'s rollout has not been perfect, and users have reported several bugs that have mostly been patched in subsequent iOS updates.
