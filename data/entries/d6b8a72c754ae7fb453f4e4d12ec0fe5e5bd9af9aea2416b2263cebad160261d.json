The FTC's <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/complaint_ring.pdf\">lawsuit</a> in US District Court for the District of Columbia also alleged that Ring failed to promptly implement basic privacy and security protections, making it easier for hackers to take over customers' accounts and cameras. A <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/proposed_stipulated_order_ring.pdf\">settlement</a> that is pending a judge's approval would require Ring to pay $5.8 million for customer refunds, delete certain types of data, and implement privacy and security controls. Amazon did not admit any wrongdoing.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1943611#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1943611&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d6b8a72c754ae7fb453f4e4d12ec0fe5e5bd9af9aea2416b2263cebad160261d","category":"Tech"}
