A new article <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/inside-the-arms-race-between-youtube-and-ad-blockers-140031824.html\">from Engadget</a> detailing the \"arms race\" over ad blocking brings up an interesting point regarding the power that YouTube and Chrome have in this battle: a dramatic update advantage over the ad blockers.</p>\n<p>In addition to hamstringing Chrome's extension platform with no real user-centric justifications, Manifest V3 will also put roadblocks up before extension <em>updates</em>, which will delay an extension developer's ability to quickly respond to changes. YouTube can instantly switch up its ad delivery system, but once Manifest V3 becomes mandatory, that won't be true for extension developers. If ad blocking is a cat-and-mouse game of updates and counter-updates, then Google will force the mouse to slow down.</p>\n<p>Chrome's \"Manifest V3\" makes dramatic changes to the Chrome extension platform. The current platform, Manifest V2, has been around for over ten years and works just fine, but it's also quite powerful and allows extensions to have full filtering control over the traffic your web browser sees. That's great for protecting privacy, speeding up the web, and blocking ads, but it also means you can download a browser from the world's biggest ad company and use it to block ads—and that was only going to last for so long.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1987843#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1987843&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f612f3c053e77426924042181afe4c22fe76a9a4e12d2b2e8963d497f4e4b650","category":"Tech"}
