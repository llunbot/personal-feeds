But there wasn't really an engine for making a website, the thing you see when you visit the domain. Domains offered quick hook-ups to services like Shopify, Wix, and Squarespace. Now the last of those is set to take the whole business over, along with the roughly 10 million domains and the millions of customers behind them.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1948540#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1948540&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"44f7d14652c48b284fd89dadc89e1c59d967324bc08c74b1c8cef980f705b40b","category":"Tech"}
