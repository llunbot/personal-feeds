On a February 2024 earnings call, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company was working on generative AI and would <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-ai-details-coming-later-this-year/\">share details \"later this year.\"</a>\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/apple-generative-ai-features-and-smarter-siri/\">said</a> generative AI \"should improve how both Siri and the Messages app can field questions and auto-complete sentences.\" <em>The Information</em>'s Wayne Ma <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/06/ios-18-siri-improvements/\">said</a> Apple would incorporate large language models into Siri to let users automate complex tasks, a feature that would involve deeper integration with the Shortcuts app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGenerative AI surged in popularity in 2022 after OpenAI released ChatGPT, a chatbot that can respond to questions and other prompts. Google, Microsoft, and other companies have also released similar chatbots and tools, including ones that can automatically generate images, respond to voice queries, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSome generative AI features <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/iphone-16-exclusive-ai-features-ios-18/\">might be exclusive to iPhone 16 models</a>, which are rumored to have a Neural Engine with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/14/iphone-16-upgraded-neural-engine-rumor/\">\"significantly\" more cores</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>RCS Support in Messages App</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/General-Apps-Messages.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1407\" />\r<br />\nIn November 2023, Apple announced that it would <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-to-adopt-rcs-messaging-standard/\">support the cross-platform messaging standard RCS</a> in the Messages app on the iPhone starting \"later\" in 2024, so it will likely be an iOS 18 feature based on that timeframe.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRCS support should result in the following improvements to the default messaging experience between iPhones and Android devices:<ul>\r<br />\n <li>Higher-resolution photos and videos</li>\r<br />\n <li>Audio messages</li>\r<br />\n <li>Typing indicators</li>\r<br />\n <li>Read receipts</li>\r<br />\n <li>Wi-Fi messaging between iPhones and Android devices</li>\r<br />\n <li>Improved group chats, including the ability for iPhone users to leave a conversation that includes Android users</li>\r<br />\n <li>Improved encryption compared to SMS</li>\r<br />\n</ul>These modern features are already available for iPhone-to-iPhone conversations with blue bubbles, via iMessage, and many of the features are also available in third-party messaging apps, such as WhatsApp and Telegram. RCS support on the iPhone will extend the features to green bubbles in the Messages app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Biggest iOS Update Ever?</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/iOS-18-Mock-iPhone-16-Feature-Gray.jpg\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" />\r<br />\nApple believes iOS 18 has the potential to be the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/28/ios-18-big-expectations/\">\"biggest\" software update in the iPhone's history</a>, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"I'm told that the new operating system is seen within the company as one of the biggest iOS updates — if not the biggest — in the company's history,\" he wrote, in a January 2024 edition of <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-01-28/apple-eu-changes-sideloading-third-party-app-stores-are-future-of-the-iphone-lrxjzbg6\">his <em>Power On</em> newsletter</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>visionOS-Inspired Design Changes?</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/visionOS-design.jpeg\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1012\" />\r<br />\niOS 18 and iPadOS 18 will feature <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/09/ios-18-visionos-design-elements-rumor/\">visionOS-inspired design elements</a>, according to a rumor shared by Israeli website <em>The Verifier</em>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor example, the report claimed that the Apple TV app on iPadOS 18 will feature the same translucent navigation bar that was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/apple-tv-app-redesign-tvos-17-2/\">introduced in the tvOS 17.2 version of the app</a> in 2023.
