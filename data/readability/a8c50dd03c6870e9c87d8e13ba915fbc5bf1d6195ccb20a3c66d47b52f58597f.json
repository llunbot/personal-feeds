The Air-Liner Road increases the safety of tubeless-ready tires by locking the bead of the tire into the rim, reducing the likelihood of burping at the bead. It also cushions the tire and wheel from impacts and provides an additional tubeless set-up seal.</p></div></div>","author":"CyclingTips","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"a8c50dd03c6870e9c87d8e13ba915fbc5bf1d6195ccb20a3c66d47b52f58597f","category":"Cycling"}
