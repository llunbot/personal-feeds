Sure, the screen might make streaming a little more comfortable, but these days, many of those devices don’t even fit in our pockets or bags. Instead of lugging a tablet-sized smartphone around, <a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/nanophone-a-miniaturized-smartphone-packed-with-mega-features?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_content=PS-2384&amp;utm_medium=Referral&amp;utm_campaign=nanophone-a-miniaturized-smartphone-packed-with-mega-features-25-05-15&amp;utm_term=SALE-326842\" target=\"_blank\">consider switching to this mini smartphone</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The NanoPhone actually fits in your pocket—it’s smaller than a credit card—but comes with the same features the latest smartphones have. Grab this compact smartphone for only $89.97 (reg. $199) while inventory lasts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To answer your most pressing question, no, the NanoPhone doesn’t necessarily require you to get a new mobile plan. You can just insert the SIM card from your current phone, and it should work with your existing 4G carrier. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out some of this pocket smartphone’s features:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>A clear, responsive touchscreen with an intuitive interface for easy scrolling</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Built-in 5MP rear and 2MP front cameras allow for video chatting and photos on the go</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/nanophone-a-miniaturized-smartphone-packed-with-mega-features?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_content=PS-2384&amp;utm_medium=Referral&amp;utm_campaign=nanophone-a-miniaturized-smartphone-packed-with-mega-features-25-05-15&amp;utm_term=SALE-326842\" target=\"_blank\">Dual SIM card support so you can use two numbers</a> from the NanoPhone</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Storage for your apps, photos, and files, which is expandable with Micro-SD</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Why settle for an oversized smartphone when this mini one offers all the same features you know and love, minus the bulky design?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get the <a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/nanophone-a-miniaturized-smartphone-packed-with-mega-features?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_content=PS-2384&amp;utm_medium=Referral&amp;utm_campaign=nanophone-a-miniaturized-smartphone-packed-with-mega-features-25-05-15&amp;utm_term=SALE-326842\" target=\"_blank\">NanoPhone now for $89.97 and save 55%</a> on this credit card-sized smartphone before supplies run out—there are less than 50 units in stock!</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://cdnp1.stackassets.com/7ea978d1768674b1afc520f9d0a54e55c1b89551/store/aa08e68111ae4f3075bafd6b1fe8852fda344a86b8ef6b4b40e55e50c812/sale_326842_article_image.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>NanoPhone – A Miniaturized Smartphone Packed with Mega Features!<a href=\"https://shop.macworld.com/sales/nanophone-a-miniaturized-smartphone-packed-with-mega-features?utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_content=PS-2384&amp;utm_medium=Referral&amp;utm_campaign=nanophone-a-miniaturized-smartphone-packed-with-mega-features-2025-05-21&amp;utm_term=SALE-326842\" target=\"_blank\">See Deal</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.stacksocial.com/?utm_content=PS-2384&amp;utm_source=macworld.com&amp;utm_medium=Referral\"><em>StackSocial</em></a><em> prices subject to change.</em></p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"c14a10872e4a3641131919087ea7514ef1af7d5b8542e9eb2115d9a480a5a5c6","category":"Apple"}
