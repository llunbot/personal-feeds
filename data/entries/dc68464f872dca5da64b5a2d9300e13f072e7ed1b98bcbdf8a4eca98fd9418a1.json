SBG has presence throughout Africa and this hybrid conference was attended by almost 2,000 engineers from across the continent. It was amazing to reconnect with long-time friends and former colleagues, and to make new friends.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/06/17/sbg7.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/06/17/sbg7-1024x768.jpg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /></a></p> \n<p><span><strong>Last week’s launches</strong></span><br /> Here are some launches that got my attention during the previous week.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-adds-passkey-multi-factor-authentication-mfa-for-root-and-iam-users/\">Passkey multi-factor authentication (MFA) for root and IAM users</a> – We’ve added passkeys to the list of supported <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_mfa.html\">multi-factor authentication (MFA)</a> for your root and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/iam/\">AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)</a> users, to give you the convenience of use and easy recoverability. A passkey is a pair of cryptographic keys generated on your client device when you register for a service or a website. Passkeys can be used to replace passwords. However, for this initial release, we choose to use passkeys as a second factor authentication, in addition to your password.</p> \n<p>Amazon GuardDuty Malware Protection for Amazon S3 – At <a href=\"https://reinforce.awsevents.com/\">AWS re:Inforce 2024</a> this past week, we announced general availability of Amazon GuardDuty Malware Protection for <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/\">Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)</a>. This is an expansion of GuardDuty Malware Protection to detect malicious file uploads to selected S3 buckets. Benefits include the ability to fully manage malware detection without managing compute infrastructure, and coverage summary for all protected buckets in your organization, to name a few. Read more in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-amazon-guardduty-malware-protection-for-amazon-s3/\">the post published last week detailing Amazon GuardDuty Malware Protection for Amazon S3</a>.</p> \n<p>IAM Access Analyzer Update – More goodness out of AWS re:Inforce 2024 last week! We announced an IAM Access Analyzer Update, which allows you to extend custom policy checks and also includes a guided revocation. This gives you guidance that you can share with your developers so that they can revoke unneeded permissions. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/iam-access-analyzer-update-extending-custom-policy-checks-guided-revocation/\">My colleague Jeff Barr writes about it in more detail in this post</a>.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Other AWS news</strong></span><br /> AWS open source news and updates – My colleague <a href=\"https://twitter.com/094459\">Ricardo</a> writes <a href=\"https://community.aws/content/2hgOKawTtLBR1DJjBa8KlLPTVio/aws-open-source-newsletter-199\">this weekly open source newsletter</a> in which he highlights new open source projects, tools, and demos from the AWS Community.</p> \n<p>The .Net developer community remains close to our hearts here at AWS. I’m inspired by my colleagues <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandon-minnick/\">Brandon Minnick</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/francoisbouteruche/\">Francois Bouteruche</a> who support this community, <a href=\"https://community.aws/content/2gYi0ezjVtwKEFBmXybmRF3Etx5/the-net-on-aws-show-featuring-david-fowler-and-norm-johanson\">resulting in the AWS and the Azure engineering teams working together</a> to create delightful .NET developer experiences. At the recently held <a href=\"https://ndcoslo.com/\">NDC Oslo,</a> which is part of the NDC Conferences hosted around the world, VP of Azure Developer Experience, Scott Hunter, talked about this collaboration during his keynote.
