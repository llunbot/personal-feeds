The young brand has been the new kid on the luxury automaker block, contending with the challenge of competing with 100-year-old legacy manufacturers who have long set the bar for extravagance while trying to distinguish itself as something unique.</p>\n<p>Regarding the latter, Genesis bets on its core principles of being audacious, progressive, and distinctly Korean to give its offering enough pop in contrast to the traditionally stuffy European fare. The GV70 Electrified is the latest move to that end, delivering a battery-electric vehicle version of its bold-styled crossover vehicle that's no mere drivetrain swap.

There are a handful of notable differences between the two versions, not the least of which is their points of origin. As mentioned, the GV70 Electrified is the first Genesis brand vehicle to roll off the assembly line at Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama or HMMA, the parent company's plant located in Montgomery, Alabama.
