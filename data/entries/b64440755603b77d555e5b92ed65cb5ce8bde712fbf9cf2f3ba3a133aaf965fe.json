{"title":"The Sound of Software","link":"https://www.notboring.software/words/the-sound-of-software","date":1715381847000,"content":"\n<p>Andy Allen and Thomas Williams, from Not Boring:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Sound is an outcast in Software Design. We may embrace the\naesthetics of animation and visuals, but sound is different. It’s\nintrusive. Unlike visuals on a screen, you can’t look away or\nignore it. It’s enough to make you rip the batteries out of a toy\nor frisbee an iPad across the room (speaking from experience).</p>\n\n<p>And yet, play a video game without sound and its powerful punch\nlands with no force. Without music, once moving moments in a film\nbecome dull, even comical (Jurassic Park, Rocky). Sound holds an\nimmense power to elevate any experience — including the most\nboring of software.</p>\n\n<p>Sound in software isn’t inherently bad. It’s just been really\nbadly designed.</p>\n\n<p>We use sound in every !Boring app, and many have called it out as\none of their favorite aspects of our apps. We’ve learned a few\nthings about when to use sound, how to design it, and how to\nimplement it. When done right, sound unlocks a path to much richer\nsoftware experiences.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Previously:</strong> “<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/06/15/worlds-most-satisfying-checkbox\">The World’s Most Satisfying Checkbox</a>”.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/05/10/the-sound-of-software\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b64440755603b77d555e5b92ed65cb5ce8bde712fbf9cf2f3ba3a133aaf965fe","category":"Tech"}
