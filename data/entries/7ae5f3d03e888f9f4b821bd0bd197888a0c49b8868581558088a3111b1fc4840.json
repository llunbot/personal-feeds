DetailsPro brings SwiftUI to designers working on Apple platforms. (What a perfect week for a developer/designer tool to sponsor DF.) Without writing a line of code, you can bring your next idea to life in SwiftUI right from your iPhone. Design apps for the iPhone, on your iPhone. Or use it on your iPad or Mac.</p>\n\n<p>DetailsPro has an easy, approachable interface, built-in templates, and a community of designers who share files. It is very easily to get started — you’ll be up and running in minutes. Designs in DetailsPro are 1:1 SwiftUI, so you can export to Xcode at any time. Intuitive features like side-by-side Dark Mode preview and Repeating Elements — a <em>huge</em> timesaver — use the smarts of SwiftUI to make the process enjoyable.</p>\n\n<p>DetailsPro is available for iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Vision Pro. DetailsPro is so good and so fun it makes me want to come up with ideas for new apps just to have an excuse to use it. Download it now and give it a try — it’s free forever up to five files, and very reasonably priced for a professional tool.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/16/detailspro\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"7ae5f3d03e888f9f4b821bd0bd197888a0c49b8868581558088a3111b1fc4840","category":"Tech"}
