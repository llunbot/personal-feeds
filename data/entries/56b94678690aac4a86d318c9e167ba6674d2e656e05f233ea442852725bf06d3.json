This is the case with Bitdefender Antivirus for Mac which includes Bitdefender VPN for real-time antiviral and anti-malware protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitdefender Antivirus for Mac is easy to download, install, and assign full drive permissions to as needed. As is the case with most antiviral suites, Bitdefender Antivirus for Mac offers a speedy Quick Scan mode with which to perform a quick overview and locate, quarantine, and remove viral candidates within a few minutes as well as a Full Scan mode, which looks over every possible file on your hard drive and in my case took almost 19 hours for a full scan. To its credit, Bitdefender Antivirus for Mac’s full scan feature ran well in the background and could be minimized to allow other work to be done while the process runs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>External volumes such as USB flash drives can be dragged and dropped into the application window or the Dock icon to begin a scan, which comes in handy. Other features include easily protected files/whitelist creation and a helpful web portal that acts as an overview of your Bitdefender accounts, features, and allows for remote scanning on installed devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Performance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Bitdefender Shield real-time protection feature dovetails nicely with <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668710/how-secure-mac.html\">macOS’ Gatekeeper feature</a>, and there isn’t much in the way of malware that gets by it. Still, when we disabled Bitdefender Shield, rebooted the Mac, and installed malware, we were in for a mixed bag in terms of the application’s ability to locate and neutralize malware that was already on the system. While the program caught and disabled eight pieces of malware, it missed four significant pieces of malware within the OSX.Backdoor.Adwind, OXS.DazzleSpy, and OSX.EvilEgg packages, and left questionable installed applications such as the controversial Wave web browser and an infected copy of Adobe Flash Player in place.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender4.png?w=1200\" alt=\"A quick overview of detected malware in the Quarantine window\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender4.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1824w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender4.png?resize=300%2C195&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender4.png?resize=768%2C499&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender4.png?resize=1200%2C779&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender4.png?resize=1536%2C997&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"779\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption><br />A quick overview of detected malware in the Quarantine window.</figcaption>\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"A quick overview of detected malware in the Quarantine window\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender4.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1824w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender4.png?resize=300%2C195&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender4.png?resize=768%2C499&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender4.png?resize=1200%2C779&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender4.png?resize=1536%2C997&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"779\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><br />A quick overview of detected malware in the Quarantine window.</figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"A quick overview of detected malware in the Quarantine window\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender4.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1824w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender4.png?resize=300%2C195&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender4.png?resize=768%2C499&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender4.png?resize=1200%2C779&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender4.png?resize=1536%2C997&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"779\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><br />A quick overview of detected malware in the Quarantine window.</figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>macOS’ Gatekeeper and the Bitdefender Shield kept the lion’s share of questionable software out, but once these defenses were bypassed and the malware was installed, Bitdefender Antivirus for Mac missed several items on its sweep, which had to be removed with a separate program, which raises eyebrows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While most of this works well, there are caveats to consider. Beyond the malware samples it missed, Bitdefender Antivirus froze twice after a scan found a piece of malware. This issue resolved itself after turning the Bitdefender Shield feature on and rebooting the Mac, but it seemed a strange requirement in the first place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with several other security suites, Bitdefender Antivirus for Mac offers anti-phishing protection in the form of web browser extensions for the Safari, Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox web browsers. These offered varying degrees of success, and once again, I tapped into my Gmail’s Spam folder to see what kind of protection these browser extensions afforded me. Under Safari, Bitdefender Antivirus for Mac offered no prominent phishing protection, allowing me to visit questionable websites with no warning whatsoever. This proved better under the Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox extensions, which stopped me from visiting questionable websites with a warning but still permitted me to click through and visit the website anyway.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender5_7da2c4.png?w=1200\" alt=\"A blocked website via Bitdefender’s Total Defense web browser extension feature\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender5_7da2c4.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2562w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender5_7da2c4.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender5_7da2c4.png?resize=768%2C446&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender5_7da2c4.png?resize=1200%2C696&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender5_7da2c4.png?resize=1536%2C892&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender5_7da2c4.png?resize=2048%2C1189&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"696\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption><br />A blocked website via Bitdefender’s Total Defense web browser extension feature.</figcaption>\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"A blocked website via Bitdefender’s Total Defense web browser extension feature\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender5_7da2c4.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2562w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender5_7da2c4.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender5_7da2c4.png?resize=768%2C446&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender5_7da2c4.png?resize=1200%2C696&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender5_7da2c4.png?resize=1536%2C892&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender5_7da2c4.png?resize=2048%2C1189&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"696\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><br />A blocked website via Bitdefender’s Total Defense web browser extension feature.</figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"A blocked website via Bitdefender’s Total Defense web browser extension feature\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender5_7da2c4.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2562w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender5_7da2c4.png?resize=300%2C174&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender5_7da2c4.png?resize=768%2C446&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender5_7da2c4.png?resize=1200%2C696&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender5_7da2c4.png?resize=1536%2C892&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender5_7da2c4.png?resize=2048%2C1189&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"696\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><br />A blocked website via Bitdefender’s Total Defense web browser extension feature.</figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitdefender Antivirus for Mac offers an anti-tracker for web browsers and access to a VPN depending on your subscription. Where basic functionality is concerned, Bitdefender VPN represents a viable VPN client that handles creating a secure connection that can be routed through assorted global locations with ease. This was readily tested by logging into a Canadian server to binge bad reality shows not available in the United States, and a friendly interface takes some of the fear out of using a VPN client for the first time. The application offers ad and tracker blocking, which comes in handy, along with an overall Kill-Switch feature, which closes down all internet traffic if a connection is lost. Take a look at our recommendations of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/231047/best-vpn-for-mac.html\">best VPNs on Mac</a> if you’d like to find a VPN to suit you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there was one thing that truly might raise your hackles, it’s the fact that the Bitdefender VPN program that is bundled with Bitdefender Antivirus only allows for 200 megabytes of data per day to be used. After that, it encourages you to upgrade to the full version, which costs $34.99/£29.99 a year for the first year (then $69.99/£59.99 per year). This feels like a veritable gut punch, and while Bitdefender VPN is a good, no-frills VPN client, trial sessions exist for a reason and Bitdefender’s competitors have long since figured out how to offer a genuine free session with which to make up your mind as to whether this is the VPN client for you.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender6.png?w=1200\" alt=\"Bitdefender’s VPN program advising you to upgrade\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender6.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1790w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender6.png?resize=300%2C216&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender6.png?resize=768%2C552&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender6.png?resize=1200%2C863&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender6.png?resize=1536%2C1104&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"863\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption><br />Bitdefender’s VPN program advising you to upgrade now once your trial allotment of 200 megabytes of data per day has run out.</figcaption>\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Bitdefender’s VPN program advising you to upgrade\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender6.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1790w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender6.png?resize=300%2C216&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender6.png?resize=768%2C552&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender6.png?resize=1200%2C863&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender6.png?resize=1536%2C1104&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"863\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><br />Bitdefender’s VPN program advising you to upgrade now once your trial allotment of 200 megabytes of data per day has run out.</figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Bitdefender’s VPN program advising you to upgrade\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender6.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1790w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender6.png?resize=300%2C216&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender6.png?resize=768%2C552&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender6.png?resize=1200%2C863&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Bitdefender6.png?resize=1536%2C1104&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"863\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><br />Bitdefender’s VPN program advising you to upgrade now once your trial allotment of 200 megabytes of data per day has run out.</figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Price</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The software currently retails at “50% off” which is <a href=\"https://bitdefender.f9tmep.net/c/321564/278689/4466?subId1=1-1-234655-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.bitdefender.com/solutions/antivirus-for-mac.html\">$19.99</a> / <a href=\"https://bitdefender.f9tmep.net/c/321564/278689/4466?subId1=1-1-234655-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.bitdefender.co.uk/solutions/antivirus-for-mac.html\" target=\"_blank\">£14.99</a> a year for one Mac (it’s then $39.99/£29.99 a year), but the deal prices change often.

It covers five devices, including Macs, Windows, Android and iOS. As with the standard Antivirus for Mac solution, there is a 30-day trial available.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Verdict</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bitdefender Antivirus for Mac offers a handy, customizable user interface, good features and combines well with macOS’ Gatekeeper feature, but still allows a fair amount of malware to slip through under the right circumstances. This, combined with occasional freezing, minimal anti-phishing protection for its Safari web browser extension, and a VPN client that all-too-readily pushes for the user to upgrade to the tune of $34.99/£29.99 a year feels as if the software is tugging at your leg for you to buy it. Under most circumstances, Bitdefender Antivirus for Mac should work fine for most users and the fact that it supports Macs from macOS 10.10 (Yosemite) is to its credit, but there are still some rough edges to consider, and these can’t be ignored.</p>\n\nAntivirus, MacOS, Security Software and Services</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"56b94678690aac4a86d318c9e167ba6674d2e656e05f233ea442852725bf06d3","category":"Apple"}
