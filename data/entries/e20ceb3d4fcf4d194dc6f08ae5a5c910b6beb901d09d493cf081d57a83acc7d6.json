That meant that searches from Microsoft's Edge browsers that had yet to change their default providers didn't work. It also meant that services relying on Bing's search API—Microsoft's own Copilot, ChatGPT search, Yahoo, Ecosia, and DuckDuckGo—similarly failed.</p>\n<p>Services were largely restored by the morning Eastern work hours, but the timing feels apt, concerning, or some combination of the two. Google, the <a href=\"https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share\">consistently dominating search platform</a>, just last week <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/search/generative-ai-google-search-may-2024/\">announced</a> and debuted <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/google-is-reimagining-search-in-the-gemini-era-with-improved-ai-options/\">AI Overviews as a default addition to all searches</a>. If you don't want an AI response but still want to use Google, you can hunt down <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/google-search-adds-web-filter-as-it-pivots-to-ai-focused-search-results/\">the new \"Web\" option</a> in a menu, or you can, <a href=\"https://tedium.co/2024/05/17/google-web-search-make-default/\">per Ernie Smith</a>, tack \"&amp;udm=14\" onto your search or use Smith's own <a href=\"https://udm14.com/\">\"Konami code\" shortcut page</a>.</p>\n<p>If dismay about AI's hallucinations, power draw, or <a href=\"https://www.404media.co/google-is-paying-reddit-60-million-for-fucksmith-to-tell-its-users-to-eat-glue/\">pizza recipes</a> concern you—along with perhaps broader Google issues involving privacy, tracking, news, SEO, or monopoly power—most of your other major options were brought down by a single API outage this morning. Moving past that kind of single point of vulnerability will take some work, both by the industry and by you, the person wondering if there's a real alternative.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026559#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2026559&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e20ceb3d4fcf4d194dc6f08ae5a5c910b6beb901d09d493cf081d57a83acc7d6","category":"Tech"}
