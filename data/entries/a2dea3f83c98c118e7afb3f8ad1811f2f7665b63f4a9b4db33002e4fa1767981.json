In it, he was\nextremely critical of the administration’s effort to undo some of\nXinis’ recent orders in the case, sounding alarm bells about how\nits maneuverings in the matter have resulted in the two branches\n“grinding irrevocably against one another in a conflict that\npromises to diminish both.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Quoting <a href=\"https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25900477/25-1404-ruling.pdf\">from Wilkinson’s order</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is difficult in some cases to get to the very heart of the\nmatter. But in this case, it is not hard at all. The government is\nasserting a right to stash away residents of this country in\nforeign prisons without the semblance of due process that is the\nfoundation of our constitutional order. Further, it claims in\nessence that because it has rid itself of custody that there is\nnothing that can be done.</p>\n\n<p>This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive\nsense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still\nhold dear.</p>\n\n<p>The government asserts that Abrego Garcia is a terrorist and a\nmember of MS-13. Perhaps, but perhaps not. Regardless, he is still\nentitled to due process. If the government is confident of its\nposition, it should be assured that position will prevail in\nproceedings to terminate the withholding of removal order.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>No minced words. No equivocation. No histrionics either. Just calling it like it is. More like this, please. This needs to be faced head-on, with plain language.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/18/federal-appeals-court-trump-lawlessness\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"a2dea3f83c98c118e7afb3f8ad1811f2f7665b63f4a9b4db33002e4fa1767981","category":"Tech"}
