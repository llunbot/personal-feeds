Dubbed simply <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MJWY3AM/A/magsafe-battery-pack\">the \"MagSafe Battery Pack</a>,\" it costs $99 on Apple's online store.</p>\n<p>MagSafe is a new feature (with an old name) for the iPhone 12 lineup. Supported phones contain magnets on the back that can be used to attach accessories, including this one. Here, MagSafe ensures that the charger and the iPhone's charging coils are properly aligned.</p>\n<p>The battery pack charges the iPhone at 5 W while unplugged or 15 W while plugged in. If we're deciphering Apple's ad copy accurately, the MagSafe Battery Pack itself can be charged at up to 15 W. But when the pack is attached to an iPhone and you charge both simultaneously, you can charge at 20 W.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1779880#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1779880&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"da2a2ca0c9435996fda1b58bf9f34855e95a453de80e3bfd39ea5b00c9e1142a","category":"Tech"}
