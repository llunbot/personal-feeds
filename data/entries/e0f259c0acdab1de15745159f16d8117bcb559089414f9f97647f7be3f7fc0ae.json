{"title":"[Sponsor] Warp — Your Terminal, Reimagined","link":"https://www.warp.dev/?source=df2","date":1690851011000,"content":"\n<p>Warp is a modern, Rust-based terminal with AI built in so you and your team can build great software, faster.</p>\n\n<p>Edit your commands like in an IDE, with selections, autosuggestions, and completion menus. Generate commands from natural language using AI so you don’t have to context switch to Google anymore. Navigate through your terminal output command-by-command instead of scrolling through a wall of text.</p>\n\n<p>And with the newly released Warp Drive, there’s a secure place to save your commands as workflows so you can annotate, share, and execute them on-demand.</p>\n\n<p>Warp works with bash, zsh, and fish and requires zero config. Warp is available today on Mac.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/2023/07/warp_your_terminal_reimagined\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"Daring Fireball Department of Commerce","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"e0f259c0acdab1de15745159f16d8117bcb559089414f9f97647f7be3f7fc0ae","category":"Tech"}
