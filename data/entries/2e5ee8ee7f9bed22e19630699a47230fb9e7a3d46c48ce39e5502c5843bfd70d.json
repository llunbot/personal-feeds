While gravel bikes used to be jacks of all trades, many bike brands now offer multiple models to suit different uses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At <em>Cyclist</em>, we’ve ridden and reviewed many of the best <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/bikes/gravel-adventure-and-cyclocross\" target=\"_blank\">gravel bikes</a> on offer and here we have picked our favourites, but if you’re looking for something different, you can be pretty sure to find a review on our site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The gravel bike spectrum now divides into multiple target markets. Gravel racing has really taken off, particularly in the USA. A gravel race bike has much in common with a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-all-round-road-race-bikes\" target=\"_blank\">road race bike</a>, with aerodynamics as important for the off-road racer as the road racer. At the other end of the spectrum, adventure gravel bikes offer wide tyre clearance,<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-gravel-gearing-how-to-get-lower-gears\" target=\"_blank\"> low gearing</a> and the option to load up for multi-day <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/an-introduction-to-bikepacking\" target=\"_blank\">bikepacking</a> rides. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many gravel rides take in at least some tarmac and many road riders want to be able to take in light off-road to vary the riding, see somewhere different and link up their road riding in unfamiliar ways. It’s spawned a new category of<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-all-road-bikes\" target=\"_blank\"> all-road bikes</a>. They’re among the<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-road-bike\" target=\"_blank\"> best road bikes</a>, offering wider tyre clearance and the handling to tackle less technical gravel surfaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, while carbon bikes predominate, don’t discount metal gravel bikes. Whether alloy, steel or <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-titanium-bikes-reviewed\" target=\"_blank\">titanium</a>, they provide a durable alternative to carbon and often offer features that mainstream carbon gravel bikes don’t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve covered all these gravel bike categories in this buyer’s guide to the best gravel bikes. Meanwhile, if you need help deciding, read our guide to what to look for in a gravel bike, lower down the page.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Reviews of the best gravel bikes</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Best gravel race bikes</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>BMC Kaius 01 Three: RRP £5,699 – <strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/bmc-kaius-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Canyon Grail CF SLX 8 Di2:</strong> <strong>RRP £5,149 –</strong> <strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/canyon-grail-cf-slx-8-di2-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cervélo Áspero:</strong> <strong>RRP £3,399 –</strong> <strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/cervelo-aspero-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Factor Ostro Gravel: RRP £8,430 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/factor-ostro-gravel-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Best adventure gravel bikes</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>3T Exploro Ultra:</strong> <strong>RRP £5,099 – <strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/3t-exploro-ultra-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></strong></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cannondale Topstone Carbon 2 L:<a href=\"https://tidd.ly/3RXGKoy\" target=\"_blank\"> </a>RRP £4,500 – <strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/cannondale-topstone-carbon-2-l-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Canyon Grizl CF SL 8:</strong> <strong>RRP £2,999 – <strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/canyon-grizl-gravel-bike\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Specialized Diverge STR Expert:</strong> <strong>RRP £7,500 –<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-sworks-diverge-str-review\" target=\"_blank\"> <strong>Read our full review</strong></a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Best metal gravel bikes</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Enigma Esker:</strong> <strong>RRP £3,799 (frameset) – <strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/enigma-esker-gravel-bike-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Mason Bokeh:</strong> <strong>RRP £3,300 – <strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/mason-bokeh-3-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Moots Routt RSL:</strong> <strong>£7,900 (frameset) – <strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/moots-routt-rsl-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></strong></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Singular Kite Titanium:</strong> <strong>RRP £2,500 (frameset) – <strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/singular-kite-titanium-gravel-bike-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Best all-road bikes</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Colnago C68 Allroad: £5,999 (frameset) – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/colnago-c68-allroad-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Enve Fray: RRP £5,500 (frameset) – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/enve-fray-road-bike-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>FiftyOne Sika: RRP £4,499 (frameset) – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/fiftyone-sika-road-bike-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Giant Defy Advanced SL 0: RRP £10,349 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/giant-defy-advanced-sl-0-2024-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>How we test and why you should trust our advice</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/12/05222532/fiftyone_assassin_review_02-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"fiftyone_assassin_review_02\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With almost every manufacturer now offering at least one of these incredibly capable mixed-terrain bikes in their ranges, we’ve been hard at work riding as many of them as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every gravel bike featured here has been put to the test on a variety of terrain by our team of expert reviewers, overseen by tech editor <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/authors/sam-challis\" target=\"_blank\">Sam Challis</a>.

Gone are the double-decker handlebars, replaced by bars with a slight drop to put you in a more aero ride position and frame profiles also now have an aero edge. The bars also include a ‘Gear Grove’, so you can fit extensions or other add-ons. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s internal frame storage and the frame still offers a decent range of fixing points. Canyon sells a Fidlock frame bag to fit inside the front of the triangle, which it says makes the Grail even more aero and removeable ‘Fork Sleeves’ add bosses if you do want to load up. As with all Canyon’s bikes, the spec of the bike we tested was good, with (now 12-speed) Shimano GRX Di2 and DT Swiss carbon wheels and the 8.5kg weight is competitive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We found the Grail surefooted on trickier technical terrain, holding a line well over sloppy, rutted paths. Hit a tarmac or faster gravel section and the Grail is fast too. It’s a stiff ride though, which we put down to the frame, the aero carbon seatpost ported from the Ultimate road bike and the 42mm deep carbon wheelset. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/canyon-grail-cf-slx-8-di2-review\" target=\"_blank\">Canyon Grail CF SLX 8 Di2 review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://www.canyon.com/en-gb/gravel-bikes/performance/grail/cf-slx/grail-cf-slx-8-di2/3793.html\" target=\"_blank\">Canyon (£4,869)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Cervélo Áspero</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/03/07094345/cervelo_aspero_review_pics_01_crop-970x518.jpg\" alt=\"cervelo_aspero_review_pics_01_crop\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>£3,100 | <a href=\"https://tidd.ly/4aM7sWN\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Variable fork offset for consistent handling on 700c and 650b wheels</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Low weight and fast riding</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Cervélo is known for making fast road bikes and the off-road Cervélo Áspero is almost equally speedy. Marketed with the slogan ‘haul ass, not cargo’, it’s unashamedly racy. Of course, this doesn’t mean you couldn’t strap bikepacking bags to it, and there’s even a mount for a snack box on the top tube.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you want to go out and win yourself some gravel races, this is the sort of bike that will help you do so. With a low frame weight and nippy handling, it’s literally and figuratively head-down in its approach to riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This balance is kept stable whatever tyres you use thanks to something Cervélo calls the ‘Trail Mixer’. Allowing the fork offset to be adjusted to maintain consistent handling, it permits the Áspero to work with 700c or 650b gravel wheelsets or slick road tyres.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/cervelo-aspero-review\" target=\"_blank\">Cervélo Áspero review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div><br /></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Factor Ostro Gravel</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/11/02141420/factor-ostro-gravel-1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"factor-ostro-gravel-1\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/11/02141420/factor-ostro-gravel-1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/11/02141420/factor-ostro-gravel-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/11/02141420/factor-ostro-gravel-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/11/02141420/factor-ostro-gravel-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/11/02141420/factor-ostro-gravel-1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/11/02141420/factor-ostro-gravel-1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/11/02141420/factor-ostro-gravel-1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/11/02141420/factor-ostro-gravel-1-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/11/02141420/factor-ostro-gravel-1.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>£8,430 | <a href=\"https://viresvelo.com/factor/ostro-gravel/\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lightweight, rigid and sharp-handling</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Floats over obstacles at higher speeds, but feels firm at lower speeds on more technical terrain</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Aimed at the pointy end of gravel riding, the Ostro Gravel carries over Factor’s performance road bike design to off-road riding. Based on the previous generation Ostro VAM road bike, the Ostro Gravel offers aerodynamics tuned for off-road riding speeds and 45mm tyres.

The third iteration of 3T’s popular but controversial aero gravel bike, the Exploro Ultra has been shaped to work best with wide 650b tyres around 55mm-61mm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Made for the most technical and therefore slowest terrain, the Ultra’s aero benefits are most likely to pay dividends on the rarer occasions it’s used on the road. At the same time, it utilises its big tyres to override the framesets’ otherwise aggressive attributes once off-road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other radical features include a dropper post and a super-wide single-ring drivetrain. So how does it add up? It’s undoubtedly the most exaggerated example of how designer Gerard Vroomen can successfully squish together two typically disparate drop-bar genres – aero and gravel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leveraging the transformative effect of tyre size and pressure, the Ultra switches personalities as extremely as it mixes genres. Off-road, its chunky Vittoria tyres offset the harshness of the aero frame and allowed it to take on technical terrain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet back on the tarmac, the frame’s attributes become more dominant, leaving it feeling far more like a quick road bike than its off-road capability would otherwise suggest.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/3t-exploro-ultra-review\" target=\"_blank\">3T Exploro Ultra review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Cannondale Topstone Carbon 2L</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/cannondale-topstone-carbon-1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Cannondale Topstone Carbon gravel bike\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/cannondale-topstone-carbon-1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/cannondale-topstone-carbon-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/cannondale-topstone-carbon-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/cannondale-topstone-carbon-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/cannondale-topstone-carbon-1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/cannondale-topstone-carbon-1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/cannondale-topstone-carbon-1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/cannondale-topstone-carbon-1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/cannondale-topstone-carbon-1-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/cannondale-topstone-carbon-1.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Lizzie Crabb</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>£4,500 | <a href=\"https://tidd.ly/3B6HyAS\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Confident handling, with Kingpin rear suspension adding comfort</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Around 500g added to the bike’s weight from SmartSense lighting</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Topstone Carbon offers 30mm of travel at the rear thanks to the Kingpin rear triangle design and Cannondale sells specs with its Lefty suspension fork too, adding yet more ride comfort and control over rough ground.

At the extremes, gravel race bikes are very different from the most adventure-focussed gravel bikes, so if you want to race or you want to load up for off-grid adventures, there’s a gravel bike for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravel race bikes often sacrifice tyre clearance in favour of speed, a gravel race bike may have higher gearing for faster riding and in many cases the frame will have a firm ride for off-road performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adventure gravel bike, on the other hand, may be set up with wide, grippy tyres that feel a little slow on road and offer low gears that are great for off-road conditions but may cause you to spin out on faster sections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately if you’re not sure, there are still plenty of all-rounder gravel bikes available which offer good tyre clearance and the mounts you need for bikepacking. If you want to mix off-road with tarmac, meanwhile, an all-road bike might be the best choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Do I want one or two chainrings?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravel bikes are often offered with a choice of single chainring (1x) or double chainrings (2x). 1x has the advantage of mechanical simplicity. It also usually increases tyre clearance and reduces the risk of clogging. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-gravel-gearing-how-to-get-lower-gears\" target=\"_blank\">gear range</a> offered by 1x may be lower than 2x (although some of the widest ratio options are 1x). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although theoretically you get half the number of gear ratios, in practice a 2x groupset has several overlapping gear ratios between the two chainrings. As the number of speeds offered now stretches to 12 or 13, the jumps between ratios with a 1x setup may not be that great, particularly in the mid-range in which most riding takes place.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Electronic or mechanical shifting?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Both Shimano and SRAM now offer a choice between mechanical and electronic shifting in their<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/gravel-bike-groupsets\" target=\"_blank\"> gravel bike groupset </a>ranges, although <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/campagnolo-ekar-groupset-review\" target=\"_blank\">Campagnolo Ekar</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/campagnolo-ekar-gt-groupset-review\" target=\"_blank\">Ekar GT </a>remain mechanical only.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Electronic shifting is less prone to contamination than mechanical shifting, so you should get more precise shifting with less fettling required. It’s also more configurable if you want to fine-tune your shifter behaviour. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, you need to keep the derailleur batteries powered up and electronic groupsets are usually significantly more expensive than mechanical. Components for electronic groupsets are more expensive than those for mechanical ones, particularly the vulnerable rear derailleur.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Why choose hydraulic disc brakes?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Disc brakes are standard on gravel bikes, but in lower priced bikes there’s often a choice between cable-operated and hydraulic systems. As with mechanical groupsets, cable disc brakes are more prone to contamination and performance degradation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-cyclist-guide-to-road-bike-disc-brakes\" target=\"_blank\">Hydraulic disc brakes</a> usually offer more powerful braking and more modulation, although they need to be <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-bleed-shimano-hydraulic-road-disc-brakes\" target=\"_blank\">bled periodically</a> to keep them working at their best. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What tyres do I need?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravel bikes are normally sold with all-rounder tyres. They’ll be fine for many off-road surfaces, but may not have enough grip for damp conditions. A grippier tyre will serve better here, but may roll slowly on the road. There are also tyres designed for faster, drier conditions and on/off-road riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In muddy conditions, a low profile tyre tread can quickly clog up and you’ll lose traction. Mud can also accumulate on the tyre sidewalls and the frame, in the worst case stopping your wheels from turning. A dedicated mud tyre can help, while if you run a slightly narrower tyre you’ll have greater clearance in the frame and less tendency to clog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our guide to the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-the-best-gravel-bike-tyres\" target=\"_blank\">best gravel bike tyres </a>will help you choose. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Do I need to set up tubeless?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Almost all gravel bike tyres and wheels are tubeless-ready, although gravel bikes are usually sold with inner tubes. You’ll save yourself a world of grief by swapping to tubeless, as you can run your tyres at lower pressure, you get a measure of puncture resistance from the<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-tubeless-sealant\" target=\"_blank\"> tyre sealant </a>and you’ll reduce the chances of pinch flats should you hit a rock or other obstacle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, tubeless isn’t fit-and-forget and you’ll need to check sealant levels and keep them topped up, as sealant dries up over time. A puncture will deplete sealant too and not all seal properly with just sealant, so you may want to carry a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-tubeless-repair-kit\" target=\"_blank\">tubeless repair kit</a> and/or spare <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-inner-tubes\" target=\"_blank\">inner tube</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-2-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-gravel-bike\">The best gravel bikes 2025 reviewed</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Jdelves","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"2e5ee8ee7f9bed22e19630699a47230fb9e7a3d46c48ce39e5502c5843bfd70d","category":"Cycling"}
