They’ll have a shorter reach, so you won’t be stretched so far forwards, and thanks to a longer head tube and more elevated <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/road-bike-handlebars-guide-how-to-choose-the-right-ones/\">handlebar</a>, they’ll have a higher front-end, so you won’t be so low.</p>\n<p>In other words, you’ll be sitting in a more upright position than you would on a dedicated race bike, which is good for comfort and also helpful for building new riders’ confidence.</p>\n<p>If all of that still went over your head, make sure you check out our beginner’s guide to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/sizing-and-fit/road-bike-geometry-explained/\" target=\"_blank\">road bike geometry and handling</a>.</p>\n<p>The bikes won’t be as stiff or light as an expensive race bike, and they’ll usually feature less carbon in their construction too. For the most part, bikes in this price range will have a frame made of metal, most often an aluminium alloy.</p>\n<p>That’s not necessarily a bad thing, though, some of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-aluminium-road-bikes/\" target=\"_blank\">best aluminium road bikes</a> we have ridden easily rival their carbon equivalents.</p>\n<h3>What will I get for my money?</h3>\n<p>Don’t go thinking that £1,000 road bikes aren’t the real deal. As long as you’re riding on tarmac, they’ll do whatever you need them to, whether that’s adding a bit of pace to your commute, dipping your toe into the waters of racing, taking on a sportive, touring or simply riding for fun at the weekend.</p>\n<p>Bikes in this price range vary a good deal in spec. The best value ones will typically have a mid-range 11-speed Shimano 105 or SRAM Rival groupset, while many will be equipped with groupsets lower down the scale, such as 11-speed SRAM Apex, 10-speed Shimano Tiagra or 9-speed Shimano Sora.</p>\n<p>A groupset is the collection of components that make your bike go and stop, i.e. shifters, derailleurs, cranks, brakes etc. You can find out more in our <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/road-bike-groupsets-everything-you-need-to-know/\">road bike groupsets</a> explainer.)</p>\n<p>Many bikes in this category will also mix and match components to save money. So you’ll often find bikes with Shimano Tiagra shifters and derailleurs but Tektro brakes, for example.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/road-disc-brakes-everything-you-need-to-know/\">Disc brakes</a> are becoming more common at this level but they will often be mechanical cable-operated calipers (or mechanically-actuated hydraulic calipers) rather than the full hydraulic systems found on more expensive bikes.</p>\n<p>In any case, don’t discount rim brakes, they’re perfectly adequate for most riding and save weight compared to discs.</p>\n<p>Read on for summaries and links to all of our highest rated road bikes under £1,000, with the highest scoring bikes shown first.</p>\n<section><div>\n        <h2>The best road bikes around £1,000 in 2021, as rated and reviewed by our expert testers</h2>\n<ul><li><strong>Boardman SLR 8.9:</strong> £1,100</li>\n<li><strong>Bristol Bicycles Expedition:</strong> £775</li>\n<li><strong>Canyon Endurace AL 7.0:</strong> £999</li>\n<li><strong>Giant Contend SL 1:</strong> <span> £999</span></li>\n<li><strong>Giant Contend 2:</strong> <span>£579</span></li>\n<li><strong>Ribble Endurance AL Disc:</strong> £999</li>\n<li><strong>Ribble R872 Tiagra:</strong> £1,000</li>\n<li><strong>Rose Pro SL:</strong> £997</li>\n<li><strong>Specialized Allez:</strong> £650</li>\n<li><strong>Specialized Allez Elite:</strong> £1,249</li>\n<li><strong>Triban RC520 Disc:</strong> £850</li>\n<li><strong>Van Rysel EDR AF: </strong>£1,200</li>\n<li><strong>Vitus Zenium Tiagra:</strong> £1,100</li>\n</ul><p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section><h2>Boardman SLR 8.9</h2>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> It’s hard to argue with a carbon frame, Shimano 105 as well as great-quality components.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudery / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£1,100 as tested</li>\n<li>Carbon frame and fork</li>\n<li>Mostly Shimano 105 components</li>\n</ul><p>The Boardman SLR 8.9 is one of the least expensive carbon road bikes there is, and with the same aerodynamic tube profiles as Boardman’s top-end 9.6 and a nearly complete Shimano 105 groupset, it’s great value.</p>\n<p>Boardman describes the geometry as endurance but we found it lives on the racier side, delivering a ride that is equal parts fast and comfortable with impressive handling.</p>\n<p>The wheels are basic but they are <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/tubeless/\">tubeless</a>-ready and do come with decent Vittoria tyres.

This new version is no exception with a fully carbon frame and fork, and cable-actuated disc brakes that work well.</p>\n<p>The Zenium has a 10-speed Shimano Tiagra groupset which, considering the price of the bike and that it has a carbon frame, is an absolute steal. The gearing is also ample for practically any ride you’ll go on.</p>\n<p>The kit is as expected for the price but still good. The bike has an aero handlebar that’s flattened on the top, which offers an aero advantage but, maybe more importantly, will comfortably fit your hands.</p>\n<p>When it comes to the ride, the Zenium flies on the flat and is a lively climber. It is a firmer ride than a lot of other bikes, but that’s the only thing holding the Zenium back.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/2021-vitus-zenium-tiagra-review/\">Read the full Vitus Zenium review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<hr /><h2>Also consider…</h2>\n<p>The following bikes scored 4 out of 5 stars when reviewed by BikeRadar, still making them some of the best bikes you can buy.</p>\n<h2>Boardman ADV 8.6</h2>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Great comfort and versatility from Boardman’s big-tyred all-rounder.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudery / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£750 as tested</li>\n<li>Great comfort and off-road potential</li>\n<li>Average disc brakes</li>\n</ul><p>Boardman describes the ADV 8.6 as its entry-level adventure bike, and we found it to offer a good compromise between on-road and off-road riding, concluding that it would make a great commuter, road or gravel all-rounder.</p>\n<p>The aluminium frame is paired with a carbon fork, 9-speed Sora groupset, tubeless-ready rims and tyres that perform well on tarmac and gravel.
