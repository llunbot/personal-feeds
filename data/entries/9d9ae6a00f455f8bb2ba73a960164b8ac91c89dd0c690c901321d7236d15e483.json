That's according to Weibo-based leaker <a href=\"https://weibo.com/6048569942/PnngRFfih\">Digital Chat Station</a> who has sources within the Chinese supply chain. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Foldable-iPhone-2023-Feature-Iridescent-Search.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" />\r<br />\nOn Monday, the leaker revealed the alleged <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/14/iphone-fold-display-resolutions-cameras/\">screen resolutions</a> for the 7.76-inch inner display and the 5.49-inch outer display of Apple's book-style foldable device, and they also claimed that the inner display uses \"under-screen camera technology.\" However, it was not clear whether this meant the TrueDepth system that underlies Face ID would be integrated beneath the screen along with the selfie camera.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe latest tidbit of information clears this up, and suggests that the display will have a single punch-hole camera. It also aligns with industry analyst Ming-Chi Kuo's claim that Apple's foldable iPhone will <a href=\"https://mingchikuo.craft.me/84AOn3Ll8Zah6f\">forgo Face ID authentication</a>, instead using a Touch ID side button as a means to save precious internal space. Apple already integrates Touch ID into the side button on some iPads, so there's precedent for this.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIntegrating Face ID under the screen is difficult because the core components that make up the TrueDepth camera system – like the dot projector and infrared camera – need a clear, unobstructed view to accurately scan your face. Current display layers block or distort infrared light, which degrades the system's ability to create a secure 3D facial map. Fully under-display Face ID will remain a technical hurdle until displays can transmit infrared light cleanly.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThat said, it's possible that Apple has already made advances toward achieving such a feat. Apple is also developing a larger 18.8-inch foldable device, and according to Digital Chat Station, one of Apple's engineering prototypes features a \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/foldable-ipad-pro-under-display-face-id/\">metal superstructure lens</a>\" that integrates the receiver and transmitter components of Face ID for under-display facial recognition. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman has suggested the \"giant\" foldable tablet will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/16/foldable-ipad-likely-set-for-2028-launch/\">launch in 2028</a>. Whether the new Face ID technology makes it into the finished device is unknown. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple will launch its long-rumored foldable iPhone late next year with a ~$2,000 premium price tag attached, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/24/foldable-iphone-to-launch-next-year/\">according to Gurman</a>. <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digital-chat-station/\">Digital Chat Station</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/\">Foldable iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/15/foldable-iphone-under-screen-camera-no-face-id/\">Foldable iPhone's Under-Screen Camera Likely Won't Include Face ID</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/foldable-iphones-under-screen-camera-likely-wont-include-face-id.2455343/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9d9ae6a00f455f8bb2ba73a960164b8ac91c89dd0c690c901321d7236d15e483","category":"Apple"}
