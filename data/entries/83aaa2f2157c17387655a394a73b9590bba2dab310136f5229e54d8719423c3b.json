Apple Card Savings is billed as a destination for your Daily Cash–the cashback you get when making Apple Card purchases–but you can transfer money to the account from a linked bank account, and withdraw money at any time with no fees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like Apple Card, this is currently only available to users in the United States. You must be 18 years old, have a social security number or individual taxpayer identification number, have a valid physical U.S. address, and have <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/229795/how-to-set-up-two-factor-authentication-for-your-apple-id-and-icloud-account.html\">two-factor authentication</a> set up on your iPhone. (If you have Apple Card, you already meet most of these criteria.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how to get started setting up your Apple Cash Savings account.</p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div><div><div>At a glance </div></div><ul><li><span>Time to complete: </span><span>  5 minutes</span></li><li>Tools required: none</li><li>Materials required: iPhone with Apple Card account</li><li>Cost: 0</li></ul></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div><span>1.</span>\n<h3>Open Apple Card and select Daily Cash</h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/apple-card-savings-step1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple Card Savings step1\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>First, open the Wallet app and select your Apple Card.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<p>Then tap the More button (…) in the upper right and choose Daily Cash.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div><span>2.</span>\n<h3>Change Daily Cash option to Savings</h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/apple-card-savings-step2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple Card Savings step 2\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>From the Daily Cash section, tap <em>Savings</em> under Daily Cash Election.
