{"title":"Weekly Sponsorships Here at Daring Fireball","link":"https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/","date":1742596707000,"content":"\n<p>How has your week been? My week was ... <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/something_is_rotten_in_the_state_of_cupertino\">busy</a>. That includes a new episode of The Talk Show recorded yesterday, dropping in your favorite podcast app soon. Amidst all the writing (and talking) I’ve been doing, I’m also working on filling up open weeks on the sponsorship schedule for Q2.</p>\n\n<p>After a very full February and March, I’ve got a bunch of openings in the next few months — and openings for <s>the next two weeks, starting with this Monday</s>. <strong>Update:</strong> The coming week just sold, but the next week, starting March 31, remains open.</p>\n\n<p>Weekly sponsorships have been the top source of revenue for Daring Fireball ever since I started selling them <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/archive\">back in 2007</a>. They’ve succeeded, I think, because they make everyone happy. They generate good money. There’s only one sponsor per week and the sponsors are always relevant to at least some sizable portion of the DF audience, so you, the reader, are never annoyed and hopefully often intrigued by them. And, from the sponsors’ perspective, they work. My favorite thing about them is how many sponsors <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/feeds/sponsors/archive\">return for subsequent weeks</a> after seeing the results.</p>\n\n<p>If you’ve got a product or service you think would be of interest to DF’s audience of people obsessed with high quality and good design, <a href=\"mailto:sponsors@daringfireball.net?subject=Feed%20Sponsorship\">get in touch</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/21/weekly-sponsorship-here-at-daring-fireball\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"e8faa5a1157477880337c35d317159458ee6677ac70ca0a1666bf3705b1e6770","category":"Tech"}
