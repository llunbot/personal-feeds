In the last six months, we have seen the two most powerful rockets ever take flight, the Space Launch System and Starship. What a time for the industry and enthusiasts—the future looks so bright!</p>\n<p>As always, we <a href=\"https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/\">welcome reader submissions</a>, and if you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site).

The 3D-printed engine, previously flown on the ‘There and Back Again’ mission launched in May 2022, has undergone extensive qualification and acceptance testing to certify it for re-flight. This includes multiple full mission-duration hot fires where the pre-flown engine performed as if it were a newly built one.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1932949#p3\">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1932949&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f4d708bbd0a26abdd49e75e688feb81248c49178de2ab8f21d1e485afd57dda1","category":"Tech"}
