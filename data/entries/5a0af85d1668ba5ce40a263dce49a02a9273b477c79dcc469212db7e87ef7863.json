Can a man who just dominated the Giro at a canter be anything but a favourite? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below, we’ve assessed the pair’s chances, along with the other top names, to try to figure out who the

de France victories and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/giro-ditalia\" target=\"_blank\">Giro d’Italia</a> dominance does not an underdog make. But <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/uae-team-emirates\" target=\"_blank\">UAE Team Emirates</a> Manager Maxtin Joxean Fernandez pointed the finger at rival Vingegaard as being top billing at the Tour de France, saying in an interview with <em><a href=\"https://sporza.be/nl/2024/05/31/ondanks-pogacars-giro-demonstratie-houdt-uae-druk-af-voor-de-tour-vingegaard-is-de-topfavoriet~1717156077878/\" target=\"_blank\">Sporza</a></em> that ‘Pogačar was fatigued after the Giro d’Italia’ and that Vingegaard is ‘the big favourite’, having been training at altitude for several weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s understandable that three weeks at maximum effort in a Grand Tour would exhaust anyone, let alone someone aiming to win their first Tour de France title since 2021. In May, Pogačar won the Giro d’Italia on his debut with relative ease, as expected, with his closest competitor Dani Martínez (Bora-Hansgrohe) finishing almost ten minutes behind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if he’s Giro-fatigued, the Slovenian star can still rely on the strongest team in the peloton. Adam Yates and João Almeida dominated the recent Tour de Suisse, winning two stages apiece and finishing first and second on GC. Both will be riding in support of Pogačar at the Tour alongside a line-up of top-notch talent that also includes 21-year-old super-talent Juan Ayuso.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last man to complete the Giro/Tour double was <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pantani-tour-giro-double\" target=\"_blank\">Marco Pantani in 1998</a>. If anyone could achieve this feat in the current peloton, it’s Pogačar, or this guy…</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Underdog ranking: 0/5</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Underdog contender 2: Jonas Vingegaard (Visma-Lease a Bike)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Vingegaard-in-maillot-jaune-ahead-of-first-rest-day-2023-Tour-de-France-by-Pauline-Ballet-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"man in yellow jersey holding lion toy and flowers\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Vingegaard-in-maillot-jaune-ahead-of-first-rest-day-2023-Tour-de-France-by-Pauline-Ballet-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Vingegaard-in-maillot-jaune-ahead-of-first-rest-day-2023-Tour-de-France-by-Pauline-Ballet-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Vingegaard-in-maillot-jaune-ahead-of-first-rest-day-2023-Tour-de-France-by-Pauline-Ballet-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Vingegaard-in-maillot-jaune-ahead-of-first-rest-day-2023-Tour-de-France-by-Pauline-Ballet-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Vingegaard-in-maillot-jaune-ahead-of-first-rest-day-2023-Tour-de-France-by-Pauline-Ballet-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Vingegaard-in-maillot-jaune-ahead-of-first-rest-day-2023-Tour-de-France-by-Pauline-Ballet-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Vingegaard-in-maillot-jaune-ahead-of-first-rest-day-2023-Tour-de-France-by-Pauline-Ballet-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Vingegaard-in-maillot-jaune-ahead-of-first-rest-day-2023-Tour-de-France-by-Pauline-Ballet-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Vingegaard-in-maillot-jaune-ahead-of-first-rest-day-2023-Tour-de-France-by-Pauline-Ballet-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/07/Vingegaard-in-maillot-jaune-ahead-of-first-rest-day-2023-Tour-de-France-by-Pauline-Ballet-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Pauline Ballet/A.S.O.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Jonas Vingegaard has won the last two editions of the Tour de France.

Roglič has plenty of experience in winning Grand Tours, having tucked away three consecutive Vuelta a España titles and a Giro d’Italia <em><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-d-italia-why-jersey-pink\">maglia </a><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-d-italia-why-jersey-pink\" target=\"_blank\">rosa</a></em>. But the Tour de France is the one that has evaded him. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roglič finished just off the podium in 2018. In 2020, he lost the yellow jersey on a dramatic final day of racing as Pogačar claimed the top spot after a dominant time-trial display on La Planche des Belles Filles. In both 2021 and 2022 he abandoned through injuries sustained after crashing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If he manages to avoid hitting the ground this year (and it’s a big ‘if’, he was another caught up in the Itzulia crash that took Vingegaard out), Roglič should be able to maintain a strong place on GC. Especially considering he’s already won the warm-up in the Critérium du Dauphiné. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Underdog ranking: 2/5</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Underdog contender 4: Remco Evenepoel (Soudal-QuickStep)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/file-6-970x647.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/file-6-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/file-6-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/file-6-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/file-6-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/file-6-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/file-6-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/file-6-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/file-6-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/file-6-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/file-6.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/remco-evenepoel\" target=\"_blank\">Remco Evenepoel </a>completes the ‘big four’ of favourites despite this being his first outing on the Tour de France rollercoaster. Yet the 24-year-old is no newcomer, he already has the <em>palmarès</em> of a seasoned vet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two-times World Champion won the 2022 Vuelta a España at just 22 years of age. Given Belgium’s rich legacy in cycling, the expectations on Evenepoel’s shoulders are huge, with the country looking to celebrate its first Tour winner since Lucien Van Impe in 1976. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Evenepoel will undoubtedly be one to watch. He said in December last year that state his aim was to make it to the ‘top 5’, but since he came down hard in the Itzulia crash there will surely be less pressure for a big result here. This is scheduled to be his only Grand Tour of the season though, providing good reason to go all out. He’ll certainly be a favourite for the time-trials.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Underdog ranking: 3/5</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Underdog contender 5: Carlos Rodríguez (Ineos Grenadiers)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/file-37-970x647.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/file-37-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/file-37-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/file-37-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/file-37-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/file-37-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/file-37-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/file-37-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/file-37-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/file-37-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/file-37.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>On to the <em>actual</em> underdogs now; dismiss Carlos Rodríguez at your peril.

Fortunately the injuries sustained in a crash on Stage 4 in Switzerland were not severe and the move was said to be taken as more of a precaution. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carapaz became the first Ecuadorian cyclist to <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/giro-ditalia-2019-richard-carapaz-wins-historic-maglia-rosa-after-stage-21-in-verona\" target=\"_blank\">win the Giro d’Italia in 2019</a> while racing for Movistar. He shone towards the end of the second week particularly, thriving on the mountain slopes and claiming victory on Stage 14, which allowed him to pull the <em>maglia rosa</em> onto his shoulders and never let it go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The EF Education-EasyPost team are one that can be found lighting up races and are perhaps more suited to stage hunting than having a focus on the yellow jersey. But when needed to help Carapaz on GC, you can be sure they’ve got the talent to try. It’s finding the balance between helping Carapaz and stage hunting that will be key for the team this July.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Underdog ranking: 5/5</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Underdog contender 8: Enric Mas (Movistar)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Enric-Mas-Stage-20-2018-Vuelta-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Enric-Mas-Stage-20-2018-Vuelta-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Enric-Mas-Stage-20-2018-Vuelta-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Enric-Mas-Stage-20-2018-Vuelta-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Enric-Mas-Stage-20-2018-Vuelta-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Enric-Mas-Stage-20-2018-Vuelta-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Enric-Mas-Stage-20-2018-Vuelta-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Enric-Mas-Stage-20-2018-Vuelta-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Enric-Mas-Stage-20-2018-Vuelta-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Enric-Mas-Stage-20-2018-Vuelta-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Enric-Mas-Stage-20-2018-Vuelta-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Photo by Tim de Waele/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, Movistar has made the mistake of having too many leaders at a Grand Tour, who ended up cancelling each other out.

It’s hard to see a jump to the yellow jersey, but on his day Mas is still entertaining to watch – he possesses a die-hard spirit on the bike, battling to the finish no matter what.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Underdog ranking: 5/5</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>For more on the Tour de France, visit our <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tour-de-france\" target=\"_blank\">hub page</a>.</em></p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-climbs\">The climbs that will decide the 2024 Tour de France</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/how-do-tour-de-france-favourites-prepare\">How are the favourites preparing for the Tour de France?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-prize-money\">How much is the 2024 Tour de France prize money?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pantani-tour-giro-double\">Tour de France history: Pantani goes from hero to legend</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\">Men’s Tour de France 2024: Route, how to watch and all you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-2024-underdogs\">Who actually are the underdogs for the Tour de France?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Robyn Davidson &#124; Editorial Assistant","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"5a0af85d1668ba5ce40a263dce49a02a9273b477c79dcc469212db7e87ef7863","category":"Cycling"}
