You’re so desperate to see your beloved claret and blue army closer to home that you decide to build a football pitch outside your front door. You then get out a pen and paper and write a letter to Newham Council requesting that the team starts playing its home games here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now imagine that the council and West Ham’s owners say yes. Before you know it, you’ve got Declan Rice, Mark Noble and the rest of the team playing against Manchester United in full view of your bedroom window.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/03024936/classic_climb_paterberg_02-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Paterberg Classic Climb\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/03024936/classic_climb_paterberg_02-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/03024936/classic_climb_paterberg_02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/03024936/classic_climb_paterberg_02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/03024936/classic_climb_paterberg_02-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/03024936/classic_climb_paterberg_02-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/03024936/classic_climb_paterberg_02-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/03024936/classic_climb_paterberg_02-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/03024936/classic_climb_paterberg_02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>All the major bergs in Flanders are now marked with Strava segment start and finish points. </figcaption><figcaption>Alex Duffill / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>It’s a dream that lives solely in the mind of a certain journalist who writes for an unspecified cycling magazine, yet for one Flemish farmer the cycling equivalent of this dream became a reality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As recently as 1985 the Paterberg was nothing more than a steep, unpaved dirt track. That was until one of the farmers who lived on the climb decided to take action after he found himself a little envious of one of his friends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apparently this friend lived on a nearby climb called the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/koppenberg-tour-of-flanders\" target=\"_blank\">Koppenberg</a>, which had been introduced into the region’s biggest bike race, the Tour of Flanders, a decade earlier in 1976.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/03024939/classic_climb_paterberg_03-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"Paterberg Classic Climb\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/03024939/classic_climb_paterberg_03-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/03024939/classic_climb_paterberg_03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/03024939/classic_climb_paterberg_03-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/03024939/classic_climb_paterberg_03-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/03024939/classic_climb_paterberg_03-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/03024939/classic_climb_paterberg_03-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/03024939/classic_climb_paterberg_03-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/03024939/classic_climb_paterberg_03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>If you’ve got the bike-handling skills, you can always take the dirt track on the left. </figcaption><figcaption>Alex Duffill / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>As a huge cycling fan, the farmer felt it was unacceptable that he couldn’t live as close to the action as his mate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So he got out pen and paper and wrote a letter to the Kluisbergen council requesting approval for him to pave the dirt track that ran outside his farm with cobbles, thereby creating a new cobbled climb that could then be used in De Ronde.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Incredibly, the council listened. It allowed the farmer to cover the Paterberg in <i>kassei</i> and by the spring of 1986 the Paterberg was ready to make its debut in the Flemish Monument. Build it and the Tour of Flanders will come.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Time to shine</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/03024941/classic_climb_paterberg_04-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Paterberg Classic Climb\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/03024941/classic_climb_paterberg_04-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/03024941/classic_climb_paterberg_04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/03024941/classic_climb_paterberg_04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/03024941/classic_climb_paterberg_04-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/03024941/classic_climb_paterberg_04-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/03024941/classic_climb_paterberg_04-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/03024941/classic_climb_paterberg_04-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/03024941/classic_climb_paterberg_04.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>The sign may say 20% but the maximum gradient is actually 21%. </figcaption><figcaption>Alex Duffill / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Despite having been built for the race, for the first 26 years the Paterberg was seen as just another climb. It was steep, harsh and it sapped the legs, but being a long way from the finish it was no more significant than climbs such as the Eikenberg or Wolvenberg – just another obstacle the peloton had to haul itself over before the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/is-the-muur-van-geraardsbergen-flanders-greatest-climb\" target=\"_blank\">Muur van Geraardsbergen</a>/Bosberg one-two knockout blows that had concluded the race since 1973 and so often decided its winner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it would have remained had it not been for a controversial decision by Tour of Flanders owner Wouter Vandenhaute in 2012. Having bought the race in 2009, Vandenhaute founded <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/flanders-classics-tomas-van-den-spiegel\" target=\"_blank\">Flanders Classics</a> a year later, the company that runs De Ronde plus five further semi-Classics in the region.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking to make the race more financially viable and commercially lucrative, the long-established route was given a refresh. The finish in Meerbeke was swapped out for the town of Oudenaarde, with the iconic double of the Muur/Bosberg replaced by the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/oude-kwaremont-tour-of-flanders\" target=\"_blank\">Oude Kwaremont</a> and the Paterberg.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/03024944/classic_climb_paterberg_05-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Paterberg Classic Climb\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/03024944/classic_climb_paterberg_05-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/03024944/classic_climb_paterberg_05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/03024944/classic_climb_paterberg_05-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/03024944/classic_climb_paterberg_05-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/03024944/classic_climb_paterberg_05-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/03024944/classic_climb_paterberg_05-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/03024944/classic_climb_paterberg_05-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/06/03024944/classic_climb_paterberg_05.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Alex Duffill / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Both were to be climbed three times apiece during the race, giving spectators the chance to see the action on multiple occasions from the same spot, and Vandenhaute the chance to erect highly profitable hospitality tents roadside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The route change made many local fans incandescent with rage, to the point where they held a fake funeral on the slopes of the Muur in protest at its axing.
