In Vivaldi's case, this means the <a href=\"https://vivaldi.com/android/\">Android version</a> of the browser. (There is no iOS version of Vivaldi.) Android tablets get special attention in this release, with several features aimed at improving the web browsing experience on larger screensâ€”something even Google hasn't managed to do with its own mobile browser.</p>\n<p>In fact, the idea that an app would be optimized for performance on Android tablets is almost unheard of these days. That unfortunate reality is central to our major complaint about the Android-powered <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/the-best-tablets/\">iPad alternatives</a>, where the software experience is universally subpar. I should note that Google is currently revamping the overall Android tablet experience by adding some improvements for larger screens that will roll into the next version of the mobile operating system. An <a href=\"https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/12/beta-1-update-for-12l-feature-drop.html\">early beta release</a> is available now.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1819584#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1819584&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5b8f688acf8d7754aa722d8d11b8405cc90cf2b5e6b9ec11b211ecf3e25fc6eb","category":"Tech"}
