{"title":"Louie Mantia on Dark Mode App Icons","link":"https://lmnt.me/blog/dark-mode-app-icons.html","date":1718811267000,"content":"\n<p>Louie Mantia:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple’s announcement of “dark mode” icons has me thinking about\nhow I would approach adapting “light mode” icons for dark mode. I\ngrabbed 12 icons we made at <a href=\"https://www.parakeet.co/\">Parakeet</a> for our clients to\nillustrate some ways of going about it. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, some icons appear to have lost or gained weight in\ndark mode. For example, the Settings gear didn’t change size in\ndark mode, but it appears to occupy less space because the dark\ncircle around it blends with its background. That makes it\n<em>appear</em> smaller than the Find My icon, which now looks enormous\nnext to FaceTime. This is a remnant of some questionable design\nchoices in iOS 7 that have lingered now for the last decade.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That last sentence is the most diplomatic thing I’ve ever heard from Louie. What a splendid post this is — exemplary work to illustrate his advice.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/19/mantia-dark-mode-icons\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"19ccaddb05287c3461dfc475f5016eb3b6e2405d513b9426020fcc115734bb60","category":"Tech"}
