The ‌M2‌ Max was released in January upon the launch of the latest 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models, but the ‌M2‌ Ultra chip is new and would succeed the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-ultra/\">M1 Ultra</a> chip that Apple uses in the ‌Mac Studio‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>Can confirm Apple is nearing the introduction of a new Mac codenamed J475. What’s the codename of the current Mac Studio? J375. <a href=\"https://t.co/X4f2n2Mtni\">https://t.co/X4f2n2Mtni</a></p>— Mark Gurman (@markgurman) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1664389724801302529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 1, 2023</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to Gurman, the ‌M2‌ Max Mac in testing features eight high-performance cores, four efficiency cores, a 30-core GPU, and 96GB RAM. This is the same as the chip in the ‌M2‌ Max version of the 16-inch MacBook Pro.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌M2‌ Ultra Mac apparently has 16 high-performance cores and 8 efficiency cores, and a 60-core GPU, though prior information suggests that the ‌M2‌ Ultra could feature up to 76 GPU cores. Different configurations feature 64GB, 128GB, and 192GB of memory.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is believed to be testing these new Macs just days ahead of the WWDC keynote, and Gurman says that he <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/31/several-new-macs-in-one-of-longest-ever-keynotes/\">expects multiple Macs</a> to be introduced at the event, including an all-new 15-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a> model. Gurman has stopped short of saying the new ‌Mac Studio‌ will be introduced at WWDC, but it seems highly likely at this point.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/\">Mac Studio</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/\">WWDC</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac-Studio\">Mac Studio (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-studio.237\">Mac Studio</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8\">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/02/new-mac-studio-likely-to-be-introduced-at-wwdc/\">New Mac Studio Likely to Be Introduced at WWDC</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-mac-studio-likely-to-be-introduced-at-wwdc.2391336/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"90dcf9defbde52ed66a25903856eccb145f407a63d75c7d94310bdc9ca5dd107","category":"Apple"}
