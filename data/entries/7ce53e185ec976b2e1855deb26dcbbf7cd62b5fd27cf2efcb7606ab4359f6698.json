Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>\n<p>LISBON, Portugal—Last week we wrote about driving a pair of new M-badged electric BMWs. With the arrival of the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/10/bmw-has-an-all-new-electric-5-series-and-weve-driven-it-the-2024-bmw-i5/\">i5 M60</a> and the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/09/the-2024-bmw-i7-m70-electric-luxury-turned-up-to-11/\">iX M70</a>, there are now go-fast variants of all four of BMW's battery-electric vehicles. But as BMW will openly admit, those aren't true M cars. That's not to say that BMW's M Division is afraid of electrification—last year it debuted <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/03/the-2023-bmw-xm-is-purpose-built-to-get-your-attention\">the XM, a performance plug-in hybrid SUV</a>. And next year, the XM's powertrain will reappear in a plug-in hybrid M5. But when might we see a purely electric M car?</p>\n<p>Conveniently for us, Frank van Meel, CEO of BMW M, was on hand in Portugal to sit down and talk about the future of M performance and electrification. And, as it turns out, we might see a fully electric BMW M car in plenty of time before the end of this decade.</p>\n<p>\"Well, if you look on social media, you can already see our mule test car with quad motors, because for us, that is a very promising concept for high performance,\" van Meel said, referring to recently released photos <a href=\"https://www.bmwblog.com/2023/01/13/bmw-m-intensify-quad-motor-ev-tests/\">of a BMW i4 EV with the license plate M HP 4 E</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1973576#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1973576&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
