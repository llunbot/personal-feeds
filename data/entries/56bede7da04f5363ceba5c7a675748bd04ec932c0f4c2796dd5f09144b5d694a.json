The device will begin shipping later this year at a starting price of $399.</p>\n<p>The hefty-looking console, which is 11.7 inches long (compared to 9.4 inches for the default Switch with Joy-Cons), will launch at three price points, differentiated by built-in storage capacity, higher SSD speed ratings (jumping from default eMMC storage to a pricier NVMe protocol), and differently tempered glass on its screen. Those upgraded versions will cost $529 (256GB) and $649 (512GB, \"anti-glare etched glass\"). Both pricier bundles include a carrying case.</p>\n<p>All models will have the same AMD-powered combination of a four-core Zen 2 CPU and a RDNA 2 GPU, which Valve describes as a \"custom\" APU. Each model also includes 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM, a 40 Whr battery (guaranteeing \"2-8 hours of gameplay\" on a single charge), a microSD card slot for expandable storage, and a 7-inch, 1280x800, 60 Hz touchscreen LCD.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1780592#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1780592&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"56bede7da04f5363ceba5c7a675748bd04ec932c0f4c2796dd5f09144b5d694a","category":"Tech"}
