Burkman &amp; Associates LLC for making illegal robocalls to wireless phones, the commission <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-issues-5-million-penalty-illegal-robocalling\">announced yesterday</a>. Burkman and Wohl have faced multiple lawsuits and pleaded guilty in one criminal case. If they do not pay the $5,134,500 penalty, the FCC will refer it to the Department of Justice for collection.</p>\n<p>The FCC fine is for 1,141 calls made to wireless numbers without the recipients' express prior consent. But the robocalls were sent to over 85,000 people overall, according to a ruling in a court case described later in this article.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1946192#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1946192&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"081b6b4f4a85022f2a054e14068a1349cb6057ab39891b2f7843267b34ffaa78","category":"Tech"}
