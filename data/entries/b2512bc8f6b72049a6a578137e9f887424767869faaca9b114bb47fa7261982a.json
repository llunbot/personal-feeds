It's currently unknown how long the rig was running because the illegal operation went undetected, partly because the computers used were connected to the Internet through their own modems rather than through the court's network.</p>\n<p>While no one has been charged yet with any crimes, the court seemingly has suspects. Within two weeks of finding the rig, the court terminated a contract with a company responsible for IT maintenance in the building, TVN24 reported. Before the contract ended, the company fired two employees that it said were responsible for maintenance in the parts of the building where the cryptomine was hidden.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984512#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1984512&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b2512bc8f6b72049a6a578137e9f887424767869faaca9b114bb47fa7261982a","category":"Tech"}
