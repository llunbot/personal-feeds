It features in the MacBook Pro M3 and iMac and was recently added to the MacBook Air, but it is still absent from the Mac mini. How long will we have to wait for Apple to roll out the M3 to the rest of the range? Or will Apple skip it and decide to release a new Mac mini with an M4 chip?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article is designed to help you figure out what’s happening with the M3 and M3 Pro versions of the Mac mini–or if Apple skips the M3 series and goes straight to M4.

Price</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Price drops outside the U.S. are somewhat likely. </li>\n</ul>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Rumors about the M3/M4 Mac mini have not addressed prices and the price is unlikely to change inside the U.S. However, we do hope that there will be price drops outside the U.S. to reverse price hikes a few years ago. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has been adjusting prices following previous price hikes. When Apple has updated Macs and iPhones since late 2023 it reduced some prices in locations outside the U.S. The U.K. prices of the M3 MacBook Air, for example, ‘match’ the U.S. prices. For example, the M2 MacBook Air now costs $999/£999. That’s a good sign for the M3 Mac mini–it could follow the same standard configuration prices of $599/£599 (currently £649) and $799/£799 (currently £849) when it is finally released. In 2020, the M1 Mac mini had prices of $699/£699 and $899/£899. </p>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<h2>New Mac mini: Processor and specs</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>M3: 3nm chip with 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 8GB unified memory (16GB and 24GB options)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>M3 Pro: 11 or 12 core CPU, 14 or 18 GPU cores, 18GB unified memory (36GB option)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>M4: AI enhancements</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<p>We have a fair idea of what to expect from the Mac mini M3 and M3 Pro because we have already seen those chips in the MacBook Pro, iMac, and MacBook Air. Apple is said to put an AI emphasis on the M4 so that it could have similar CPU and GPU specs as the M3 but with a larger Neural Engine and more unified memory.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1953800/apple-m3-cpu-gpu-speed-performance.html\">3nm process</a> used for the M3 (and possibly for the M4) allows more transistors to fit on a chip, which should provide a performance boost. The M3 will also offer better power efficiency, so the temperature considerations required for the M1 or M2 Mac mini aren’t the same as the M3, which could allow it to run faster because it doesn’t get as hot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, the M3 GPU is faster and more efficient and features Dynamic Caching, a new technology that brings features like hardware-accelerated ray tracing and mesh shading to the Mac. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the amount of unified memory, Apple still offers the standard configuration of 8GB for the M3 and options for 16GB and 24GB, as with the M2.  For the M3 Pr,o there is up to 36GB of unified memory available, but the standard configuration is now 18GB memory (up from 16GB). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information read about how the different generations of Mac processors<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670873/which-mac-processor-apple-processor-comparison-m1-vs-intel.html\"> compare</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<h2>New Mac mini: Ports/Connectivity</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Possibly five USB-C ports and no USB-A</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>When Apple released the M1 Mac mini in 2020, the company reconfigured the ports so that it had two Thunderbolt/USB-C ports instead of the four that were on the Intel-based Mac mini. Apple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In September, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-09-01/apple-s-succession-strategy-m4-mac-mini-cheaper-ipad-magic-keyboard-m0jkdrx5?cmpid=BBD090124_POWERON&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_term=240901&amp;utm_campaign=poweron\">reported</a> that the M4 Mac mini will have five USB-C ports, two on the front and three on the back. It will not have USB-A ports. He also said it will have ethernet and HDMI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The M2 Mac mini already has Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3, but Apple could opt for Wi-FI 7 and Bluetooth 5.4.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/m1-mac-mini-ports-2020.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"M1 Mac mini ports\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/m1-mac-mini-ports-2020.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1500w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/m1-mac-mini-ports-2020.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/m1-mac-mini-ports-2020.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/m1-mac-mini-ports-2020.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/m1-mac-mini-ports-2020.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/m1-mac-mini-ports-2020.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<figcaption><p>Apple will likely not change the port configuration on the M3 Mac mini.</p></figcaption>\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"M1 Mac mini ports\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/m1-mac-mini-ports-2020.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1500w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/m1-mac-mini-ports-2020.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/m1-mac-mini-ports-2020.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/m1-mac-mini-ports-2020.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/m1-mac-mini-ports-2020.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/m1-mac-mini-ports-2020.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>Apple will likely not change the port configuration on the M3 Mac mini.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"M1 Mac mini ports\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/m1-mac-mini-ports-2020.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1500w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/m1-mac-mini-ports-2020.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/m1-mac-mini-ports-2020.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/m1-mac-mini-ports-2020.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/m1-mac-mini-ports-2020.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/m1-mac-mini-ports-2020.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption><p>Apple will likely not change the port configuration on the M3 Mac mini.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<h2>New Mac mini: Design</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Hints of a possible Mac mini redesign with the M4 update. </li>\n</ul>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The current Mac mini features a 7.75-by-7.75-by-1.41 inch (19.7-by-19.7-by-3.6 centimeter) external design.
