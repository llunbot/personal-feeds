{"title":"Apple Events 2023: Apple’s event calendar and details of the next Apple keynote","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/672537/when-is-apples-next-event.html","date":1693567629000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple doesn’t often participate in big industry-wide events such as CES or E3. The most valuable company in the world holds its own events, thank you very much. Several times a year, Apple invites the press and industry professionals to Apple Park to hear all about its latest products and services. Apple calls these “events,” and streams them live online to millions of watchers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2022, there were three such events: A spring event on March 8, WWDC on June 6, and the iPhone 14 launch on September 7. An additional event was expected in October or November but never materialized.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far in 2023, we’ve had just one event: WWDC in June. We expect two more Apple events before the year is over. Read on to find out what events and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671090/new-apple-products.html\">new Apple product launches</a> the company has in store for 2023 and 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When is Apple’s next event?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The next event in Apple’s calendar is the iPhone 15 launch on September 12, 2023. This is now official, following the sending out of invitations near the end of August. (At least, the event is official. The announcements themselves will remain secret until the last possible moment, and Apple is referring to the event by the tagline “Wonderlust” rather than as the iPhone 15 launch.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have lots of information about <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/831417/apple-september-iphone-event-date-time.html\">Apple’s September 2023 iPhone 15 event</a> in a separate story.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Skarmavbild-2023-08-29-kl.-18.10.03.png?w=1200\" alt=\"Wonderlust invitation \" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Skarmavbild-2023-08-29-kl.-18.10.03.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1664w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Skarmavbild-2023-08-29-kl.-18.10.03.png?resize=300%2C230&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Skarmavbild-2023-08-29-kl.-18.10.03.png?resize=768%2C590&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Skarmavbild-2023-08-29-kl.-18.10.03.png?resize=1200%2C922&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Skarmavbild-2023-08-29-kl.-18.10.03.png?resize=1536%2C1180&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"922\" /></figure><p>Apple </p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>What time will the next Apple event start?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s keynotes tends to start at 10 am in California (where Apple is based), and the “Wonderlust” event on September 12 is no exception.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what that translates to in the countries where most of our readers live:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>U.S.: at 10 am (PST/PDT), 11 am (MST/MDT), noon (CST/CDT), 1 pm (EST/EDT)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Canada: as above, and 2 pm (AST/ADT)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>U.K.: at 6 pm (GMT/BST)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Europe: at 7pm (CET/CEST)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>India: at 10.30 pm (IST)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Australia: Following day at 1 am (AWST/AWDT), 2.30 am (ACST/ACDT), 3 am (AEST/AEDT)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>New Zealand: next day at 5 am (NZST/NZDT)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>How long does an Apple event last?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple keynotes usually last between one and two hours and feature CEO Tim Cook along with various other Apple executives including Craig Federighi, John Ternus, and Erin Turullols. WWDC and the September event tend to be longer keynotes; the spring and late-fall events can be slightly shorter. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When does Apple hold events?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple holds three or four live or live-streamed events throughout the year where the company unveils its latest products and plans during a keynote address. They are usually held during similar times of the year:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>March/April: Spring event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>June: WWDC (Worldwide Developers Conference)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>September: Fall event (aka iPhone launch event)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>October/November: Late-fall event(s)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This event calendar is by no means set in stone, though, with the spring and October events being less regular. Some years, Apple doesn’t hold a spring event at all, as was the case in 2023. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The summer and September events are more predictable, with software coming at WWDC in June and iPhones and Apple Watches in September. The October event often sees Apple launch new Macs, but this is another one that changes from year to year.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Apple events will take place in 2023?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on past history and recent rumors, here are the events we expect to see across the remainder of 2023:</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"New Apple Products Apple Event September\" width=\"1069\" height=\"743\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1246w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?resize=300%2C209&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?resize=768%2C535&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?resize=1200%2C836&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?resize=1240%2C868&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w\" /><figcaption>Apple launched the new iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods Pro in September 2022.</figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 15 launch event: September 12, 2023</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple always holds an event in September, and almost always uses this to announce a new iPhone. (The only exception in recent memory was in 2020, as a result of Covid-related production issues. That year the iPhone was announced in October.) Here are the past few Apple September event dates:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2022: Wednesday, September 7<br />2021: Tuesday, September 14<br />2020: Tuesday, September 15<br />2019: Tuesday, September 10<br />2018: Wednesday, September 12<br />2017: Tuesday, September 12</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we know when the next one will take place, too. Apple has sent out <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2046187/wonderlust-event-invite-clues-colors-apple-watch-iphone-15-airpods.html\">invitations</a> to an event on September 12, 2023, and we’re expecting to see the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1351959/iphone-15-plus-pro-ultra-rumors-specs-release-price.html\">iPhone 15</a>, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, and possibly a new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1487037/iphone-15-pro-max-ultra-design-display-camera-price-rumors.html\">iPhone 15 Ultra</a> to replace the iPhone 14 Pro Max. We’re also likely to see the launch of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1472709/apple-watch-series-9-rumors-specs-features-price-release.html\">Apple Watch Series 9</a>. Could there be <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673885/airpods-pro-lite-release-date-price-specs-rumours.html\">new AirPods</a>? We’ll have to wait and see. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Late-fall event: October/November 2023 </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s late-fall event, held in October or November as a follow-up to the usually bigger September launch, isn’t guaranteed to happen. In 2022, for example, there were rumors about an October event, but Apple opted instead to issue press releases for the new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1371039/ipad-10th-generation-review.html\">10th-gen iPad</a> and M2 iPad Pro. Over the past six years, Apple has held a total of four late-fall events (including a double-header in 2020), so it’s anyone’s guess whether it’ll happen this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>2022: No event </li>\n\n\n\n<li>2021: Monday, October 18</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2020: Tuesday, October 13 <em>and</em> Tuesday, November 10</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2019: No event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2018: Tuesday, October 30</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2017: No event</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple traditionally uses its late-fall event to unveil new Macs and iPads, in contrast to the September event’s usual focus on the iPhone and Apple Watch. In 2023, that could mean the launch of the M3 chip, which could appear in the new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1511195/imac-apple-silicon-m2-m3-update-rumors.html\">24-inch iMac</a>, but we may be waiting until 2024 for that. Another contender for the late 2023 event is a rumored <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1835319/14-inch-ipad-pro-release-specs-features-price.html\">14-inch iPad Pro.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Apple events will take place in 2024?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the events we expect to see in 2024, and what could launch.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Spring event 2024 </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There were no Apple spring events in 2023 or 2020, but when they do happen, they can be significant. In spring 2022, Apple announced the iPhone SE 2, iPad Air, and Mac Studio and Studio Display; in 2021, we got the iMac, AirTag, and Apple TV 4K. And in 2019, the event was devoted to Apple’s services: Apple TV+, Apple News+, and Apple Arcade. Could there be an Apple spring event in 2024? It looks likely. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there is, the event will most likely take place on a Monday or Tuesday in March or April. Here’s when Apple has held its past few spring events:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>2023: No event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2022: Tuesday, March 8</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2021: Tuesday, April 20</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2020: No event due to Covid</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2019: Monday, March 25</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2018: Tuesday, March 27</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2017: No event</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We already know that Apple’s Vision Pro headset is set to launch in “early 2024” so a spring launch is entirely feasible. What else could we see? New AirPods, a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676817/homepod-with-screen-rumours-and-release-date.html\">HomePod with a screen</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676887/apple-games-console-rumours-and-release-date.html\">gaming device</a>? </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>WWDC: June 2024</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WWDC usually takes place in the first or second week of June. In 2023 the opening keynote was held on Monday, June 5. Apple announced three new Macs and the Vision Pro headset as well as revealing the features coming up in the various operating systems. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the keynote on the Monday, developer events and sessions will run throughout the week. You can read more about <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678333/wwdc-ios-macos-watchos-hardware-keynote.html\">WWDC date, times and everything you need to know</a> in a separate article.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>WWDC 2023: June 5-9</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WWDC 2022: June 6-10</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WWDC 2021: June 7-11</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WWDC 2020: June 22-26</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WWDC 2019: June 3-7</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WWDC 2018: June 4-8</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WWDC 2017: June 5-9</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple uses WWDC each year to unveil the latest versions of its operating systems, so in 2024 we’ll get a preview of iOS 18, iPadOS 18, macOS 15, watchOS 11, and tvOS 18, and possibly an update to Apple’s realityOS. New hardware sometimes makes an appearance at WWDC as well, as was the case in 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Fall event(s): September/October/November 2024</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The cycle will complete with the big iPhone event in September 2024 (there are rumors that the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2007943/iphone-16-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">iPhone 16</a> will be a major overhaul) and, possibly, iPad and Mac events in October and/or November. But this is a long way off so we won’t get into too much detail just yet.</p>\n\nApple Inc, iPad, iPhone, Mac, Personal Software</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"b5c06e2d3adf833f06dde99d33f2812f0c12054ef6a09cee49d9270f80a0f9b2","category":"Apple"}
