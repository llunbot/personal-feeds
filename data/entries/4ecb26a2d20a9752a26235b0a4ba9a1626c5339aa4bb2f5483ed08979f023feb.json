And I think it's very important that we stand up and say that very loudly,\" said Cook at the time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHowever, Pitruzzella said on Thursday the General Court ruling had \"committed a series of errors\" and \"failed to assess correctly the substance and consequences of certain methodological errors.\" Pitruzzella said the court needed \"to carry out a new assessment\" as a result.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nResponding to the opinion of the advocates-general, Apple said on Thursday that the lower court \"was very clear that Apple received no selective advantage and no State aid, and we believe that should be upheld.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAn ECJ ruling is expected next year.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/\">European Union</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-commission/\">European Commission</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ireland-tax-case/\">Apple-Ireland Tax Case</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/apple-could-pay-ireland-eu-tax-dispute/\">Apple Could Pay 'Total Political Crap' $14 Billion Tax Bill to EU After All</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-could-pay-total-political-crap-14-billion-tax-bill-to-eu-after-all.2410427/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4ecb26a2d20a9752a26235b0a4ba9a1626c5339aa4bb2f5483ed08979f023feb","category":"Apple"}
