{"title":"Will Apple Announce Any New Hardware at WWDC 2025 Next Week?","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/03/wwdc-2025-new-hardware-or-not/","date":1748962485000,"content":"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/\">WWDC 2025</a> is fast approaching, with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/02/apple-readies-wwdc-2025-live-stream/\">Apple's opening keynote</a> set to begin on Monday, June 9 at 10 a.m. Pacific Time. Apple always uses the annual developer conference to unveil the latest versions of its software platforms, with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/28/apple-ios-26/\">iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26, and visionOS 26</a> all expected to be announced next week. But a key question remains: will there be any hardware announcements too?\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/06/WWDC-2025-Apple-Logo.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nThe answer to that question is likely no. In his <em>Power On</em> newsletter last weekend, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/01/wwdc-2025-likely-smaller-scale/\">Apple has no major new devices ready to ship</a>, so there might not be any hardware announcements at WWDC 2025.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple could still surprise us on the hardware front, of course, and Gurman did not explicitly rule out smaller device announcements.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWWDC is always focused on software, but there are hardware announcements at the conference in some years. Most recently, Apple unveiled the Vision Pro and updated three Mac models at WWDC 2023. In 2024, however, it was a software-only affair.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe only rumored Apple product that might be imminent is an AirTag 2. Gurman previously said that he expected a new AirTag <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/24/airtag-2-mid-2025-rumor/\">to be released around mid-2025</a>, but he has not mentioned the accessory in a while, so it is unclear if that timeframe remains accurate. Even if an AirTag 2 is coming soon, there is no guarantee that it will be unveiled during the WWDC 2025 keynote, as Apple could opt to announce it with a press release only.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe majority of Macs have been updated since October 2024, with the only exception being the high-end Mac Pro desktop tower. The current Mac Pro is equipped with Apple's M2 Ultra chip, so in theory it could be updated with the M3 Ultra chip that debuted in the Mac Studio this year, but that has not been rumored. It is also looking <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/09/m4-ultra-chip-is-unlikely/\">unlikely that Apple will ever release an M4 Ultra chip</a>, so the Mac Pro's path forward is currently unclear.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLikewise, the entire iPad lineup has been updated since May 2024, so new iPad models are unlikely to be announced at WWDC 2025.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe next iPhone and Apple Watch models are expected to launch in September, as usual, while <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/12/homepod-mini-2-and-new-apple-tv-launch-timing/\">new Apple TV and HomePod mini models are rumored to launch in September or later this year</a>. AirPods Pro 3 are also rumored to launch later this year, at the earliest, while new AirPods Max are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/23/when-to-expect-airpods-max-2/\">not expected to launch until 2027</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere have been on-again, off-again rumors about a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/11/vision-pro-2-with-m5-may-not-launch-until-2026/\">Vision Pro 2 with an M5 chip</a>, but it is unclear if that would launch in 2025 or 2026.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA new version of Apple's standalone Studio Display with mini-LED backlighting has been rumored, but it is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/apple-mini-led-studio-display/\">not expected to launch until late 2025 or early 2026</a>. Apple's higher-end Pro Display XDR has not been updated since it first launched in 2019, but it is unclear if and when a new version of the display will be released.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLast, Apple's rumored smart home hub <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/09/apple-smart-home-hub-postponed/\">has been postponed</a> due to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/\">delayed Siri features</a>, so do not expect that device at WWDC 2025.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThat wraps up where things stand. As mentioned, though, a surprise or two is always possible.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe keynote will be streamed on Apple's website, in the Apple TV app, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/02/apple-readies-wwdc-2025-live-stream/\">on YouTube</a>. On-demand playback will be available afterwards.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/\">WWDC 2025</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8\">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/03/wwdc-2025-new-hardware-or-not/\">Will Apple Announce Any New Hardware at WWDC 2025 Next Week?</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/will-apple-announce-any-new-hardware-at-wwdc-2025-next-week.2458135/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"90365858f8f38ea251e394c3794442572b3137385b3d34cc0474c5b4514bc009","category":"Apple"}
