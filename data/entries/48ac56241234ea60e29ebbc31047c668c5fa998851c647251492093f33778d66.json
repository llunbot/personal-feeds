But a new leak claims it will be a lot different than we thought.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to longtime leaker <a href=\"https://x.com/evleaks\">Evan Blass on X</a>, the iPhone SE 4 will have a Dynamic Island instead of a notch. That contradicts basically every other rumor we’ve heard about the iPhone SE display, which has long been expected to have a notch. Apple first dropped the notch with the iPhone 14 Pro followed by the iPhone 15 a year later. Rumors have long claimed the iPhone SE 4 will be based on the iPhone 14, the last iPhone to have a notch.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/blass-iphone-se-leak.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"evan blass tweet showinh iphone se 4\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/blass-iphone-se-leak.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/blass-iphone-se-leak.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/blass-iphone-se-leak.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/blass-iphone-se-leak.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/blass-iphone-se-leak.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/blass-iphone-se-leak.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/blass-iphone-se-leak.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/blass-iphone-se-leak.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Granted, the rest of what we’ve heard about the iPhone SE 4 matches up with the iPhone 15, including a 48MP camera and USB-C. But if the iPhone SE 4 has a Dynamic Island, it changes everything we thought we knew about the phone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For one, Apple still sells the iPhone 15. If the iPhone SE 4 has the same design and display with a better chip, the only benefit of the iPhone 15 will be a secondary camera, which is a hard sell for a year-old phone that will likely cost $200 more and have a slower chip. And who would buy an iPhone 14 with a notch and a Lightning port when the brand-new iPhone SE 4 is cheaper?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Blass is correct, it likely means that Apple will change its iPhone strategy and distill the lineup down to just five models: the iPhone 16, 16 Plus, 16 Pro, 16 Pro Max, and iPhone SE 4. Or maybe <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2566753/why-apples-bizarre-iphone-se-name-change-actually-makes-sense.html\">16E</a>, though Blass also reports that the iPhone SE name will stick around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is expected to unveil the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1354114/iphone-se-4-design-specs-features-release-date.html\">iPhone SE 4</a> in March or April, possibly at a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1484151/apple-spring-event-date-time-how-to-watch-rumors.html\">spring event</a> alongside the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2158175/ipad-11th-gen-2025-release-date.html\">11th-gen iPad</a>.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"48ac56241234ea60e29ebbc31047c668c5fa998851c647251492093f33778d66","category":"Apple"}
