In a statement, Apple said software coming soon will clarify when notifications have been summarized by ‌Apple Intelligence‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/bbc-news-apple-intelligence-summaries-clean-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\n<blockquote>Apple Intelligence features are in beta and we are continuously making improvements with the help of user feedback. A software update in the coming weeks will further clarify when the text being displayed is summarization provided by Apple Intelligence. We encourage users to report a concern if they view an unexpected notification summary.</blockquote>\r<br />\nThe statement comes <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/06/bbc-calls-out-apple-ai-creating-fake-news-titles/\">following a <em>BBC News</em> complaint</a> over a pair of false notification headlines generated by ‌Apple Intelligence‌ on Friday. One notification claimed Luke Littler won a darts championship before the tournament had even begun, and another falsely suggested former tennis player Rafael Nadal had come out as gay. <em>BBC News</em> called on Apple to take action because the ongoing ‌Apple Intelligence‌ issue threatens consumer trust in news organizations.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAvailable on compatible devices in iOS 18.1 and later, ‌Apple Intelligence‌ notification summaries are designed to group multiple notifications from the same app together, providing a one-sentence overview of the content. These short summaries can cause problems when AI pulls the wrong details from news stories.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere have been several prior events where ‌Apple Intelligence‌ provided incorrect details from incoming news app notifications. In November, ‌Apple Intelligence‌ suggested Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had been arrested, incorrectly interpreting a story from <em>The New York Times</em>. Last month, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/19/apple-faces-criticism-new-notification-summaries/\">urged Apple to disable</a> the ‌Apple Intelligence‌ notification feature after a misleading headline suggesting murder suspect Luigi Mangione had shot himself. RSF said that \"generative AI services are still too immature to produce reliable information for the public.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌Apple Intelligence‌ notification summaries are an opt-in feature <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/ios-turn-off-notification-summaries/\">and they can be disabled</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/06/apple-intelligence-fake-headline-clarification/\">Apple Intelligence Update Will Add Clarification to Prevent Fake Headline Confusion</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-intelligence-update-will-add-clarification-to-prevent-fake-headline-confusion.2446830/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e88b3c5cdaffdfe8665a0078cacb3667782254c34e0be6aba0d0dcc5625dcc78","category":"Apple"}
