{"title":"Doctors find worms squirming through teen’s neck: A cautionary tale","link":"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/02/doctors-find-worms-squirming-through-teens-neck-a-cautionary-tale/","date":1740146697000,"content":"<p>Regardless of the state of the world—whether you're <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/the-new-yorker-radio-hour/the-aclu-vs-trump-20\">staring down a Constitutional crisis</a> or enjoying happier times, at ease on a beach—it's wise to remember that there will always be tiny worms with gaping mouths ringed by razor-sharp teeth ready to pierce your body, burrow into your skin, and tunnel through your flesh like an ambitious gopher in springtime.</p>\n<p>I'm referring, of course, to hookworms, the blood-feeding parasites aptly named for the hook-like heads they use to latch onto their victims.
