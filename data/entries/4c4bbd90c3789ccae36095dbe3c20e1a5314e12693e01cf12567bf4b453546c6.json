From the long straights before La Rivière-Thibouville, the lousy clouds burst like balloons above the peloton, pouring out their thick contents, mixed with hailstones that drummed in the wheels. There were not ten of them who had equipped themselves with raincoats.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So ran the opening of <em>L’Auto</em>’s race report of the 21st edition of Paris-Caen, held on 14th April 1935. One hundred and thirty riders had started the race under those heavy clouds. The wind was ferocious, the cold bone-numbing and the rain unrelenting. So atrocious were the conditions that, according to <em>Le Miroir des Sports</em>, the peloton was ‘pulverised into a quantity of small, helpless, frozen, unrecognisable sections, a sort of mud block advancing with difficulty on the narrow roads of the Norman bocage, usually so cheerful and today saddened by the grey sky and the bitter north wind’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With some 20km remaining of the 232km race, three men had emerged from the sodden pack and were at the front: Jean Noret, who had won the race the previous year and had been at the head of affairs since first breaking away from the peloton in an initial group of four with 115km to go; Léon Level, who had been dropped from the chasing group on the short but steep hills that punctuated the course but had managed to get back on before setting off in pursuit of Noret; and Maurice Archambaud, who was the only rider from that chasing group able to join Level in hunting down Noret. Level and Archambaud worked together and snared their prey.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>‘Noret thought he was safe from all danger and could not believe his eyes,’ reported <em>Le Miroir</em>. ‘The disappointment he felt must certainly have had an influence on his physical abilities, because he was not able to take the wheel of the snarling little Archambaud when the latter, who knew his chances in the sprint were extremely reduced, made a break that was to be decisive.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As it happened, neither Level nor Noret were able to follow Archambaud, leaving the 30-year-old two-time Tour de France stage winner to ride into the Venoix velodrome alone to record a 35-second victory over Noret, with Level coming in more than two minutes back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘This Archambaud is irresistible,’ wrote Jacques Goddet in <em>L’Auto</em>. ‘He is the man who can afford to have no sprint, since he might never need one. He gives the young André Leducq brand, equipped with Hutchinson tyres, its first major victory, and it is a new reward for the Saint-Étienne manufacturer, Mr Mercier, who has thrown the marvellous youthfulness of his two brands, André Leducq and Francis Pélissier, into the sporting battles of the road.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+2\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-2-970x300.webp\" alt=\"Cyclist banner saying 'get the magazine for people who love cycling, click here to subscribe'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-2-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-2-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-2-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-2-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-2-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-2-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-2-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>The birth of Mercier</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Mercier company had been founded by Emile Mercier, who started manufacturing components for pedals in 1919. Based in the industrial hotspot of Saint-Étienne, within five years the firm had moved into making frames. It would reach a production rate of more than 100,000 frames a year by 1933 before producing complete bicycles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keen to associate his products with notable figures from cycle racing, in 1933 Mercier teamed up with the Hutchinson tyre company and launched the Francis Pélissier-Mercier-Hutchinson branded outfit (Francis Pélissier being a three-time national champion and double Bordeaux-Paris winner in the 1920s). By 1935 Mercier had also launched the André Leducq brand (Leducq being a still-active two-time Tour winner who Mercier had tempted from Alcyon) as well as now sponsoring a team under the Mercier-Hutchinson name. Along with Leducq, Archambaud had joined from Alcyon for the 1935 season and was riding for the Leducq-branded outfit when he won that drenched Paris-Caen in April, recording Mercier’s first major race win.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/team-history-mercier-2-970x970.webp\" alt=\"Pro team history Mercier\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/team-history-mercier-2-970x970.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/team-history-mercier-2-300x300.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/team-history-mercier-2-150x150.webp 150w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/team-history-mercier-2-768x768.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/team-history-mercier-2-75x75.webp 75w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/team-history-mercier-2-350x350.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/team-history-mercier-2-750x750.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/team-history-mercier-2-1140x1140.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/team-history-mercier-2.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>Raymond Poulidor at the 1968 Tour de France. The man who finished on the podium eight times without winning the race spent his entire 18-year career with Mercier.</figcaption><figcaption>Getty Images</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Over the course of the following years Mercier would sign many notable riders who would record a number of important race wins: Roger Lapébie joined in 1937 and promptly won the Tour de France (while riding for the France national team); Marcel Kint won Paris-Roubaix in 1943; Rik Van Steenbergen won both the Tour of Flanders (1944, 1946) and Paris-Roubaix (1948, 1952) as well as the World Championships in 1949; and Louison Bobet won the Tour de France in 1955 (his third in a row but first for Mercier), Flanders in 1955 (the first Frenchman to do so), Paris-Roubaix in 1956 and Bordeaux-Paris in 1959.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the rider most synonymous with Mercier is Raymond Poulidor, who rode for the team for the entirety of his 18-year professional career. In March 1961, in just his second season, Poulidor was on the team bus on the way to the start of Milan-San Remo when sports director Antonin Magne stopped the bus at the foot of the Capo Berta and told him this was where the final selection could be made and he should make his move there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Poulidor’s race would be impacted by a puncture that, because of a closed level-crossing delaying his team car, meant he lost more than two minutes on the bunch. Demotivated, the Frenchman was on the verge of giving up, but encouraged by Magne he chased back on and then attacked out of the group on the Capo Berta, taking Ab Geldermans with him to join Jean-Claude Annaert who was at the head of the race.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pro-team-history-st-raphael\">Pro team history: St Raphaël</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pro-team-history-alcyon\">Pro team history: Alcyon</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-history-anquetil-and-poulidor-go-head-to-head\">Tour de France history: Anquetil and Poulidor go head to head on the Puy de Dôme</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>With pre-race favourite Rik Van Looy letting the move go and no one helping the chase for fear of towing Van Looy to the win, Poulidor struck out alone on the Poggio. Geldermans and Annaert were caught by the now animated chasing group but Poulidor managed to stay away. Despite taking a wrong turn as the finish neared, Poulidor, wearing Mercier’s now famous purple jersey, held on to record a three-second win ahead of Van Looy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘All my competitors checked me out and were happy to lose as long as I didn’t come in first,’ Van Looy said afterwards. ‘I didn’t win but it doesn’t matter, Poulidor won, a boy of great means who was able to take advantage of a favourable situation. I congratulate him but I can’t say that this Milan-San Remo was a great race.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Poulidor likely couldn’t have cared less whether it was a great race or not – he had his first major win and Magne immediately doubled his salary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Poulidor would go on to form a legendary rivalry with Jacques Anquetil, famously never managing to beat the five-time champion at the Tour. He came closest in 1964 when he finished second by 55 seconds during a race in which the two men went shoulder to shoulder on the Puy de Dôme climb, a moment captured in one of the race’s most famous images.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite his ill-deserved reputation as the ‘eternal second’, Poulidor would record many wins for Mercier – the Vuelta a España, Flèche Wallonne, GP des Nations, Paris-Nice and the Dauphiné among them. Mercier remained a title sponsor of pro teams until 1983, alongside other sponsors such as tyre maker Hutchinson, BP, Fagor and ice cream company Miko, before leaving the sport at the end of 1983.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"332\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-970x332.webp\" alt=\"Cyclist newsletter banner saying 'stay one step ahead of the pack, click here to sign up'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-970x332.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-300x103.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-768x263.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-1536x526.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-2048x701.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-750x257.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-3-1140x390.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pro-team-history-mercier\">Pro team history: Mercier</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"4c4bbd90c3789ccae36095dbe3c20e1a5314e12693e01cf12567bf4b453546c6","category":"Cycling"}
