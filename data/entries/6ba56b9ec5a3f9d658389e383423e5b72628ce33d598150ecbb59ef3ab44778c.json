It also sticks with a threaded bottom bracket shell, and can even accommodate an internally routed <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-dropper-posts/\" target=\"_blank\">dropper seatpost</a>.</p>\n<p>With clean lines, a simple frame and no mudguard or rack mounts, the bike stands apart from the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/gravel-bikes/specialized-diverge-comp-carbon-review/\">Specialized Diverge</a> and is – to quote Specialized – aimed at riders looking for “gravel enlightenment”.</p>\n<p>It probably won’t surprise you to hear that all of this comes at a, to put it mildly, very high premium, with the top-end S-Works model we’ve been testing coming in at $12,000 / £10,750 / €12,200 / AU$18,000. For that, you get Specialized’s top-end S-Works 12r carbon frameset, a full <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-road/sram-rockshox-xplr/\" target=\"_blank\">SRAM Red eTap AXS XPLR</a> groupset and Roval Terra CLX wheels.</p>\n<p>For those without bottomless pockets, the Pro, Expert and Comp bikes use the slightly heavier 10r layup, which adds a claimed 100g to the frame weight, but will save you a fair chunk of cash, with the cheapest build coming in at £4,000 / $4,200 / €4,000 / AU$6,300.</p>\n\n<h2>Laying down the facts on the layup</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The overall shape of the Crux is very smooth and, dare we say it, beautiful.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Compared to a modern carbon road bike, the Crux is quite organic in form, with the tubes flowing into each other smoothly. This contrasts with the more angular frame shapes seen on most road bikes, which usually appear in the name of aero gains.</p>\n<p>According to Specialized, on a typical frame, these angular areas require reinforcing layers of carbon. This is because carbon isn’t as strong when laid up over sharp angles.</p>\n<p>In comparison, Specialized claims the smoother overall design of the Crux allows it to use “longer, unbroken plies” that are laid up around and over the tube junctions in the frame.</p>\n<p>This means the frame requires fewer stiffening layers to maintain strength, reducing weight by a claimed 150g in the case of the Crux, compared to a conventionally designed frameset.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The lightest frame is said to weigh just 725g.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>All of this adds up to a claimed 725g frame weight for a size 56cm S-Works frame in the lightest paint job without hardware.</p>\n<p>To put that into context, it’s only 165g heavier than an equivalent Aethos frame, which is pretty remarkable when you consider the Crux is rated for off-road riding.</p>\n<p>It also has a fairly reasonable 125kg rider weight limit (although it’s important to note that the weight limit for some of the components specced on the complete bikes is 109kg).</p>\n<p>The cheaper 10r frame, which is used on the Pro, Expert and Comp level bikes, is claimed to weigh 825g in the same spec.</p>\n<p>The same 12r fork is shared across all bikes, and is claimed to weigh around 400g with a steerer cut for a 56cm frame.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, the frame has been slimmed down as much as possible, using the same lightweight thru axles and seat clamp as the Aethos.</p>\n<h2>Cleared to send</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The new bike will take tyres up to 2.1in wide.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Tyre clearance on the new Specialized Crux stands at 2.1in for 650b wheels, or 47mm for 700c wheels. This is the same as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/gravel-bikes/specialized-diverge-comp-carbon-review/\" target=\"_blank\">the Diverge</a>.</p>\n<p>A key marketing claim about the new Crux is that, for its (genuinely impressive) light weight, the bike features very large tyre clearances.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tyre clearance to weight ratio – what a time to be alive.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Taking both of these factors into consideration, it has produced a graph demonstrating the “clearance to weight ratio” of the Crux compared to similar bikes on the market.</p>\n<p>While we admit to doing a fairly intense eye roll when we first saw this, we have to give credit where it’s due – in the press pack for the bike, Specialized acknowledges with a tongue firmly planted in its marketing cheek that “the industry needs another standard” for comparing bikes.</p>\n<p>While ‘clearance to weight’ is unlikely to become a key buying decision for most riders, it’s still an interesting way to illustrate where the bikes sit in the overall market.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tyre clearances are as generous out back.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<h2>Specialized says no to integration</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Like the Aethos, the Crux sticks with a non-integrated front end.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Specialized</i></span></div>\n<p>The new Crux is designed to use a standard two-piece cockpit. The two top-spec bikes get the new-ish Roval Terra carbon handlebars, which boast an impressive 200g claimed weight, with cheaper models given alloy bars.</p>\n<p>Opting for a classic cockpit means the new Crux forgoes fully internal cable routing in favour of a lighter (and easier to maintain) semi-integrated solution.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> All cables are routed through a small port at the top of the down tube.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Cable routing on the frame is handled by a port that sits just behind the head tube at the top of the down tube. The bike uses full-length housing, which runs all the way around the bottom of the standard ISO-threaded <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-complete-guide-to-bottom-bracket-standards/\" target=\"_blank\">bottom bracket</a> cup.</p>\n<p>Up front, the brake hose enters the left leg of the fork just below the crown.</p>\n\n<h2>You can have whatever you want so long as it’s 1×</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Though you can run a 2× crankset, the bike is designed primarily to work with a 1× drivetrain.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>The new Crux is designed primarily to work with 1× drivetrains and all complete builds are specced with 1× SRAM drivetrains.</p>\n<p>However, the frame also includes an integrated front derailleur mount that will work with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/shimano-grx-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Shimano GRX</a> or eTap front derailleurs. The bike is not compatible with mechanical front derailleurs, nor will it work with Shimano road double cranksets (there’s more info on this in the section on using the new Crux as a cyclocross bike).</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The bike includes an integrated front-derailleur mount.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The top-end S-Works Crux is specced with a Roval Alpinist carbon seatpost, with cheaper models getting the slightly heavier Roval Terra carbon post. The bike also moves away from the integrated seatbinder seen on the old bike in favour of a good ol’ fashioned external seat clamp.</p>\n<p>For the shredders among you, the bike is also designed to work with any internally-routed 27.2mm dropper posts – though the likes of the wireless RockShox Reverb AXS will, of course, offer the easiest plug-and-play dropper solution.</p>\n<p>The bike has three bottle cage mounts, with the third sitting on the underside of the down tube towards the bottom bracket shell. As mentioned, there are no mudguard or rack mounts on the frame, nor does it have a top tube mount seen on many new gravel bikes.</p>\n<h2>New Specialized Crux geometry</h2>\n<div>\n

which was notably low and slack for a cyclocross bike anyway – but Specialized has made a few small tweaks on the new bike.</p>\n<p>To start, and in line with broader industry trends, reach has grown by roughly 10mm across the board (388mm vs 397mm for a 56cm bike compared to the old model).</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The geometry of the new bike has been tweaked subtly from the outgoing Crux.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Increasing reach allows riders to reduce their stem length, keeping weight distribution more biased towards the rear of the bike, which can improve handling in steep terrain.</p>\n<p>Trail has also been increased by a small amount, presumably to calm down steering at higher speeds.</p>\n<p>Finally, the bottom bracket drop has also been increased, though, thanks to the fatter tyres specced on the new Crux, the published effective bottom bracket height is essentially the same (the old bike was optimised to work best with 33mm tyres, which is the widest permitted by UCI rules for cyclocross racing).</p>\n<p>Otherwise, the geometry of the new bike is broadly the same, so those looking to upgrade from an older Crux are unlikely to find their position hugely different on the new bike.</p>\n<p>The new bike is available in six sizes compared to the old model’s seven, with shorter riders no longer able to get a size 46cm frame.</p>\n<p>With that said, the standover height of the new 49cm frame is actually considerably smaller than the old 46cm frame, coming in at 749mm on the new Crux vs 763mm for the old model.</p>\n<h2>Is the new Specialized Crux just a cyclocross bike?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The old Crux was designed explicitly as a cyclocross bike. The new Crux steps away from this completely.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Specialized</i></span></div>\n<p>The Crux was introduced in 2010 and, though many people turned it to gravel duties, it was designed nominally as a cyclocross bike.</p>\n<p>The new Crux makes a clean break with cyclocross specificity and Specialized will not offer the bike in a ‘cross-specific build. Despite this, the new bike will be used by the brand’s sponsored athletes, such as Zdeněk Štybar and Kata Blanka Vas, in cyclocross races.</p>\n<p>Why abandon ‘cross altogether with the new bike?</p>\n<p>Put simply, the market for dedicated cyclocross bikes is vanishingly small when compared to gravel, which by some brands’ measure is now their biggest category overall.</p>\n<p>Specialized was also keen to point out that serious cyclocross racers will likely have very specific requirements, and any stock build is unlikely to meet their needs.</p>\n<p>For sponsored athletes or those who are dead-set on building up a new Crux as a ‘cross bike, there’s still the option to build up their bike from a frameset (which is UCI-approved).</p>\n<p>An interesting note on compatibility for ‘cross racers: the new Crux frameset is designed to work primarily with 1× cranksets, but will also work with 2× Shimano GRX and SRAM 2× cranksets. It is, however, not compatible with 2× Shimano road cranksets due to clearance issues at the seatstays.</p>\n<p>Given top cyclocross racers sponsored by Shimano often choose to run its 2× road chainsets with close-spaced chainrings (this includes the aforementioned <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/specialized-custom-crux-zdenek-stybar/\">Stybar)</a>, this could result in some interesting builds, as GRX is only available with 48/31t chainrings.</p>\n<p>Will these riders opt for third-party chainrings for GRX cranks or will they all move to 1×? We look forward to finding out.</p>\n<h2>Specialized Crux pricing and range overview</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The top-end build will set you back a remarkable $12,000.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The range-topping Specialized S-Works Crux will set you back $12,000 / £10,750 / €12,200.</p>\n<p>For that, you get a pretty-much-best-of-everything build that includes a full SRAM Red eTap AXS XPLR groupset, carbon Roval Terra wheels and all manner of other lightweight goodness.</p>\n<p>Out of curiosity, we had a look back at the 2018 S-Works Crux, which cost $7,500 for a Dura-Ace 9170 Di2 build – that’s a 60 per cent increase.</p>\n<p>The changes aren’t quite so chasmic at the cheaper end of the price spectrum, with the Comp-level bike, which is specced with a SRAM Rival groupset coming in at $4,200. The previous-generation bike was  $3,200 for a broadly similar spec.</p>\n<p>It’s important to note we’re sort of comparing apples to oranges here – the new Crux uses a fairly novel construction method and a higher grade of carbon, whereas the older model used more traditional techniques. Specialized is also hardly alone here, with all brands <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/why-are-bikes-so-expensive/\" target=\"_blank\">increasing the price of their bikes</a> across the board (the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2022-trek-checkpoint/\" target=\"_blank\">new Trek Checkpoint</a> also has a top-end $12,000 build option, for example).</p>\n<h3>2021 Specialized
