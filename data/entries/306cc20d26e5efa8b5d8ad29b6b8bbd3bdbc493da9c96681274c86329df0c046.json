Make it smoother and stronger, and make it fit on more bikes, without giving up any of the adjustability. In fact, subtle tweaks make it more and easier to adjust, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A mountain bike version of trophy truck suspension was the goal, keeping your tires on the ground while the chassis floats smoothly above them. Fox thinks they’ve nailed it, calling the new Float X2 the definitive gravity shock, designed to pair perfectly with the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2025-fox-grip-dampers-deliver-better-faster-control/\">GRIP X2 fork dampers</a> that debuted in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s Monotube? Why does it Matter?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-float-x2-rear-shock-7.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2200\" height=\"1467\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-float-x2-rear-shock-7.webp\" alt=\"2026 fox float x2 rear shock shown on a mountain bike.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-float-x2-rear-shock-7.webp 2200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-float-x2-rear-shock-7-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-float-x2-rear-shock-7-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-float-x2-rear-shock-7-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-float-x2-rear-shock-7-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-float-x2-rear-shock-7-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-float-x2-rear-shock-7-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-float-x2-rear-shock-7-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With the prior twin tube design, which quite literally uses a tube inside a tube in the damping system, Fox essentially had to make some internals smaller or use up valuable air spring volume to hold more of the damping architecture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Switching to a monotube design gave them a lot more room to play with, so they made the air spring shaft bigger (1/2″ diameter, up from 3/8″) and more robust. That means it can better resist lateral and torsional loads from the mounting points, making it a stronger shock.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pressure Balancing is part of it</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-float-x2-rear-shock-2.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2200\" height=\"1650\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-float-x2-rear-shock-2.webp\" alt=\"2026 fox float x2 rear shock shown on a mountain bike.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-float-x2-rear-shock-2.webp 2200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-float-x2-rear-shock-2-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-float-x2-rear-shock-2-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-float-x2-rear-shock-2-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-float-x2-rear-shock-2-768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-float-x2-rear-shock-2-2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It also gave them more room for larger pistons and reduced the number of seals required, improving durability. The increased interior space also let them “pressure balance” the system, balancing forces on either side of the mid-valve so that it can react faster, making the shock much more responsive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pressure Balancing was a big part of the improved performance in their new fork dampers, and now they’ve achieved a similar feel in the shocks. (For a deep dive on Pressure Balancing, check our coverage of the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2025-fox-grip-dampers-deliver-better-faster-control/\">new GRIP Dampers</a> and our <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/podcast-99-fox-explains-grip-dampers/\">interview with Fox’s suspension engineer</a>)</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Trunnion shocks get better air springs</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-float-x2-rear-shock-6.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2200\" height=\"1467\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-float-x2-rear-shock-6.webp\" alt=\"2026 fox float x2 rear shock shown on a mountain bike.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-float-x2-rear-shock-6.webp 2200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-float-x2-rear-shock-6-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-float-x2-rear-shock-6-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-float-x2-rear-shock-6-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-float-x2-rear-shock-6-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-float-x2-rear-shock-6-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-float-x2-rear-shock-6-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-float-x2-rear-shock-6-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The design let them lower the compression ratio on trunnion shocks to match what’s on the eyelet versions. Oddly, with the 2nd gen Float X2, the trunnion version had more constraints on air volume size due in part to the twin tube design. Which meant a higher compression ratio, which meant it ramped up faster, making it less likely you’d be able to use all of your travel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, they have the same air volume no matter which mounting style you need, so performance is the same across the board. And, across the board, the Float X2 has the same air seal package as Float X, with a new volume spacer arrangement that allows 1cc steps.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The 4-way challenge</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-Float-X2-shock-22.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1915\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-Float-X2-shock-22.webp\" alt=\"2026 fox float x2 rear shock shown from various angles.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-Float-X2-shock-22.webp 2500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-Float-X2-shock-22-297x228.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-Float-X2-shock-22-1536x1177.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-Float-X2-shock-22-120x92.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-Float-X2-shock-22-768x588.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-Float-X2-shock-22-2048x1569.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Performance aside, the design itself is a big deal because it packages a dual-function rod through the main air piston rod, allowing for independent adjustment of high- and low-speed rebound…something that’s never been done before. Fox says this is the first-ever 4-way adjustable monotube mountain bike shock.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Transverse Reservoir Layout</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-float-x2-rear-shock-1.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2200\" height=\"1650\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-float-x2-rear-shock-1.webp\" alt=\"2026 fox float x2 rear shock shown on a mountain bike.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-float-x2-rear-shock-1.webp 2200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-float-x2-rear-shock-1-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-float-x2-rear-shock-1-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-float-x2-rear-shock-1-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-float-x2-rear-shock-1-768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-float-x2-rear-shock-1-2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Externally, the major update is a new transverse reservoir layout. The prior model aligned the external reservoir with the shock body, which bundled the IFP into the same tube as the compression damping circuits. In theory that made it all more compact, but the reality was that it jutted downward (or upward, depending on shock orientation) quite a bit, limiting frame fitment options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new transverse layout helps it fit around more/larger water bottles and range extender batteries on more bikes. Additionally, the IFP chamber is now separate, giving it more volume, which means more oil volume for better heat management.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Compression Damping is Better, Too</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-fox-Float-X2-internals-8-scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1909\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-fox-Float-X2-internals-8-scaled.webp\" alt=\"internal damper assembly in 2026 fox float x2 rear shock.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-fox-Float-X2-internals-8-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-fox-Float-X2-internals-8-297x221.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-fox-Float-X2-internals-8-1536x1145.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-fox-Float-X2-internals-8-120x89.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-fox-Float-X2-internals-8-768x573.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-fox-Float-X2-internals-8-2048x1527.webp 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>Left to Right: Complete damping &amp; piston assemblies; rebound damping circuit &amp; air spring piston; compression damping circuit.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Fox also updated the compression damping circuit. It has a lot more valves and shims, almost 50 of them, which is about double the prior version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They say it has more consistent, linear changes between clicks. It also has a broader range of adjustment on the compression base valve. Combined with the updated pressure-balanced design, it claims to have increased support without added harshness.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Better Control Knobs</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-fox-Float-X2-details.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1320\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-fox-Float-X2-details.webp\" alt=\"closeup details of control knobs on 2026 fox float x2 rear shock.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-fox-Float-X2-details.webp 2500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-fox-Float-X2-details-297x157.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-fox-Float-X2-details-1536x811.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-fox-Float-X2-details-120x63.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-fox-Float-X2-details-768x406.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-fox-Float-X2-details-2048x1081.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In total, you have 8 clicks of high-speed adjustments and 16 clicks of low-speed adjustments for both compression and rebound. And, as a bonus all control knobs are aligned so that when they point straight along the body of the shock, they are centered in their adjustment, making it easy to see where you’re at at a glance. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New DHX2 Coil Shock</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-float-DHX2-rear-shock-3.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2200\" height=\"1467\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-float-DHX2-rear-shock-3.webp\" alt=\"2026 fox float dhx2 coil spring rear shock on a mountain bike being ridden downhill.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-float-DHX2-rear-shock-3.webp 2200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-float-DHX2-rear-shock-3-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-float-DHX2-rear-shock-3-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-float-DHX2-rear-shock-3-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-float-DHX2-rear-shock-3-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-float-DHX2-rear-shock-3-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-float-DHX2-rear-shock-3-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2026-fox-float-DHX2-rear-shock-3-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The coil-spring DHX2 gets all of the same damper and architecture updates, plus a few of its own.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-Fox-Float-DHX2-internals-scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"2355\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-Fox-Float-DHX2-internals-scaled.webp\" alt=\"2026 fox float dhx2 coil spring rear shock.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-Fox-Float-DHX2-internals-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-Fox-Float-DHX2-internals-297x273.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-Fox-Float-DHX2-internals-1536x1413.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-Fox-Float-DHX2-internals-120x110.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-Fox-Float-DHX2-internals-768x707.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MY26-Fox-Float-DHX2-internals-2048x1884.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The main shaft is steel and also now 1/2″ (12.7mm) diameter.
