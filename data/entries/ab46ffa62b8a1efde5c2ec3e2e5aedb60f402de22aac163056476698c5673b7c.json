Researchers at the University of Hull <a href=\"https://ras.ac.uk/news-and-press/news/want-spot-deepfake-look-stars-their-eyes\">recently unveiled</a> a novel method for detecting AI-generated deepfake images by analyzing reflections in human eyes. The technique, presented at the <a href=\"https://nam2024.hull.ac.uk/\">Royal Astronomical Society's National Astronomy Meeting</a> last week, adapts tools used by astronomers to study galaxies for scrutinizing the consistency of light reflections in eyeballs.</p>\n\n<p>Adejumoke Owolabi, an MSc student at the University of Hull, headed the research under the guidance of <a href=\"https://www.hull.ac.uk/staff-directory/kevin-pimbblet\">Dr. Kevin Pimbblet</a>, professor of astrophysics.</p>\n<p>Their detection technique is based on a simple principle: A pair of eyes being illuminated by the same set of light sources will typically have a similarly shaped set of light reflections in each eyeball. Many AI-generated images created to date don't take eyeball reflections into account, so the simulated light reflections are often inconsistent between each eye.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038332#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038332&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ab46ffa62b8a1efde5c2ec3e2e5aedb60f402de22aac163056476698c5673b7c","category":"Tech"}
