The tower PCs announced today are 42 percent larger and have a new thermal design that flattens the previous version's bumpy, weave-like ventilation grille into a square-filled design reminiscent of waffles. The beefier chassis—which measures 27 L, compared to its predecessor's 19 L—makes way for Intel's latest 12th-Gen Alder Lake CPUs and Nvidia's and AMD's most powerful graphics cards.</p>\n<p>The top-line CPU option is the powerful Intel Core i9-12900K—and when we say powerful, we mean it. The chip is a 125 W, overclockable, 16-core, 24-thread CPU with 30MB of cache and a 3.2 GHz clock speed that can boost to 5.2 GHz. The prior XPS Desktop came with up to an i9-11900K, which is also 125 W but with fewer cores (although performance may vary due to the 12th Gen chip's mix of performance and efficiency cores, threads, and cache and higher clock speeds (3.5 / 5.3 GHz).</p>\n<p>Options for graphics go up to an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 or an <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/10/amds-newest-graphics-cards-rdna2-power-from-579-999/\">AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT</a>. You can add up to an incredible 128GB of DDR5-3600 RAM (across four 32GB sticks), twice the memory offered by the last-gen XPS Desktop. The PC packs up to 4TB of storage, courtesy of a 2TB SSD and 2TB HDD. Fuel for all that computing horsepower comes from a 750 W power supply.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1807984#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1807984&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0d0b5098bea6813cfe977dcff8c8363cede54d6f42fc128d0500a871f9cae632","category":"Tech"}
