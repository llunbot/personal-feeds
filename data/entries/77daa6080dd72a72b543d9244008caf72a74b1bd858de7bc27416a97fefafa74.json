Meanwhile the Montréal race boasts nearly 4,000 meters of altitude gain, and is always a race of attrition. </p>\n<p>On paper Pogačar was only one of many favourites in Québec, as the race often finishes with a pack of nearly 50 riders sprinting towards the line. But that didn't stop him from trying to turn the tables on the sprinters with a blistering attack on the final climb.</p>\n<p>Defending champion Arnaud De Lie, was the first to follow, and while the initiative was soon stifled, the Belgian had little left for the sprint, and could only watch as Australian Michael Matthews stormed to his third win here in Québec. </p>\n<p>Pogačar however, was clearly on a level all his own in Montréal, attacking with nearly two laps to go, for a romping, stomping, solo victory. Clearly the Slovenian has recovered from his Giro d'Italia, Tour de France double this summer and is ready for Worlds.</p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/02Pogacar03_Training_Quebec_GP_Quebec_09_2024_1024x1024.jpg?v=1726444689\" /></div>\n<p>What better way to get over jet lag than a 100-kilometre training ride.
