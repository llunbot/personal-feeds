The mismatch between a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK532978/\">vestibular system</a> telling your body it's standing still and a VR headset telling your eyes that you're moving often causes an almost instant upset stomach for many VR users.</p>\n<p>For years, VR games and experiences have tried to mitigate this problem with software tricks, such as movement by \"teleportation\" and \"snap\" turning that jumps in sharp, discrete angles. But these solutions come with their own problems for games in which smoother walking motion and free rotation are important.</p>\n<p>Rather than focusing on software, Neurosync has decided to use hardware to try to solve this problem. The company's C-Infinity \"VR Locomotion Platform\" (which is currently <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cinfinity/c-infinity-revolutionary-vr-gaming\">wrapping up a successful Kickstarter campaign</a>) promises to \"effectively reduc[e] motion sickness while delivering an unparalleled true sense of movement... while also reducing fatigue.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2004935#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2004935&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2bd3d2f156c600919140d98064d9ade7a4d58e63d03a38795f300dd8b531f92d","category":"Tech"}
