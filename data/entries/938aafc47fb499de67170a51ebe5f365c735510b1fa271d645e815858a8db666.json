If informed speculation is correct, the test launch from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station this week—performed in partnership between the Army and the Navy—could be a full-scale test of the new solid-fueled hypersonic missile to propel a hypersonic glide vehicle to high speeds over the Atlantic Ocean.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1965563#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1965563&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"938aafc47fb499de67170a51ebe5f365c735510b1fa271d645e815858a8db666","category":"Tech"}
