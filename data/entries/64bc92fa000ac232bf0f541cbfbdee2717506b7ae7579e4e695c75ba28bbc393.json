It was as if the day came with a ready-made script, the opportunity to put on one last show in front of family and friends on home roads, and Pinot followed his lines with the dedication of a trained actor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pinot, by his own admission, does not win much. In the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/netflix-unchained-review\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Tour de France: Unchained</em></a> docuseries, with the camera trained on his face, he spoke in French: ‚ÄòSometimes I feel like I‚Äôm more popular than I am talented. There are days when I wish I got less love and more wins.‚Äô The hopes of a nation have been a weight on his shoulders. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pinot is more than just popular to a lot of the people who line the roadsides ‚Äì he is beloved, that much is evident. His dedicated fan club of Collectif Ultras Pinot (the term ‚Äòultras‚Äô is commonly associated with passionate football fans), the French Federation of Lose (that celebrates the ‚Äòlosers‚Äô as opposed to winners in French sport), and Parions Sport (the betting brand of team sponsor FDJ) united to give the rider a memorable send off. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two-time French national champion and former teammate of Pinot, Arthur Vichot, was also seen with a beer in hand, leading the chants on Petit Ballon. From the break of dawn til late afternoon, their enthusiasm never waned as they waited for the peloton. Speakers blasted music, megaphones amplified praise for their favourite rider, and FDJ shirts were the attire of choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fans didn‚Äôt throw a dart at the map and choose a random location on the route from Belfort to Le Markstein Fellering. On the Category 1 Petit Ballon climb (9km, 8.1%) is a bend listed as a ‚Äòplace of worship‚Äô on Google Maps. 1.8km before the summit comes the <em>Virage Pinot</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><p>Arthur Vichot est une putain de l√©gende. <a href=\"https://t.co/fUVoe0pGaA\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/fUVoe0pGaA</a></p>‚Äî Charly M.

On those familiar roads, he kicked away from the chasing group and buried himself in the breakaway group. Into the final 32km, with the peloton‚Äôs gap sneaking to under a minute, Pinot notched up the pace on the penultimate climb of the day. One metre. Two metres. Three metres. Neither fellow countryman Warren Barguil nor <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/tom-pidcock-descending-safa-brian\" target=\"_blank\">daredevil descender Tom Pidcock</a> could attach themselves to his wheel.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/thibaut-pinot-lapierre-xelius-tour-de-france\">Thibaut Pinot‚Äôs 2023 Tour de France bike: Lapierre Xelius SL3</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/5-best-thibaut-pinot\">Cyclist‚Äôs 5 favourite Thibaut Pinot moments</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/why-we-love-thibaut-pinot\">Thibaut Pinot, an inspiration to us all</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>A lone figure cut through the air. Solo at the head of the race, yet not isolated in spirit. The cacophony swelled and banners were raised as the local hero climbed through swathes of spectators on the climb, though a parting sea of fans at Virage Pinot and beyond the Petit Ballon summit. Here, they waved and cheered with such force that you would be forgiven for thinking they had just woken up, fresh and ready to tackle the day. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But no; they had been waiting for many, many hours with beverages flowing, fancy dress donned, chants perfected and spirits high. The energy was electric as a roar pushed Pinot up and over the mountain, a one-man show on the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><p><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f525.png\" alt=\"üî•\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f525.png\" alt=\"üî•\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f525.png\" alt=\"üî•\" /> Merci Thibaut <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f525.png\" alt=\"üî•\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f525.png\" alt=\"üî•\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f525.png\" alt=\"üî•\" /><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TDF2023?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">#TDF2023</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThibautPinot?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">@ThibautPinot</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/waXVhEK9ze\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/waXVhEK9ze</a></p>‚Äî Tour de France<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"‚Ñ¢\" /> (@LeTour) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LeTour/status/1682759067461206017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">July 22, 2023</a></blockquote> </div>\n\n\n\n<p>Stage honours would eventually go to a resurgent Tadej Pogaƒçar. Pinot crossed the line 33 seconds down. Perhaps the most fitting of finales to his Tour de France. Winning the stage be damned, he‚Äôs a champion when it comes to evoking such powerful emotions along the way and racing with his heart. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>His last dance was rewarded with the combativity award for the day. As a result, he would cross the line on the Champs-√âlys√©es for the final stage with a gold number on his back.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><p>La boucle est boucl√©e <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1faf6.png\" alt=\"ü´∂\" /> <a href=\"https://t.co/TiP6m4I9G2\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/TiP6m4I9G2</a></p>‚Äî F√©d√© <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f1eb-1f1f7.png\" alt=\"üá´üá∑\" /> de la Lose (@FFLose) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FFLose/status/1683177564607479808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">July 23, 2023</a></blockquote> </div>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of the season, Pinot will retire. He can fully embrace his life on the farm, tending to baby goats and caring for his donkeys, enjoying his retirement as a former professional rider. He isn‚Äôt withdrawing from cycling completely, however.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><p>Au revoir ‚Ä¶ le virage ne mourra pas, l‚Äôan prochain on sera l√† , je serai avec vous !
