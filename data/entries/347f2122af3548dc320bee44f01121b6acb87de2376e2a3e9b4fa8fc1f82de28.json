{"title":"Apple Introduces New MacBook Upgrade Program for Business Partners","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/29/apple-macbook-upgrade-program-businesses/","date":1638200281000,"content":"In association with CIT as the financing partner, Apple has <a href=\"https://landing.cit.com/mac-upgrade.html?t=SMB_MAC-FINANCNING_202111\">launched a new Mac Upgrade Program</a> for small businesses and Apple business partners that allow companies to easily distribute and upgrade their fleets of MacBooks at an affordable price to all of their workers.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/Mac-Notebook-Upgrade-Program-16x9.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAs outlined on CIT's website, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MaxWinebach/status/1465326203049414656?s=20\">shared by Max Weinbach</a>, Apple Business Partners can distribute the 13-inch MacBook Pro, 13-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a>, 14-inch MacBook Pro, and 16-inch MacBook Pro to their staff for only 3% of their retail list prices as monthly installments. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros are offered at $60 and $75 per month, respectively, while the 13-inch MacBook Pro and ‌MacBook Air‌ are offered at $30 and $39 monthly payments. No Mac desktop is provided as part of the program.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhile details are scarce, CIT's website says that small businesses can apply for the program through the website, and if approved, Apple will process and ship the Mac orders. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nA similar program exists for regular customers with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> Upgrade Program, where customers can get the latest ‌iPhone‌ for one monthly price. The program has been a popular financing option for customers. A Mac Upgrade Program is not offered publicly to regular customers, and it's important to note that customers less often upgrade their Mac computers, so a program in that regard may make less sense.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro-13/\">13\" MacBook Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">14 &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_13\">13\" MacBook Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">14\" &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">MacBook Air (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/29/apple-macbook-upgrade-program-businesses/\">Apple Introduces New MacBook Upgrade Program for Business Partners</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-introduces-new-macbook-upgrade-program-for-business-partners.2325478/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=IUMhO_zmbzA:xk_ncRj6VcU:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=IUMhO_zmbzA:xk_ncRj6VcU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"347f2122af3548dc320bee44f01121b6acb87de2376e2a3e9b4fa8fc1f82de28","category":"Apple"}
