What's different in this particular case is that Weibo-based leakers <a href=\"https://weibo.com/5821279480/PfKGMhlUC\">Fixed Focus Digital</a>, <a href=\"https://weibo.com/5673255066/PfKNCANbc\">Ice Universe</a>, and <a href=\"https://weibo.com/6048569942/PfKLpEeBk\">Digital Chat Station</a> have all backed the accuracy of the CAD image, based on their own information from Apple's supply chain in China. \"The appearance is basically like this,\" commented Digital Chat Station in reference to the image. It might just be time to get used to this new look.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"The CAD renders are quite accurate,\" said Fixed Focus Digital. \"Let me add a bit more detail: The iPhone 17 Pro models will most likely use a combination of materials â€” specifically, a glass section for the logo area integrated into an overall metal chassis.\" This appears to explain the red areas on the iPhone 17 Pro models in the image. Indeed, rumors do suggest Apple plans to go with a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/25/first-iphone-17-pro-design-leak/\">half glass, half aluminum build</a>, which would increase durability. The glass would allow wireless charging to continue to be available, but a partial aluminum frame would be less prone to breakage. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has also reportedly tested a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/iphone-17-pro-reverse-charging-feature/\">wireless reverse charging feature</a> for the iPhone 17 Pro models that would make the iPhone capable of delivering power to other Apple devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple plans to significantly revamp the camera design on its upcoming iPhone 17 Pro models, moving away from the familiar square camera bump to a distinctive aluminum camera bar that spans the device's width, according to recent reports.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe redesign extends to the new iPhone 17 Air model, which is set to replace the Plus variant in Apple's lineup. This thinner device will allegedly feature a similar horizontal camera bar design, though it will accommodate just a single camera lens.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn contrast, the base iPhone 17 is expected to maintain the current camera design language seen in the iPhone 16 series, helping to further differentiate Apple's premium and standard offerings.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple supply chain analyst Jeff Pu earlier this month said the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max will all be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/18/iphone-17-pro-models-aluminum-frame-rumor/\">equipped with aluminum frames</a>. However, Pu expects Apple's rumored iPhone 17 Air model to have a titanium frame. Apple introduced titanium as a feature for its Pro models in 2023, but Pu said Apple plans to use aluminum for the iPhone 17 Pro models due to environmental considerations.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhat do you think of the alleged changes in this year's iPhone 17 series? Let us know in the comments. Apple is anticipated to unveil the iPhone 17 lineup during its traditional September launch window.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17/\">iPhone 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/\">iPhone 17 Air</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-pro/\">iPhone 17 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/majin-bu/\">Majin Bu</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/24/revealed-entire-iphone-17-lineups-camera-designs/\">Revealed: Entire iPhone 17 Lineup's Striking New Camera Designs</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/revealed-entire-iphone-17-lineups-striking-new-camera-designs.2450059/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a203c24d8c7accada1fc224caa7a40f25086439f9352b886e0edad822678e6b8","category":"Apple"}
