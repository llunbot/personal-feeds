Here’s what we know so far.</p>\n<h2>1) It’s not the Merida Scultura GR</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Matej Mohorič rides unreleased Merida Silex to UCI Gravel World Championships victory\" title=\"Matej Mohorič rides unreleased Merida Silex to UCI Gravel World Championships victory\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Matej Mohorič went solo in the final 20km to win on this unreleased Merida Silex.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tom Hardie / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>First, let’s start with the obvious – this isn’t the new Merida Scultura Endurance GR, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/eurobike-2023-gallery/\">launched back in June</a>.</p>\n<p>On paper, that bike might have served as the ideal ride for the Gravel Worlds. It was described as the “latest gravel-racing-specific addition to the Merida line-up” upon its release.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Merida Scultura Endurance GR\" title=\"Merida Scultura Endurance GR\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Merida launched the Scultura Endurance GR gravel race bike (pictured) in June, but Mohorič rode the new Merida Silex at the UCI Gravel World Championships.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Nick Clark / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>In fact, Merida went as far as saying the Scultura Endurance GR will “sit alongside the more adventure and bikepacking-focussed Silex and offer the perfect machine for one-day gravel races and fast-paced gravel sessions”.</p>\n<p>It looks like some of Mohorič’s Bahrain–Victorious trade teammates were on the Scultura Endurance GR, but not the eventual race winner.</p>\n<h2>2) The sloping top tube remains, but with an updated geometry?</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Matej Mohorič rides unreleased Merida Silex to UCI Gravel World Championships victory\" title=\"Matej Mohorič rides unreleased Merida Silex to UCI Gravel World Championships victory\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The new Silex appears to sport a more aggressive shape than its predecessor.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tom Hardie / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The original Silex, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/merida-pushes-boundaries-of-gravel-bike-geometry-with-new-silex/\">which arrived in 2017</a>, is easily recognisable thanks to its heavily sloping top tube. At the time, Merida was among the brands pushing the boundaries of the fast-emerging gravel discipline with a geometry inspired by its mountain bike range.</p>\n<p>Fast-forward to 2023 and the refreshed Silex’s sloping top tube remains, but the new bike appears to have a more aggressive layout than the original bike.</p>\n<p>That said, we’ve only seen Mohorič’s bike so far and, as this is an unreleased bike, there’s no word from Merida.</p>\n<h2>3) There’s a new head tube design</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Matej Mohorič rides unreleased Merida Silex to UCI Gravel World Championships victory\" title=\"Matej Mohorič rides unreleased Merida Silex to UCI Gravel World Championships victory\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The new Silex has an updated head tube.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tom Hardie / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Take a closer look at the head tube and Mohorič’s Silex sports a new shape.</p>\n<p>The trailing edge of the old Silex’s head tube (pictured below) is a much more angular affair, with the new Silex looking like it fills some of that void, possibly in a bid to improve aerodynamics.</p>\n<p>Mohorič’s head tube also appears to be more compact, in stack, than what we’re used to seeing on the Silex – but again, we’ve only seen the one bike, in one size.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pack shot of the Merida Silex+ 6000 gravel bike\" title=\"Merida Silex+ 6000\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The existing Silex (pictured) has a shallow, more angular head tube.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Robert Smith / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Otherwise, the ever-so-slightly bulbous leading edge of the Silex’s head tube appears to remain.</p>\n<p>Finally, as far as the head tube is concerned, we can’t help but smile at the big old race number slapped across the front of Mohorič’s bike.</p>\n<p>Is this a gran fondo or a race for a rainbow jersey?</p>\n<h2>4) The fork is new, too</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Matej Mohorič rides unreleased Merida Silex to UCI Gravel World Championships victory\" title=\"Matej Mohorič rides unreleased Merida Silex to UCI Gravel World Championships victory\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Has Merida increased the tyre clearance beyond the 42c offered by the existing Silex?</span></figcaption><span> <i>Tom Hardie / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>While we’re at the front end of the bike, there’s a new fork, too.</p>\n<p>The new fork runs straight from top to bottom, rather than kinking to a vertical finish at the drop-outs, as is the case on its predecessor.</p>\n<p>There’s an additional eyelet on the fork, too – we’ll come on to this – and clearance looks to have increased.</p>\n<p>The existing Silex has room for 42c  <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-tyres/\">gravel tyres</a>.
