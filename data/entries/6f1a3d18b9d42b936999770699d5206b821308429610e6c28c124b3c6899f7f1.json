Today's ad focuses on the 4K 120 frames per second Dolby Vision video recording feature that is exclusive to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a> and ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nThe minute-long ad shows several slow motion shots, including a wind storm, an astronaut floating in space, an arrow flying through the air, a car crash, and more.
