These \"elevated voltage events can accumulate over time,\" eventually damaging the processor and causing system hangs or crashes.</p>\n<p>Intel has developed a microcode update to fix those elevated voltage requests, but the bad news for some users is that they will require a BIOS update, and they can't be deployed via software updates as some microcode fixes can be.</p>\n<p>Intel says that in most cases, CPU performance should be essentially unaffected by the patch, though the company did notice a handful of benchmark subscores and individual games that exhibited \"moderate\" slowdown (though we don't know how much that is, in concrete terms). Here's the relevant statement about performance:</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042246#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2042246&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"66e242f233d9519253dcb1a2d6d3f7eb476b0a7a2c5e69f372ff68b844300e6e","category":"Tech"}
