In <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-carplay/\">SharePlay was added to CarPlay</a>, allowing everyone in the car to contribute songs to a shared playlist.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOn the ‌HomePod‌ and the ‌Apple TV‌, the SharePlay feature allowed users to generate a QR code (on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> for ‌HomePod‌) that could be scanned to give friends and family members the option to play songs on the device. The ‌HomePod‌ or ‌Apple TV‌ owner was required to have an ‌Apple Music‌ subscription, but those contributing content simply needed the Music app without a subscription.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is not clear if Apple will return the SharePlay feature to the ‌HomePod‌ or ‌Apple TV‌ ahead of the launch of the iOS 17.4 and tvOS 17.4 updates, but so far, SharePlay has been missing from the past two beta releases.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 17.4 and tvOS 17.4 are set to come out in March.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>(Thanks, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hiddecollee7\">Hidde</a>!)</em><div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/shareplay/\">SharePlay</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100\">Apple TV and Home Theater</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242\">iPadOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/14/apple-removes-shareplay-apple-tv-homepod/\">Apple Removes HomePod SharePlay Feature From iOS 17.4 and tvOS 17.4 Betas</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-removes-homepod-shareplay-feature-from-ios-17-4-and-tvos-17-4-betas.2419465/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3de1f473a85e3867a73822cbd161a9cc3298cc290ee0bdd91bd6e9251d1f6ef0","category":"Apple"}
