These are the company’s most advanced handsets ever, featuring the latest processors, upgraded cameras, and new titanium and aluminum designs. But if you’re lucky enough to own one of these luxurious new devices, it’s crucial that you find the right case to protect it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why? Because, for all the physical advances made in each iPhone generation, from the Ceramic Shield on their screens to their titanium bodies, current smartphone design simply cannot stand up to one moment of carelessness or bad luck. The phone slips from your hand, it lands at an awkward angle, and your $1,000+ device is permanently marred by a cracked screen or a badly chipped chassis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than depending on your phone being tough, then, it makes far more sense to choose a case that will protect it from drop and scratch damage. And it would be even better if the case could incorporate a clever feature that makes it less likely to get dropped (or lost) in the first place. That’s where Speck comes in.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why Speck makes the right iPhone 15 case for you</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The new iPhones all support Apple’s popular MagSafe standard, a neat feature which ensures they attach themselves magnetically to compatible charging pads and other accessories. But Speck has come up with a way to make MagSafe even more secure. It’s called <a href=\"https://speckproducts.com/collections/clicklock-no-slip-interlock-for-magsafe?utm_source=macworld&amp;utm_medium=sparticle&amp;utm_campaign=clicklock\">ClickLock™</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one potential problem with MagSafe is <em>slipping</em>. While the magnetic connection resists powerfully when you pull the iPhone directly away from the charging pad, it’s far easier to break the connection by moving it laterally; you can easily–or accidentally–slide the iPhone sideways until it slips right off the pad and breaks the connection. ClickLock removes this issue by introducing a moving ‘bolt’ that clicks into place when the magnet is engaged. The bolt, on the accessory side, is pulled forward into a niche on the iPhone case side, ensuring an even stronger fit with no possibility of lateral slipping.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that ClickLock isn’t something that’s offered by even the latest iPhones out of the box; this is exclusive to cases made by Speck. However, ClickLock cases can still be used with standard MagSafe accessories, albeit without the additional benefits of the mechanical locking feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, while ClickLock is an innovative way to enhance MagSafe, Speck doesn’t stop there. Its iPhone cases are made to the highest standards of design and functionality. And of the 169 new cases the company has announced for the iPhone 15 range, 57 feature ClickLock, which means there’s sure to be a look, and a degree of protection, to suit your tastes. Whether you want the subtle elegance of the <strong>Presidio Perfect-Clear</strong> cases (from $39.95), or the 13-foot drop-tested protection, raised-bezel screen and camera guards, anti-scratch coating, and Microban antimicrobial product protection of the ultra-tough <strong>Presidio2</strong> (also from $39.95), there’s an iPhone 15 case here for you.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Presidio2-Grip-MagSafe-with-ClickLock-Bleached-Bone.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Presidio2 Grip MagSafe with ClickLock Bleached Bone\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Presidio2-Grip-MagSafe-with-ClickLock-Bleached-Bone.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1280w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Presidio2-Grip-MagSafe-with-ClickLock-Bleached-Bone.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Presidio2-Grip-MagSafe-with-ClickLock-Bleached-Bone.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Presidio2-Grip-MagSafe-with-ClickLock-Bleached-Bone.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Presidio2-Grip-MagSafe-with-ClickLock-Bleached-Bone.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Presidio2-Grip-MagSafe-with-ClickLock-Bleached-Bone.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" /></figure><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://speckproducts.com/collections/iphone-15-pro-cases-for-2023/products/presidio2-grip-magsafe-with-clicklock-iphone-15-pro-cases&amp;xcust=1-1-2120739-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Speck</a></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>An entire ecosystem of ClickLock accessories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>But wait!
