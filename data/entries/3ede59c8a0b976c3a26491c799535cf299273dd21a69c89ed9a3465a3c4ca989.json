Apple has likely bumped up the date so that people can watch the episode during the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday, November 28.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs astute Apple TV+ viewers know, this actually means the episode should be available to watch as early as Tuesday, November 26 at 9 p.m. Eastern Time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"Silo\" follows the last 10,000 people on Earth, all of whom live in a massive underground bunker to escape the seemingly toxic and deadly world outside. The people are unaware of why the silo was built, and those who seek the truth face deadly consequences. Rebecca Ferguson stars as Juliette Nichols, an engineer who attempts to unravel the mysteries surrounding the silo following a loved one's murder. The sci-fi series is based on Hugh Howey's best-selling book series. Ferguson and Howey both serve as executive producers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple TV+ costs $9.99 per month or $99 per year in the U.S., and the streaming service is also included in all Apple One subscription bundles.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/\">Apple TV Plus</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/22/apple-tv-plus-releasing-next-silo-episode-early/\">Apple TV+ Releasing Next Week's 'Silo' Episode Early</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-tv-releasing-next-weeks-silo-episode-early.2443720/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3ede59c8a0b976c3a26491c799535cf299273dd21a69c89ed9a3465a3c4ca989","category":"Apple"}
