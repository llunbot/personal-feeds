As noted by <em><a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2023/12/06/itunes-movies-and-tv-shows-app-discontinued-apple-tv/\">9to5Mac</a></em>, in the release candidate version of tvOS 17.2, opening up those apps redirects users to the ‌Apple TV‌ app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/12/apple-tv-itunes-purchases.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nThe ‌Apple TV‌ app supports both movie and TV show purchases, making the old iTunes Movies and iTunes TV Shows apps unnecessary and also confusing to some ‌Apple TV‌ users.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"iTunes Movies and Your Purchases Have Moved,\" reads the text in the iOS 17.2 release candidate. \"You can buy or rent movies and find your purchases in the ‌Apple TV‌ app.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/24/apple-tv-app-revamp/\">in October said</a> that Apple planned to remove the standalone ‌Apple TV‌ apps available for renting and purchasing TV shows and movies, and he also said that the TV show and movie sections would be removed from the iTunes Store app on iPhones and iPads.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile Apple has indeed started the process of eliminating its iTunes TV Shows and iTunes Movies apps on ‌Apple TV‌, the apps do still exist in the RC in order to provide customers with instructions on where to find their content going forward. Apple will likely remove the apps entirely in the near future.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOn the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, the iTunes Store app continues to offer TV show and movie purchases right alongside the ‌Apple TV‌ app, but the option to purchase that content may soon be removed from the iTunes Store app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\ntvOS 17.2 also includes a sidebar that houses content from both Apple's services and streaming services that integrate with the tvOS Watch Now feature. The sidebar makes it easier to access a range of content, and there are dedicated sections for Search, Watch Now, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/\">Apple TV+</a>, Sports, Library, and the Store for purchases.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to release tvOS 17.2 to the public next week.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100\">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/apple-itunes-movies-tv-show-apps-tvos-17-2/\">Apple Eliminating iTunes Movies and TV Show Apps in tvOS 17.2</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-eliminating-itunes-movies-and-tv-show-apps-in-tvos-17-2.2412998/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0eafca5cb3d1a08c36629752b5bcb6fd441d36fc52891705d015f463206360d7","category":"Apple"}
