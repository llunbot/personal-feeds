Tabs were also all arranged at the top of the display to minimize the space taken up at the top of a Safari window.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn ‌macOS Monterey‌, Apple has walked this back. There's a dedicated URL/search bar at the top of the Safari window, with the tabs arranged below it. Clicking on a tab makes it the active window and it's easier to drag tabs for rearranging or opening in a new window.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIt's still quite far off from the current Safari design in ‌macOS Big Sur‌, but it's certainly an improvement over the initial ‌macOS Monterey‌ design.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe new and separate tab bar is enabled by default when upgrading to ‌macOS Monterey‌ beta three, but Apple has included an option to revert to the original Monterey design. If you to go View and toggle off \"Show Separate Tab Bar,\" you can use the original design.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n‌macOS Monterey‌ beta 3 also appears to lay the groundwork for Universal Control. Under System Preferences -&gt; Displays -&gt; Add Display -&gt; Advanced, there are now preferences that can be selected for the Universal Control feature. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/universal-control-settings-monterey.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nUnfortunately, Universal Control is not functional and we'll have to wait for a later beta to experience a working version.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">macOS Monterey</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari/\">Safari</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-monterey.234\">macOS Monterey</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/14/macos-monterey-safari-redesign/\">macOS Monterey Beta 3: Apple Redesigns Safari Tab Interface Following Complaints</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-monterey-beta-3-apple-redesigns-safari-tab-interface-following-complaints.2304270/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=rHZrBytE_q4:vlVT1SwVQ4k:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=rHZrBytE_q4:vlVT1SwVQ4k:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/rHZrBytE_q4\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6cc60e43326b9f5cf9cbe058109294b8b0079e41f862cff99aab3c3ecca1afed","category":"Apple"}
