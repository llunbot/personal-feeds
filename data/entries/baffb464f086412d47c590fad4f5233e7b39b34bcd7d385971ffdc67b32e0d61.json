That price is a little over three times the $26 per dose the federal government paid for the last updated booster, which was exclusively distributed by the government.</p>\n<p>The price hike marks the vaccine's move from federal distribution to the commercial market. Moderna and rival manufacturer Pfizer raised the US list price of their COVID-19 vaccines by roughly 400 percent. (Moderna's is listed at $128 and Pfizer's is $115).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1972056#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1972056&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"baffb464f086412d47c590fad4f5233e7b39b34bcd7d385971ffdc67b32e0d61","category":"Tech"}
