While the manufacturer has released patches, the Eclypsium research shows that a significant proportion of users has yet to install them.</p>\n<p>“Given the challenges of updating MikroTik, there are large numbers of devices with these 2018 and 2019 vulnerabilities,” Eclypsium researchers <a href=\"https://eclypsium.com/2021/12/09/when-honey-bees-become-murder-hornets/\">wrote in a post</a>. “Collectively, this gives attackers many opportunities to gain full control over very powerful devices, positioning them to be able to target devices both behind the LAN port as well as target other devices on the Internet.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1819231#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1819231&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"758bfd6236ed306ae2dee942407239bec4edb574292a4ebca1373745af7460f9","category":"Tech"}
