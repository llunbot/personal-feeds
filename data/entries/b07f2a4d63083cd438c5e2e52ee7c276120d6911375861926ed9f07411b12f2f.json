If his timeframe is accurate, it means that the device would enter mass production after Apple's annual developers conference WWDC in June.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKuo originally predicted that the HomePod with a screen would enter mass production in the first quarter of 2025, but he said manufacturing was pushed back due to \"software development issues,\" including Apple Intelligence. Last week, Apple said that the more personalized version of Siri that it previewed at WWDC 2024 last year is taking longer than it expected, and it now anticipates rolling out the new Siri features <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/\">\"in the coming year.\"</a> It would make sense if Apple's smart home hub <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/09/apple-smart-home-hub-postponed/\">has been postponed too</a>, as a result.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKuo said another reason for the delay is ensuring that the device's interface aligns with software updates coming later this year, including iOS 19. Maybe (or <a href=\"https://x.com/markgurman/status/1899857355900125338\">maybe not</a>) this relates to Apple's rumored <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/10/ios-19-macos-16-major-design-update/\">visionOS-like software redesign plans</a>, which could extend to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/29/tvos-17-4-homeos-mention/\">all-new homeOS operating system</a> that is expected on the smart home hub.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's smart home hub is rumored to feature a 6-inch or 7-inch display, and an A18 chip. It would allow users to control smart home accessories, make FaceTime video calls, use <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/use-apple-homepod-intercom/\">Apple's intercom feature</a> between rooms in a house, and more. It might even double as a home security system <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/04/apple-smart-home-camera-rumor/\">with an Apple-designed camera</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is unclear if the home hub will launch in late 2025, or if the delays will push it back until 2026.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-command-center/\">Apple Command Center</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#HomePod\">HomePod (Neutral)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/12/homepod-with-screen-after-wwdc-kuo/\">Kuo: New 'HomePod' With Screen to Enter Mass Production After WWDC</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-new-homepod-with-screen-to-enter-mass-production-after-wwdc.2452929/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b07f2a4d63083cd438c5e2e52ee7c276120d6911375861926ed9f07411b12f2f","category":"Apple"}
