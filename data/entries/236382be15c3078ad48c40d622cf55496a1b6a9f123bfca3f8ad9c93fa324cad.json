{"title":"MacBook Pro's M1 Max GPU is Over 3x Faster Than M1 in First Metal Benchmark","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/20/m1-max-3x-faster-m1-metal-benchmark/","date":1634786089000,"content":"Multiple benchmarks have already given us a general estimate of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/18/first-m1-max-geekbench-score-surfaces/\">the CPU performance</a> of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> Max chip, but we've had little insight into GPU performance. The ‌M1‌ Max is equipped with up to 32 graphics cores, marking a vast improvement over the 8-core GPU of the ‌M1‌, which was Apple's first chip.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/macbook-pro-m1-max-metal.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe first <a href=\"https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/compute/3557857\">Metal benchmark</a> for the ‌M1‌ Max surfaced this afternoon, with the chip earning a score of 68870. Comparatively, the ‌M1‌ chip in the 13-inch MacBook Pro has a Metal score of 20581, and the Radeon Pro 5600M, which was the highest-end GPU option for the prior Intel-based 16-inch model, has a Metal score of 42510.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nCompared to the fastest chip available in Apple's previous-generation 16-inch MacBook Pro, the ‌M1‌ Max is 62 percent faster, and it's 3x faster than the ‌M1‌ chip in the 13-inch MacBook Pro, based on the Metal score we have so far.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIt's not clear if this ‌M1‌ Max chip is the 24-core variant or the 32-core variant. This is also just one result, so we should be able to get a better picture of the graphics performance when additional benchmarks are available.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to Apple, the 32-core GPU in the ‌M1‌ Max is up to 4x faster than the ‌M1‌. Apple has said that the chip delivers performance \"comparable to a high-end GPU in a compact pro PC laptop\" while consuming up to 40 percent less power.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSince we <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/18/first-m1-max-geekbench-score-surfaces/\">last shared CPU benchmarks</a> for the ‌M1‌ Max/Pro chip, <a href=\"https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/search?q=macbookpro18\">several additional results</a> have surfaced. Comparing multiple benchmarks, the ‌M1‌ Max/Pro earns an average single-core score 1742 and an average multi-core score of 12135.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe chip has the highest single-core score of any Mac to date, and it is <a href=\"https://browser.geekbench.com/mac-benchmarks\">only beaten</a> in multi-core performance by the 16, 18, 24, and 28-core Intel Xeon chips used in the higher-end <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a> Pro and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/\">Mac Pro</a> models. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">14 &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">14\" &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/20/m1-max-3x-faster-m1-metal-benchmark/\">MacBook Pro's M1 Max GPU is Over 3x Faster Than M1 in First Metal Benchmark</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macbook-pros-m1-max-gpu-is-over-3x-faster-than-m1-in-first-metal-benchmark.2318363/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=a-tNc_xkIpg:MyF680A5dSA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=a-tNc_xkIpg:MyF680A5dSA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/a-tNc_xkIpg\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"236382be15c3078ad48c40d622cf55496a1b6a9f123bfca3f8ad9c93fa324cad","category":"Apple"}
