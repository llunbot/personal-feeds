Nominally replacing the iPhone SE from 2022, the new handset is far more powerful, has a far newer look, and features a raft of cool features that SE owners could only dream of. That’s the good news. The bad news is that it’s a great deal more expensive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, it needs to be looked after properly. And that means one thing more than any other: a great case. Choose the right case for your iPhone 16e and it will be protected from drop damage, from scratches and dents, and from a costly shattered screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article we offer some guidance on selecting the perfect case for your brand-new iPhone 16e.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What to look for</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The key is to find the right blend of features and benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Physical protection is the primary reason we’re looking for an iPhone case, but it isn’t the only thing we want. We also want a case that looks great, is light and unobtrusive in the hand, is easy to put on and take off (but remains securely attached in use!), and offers an excellent all-round user experience at a good price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bonus points if it’s made and sold by a reliable company with a long history in the industry and millions of satisfied customers. After all, we’re relying on this product to look after a $599 phone; it’s vital to find a manufacturer we can depend on.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>ESR’s updated cases for the iPhone 16e</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One company we’ve written about before in the context of reliable iPhone cases is <strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/E1668ED4-7F61-4AB5-B055-16552E2D8837?maas=maas_adg_F49B3A2F1A3EA07FE723C3D14DB25EE9_afap_abs&amp;ref_=aa_maas&amp;tag=maas\">ESR</a></strong>.
