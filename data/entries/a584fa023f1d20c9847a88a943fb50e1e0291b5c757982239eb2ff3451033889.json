If you haven't been following this, this feature will track the web pages you visit and generate a list of advertising topics that it will share with web pages whenever they ask, and it's built directly into the Chrome browser. It's been in the news previously as \"<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/04/everybody-hates-floc-googles-tracking-plan-for-chrome-ads/\">FLoC</a>\" and then the \"<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/01/google-drops-floc-after-widespread-opposition-pivots-to-topics-api-plan/\">Topics API</a>,\" and despite widespread opposition from just about every non-advertiser in the world, Google owns Chrome and is one of the world's biggest advertising companies, so this is being railroaded into the production builds.</p>\n<p>Google seemingly knows this won't be popular. Unlike the glitzy front-page Google blog post that the redesign got, the big ad platform launch announcement is tucked away on the <a href=\"https://privacysandbox.com/news/privacy-sandbox-for-the-web-reaches-general-availability\">privacysandbox.com</a> page. The blog post says the ad platform is hitting \"general availability\" today, meaning it has rolled out to most Chrome users. This has been a long time coming, with <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/20/google-starts-the-ga-rollout-of-its-privacy-sandbox-apis-to-all-chrome-users/\">the APIs</a> rolling out about a month ago and a million incremental steps in the beta and dev builds, but now the deed is finally done.</p>\n  <ul>\n          <li>\n        <div>\n          <div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-5-980x1098.png\" alt /></div>\n          <p>\n            Chrome users will see this pop-up, telling them the ad platform has rolled out to them.

The new pop-up has been hitting users all week. As you can see in the pop-up, all of Google's documentation about this feature feels like it was written on opposite day, with Google calling the browser-based advertising platform \"a significant step on the path towards a fundamentally more private web.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1966378#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1966378&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a584fa023f1d20c9847a88a943fb50e1e0291b5c757982239eb2ff3451033889","category":"Tech"}
