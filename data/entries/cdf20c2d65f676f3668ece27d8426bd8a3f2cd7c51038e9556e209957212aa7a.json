{"title":"Found: MoosePack Bike Bags with Custom Options","link":"https://bikerumor.com/moosepack-bike-bags-custom-options/","date":1680634800000,"content":"<p>In my opinion, there can never be enough small bike bag makers out there in the world. They’re just trying to make life easier by supplying bags to make #ridebikesbringstuff more of a reality for you and yours. Along those lines, I’d like to share a <a href=\"https://www.moosepacks.com/\" target=\"_blank\">bag maker</a> that we discovered recently, MoosePacks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Founded in 2015 in Boone, North Carolina by Matt Moosa, they are now located in Austin Texas. They offer a good selection of core bike bags (handlebar, seat, top tube, and stem bags) that are ready to ship now. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This core line is designed and tested in-house and then sent out to be manufactured by a US manufacturer to help build their inventory of these core bags. All frame bags, and custom “one-off” project bags, as well as the development of any new bags, are all designed and manufactured in-house. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/MoosePack-Full-line-on-partial-bike.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/MoosePack-Full-line-on-partial-bike-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"MoosePack Full line on partial bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/MoosePack-Full-line-on-partial-bike-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/MoosePack-Full-line-on-partial-bike-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/MoosePack-Full-line-on-partial-bike-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/MoosePack-Full-line-on-partial-bike-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/MoosePack-Full-line-on-partial-bike-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/MoosePack-Full-line-on-partial-bike.jpeg 1280w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo c.

Their website says that they “promote sustainable practices for a clean environment”. Matt says that he “realizes the importance of saving scrap fabrics to reduce material waste”. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s check out some of the core bags that are available now. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>MoosePack Handlebar Bag</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/MoosePack-handlebar-Bag-Chesnut.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"491\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/MoosePack-handlebar-Bag-Chesnut-800x491.jpeg\" alt=\"MoosePack handlebar Bag Chesnut\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/MoosePack-handlebar-Bag-Chesnut-800x491.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/MoosePack-handlebar-Bag-Chesnut-297x182.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/MoosePack-handlebar-Bag-Chesnut-120x74.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/MoosePack-handlebar-Bag-Chesnut-768x471.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/MoosePack-handlebar-Bag-Chesnut.jpeg 823w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/MoosePack-Handlebar-Bag-on-bike.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/MoosePack-Handlebar-Bag-on-bike-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"MoosePack Handlebar Bag on bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/MoosePack-Handlebar-Bag-on-bike-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/MoosePack-Handlebar-Bag-on-bike-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/MoosePack-Handlebar-Bag-on-bike-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/MoosePack-Handlebar-Bag-on-bike-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/MoosePack-Handlebar-Bag-on-bike-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/MoosePack-Handlebar-Bag-on-bike.jpeg 990w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The MoosePack <a href=\"https://www.moosepacks.com/products/handlebar-bag\" target=\"_blank\">Handlebar Bag</a> is made with ECOPAK fabric and lined with 450 ripstop recycled polyester.
