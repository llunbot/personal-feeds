Thousands of Apple Music songs have been made available in Spatial Audio since the feature rolled out in June, including Lady Gaga's \"Rain on Me\" and Kanye West's \"Black Skinhead,\" and Eilish's new \"Happier Than Ever\" album can also be listened to in the immersive audio format.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/12/apple-and-billie-eilish-spatial-audio-video/\">Apple and Billie Eilish Collaborate on Short Film Promoting Spatial Audio</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-and-billie-eilish-collaborate-on-short-film-promoting-spatial-audio.2307345/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=BYrXK3ILS3Q:qqPTPlG0bBA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=BYrXK3ILS3Q:qqPTPlG0bBA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/BYrXK3ILS3Q\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2e8c19be592b93bac8931472607dad30bf2d271279db17a601c028c346fbe0ac","category":"Apple"}
