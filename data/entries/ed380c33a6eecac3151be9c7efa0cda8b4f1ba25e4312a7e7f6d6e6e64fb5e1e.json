Even in late autumn, conditions here are sufficient to heat up the coast, some 40km to the south, to temperatures the British summer would be proud of. However, given that the average altitude of civilisation here is around 1,200m, dawns are fresh enough to wake you up like a strong coffee.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-02-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Alpujarras, Spain\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-02-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-02-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-02-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-02-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-02-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-02-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Getting up on to the Transnevada necessitates a hefty climb to start the day.</figcaption><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Cádiar is a town typical of the area, its old, whitewashed dwellings squashed haphazardly together, with steep, narrow streets twisting in between. Its sleepy atmosphere belies a tumultuous history that runs in parallel to other villages in the region.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to the extreme terrain, Alpujarra has always been somewhat cut off from the rest of Spain, and as such it developed its own distinct culture, prospering during the Arab-Andalusian period thanks to its specialist silk production. But by the 1400s, religious wars between the Moors and invading Catholics had caused immeasurable suffering and the population never really recovered, a fact that helps explain why the area continues to fly under the radar in the 21st century.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-3-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Alpujarras, Spain\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-3-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-3-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-3-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-3-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-3-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-3-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-3.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Once on the trail, the gradient is more manageable and expansive views are ever-present.</figcaption><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The second of two civil wars here was rumoured to have started when a rich landowner proclaimed himself king in or around Cádiar itself, with the town acting as his base of operations. But these days, all such notions of brutal accessions are long forgotten, and Cádiar is operations base only to Vamos Cycling, a cycling holiday company led by Gary and Sarah Williams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It turns out that the town is equally advantageously placed for riders in search of a challenge as it is for rebel war leaders in search of a defensible HQ.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The only way is up</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-04-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Alpujarras, Spain\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-04-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-04-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-04-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-04-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-04-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-04-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-04.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>As we pick our way out of the still-silent town, the scale of today’s challenge is highlighted when I notice Gary’s gearing setup. His tiny mountain bike chainring has more in common with the sprockets in the middle of my cassette than it does with the 44t plate driving my chain, which I now realise is grossly oversized. I rapidly command my rear derailleur to shunt my chain to the top of the cassette, where I have an ominous feeling it will need to stay. With a mixture of pity and humour, Gary quips that at least I won’t need to worry about shifting all that much today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the wars and politics of the Middle Ages affected Alpujarra, the Moors cultivated a variety of produce on its rocky slopes, including olives and citrus fruits. Ingeniously, water came from snowmelt much higher up among the Sierra Nevada’s peaks, channelled down to the terraces and pastures in specially dug irrigation canals, many of which are still evident, much to the benefit of local vintners. Today, these terraces produce renowned Tempranillo from some of the highest-altitude vineyards in Europe.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-05-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Alpujarras, Spain\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-05-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-05-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-05-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-05-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-05-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-05-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-05-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-05.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Snowmelt off the Sierra Nevadan peaks flows all year, irrigating the vineyards and farmland local to Cádiar.</figcaption><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The canals, on the other hand, scythe vertically downhill, thereby tending to govern the direction of any road that isn’t tarmac, which is why the first portion of our ride sees more than 5km rise at around 10%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cádiar shrinks below us as we climb towards bigger peaks, eventually picking up the southernmost stretch of the Transnevada trail.

That’s east in the vaguest sense, for the route tracks the contours of the mountains’ <em>barrancos</em> – fronds of rock that radiate outwards from the truly massive peaks at the centre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consequently, we end up zigging north and zagging south more than heading directly east, each new <em>barranco</em> bringing with it fresh views at a surprising rate. From their western side we look out over ripples of land that steadily peter out into the sea, glistening invitingly despite looking impossibly distant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the rocky tendrils’ eastern sides we pedal further into the Sierra Nevada, where the sky is pierced by vast, snow-capped mountaintops. Mulhacén, mainland Spain’s highest mountain, is ensconced in there, as is the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/classic-climb-pico-de-veleta\" target=\"_blank\">Pico de Veleta</a>, home to Europe’s highest paved road at 3,398m.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-07-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Alpujarras, Spain\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-07-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-07-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-07-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-07-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-07-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-07-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-07-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-07.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>There’s no tarmac under our tyre treads today, though. Instead, there’s the wholesome crunch of gravel, but the surface is far from uniform. The Sierra Nevada’s altitude creates microclimates that correspondingly affect the conditions below. For us that means sometimes the surface is dry and dusty, at other times rocky and loose, at other times still claggy and wet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But while there’s the occasional technical section (and I’m told there are some truly gnarly parts of the Transnevada elsewhere), the going is generally steady in gradient and relatively simple technically. This allows me to focus on finding a rhythm and riding efficiently; it’s important not to dig too deep, too often at this altitude.</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Off-road climbs in the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-cycling-french-pyrenees\" target=\"_blank\">Pyrenees</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-cycling-french-alps\" target=\"_blank\">Alps</a> can often be so rocky and steep that it becomes as much about the line you take as your physical fitness, hence going into the red is sometimes unavoidable. Here, though, the gravel is closer in character to the road, so it pays to employ the same steady tempo as road riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Remote ecology</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-08-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Alpujarras, Spain\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-08-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-08-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-08-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-08-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-08-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-08-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-08-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-08.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption> In autumn the terrain is rocky and shrubbery is scorched following the heat of summer, but in spring the hillsides are covered with wildflowers, which softens the landscape.</figcaption><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The sun is high in the sky, but with it being autumn we’ve swerved the blistering heat of summer that would otherwise make the relentless draggy climbs and shallow descents interminable. However, we do have to contend with the effects of recent rainstorms, which have carved deep gulleys into some silt-like sections and exposed the same slabs of rock that make up the slopes around us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That isn’t to say this area is arid though. While some of the snowmelt is artificially siphoned off to fuel the agricultural terraces below, most of it naturally saturates the altitude band the Transnevada runs through. As such, myriad tough grasses and bushes cover the scree, and frequent stretches of the trail weave through pine forests. In the spring, wildflowers carpet the slopes.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-09-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Alpujarras, Spain\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-09-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-09-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-09-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-09-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-09-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-09-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-09-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/big-ride-alpujarras-09.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>The Transnevada tracks along the flanks of the mountain range, so travelling east means going north and south as much as anything else, as the trail winds into and out of each barranco.</figcaption><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>There’s incredible biodiversity here, which is at odds with, but also because of, the almost complete lack of human activity.

It takes some reassurance from the ever-buoyant Gary that, despite appearances, there are frequent potential escape tracks that hang off the Transnevada trail like rug tassels, leading down to Alpujarran towns much like Cádiar.

Taking on gradients like this, whether up or down, is simply a fact of life for any cyclists in Alpujarra.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cádiar rises up to our left, meaning there’s one last short, sharp climb to tick off before we can call our day done. In other circumstances I’d have baulked at the task, but finishing the day just as I started it – with my chain glued to the biggest sprocket and my legs burning – feels like a fitting end.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hidden gems</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fancy a return to tarmac?

In October, flights shouldn’t cost more than £150, but you’ll need to factor in the expense of travelling with a bike, which is an extra £45 each way. From there it’s around a two-hour drive east to Cádiar.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Accommodation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We stayed at Vamos Cycling’s HQ, Gary and Sarah Williams’ townhouse in the centre of Cádiar. The spacious, well-appointed house sleeps eight comfortably and most rooms have views out over the town square and the mountains beyond. There’s a fully equipped workshop on the ground floor that makes unpacking bikes easy, and as a bike mechanic in his spare time, Gary is on hand to help. A fully catered, fully supported week of gravel riding costs £750.

Sarah kept us well fed with a wide array of delicious, locally sourced food and drink, and Gary was a consummate ride guide, supplying local knowledge throughout the route and only scoffing a little when we turned up hopelessly over-geared.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cycling-spain-alpujarra\">Beyond and back: Andalusia, Spain Big Ride</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"ed380c33a6eecac3151be9c7efa0cda8b4f1ba25e4312a7e7f6d6e6e64fb5e1e","category":"Cycling"}
