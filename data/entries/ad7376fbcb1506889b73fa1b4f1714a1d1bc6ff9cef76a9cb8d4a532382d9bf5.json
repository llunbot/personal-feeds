For around a decade from the mid-90s to the early-2000s, aluminium was the material of choice, with Miguel Indurain being the first to win the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tour-de-france\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de France</a> aboard an aluminium Pinarello in 1995.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, with Lance Armstrong ‘winning’ on a carbon Trek OCLV Madone only three years later, aluminium has often since found itself largely consigned to brands’ entry-level machines.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-all-road-bikes\">Best all-road bikes 2023 reviewed</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/what-is-a-road-bike\">What is a road bike?

The ultra-stiff aluminium race bikes of the nineties and 2000s gave the material a reputation for harsh ride quality, but how a bike rides depends on multiple factors including frame design, spec choices and tyre pressure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best aluminium frames build in some vertical flex for comfort, typically with skinny or dropped seatstays or flexible seatposts. The <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/can-wider-tyres-and-lower-pressures-make-you-faster\" target=\"_blank\">trend towards wider tyres</a> has helped here too – many road bikes now come with 28mm tyres as standard and can accept wider ones still.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How we test and why you should trust our advice</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/03062057/specialized_allez_sprint_review_05-970x645.jpg\" alt=\"Riding an aluminium race bike\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/03062057/specialized_allez_sprint_review_05-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/03062057/specialized_allez_sprint_review_05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/03062057/specialized_allez_sprint_review_05-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/03062057/specialized_allez_sprint_review_05-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/03062057/specialized_allez_sprint_review_05-1140x758.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/03062057/specialized_allez_sprint_review_05-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/03062057/specialized_allez_sprint_review_05-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/04/03062057/specialized_allez_sprint_review_05.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Our team of expert testers led by tech editor <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/author/sam-challis\" target=\"_blank\">Sam Challis</a> has an immense combined experience of riding everything from the very cheapest entry-level bikes, up to the latest and greatest flagship superbikes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re riders just like you who love cycling for the joy, the excitement, and the physical challenge and we review bikes by putting in the miles in all weathers.

The race-oriented Italia RC is a legitimately fast bike with a moderate price tag, ideal for regular racing and fast training.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Featuring an asymmetric down tube with a flattened profile to resist twisting, it should be happy to get thrown about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having previous eschewed anything as crassly modern as disc brakes or bolt-thru axles, this latest version sports both. Thankfully the Italia is still gorgeous to look at in deep two-tone blue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Italia is sold frame-only, and Condor will help build the bike up to match your requirements.

There’s 28mm tyre clearance and the capability to custom spec the bike on the Ribble bike builder when ordering. Ribble provides plenty of customer support to help you choose too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Endurance AL is versatile, well specced and fun to ride, with a racy feel from its comparatively short chainstays, but with enough stability for confidence. We’d opt for the Shimano 105 model but you can save yourself £400 and drop down to Tiagra if the budget is tight. Faster riders might want a closer, higher gear set than the standard 50/34, 11-32 tooth offering, although this does give plenty of hill climbing capability.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/ribble-endurance-al-disc-105-review\" target=\"_blank\">Ribble Endurance AL Disc 105 review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div><br /></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>6.

A good proportion of that heft is in the wheels and tyres though, which feel due for an upgrade to improve the Allez’s performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-allez-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full Specialized Allez review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>7.
