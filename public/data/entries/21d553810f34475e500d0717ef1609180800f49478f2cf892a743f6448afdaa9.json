I suspect it’s stainless steel, but I’ve asked Shimano for confirmation.</p>\n<p>While I’ve only had the opportunity to remove and reinstall the screw on one bike, the new material feels far more durable, despite the fact I was using an average-quality <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/allen-keys-everything-you-need-to-know/\">Allen key</a>.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The bleed port screw in all its glory.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Kaden Gardener / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>Both <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/shimano-dura-ace-di2-r9200/\">Dura-Ace R9200</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/shimano-ultegra-di2-r8100/\">Ultegra R8100</a> groupsets also use a new screw (Y0MX98020), but it’s made from the same cheesy metal used on Shimano’s 11-speed drop-bar shifters.</p>\n<p>If you’d like to upgrade your 12-speed Dura-Ace or Ultegra shifters with this new bleed port screw, which Shimano says you can do, the part number is Y0RM98020.</p>\n<p>Though it is not commonly stocked by major retailers, you should be able to special-order it from any good bike shop.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Can I upgrade 11-speed shifters to use the new bolt?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> It’s sad news for 11-speed owners.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Unfortunately, if like me, you’re running an 11-speed groupset, Shimano has confirmed you’re stuck with the old cheesy screw.</p>\n<p>This is because the 12-speed drop-bar shifter screw is a slightly different shape that won’t work with 11-speed shifters.</p>\n<p>Though I expect Shimano will roll out the new-style screw on all of its future drop-bar groupsets, it’s unlikely Shimano will offer the older 11-speed bleed port screws in this harder metal.</p>\n<p>This is a great shame, because I would very much like to swiftly discard the older screws in my Ultegra R8070 shifters.</p>\n<h2>What should you do if you round off a Shimano bleed port bolt?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Treat this bolt with care!</span></figcaption><span> <i>Kaden Gardener / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>If you’ve ended up reading this article because you’ve rounded off one of the older-style bolts, don’t panic – there may be a solution.</p>\n<p>After a recommendation from a former workshop colleague, I’ve found good success using Wera’s Hex Plus keys. These have a larger contact zone in the head and offer significantly more grip than other hex keys.</p>\n<p>Some hex keys, such as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/first-look-friday/100-hypercraft/#:~:text=Park%20Tools%20THH,and%20hex%20keys\">Park Tool’s jewel-like THH-1 T-handle hex keys</a>, feature a clever extractor head that, if used carefully, can be employed to bite into a stripped head. However, these can be a bit hit-and-miss.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Wera’s Hex Plus keys are almost worth buying for working on this bolt alone.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>You could also try using a similarly sized Torx key in the head of the bolt. This should provide additional purchase, although you’ll want to be careful to avoid damaging the tool.</p>\n<p>As a last resort, if all else fails, you can gently tap a Torx key into the screw using a hammer. This effectively creates a new fitting to remove the screw. However, the screw will then be for the bin and you’ll need to replace it.</p>\n<p>Shimano definitely wouldn’t endorse this method though.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> It’s a wise move to take care when installing the bleed cup adaptor too.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Kaden Gardener / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>It’s worth stressing that the threads in the shifter body are very delicate. If you don’t carefully angle the bolt in perfectly straight, you’ll cross-thread them.</p>\n<p>If you’ve really mashed the threads it is, unfortunately, probably new shifter time.</p>","author":"Oscar Huckle","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"21d553810f34475e500d0717ef1609180800f49478f2cf892a743f6448afdaa9","category":"Cycling"}
