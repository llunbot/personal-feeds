We also heard some rumored details for the next version of Apple's big iMac, which could see the return of the \"iMac Pro\" name.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/Top-Stories-81-Thumbnail.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nOther popular stories this week included Apple executives talking about why we haven't seen Face ID and touchscreens come to the Mac, and well as news that Apple has quietly discontinued its Intel-based 21.5-inch iMac, so read on for all of the details on these stories and more!\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>New iMac Pro Rumored for 2022 With M1 Pro/Max Chips, 27-Inch Display With ProMotion, and More</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nOne of the last Intel-based Macs that Apple sells is the 27-inch iMac, but as expected, rumors suggest that a new version with Apple silicon is in the works. This week, leaker @dylandkt shared some <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/30/imac-pro-2022-rumors/\">alleged specs and features for the new \"iMac Pro,\"</a> including the same M1 Pro and M1 Max chips as the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/2020-iMac-Mockup-Feature-27-inch-text.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe leaker said Apple plans to launch the new iMac in the first half of 2022, with pricing starting at over $2,000 in the United States.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Beats Fit Pro Debut With a Fitness Focus, Active Noise Cancellation, and a $200 Price Tag</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nAfter being leaked in the iOS 15.1 beta last month, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/01/beats-fit-pro-launch/\">Beats Fit Pro have now been officially announced</a>, and we've shared hands-on impressions.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/beats-fit-pro-feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nIn our view, the Beats Fit Pro are essentially fitness-focused AirPods Pro, as they share many features like active noise cancellation, spatial audio with dynamic head tracking, and Apple's H1 chip. Beats Fit Pro are also less expensive than AirPods Pro, with pricing set at $199.99.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>New HomePod Mini Colors Now Available to Order and for Apple Store Pickup</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nHomePod mini is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/01/new-homepod-mini-colors-now-available/\">now available to order in three new colors</a>, including yellow, orange, and blue, in the U.S. and six other countries and regions.
