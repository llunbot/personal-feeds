{"title":"Week in Review – February 13, 2023","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/week-in-review-february-13-2023/","date":1676317479000,"content":"<p>AWS <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2023/?whats-new-content-all.sort-by=item.additionalFields.postDateTime&amp;whats-new-content-all.sort-order=desc&amp;awsf.whats-new-categories=*all&amp;awsm.page-whats-new-content-all=2\">announced 32 capabilities</a> since we published the last Week in Review blog post a week ago. I also read a couple of other news and blog posts.</p> \n<p>Here is my summary.</p> \n<p>The VPC section of the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com\">AWS Management Console</a> now allows you <strong>to visualize your VPC resources</strong>, such as the relationships between a VPC and its subnets, routing tables, and gateways. This visualization was available at VPC creation time only, and now you can go back to it using the <strong>Resource Map</strong> tab in the console. You can read the details in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-visualize-your-vpc-resources-from-amazon-vpc-creation-experience/\">Channy’s blog post</a>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/02/02/2023-vpc-resource-map-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2023/02/02/2023-vpc-resource-map-1.jpg\" alt width=\"2179\" height=\"1377\" /></a></p> \n<p><strong>CloudTrail Lake now gives you the ability to ingest activity events from non-AWS sources</strong>. This lets you immutably store and then process activity events without regard to their origin–AWS, on-premises servers, and so forth. All of this power is available to you with a single API call: <code>PutAuditEvents</code>. We launched AWS CloudTrail Lake about a year ago. It is a managed organization-scale data lake that aggregates, immutably stores, and allows querying of events recorded by CloudTrail. You can use it for auditing, security investigation, and troubleshooting. Again, my colleague <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-cloudtrail-lake-supports-ingesting-activity-events-from-non-aws-sources/\">Channy wrote a post with the details</a>.</p> \n<p>There are three <strong>new Amazon CloudWatch metrics for asynchronous AWS Lambda function invocations</strong>: <code>AsyncEventsReceived</code>, <code>AsyncEventAge</code>, and <code>AsyncEventsDropped</code>. These metrics provide visibility for asynchronous Lambda function invocations. They help you to identify the root cause of processing issues such as throttling, concurrency limit, function errors, processing latency because of retries, or missing events. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/es/blogs/compute/introducing-new-asynchronous-invocation-metrics-for-aws-lambda/\">You can learn more and have access to a sample application in this blog post</a>.</p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sns/\">Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS)</a> now supports <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/x-ray/\">AWS X-Ray</a> to visualize, analyze, and debug applications</strong>. Developers can now <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-active-tracing.html\">trace messages going through Amazon SNS</a>, making it easier to understand or debug microservices or serverless applications.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon EC2 Mac instances now support replacing root volumes for quick instance restoration</strong>. Stopping and starting EC2 Mac instances <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-mac-instances.html#mac-instance-stop\">trigger a scrubbing workflow</a> that can take up to one hour to complete. Now you can <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-restoring-volume.html#replace-root\">swap the root volume of the instance</a> with an EBS snapshot or an AMI. It helps to reset your instance to a previous known state in 10–15 minutes only. This significantly speeds up your CI and CD pipelines.</p> \n<p><strong>Amazon Polly launches two new Japanese NTTS voices</strong>. <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/NTTS-main.html#ntts-regions\">Neural Text To Speech</a> (NTTS) produces the most natural and human-like text-to-speech voices possible. You can try these voices in <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/polly/home/SynthesizeSpeech\">the Polly section of the AWS Management Console</a>. With this addition, according to my count, you can now choose among 52 NTTS voices in 28 languages or language variants (French from France or from Quebec, for example).</p> \n<p><strong>The AWS SDK for Java now includes the AWS CRT HTTP Client</strong>. The HTTP client is the center-piece powering our SDKs. Every single AWS API call triggers a network call to our API endpoints. It is therefore important to use a low-footprint and low-latency HTTP client library in our SDKs. AWS created <a href=\"https://github.com/awslabs/aws-c-http\">a common HTTP client for all SDKs using the C programming language</a>. <a href=\"https://github.com/search?p=1&amp;q=org%3Aawslabs+aws-crt&amp;type=Repositories\">We also offer 11 wrappers for 11 programming languages</a>, from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B\">C++</a> to <a href=\"https://www.swift.org/\">Swift</a>. When you develop in Java, <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/http-configuration-crt.html\">you now have the option to use this common HTTP client</a>. It provides up to 76 percent cold start time reduction on AWS Lambda functions and up to 14 percent less memory usage compared to the <a href=\"https://netty.io/\">Netty</a>-based HTTP client provided by default. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/announcing-availability-of-the-aws-crt-http-client-in-the-aws-sdk-for-java-2-x/\">My colleague Zoe has more details in her blog post</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>X in Y </strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffbarr/\">Jeff</a> started this section a while ago to list the expansion of new services and capabilities to additional Regions.

I read this blog post published on avionweek.com. It explains how <a href=\"https://aviationweek.com/aerospace/commercial-space/why-amazon-web-services-going-space?es_id=09cb1d8fe5\">AWS helps to deploy AIML models on observation satellites to analyze image quality</a> before sending them to earth, saving up to 40 percent satellite bandwidth. Interestingly, the main cause for unusable satellite images is…clouds.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Upcoming AWS Events</strong></span><br /> Check your calendars and sign up for these AWS events:</p> \n<p><strong>AWS re:Invent recaps</strong> in your area.
