From there, simply bring your unlocked ‌<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>‌ next to the other person's unlocked ‌‌iPhone‌, and your device will pop up a share interface without you having to tap on the Share Sheet.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTap the Share button that pops up to send the photo or file to the person next to you, and it will be received on the other device automatically, with permission granted through their proximity.\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/08/airdrop-proximity-sharing.jpg\" alt width=\"2000\" height=\"1327\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNote that sharing files this way works even if AirDrop receiving is turned off or limited to contacts, so it offers a way to share a file with someone without having to change your overall AirDrop settings. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>Enable or Disable AirDrop Proximity Sharing</h3>\r<br />\nWe're used to AirDrop working with someone in the same room and involving a few manual steps, but the proximity sharing feature makes transfers between two devices virtually effortless. Of course, if you don't like the idea of proximity sharing, you can turn it off. Here's how it's done in ‌iOS 17‌.\r<br />\n<ol><li>Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Tap through to <strong>General -&gt; AirDrop</strong>.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Toggle the switch next to <strong>Bringing Devices Together </strong>on or off.</li></ol><img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/enable-disable-airdrop-proximity-sharing.jpg\" alt=\"settings\" width=\"4137\" height=\"2716\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThat's all there is to it. Note that disabling this setting will also prevent the sharing of contacts via NameDrop.
