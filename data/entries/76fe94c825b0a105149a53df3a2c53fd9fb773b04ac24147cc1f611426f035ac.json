We now know the cause: an unannounced move or glitch by Microsoft that removed a once-widely used digital certificate in Windows.</p>\n<p>The removed credential is known as a root certificate, meaning it anchors the trust of hundreds or thousands of intermediate and individual certificates downstream. The root certificate—with the serial number 18dad19e267de8bb4a2158cdcc6b3b4a and the SHA1 fingerprint 4EB6D578499B1CCF5F581EAD56BE3D9B6744A5E5—was no longer trusted in Windows. Because that root was tied to certificates that certify their authenticity and trust, people trying to use or install the app received the error.</p>\n<p>Just minutes before this post was scheduled to go live, researchers learned that the certificate had been restored in Windows. It’s unclear how or why that occurred. The certificate immediately below this paragraph shows the certificate's status on Thursday. The one below that shows the status as of Friday.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1963549#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1963549&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"76fe94c825b0a105149a53df3a2c53fd9fb773b04ac24147cc1f611426f035ac","category":"Tech"}
