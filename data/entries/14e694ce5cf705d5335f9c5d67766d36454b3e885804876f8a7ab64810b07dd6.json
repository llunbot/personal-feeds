It's a much more fun update than iOS 18.1 thanks to the image generation features. You'll want to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/23/apple-releases-ios-18-2/\">check out our launch post</a> for full details on what's included, but here's a quick overview.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel</a> for more videos.</em></div>\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n <li><strong>Image Playground</strong> - There's an Image Playground app and Messages integration for creating stylized images based on prompts and images of you and your friends.</li>\r<br />\n <li><strong>Image Wand</strong> - Image Wand is for adding images to what you've written in the Notes app. On <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, you can use the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a> to make a rough sketch and have Image Wand turn it into something nicer.</li>\r<br />\n <li><strong>Genmoji</strong> - With Genmoji, you can create custom emoji. It's similar to Image Playground, but on a smaller emoji-sized scale. People that have iOS 18.1 installed will see Genmoji and can even get information about them, but they can only be created in iOS 18.2. In earlier versions of iOS, they show up as an image.</li>\r<br />\n <li><strong>Siri ChatGPT</strong> - <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> can now hand over requests to ChatGPT, a feature that's entirely opt-in. You don't need an account, and anything you ask ‌Siri‌ can be sent to ChatGPT if you want. ChatGPT has more advanced info than ‌Siri‌ and can also generate images and text. If you want to make it simpler to turn requests over to ChatGPT, you can toggle off the Ask Every Time setting so ‌Siri‌ doesn't always need your permission to contact ChatGPT. ‌Siri‌ with ChatGPT integration supports on-screen responses, so you can do things like ask \"what's in this photo?\" when you're looking at an image.</li>\r<br />\n <li><strong>Visual Intelligence</strong> - On <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a>, Visual Intelligence can be used to identify objects and places around you. Long press the Camera Control button to get to Visual Intelligence, and then point your <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> at something. You can get hours and reviews if the camera is looking at a restaurant, copy text, get text read aloud, search for items on Google, ask ChatGPT questions about objects, and more.</li>\r<br />\n <li><strong>Writing Tools</strong> - The Rewrite Writing Tools feature is no longer limited to three styles. You can describe the tone or content that you want, such as adding more dynamic words or turning an email into a poem.</li>\r<br />\n <li><strong>Languages</strong> - With iOS 18.2, Apple Intelligence supports English in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the UK in addition to U.S. English, so if you're in Canada, you no longer have to set your ‌iPhone‌ to U.S. English to use Apple Intelligence.</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Arcade</h2>\r<br />\nIn the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-arcade/\">Apple Arcade</a> section of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, the \"All Games\" section has a new drop down filter menu and the option to turn off game previews.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/ios-18-2-apple-arcade-categories.jpg\" width=\"2735\" height=\"1538\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Mail App Categorization</h2>\r<br />\nIn the Mail app, there are new built-in categories for separating out important emails, deals, newsletters, transaction emails, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iOS-18-Mail-Categorization.png\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nThe Mail app includes bigger pictures for contacts and businesses, and all emails from a single person or source will be pooled together.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Voice Memos</h2>\r<br />\nWith Voice Memos, two tracks can be layered on top of one another.

Apple has also removed the Satellite control from the Connectivity section, and changed the icon for Adaptive Audio.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/siri-control-center-ios-18-2.jpg\" width=\"2010\" height=\"1131\" />\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Safari</h2>\r<br />\nIn the Safari section of the Settings app, there's a new section for managing website data and history.
