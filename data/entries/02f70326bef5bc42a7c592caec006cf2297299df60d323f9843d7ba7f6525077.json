Reflecting on his 2021 season and looking ahead to the remaining chapters of his long racing career, he appears calmer, more nuanced in his opinions. Gone are the brash, bold absolutes of his younger days. Nothing is 100 per cent certain in Cavendish’s world anymore, except that he loves his family and his bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some things haven’t changed. Cavendish is still strong, still passionate, still searingly honest, still wounded, still ready to shut people up. And still winning. </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/mark-cavendish-retirement\">Mark Cavendish to retire at end of 2023 season</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/mark-cavendish-astana-tour-de-france\">Will Mark Cavendish’s Astana gamble pay off?</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/mark-cavendish-comeback\">Mark Cavendish’s comeback: The missile flies again</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cyclist-magazine-new-issue-on-sale-buy-it-now\">Cyclist magazine issue 140: on sale now!</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>The spiky boy racer who rocketed to four stage wins at his first <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tour-de-france\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de France</a> in 2008, aged just 23, is at the time of writing a doting 36-year-old husband and father of four who enjoys drawing Harry Potter cartoons with his kids. But in recent years Cavendish has experienced life’s darker shadows: crippling bouts of depression, stress, pain and two hellish years in the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/epstein-barr-virus-keeps-mark-cavendish-from-riding-hell-miss-the-tour-of-britain\" target=\"_blank\">grip of the Epstein-Barr virus</a>. The legend with 30 Tour de France stage wins endured five years without any Tour wins at all. Between February 2018 and April 2021 Cavendish didn’t win a single race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even his mentor and friend Rod Ellingworth lost faith. In late 2020 Cavendish was not offered a contract extension at Ellingworth’s Bahrain-McLaren team. The obsessive cycling fanboy, who as a child used to make pilgrimages on the ferry from the Isle of Man to race on the mainland, was about to become an outsider again. The ferocious competitor, who needs racing like we need oxygen, was on the verge of never racing again.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of quitting, however, in 2021 Cavendish rejoined Patrick Lefevere’s Deceuninck–QuickStep team for minimum wage, just to keep racing. He spent long hours suffering behind a derny in an empty velodrome in Greece to regain fitness; he brutalised himself for the Deceuninck ‘B’ team in unfashionable early-season races in Belgium, silently accepting a life of low-cost airlines and cheap hotels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His reward came in July, when he masterminded a dazzling Hollywood comeback, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/gallery-the-day-mark-cavendish-equalled-eddy-merckxs-tour-stage-win-record\" target=\"_blank\">winning four stages of the Tour de France</a>. Tears. Glory. Vindication.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Change of perspective</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Cavendish’s 2021 comeback story of humility and hunger proved inspirational not just for sports fans but for the general public too. He provided proof, right when people needed it, that you can turn your life around. Through his sporting achievements he had already gained people’s respect. Now he felt something else: warmth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It’s actually the biggest thing I’ve taken from it,’ Cavendish says. ‘Whether it was because I had been out of it for a bit or not, something that really struck me was how you always think spectators are watching your journey, whereas last year I realised they’re not just watching the journey, they are living my journey with me. It’s nice to feel that people relate to it in some way. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\"><img width=\"842\" height=\"297\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3.jpg\" alt=\"Subscribe to Cyclist Magazine\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3.jpg 842w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3-300x106.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3-768x271.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/clickable-subs-promo3-750x265.jpg 750w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘I think the last few years have been horrible for lots of people. If anybody could take hope from anything, then that’s a job well done.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cycling has always been more about the human stories than the trophies, and Cavendish’s comeback is quite a saga, but he admits the harsh experiences of the last few years have changed him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I am a different athlete. I had been a pro for nine years and then I got ill and I had to start from zero again,’ he reflects. ‘In fact I’m more than a different athlete – I’m a different person.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"776\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/mark-cavendish-profile-2022-02-970x776.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Cavendish profile 2022\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/mark-cavendish-profile-2022-02-970x776.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/mark-cavendish-profile-2022-02-300x240.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/mark-cavendish-profile-2022-02-768x614.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/mark-cavendish-profile-2022-02-750x600.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/mark-cavendish-profile-2022-02-1140x912.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/mark-cavendish-profile-2022-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Chris Blott / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘Now cycling is not my whole life. Obviously it is my life, but it doesn’t consume everything. I have responsibilities and the sole goal for winning isn’t just for my own gain. It’s to inspire my family and to inspire more people to ride bikes than when I first won in 2008. That changes the significance of it.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cavendish’s legacy is what matters to him now. He has won a record-equalling 34 stages of the Tour de France, Milan-San Remo in 2009 and the World Championships Road Race in 2011, but there comes a point when a champion considers not just the victories etched into the chronicles of cycling history but the marks they leave on people’s lives. People used to say ‘well done’ to him. Now they say ‘thank you’ for the inspiration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It’s great with the amount of people who ride bikes in the UK now,’ Cavendish says. ‘Whether you get the middle-aged man in his Rapha kit, a woman who’s taken up racing on the velodrome, a family out riding together along a canal path or someone commuting to work, it’s phenomenal – it’s beautiful.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021, one dedicated cycling fan from Jersey, Paul James, went further, fulfilling a promise to get a tattoo of Cavendish’s face on his thigh if he returned to winning ways. Cavendish likes people who do as they say: ‘I am more impressed that someone went through with what they said, rather than the fact it was dedicated to me,’ he smiles. ‘But it’s an honour. I gave him a call actually. It’s nice to know I’m being supported.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The lost years</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After the problems of recent years, Cavendish is far less black and white in his opinions, more open to being wrong. Mental health, in particular, was a subject he used to dismiss but which he has learned, through grim experience, to respect. Many commentators declared that in 2021 the Manx Missile was back to his old self, but that’s not quite right. This was a different version of Mark Cavendish, one moulded by life’s cuts and blows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I will never be completely mentally the same – I don’t think anybody is after any mental health struggle – but physically I felt like I didn’t have a debilitating illness anymore, so I was at a level where I could perform,’ he says. ‘The last few years I was either sick or I was trying to come back to a professional level from ground zero. As a professional sportsperson, you know your own body and you know what you need to do to be successful. And I wasn’t at that level.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Illness, injuries, confusion and a loss of form eroded his mental health. Depression manifests itself in different ways, but how exactly did it affect him? He pauses to find the right words.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Irrationality, I guess. Not necessarily lashing out, but something that wouldn’t bother me before now bothered me. I’m someone who wears my heart on my sleeve. I like to be positive. I’ve always been proud that I can be positive in a group of people. And not being able to do that was hard. And not necessarily even being negative, just not having any positivity about myself… about anything. It is difficult. It’s not my personality. And unfortunately, it changes you forever.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s moving to hear Cavendish, an athlete with steel-plated confidence, speak in this way. But in many ways his honesty about his mental health seems like a natural evolution for a man who has always been disarmingly candid about every other aspect of his life. While depression gnawed away at Cavendish’s mind, the Epstein-Barr virus attacked his body, leaving him enduring a grimly diminished half-life.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/mark-cavendish-profile-2022-03-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Cavendish profile 2022\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/mark-cavendish-profile-2022-03-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/mark-cavendish-profile-2022-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/mark-cavendish-profile-2022-03-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/mark-cavendish-profile-2022-03-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/mark-cavendish-profile-2022-03-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/mark-cavendish-profile-2022-03-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/mark-cavendish-profile-2022-03-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/mark-cavendish-profile-2022-03-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/mark-cavendish-profile-2022-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Chris Blott / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>‘There’s no other word to say it: basically, you’re fucked,’ says Cavendish. ‘Walking up the stairs floors you. Really. I remember not taking it that seriously. You think, it’s just glandular fever. Mark Renshaw had it and he was over it in a month. But I was sleeping 18 hours a day and you literally walk up the stairs and you are shattered. It’s not what you want as a professional athlete. It’s not what you want for anyone. I’m a father and I wasn’t able to do anything with my kids or my wife, so it doesn’t just affect your professional life.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without the support of his wife Peta and their children, he may not have been able to endure those dark years. How close did he come to quitting?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I never wanted to quit,’ he insists. ‘At times I thought about quitting, but I never wanted to quit. You can’t know for sure, but you can know that if you put everything in, it will give you the best shot of getting back to the top. I was doing everything within my power to perform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I knew that there were also factors that I couldn’t control,’ he adds. ‘For instance, getting a bike that fitted me. But if you can eliminate the reasons for failure, then I knew I could be at the top again. I would rather work hard and try than just stop and give up.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The comeback</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Cavendish’s 2021 comeback story is now part of cycling folklore. First came those four stage wins at the Tour of Turkey in April – his first victories since 2018. Then an injury to Deceuninck’s Irish sprinter Sam Bennett resulted in Cavendish’s selection for the Tour de France. A tearful triumph in Fougères on Stage 4 – his first Tour win since 2016 – was followed by another on Stage 6 in Châteauroux, scene of his first Tour win in 2008. Further victories came in Valence on Stage 10 and Carcassonne on Stage 13 to equal Eddy Merckx’s record of 34. Cavendish won the points jersey for the first time in a decade. Only the fairytale final win on the Champs-Élysées escaped him. If he had won that, he would have retired.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is less well-known is how Cavendish made this resurrection possible. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/i-walked-around-london-with-paul-weller-paul-smith-and-bradley-wiggins-best-day-of-my\" target=\"_blank\">Brian Holm</a>, sports director at Deceuninck-QuickStep – and best man at Cavendish’s wedding – saw the suffering behind the scenes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘He did a lot of stuff to get in shape, away from his family, and people don’t see it,’ Holm told Cyclist. ‘I have a lot of contact with Cav and he always said he would come back and win big. But he did the hard training, doing little races in the rain in Belgium. He had to prove himself to the team. But he always believed. A lot of people don’t have faith. Cav always had faith.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where does this enduring faith come from? ‘There are a number of factors,’ insists Cavendish. ‘Obviously my family and those close to me. Brian went out of his way to get me back to QuickStep. A lot of people wouldn’t stick by me because I wasn’t winning, but for him it didn’t matter that I wasn’t winning. That’s a true friend. With the faith of others, really, I was willing to give everything to my teammates.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cavendish collapsed in tears of joy after his comeback win in Fougères. ‘I was just overwhelmed, overjoyed even to be at the Tour de France,’ he recalls. ‘And just to win was a big thing. I didn’t have that much pressure to win but it felt like my first Tour de France win. I just wanted to see the boys and celebrate with them. It felt like all the years had been worthwhile for one more.’</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"776\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/mark-cavendish-profile-2022-04-970x776.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Cavendish profile 2022\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/mark-cavendish-profile-2022-04-970x776.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/mark-cavendish-profile-2022-04-300x240.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/mark-cavendish-profile-2022-04-768x614.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/mark-cavendish-profile-2022-04-750x600.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/mark-cavendish-profile-2022-04-1140x912.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/05/mark-cavendish-profile-2022-04.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Chris Blott / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Cavendish has always said that he rides with the same passion he had as a kid. ‘Don’t get me wrong, it’s more of a job than when I first started,’ he says. ‘But still every time I’m on a bike I feel a sense of freedom. Except for when I’m with my kids or my wife, on my bike is the happiest place I can be.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cavendish used to say that if he picked up a book about the greatest cyclists in history, he wanted his name to be in it. He has now certainly achieved that honour. But his longevity is uniquely impressive given that he is a sprinter. Scientific studies suggest that the body’s explosive fast-twitch muscle fibres – upon which sprinters depend – diminish after the age of 30.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘For a sprinter especially to have a successful career that spans even five years is hard,’ he says. ‘So to be able to do it for close to 15 years, I do realise is rare. That comes from just enjoying it. Without any enjoyment I know for a fact I wouldn’t have come close to that.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Riding into the future</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What will happen in the final chapter? Cavendish is not finished yet; he has signed a one-year contract extension for 2022 [and has since moved on to Astana Qazaqstan for 2023, which is expected to be his last year in the sport]. He gets tired of being asked about surpassing Eddy Merckx’s record, but for such a keen student of his sport it must be one tantalising carrot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s an exciting thought for British cycling fans, although what Cavendish does when he finally retires will be equally fascinating. Intelligent and articulate, he would be a welcome addition to any TV commentary team. He would also be an inspirational coach for young British riders.
