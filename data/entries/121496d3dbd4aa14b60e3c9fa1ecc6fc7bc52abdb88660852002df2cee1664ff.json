He believes that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a> and ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max will be available in black, white or silver, gray or \"Natural Titanium,\" and rose. This effectively means that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a>'s Blue Titanium option will be discontinued and replaced with a new rose color. This mirrors <a href=\"https://x.com/VNchocoTaco/status/1772522408144191732?s=20\">an earlier rumor</a> originating in China, which claimed that the existing Blue Titanium color will be dropped from the ‌‌iPhone 16 Pro‌‌ lineup in favor of a new \"rose\" titanium color.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOn the other hand, the ‌iPhone 16‌ and ‌iPhone 16‌ Plus will apparently be offered in black, green, pink, blue, and white. The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> and ‌iPhone 15‌ Plus are available in black, green, pink, blue, and yellow. This means that white will replace yellow, with the colors remaining the same. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nKuo noted that Apple may rename some of the existing colors, such as when it changed the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> 12's \"White\" to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a>'s \"Starlight.\" Likewise, where color names are not changed, the actual tone and appearance may still look different. The ‌iPhone 16‌ lineup is expected to be announced in the fall. <div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/19/iphone-16-lineup-to-come-in-these-two-new-colors/\">iPhone 16 Lineup Rumored to Come in These Two New Colors</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-lineup-rumored-to-come-in-these-two-new-colors.2426864/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"121496d3dbd4aa14b60e3c9fa1ecc6fc7bc52abdb88660852002df2cee1664ff","category":"Apple"}
