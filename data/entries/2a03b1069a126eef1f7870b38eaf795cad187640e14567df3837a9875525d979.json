Saving almost 25% at your wallet, these new Hyperons only add a hundred grams – most of which looks like it is in the hubs. Plus, the new standard Campy Hyperon wheels might even be more serviceable thanks to more conventional standards…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Campagnolo Hyperon lightweight carbon road bike wheels</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Campagnolo-Hyperon-lightweight-carbon-road-bike-wheelset.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Campagnolo-Hyperon-lightweight-carbon-road-bike-wheelset.jpg\" alt=\"Campagnolo Hyperon lightweight carbon road bike wheels\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Campagnolo-Hyperon-lightweight-carbon-road-bike-wheelset.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Campagnolo-Hyperon-lightweight-carbon-road-bike-wheelset-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Campagnolo-Hyperon-lightweight-carbon-road-bike-wheelset-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Campagnolo-Hyperon-lightweight-carbon-road-bike-wheelset-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Campagnolo-Hyperon-lightweight-carbon-road-bike-wheelset-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Campagnolo-Hyperon-lightweight-carbon-road-bike-wheelset-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption><em>all c.

And those spin on precision steel bearings instead of ceramics. They still have the latest N3W freehub body for 9-13sp compatibility.
