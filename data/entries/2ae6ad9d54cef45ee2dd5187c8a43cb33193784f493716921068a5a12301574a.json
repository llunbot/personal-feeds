each generation, Apple has refined the design of both the earbuds and the charging case, making them more compact and lightweight. In the ‌AirPods 4‌, the earbuds are slightly smaller and more ergonomic, while the charging case has seen a 10% reduction in volume, making it easier to carry around. Below, you'll find a detailed comparison of the dimensions of the AirPods across generations, helping you see how Apple has improved the form factor over time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h4>Earbuds</h4>\r<br />\n<table>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <th></th>\r<br />\n <th>AirPods (Second-Generation)</th>\r<br />\n <th>AirPods (Third-Generation)</th>\r<br />\n <th>AirPods (Fourth-Generation)</th>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Height</td>\r<br />\n <td>40.5 mm (1.59 inches)</td>\r<br />\n <td>30.79 mm (1.21 inches)</td>\r<br />\n <td>30.2 mm (1.19 inches)</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Width</td>\r<br />\n <td>16.5 mm (0.65 inches)</td>\r<br />\n <td>18.26 mm (0.72 inches)</td>\r<br />\n <td>18.3 mm (0.72 inches)</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Depth</td>\r<br />\n <td>18.0 mm (0.71 inches)</td>\r<br />\n <td>19.21 mm (0.76 inches)</td>\r<br />\n <td>18.1 mm (0.71 inches)</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Weight</td>\r<br />\n <td>4.0 grams (0.14 ounces)</td>\r<br />\n <td>4.28 grams (0.15 ounces)</td>\r<br />\n <td>4.3 grams (0.15 ounces)</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n</table>\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h4>Charging Case</h4>\r<br />\n<table>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <th></th>\r<br />\n <th>AirPods (Second-Generation) Charging Case</th>\r<br />\n <th>AirPods (Third-Generation) Charging Case</th>\r<br />\n <th>AirPods (Fourth-Generation) Charging Case</th>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Height</td>\r<br />\n <td>53.5 mm (2.11 inches)</td>\r<br />\n <td>46.40 mm (1.83 inches)</td>\r<br />\n <td>46.2 mm (1.82 inches)</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Width</td>\r<br />\n <td>44.3 mm (1.74 inches)</td>\r<br />\n <td>54.40 mm (2.14 inches)</td>\r<br />\n <td>50.1 mm (1.97 inches)</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Depth</td>\r<br />\n <td>21.3 mm (0.84 inches)</td>\r<br />\n <td>21.38 mm (0.84 inches)</td>\r<br />\n <td>21.2 mm (0.83 inches)</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n <tr>\r<br />\n <td>Weight</td>\r<br />\n <td>38.2 grams (1.35 ounces)</td>\r<br />\n <td>37.91 grams (1.34 ounces)</td>\r<br />\n <td>32.3 grams (1.14 ounces)\r<br />\n<strong>ANC model</strong>: 34.7 grams (1.22 ounces)</td>\r<br />\n </tr>\r<br />\n</table>\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>Is It Worth Upgrading?</h3>\r<br />\nThe ‌AirPods 4‌, especially the ANC version, represent a significant step forward over their predecessors. The most crucial upgrade is the introduction of active noise cancellation (ANC) on the ‌AirPods 4‌ with ANC, a first for Apple's open-ear earbuds. This elevates the overall listening experience by enabling users to enjoy their music and calls in noisier environments without needing silicone in-ear tips. For many, this alone will justify the upgrade, particularly for users who dislike the fit of in-ear designs like the ‌AirPods Pro‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAnother standout improvement is the sound quality. With a newly designed low-distortion driver, the ‌AirPods 4‌ deliver deeper bass, clearer highs, and better overall clarity than previous models. This is further enhanced by Apple's Adaptive EQ and Personalized Spatial Audio technology, which optimize the sound to each listener's ear. This improvement is significant enough that even casual listeners will notice a marked difference, particularly if they're upgrading from the AirPods 2 or AirPods 3, where sound quality improvements were more incremental.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFit and comfort have also seen refinements. The ‌AirPods 4‌ feature a narrower, more ergonomic design that fits a wider range of ears more securely, addressing complaints about the AirPods 3's less secure fit for some users. The charging case has also been made 10% smaller and, in the ANC version, includes a speaker for easier tracking through Apple's ‌Find My‌ app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h4>Upgrading From AirPods 2</h4>\r<br />\nIf you're coming from AirPods 2, upgrading to the ‌AirPods 4‌ is a worthwhile move, with a large number of significant design, sound, and basic quality-of-life improvements. The AirPods 2 lack many features that became standard in subsequent models, such as improved sound quality and spatial audio. Users upgrading from the AirPods 2 will find the ‌AirPods 4‌ with ANC to be an even bigger leap forward.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h4>Upgrading From AirPods 3</h4>\r<br />\nFor AirPods 3 users, the decision is more nuanced. The sound quality and comfort improvements are notable but perhaps not enough for all users to justify the switch unless ANC is a priority. If noise isolation and the ability to listen comfortably in busy environments are critical for you, then the ‌AirPods 4‌ with ANC would be a worthwhile upgrade. For those who don't need ANC and are satisfied with the sound quality of the AirPods 3, sticking with your current model might be more practical unless comfort and fit are a persistent issue.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h4>Upgrading From ‌AirPods Pro‌</h4>\r<br />\nThose using ‌AirPods Pro‌ likely won't find enough reason to switch unless they are seeking a lighter, open-ear design without silicone tips. The ‌AirPods 4‌ can't match the noise cancellation or seal of the Pro, but they offer a more comfortable alternative for those who prefer an open-ear fit while retaining many of the features Pro users enjoy, such as Personalized Spatial Audio and dynamic head tracking.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h4>‌AirPods 4‌ or ‌AirPods 4‌ With ANC?</h4>\r<br />\nChoosing between the ‌AirPods 4‌ and the ‌AirPods 4‌ with ANC largely hinges on whether active noise cancellation is a priority for you. If you frequently find yourself in noisy environments—such as commuting on public transport, traveling by plane, or working in cafes—the ‌AirPods 4‌ with ANC should dramatically improve your experience for just $50 more. Although the noise cancellation isn't as affective as that of the ‌AirPods Pro‌, it performs surprisingly well for open-ear earbuds and offers enough isolation to make a difference in lower-frequency environments like engine hums and busy streets.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ability to charge with an Apple Watch or Qi wireless charger is also notable, as is the speaker in the charging case for ‌Find My‌. These added features generally make the ‌AirPods 4‌ with ANC worth the extra $50 over the non-ANC model for most enthusiastic tech users.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOn the other hand, if you haven't owned any AirPods before or simply don't feel the need for noise cancellation, the standard ‌AirPods 4‌ will be a more economical choice. They retain the sound quality improvements, spatial audio, and comfort enhancements of the ‌AirPods 4‌, but at a lower price point. For users upgrading from AirPods 2 or 3 and who rarely find themselves in noisy places, the ‌AirPods 4‌ are a good choice that will give you most of the key updates without the extra cost.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods 4</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-4-vs-previous-generations/\">AirPods 4 vs. Previous Generations Buyer's Guide: All Upgrades Compared</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/airpods-4-vs-previous-generations-buyers-guide-all-upgrades-compared.2436887/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2ae6ad9d54cef45ee2dd5187c8a43cb33193784f493716921068a5a12301574a","category":"Apple"}
