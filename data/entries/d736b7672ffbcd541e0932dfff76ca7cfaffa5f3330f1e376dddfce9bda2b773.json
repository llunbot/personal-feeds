And that’s where <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/enve-builds-new-foundation-collection-with-us-made-carbon-more-affordable-am30-mtb-wheels/\">ENVE’s Foundation Series wheels</a> come in, so I tested the AM30 mountain bike wheels to see how they compare.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve been riding the original M5 since they launched and they’ve held up impeccably. The AM30 is a decidedly more trail-to-all-mountain wheel than the XC-oriented M5, but it shares some of the key features and, for now*, come with Industry Nine hubs. (*Their Foundation Road/Gravel wheels now come with ENVE’s InnerDrive hubs, but the AM30 hasn’t made that switch…no word on whether they will)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For comparison, the AM30 wheelset is $1400, while the M6 “trail” wheelset is $2300. So, here’s what happens when you spend $900 less…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Actual weights &amp; widths</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-actual-weights-2-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2025\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-actual-weights-2-jpg.webp\" alt=\"actual weights of ENVE AM30 mountain bike wheels.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-actual-weights-2-jpg.webp 2025w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-actual-weights-2-297x110.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-actual-weights-2-1536x569.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-actual-weights-2-120x44.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-actual-weights-2-768x284.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The wheels ship bare and weigh in at 858g (front) and 1011g (rear) without rim tape or valve stems.

That’s 1906g total ready to ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tape and valve stems are included with the wheels, and these are equipped with a Micro Spline freehub body so I could test them with the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-trp-evo-12-speed-mountain-bike-drivetrain/\">TRP EVO 12 mountain bike group</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-actual-widths-2-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2025\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-actual-widths-2-jpg.webp\" alt=\"actual widths of ENVE AM30 mountain bike wheels.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-actual-widths-2-jpg.webp 2025w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-actual-widths-2-297x110.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-actual-widths-2-1536x569.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-actual-widths-2-120x44.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-actual-widths-2-768x284.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Claimed rim widths are 30mm internal and 39mm external. Mine measured 29.83mm internal and 38.92mm external…well within expected tolerances. Depth is a claimed 20mm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of the key differences between the AM30 and M-series. These have the same rim front and rear, while the M-series wheels use different profiles and widths front to rear. For example, the M6 measures 32mm front/internal and 29mm rear/internal.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-actual-widths-3-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-actual-widths-3-jpg.webp\" alt=\"actual widths of ENVE AM30 mountain bike wheels.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-actual-widths-3-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-actual-widths-3-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-actual-widths-3-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-actual-widths-3-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-actual-widths-3-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But the AM30 keeps one of ENVE’s best features – the wide bead wall with rounded corners. Using math, they should be 4.5mm wide each, and that’s exactly where mine ended up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my opinion, this is why ENVE’s wheels are so good, they’ve nailed a design that virtually eliminates pinch flats. Even when I’ve run intentionally too-low pressures and hit rocks just to test them, I didn’t have issues. Under normal setup and conditions, I’ve been able to rally rough terrain, rocks, and roots without fear. And without incident.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Details</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-details-1-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-details-1-jpg.webp\" alt=\"closeup details of ENVE AM30 mountain bike wheels.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-details-1-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-details-1-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-details-1-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-details-1-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-details-1-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what that looks like as a profile. Note the little bead seat channels, too, and rounded ramps to bring the tire up from the deeper center for easier tubeless tire installs.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-details-2-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-details-2-jpg.webp\" alt=\"closeup details of ENVE AM30 mountain bike wheels.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-details-2-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-details-2-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-details-2-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-details-2-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-details-2-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The ultra-shallow rim depth improved compliance, and these wheels are indeed very comfortable without giving up lateral stability or the ability to rail corners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>External nipples are now the norm for both Foundation and M-Series wheels, but they were a new thing for ENVE when this wheelset launched. But, these rims also use molded spoke holes, not drilled, which is a premium touch that’s trickled down.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-details-5-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-details-5-jpg.webp\" alt=\"closeup details of ENVE AM30 mountain bike wheels.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-details-5-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-details-5-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-details-5-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-details-5-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-details-5-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I also really like the matte finish that still allows some of the carbon’s sheen to come through. It’s subtle, but there.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-details-4-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2025\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-details-4-jpg.webp\" alt=\"closeup details of ENVE AM30 mountain bike wheels.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-details-4-jpg.webp 2025w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-details-4-297x110.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-details-4-1536x569.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-details-4-120x44.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-details-4-768x284.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a reason why a lot of wheel brands spec Industry Nine hubs…they’re fantastic. These I9 1/1 hubs are a proven element, and J-bend spokes are easy to source and replace at almost any bike shop. End caps are tool-free, making them easy to service and clean, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>ENVE AM30 ride review</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-riding-4.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1300\" height=\"1734\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-riding-4.jpg\" alt=\"mountain biker riding ENVE AM30 wheels.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-riding-4.jpg 1300w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-riding-4-225x300.webp 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-riding-4-90x120.webp 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-riding-4-768x1024.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-riding-4-1152x1536.webp 1152w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve ridden these in Deer Valley, Utah’s steep and flowing trails that (thanks to some local knowledge) weren’t always fully established.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve ridden them at Beech Mountain’s bike park, where lift-served trails range from groomed and bermed to “I can’t believe this many rocks exist in one place!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I’ve ridden it in Vermont’s expansive trail network of long climbs, blazing descents, technical trails, and man-made ramps and features:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-riding-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-riding-1.jpg\" alt=\"mountain biker riding ENVE AM30 wheels.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-riding-1.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-riding-1-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-riding-1-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-riding-1-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-riding-1-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Everywhere I’ve ridden them the AM30 wheels excelled. ENVE calls them the “one-wheelset quiver for lunch laps, park laps, and backcountry epics”, and I’d agree.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-riding-2-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-riding-2-jpg.webp\" alt=\"mountain biker riding ENVE AM30 wheels.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-riding-2-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-riding-2-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-riding-2-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-riding-2-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/enve-am30-mtb-wheels-review-riding-2-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ll admit, $1400 is still a lot for a wheelset, but it’s a lot better than $2300. And it finally put ENVE at a competitive price point without watering down the product or adding a ton of weight. These are only 277g heavier than the M6 (claimed weight comparisons), and some of that weight comes from the hubs, so it’s not all out at the rim.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason I often ride and recommend ENVE is because I’ve seen how they make their wheels. I’ve ridden them enough to know they hold up to abuse. I appreciate the design thinking that goes into them. And I appreciate that they’re made in the USA (and in this case with US-made hubs, too).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re looking for a bombproof mountain bike wheel that’ll handle almost anything and has a killer pedigree, the ENVE AM30 is worth a look.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://enve.com/products/am30\" target=\"_blank\">ENVE.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/enve-am30-mountain-bike-wheel-review/\">Review: ENVE AM30 Foundation Mountain Bike Wheels</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"d736b7672ffbcd541e0932dfff76ca7cfaffa5f3330f1e376dddfce9bda2b773","category":"Cycling"}
