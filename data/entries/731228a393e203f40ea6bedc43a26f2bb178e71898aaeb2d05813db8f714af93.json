Today's beta focuses on small changes and refinements to iOS and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-15/\">iPadOS 15</a> features.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Weather App Icon</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nThe design of the Weather app icon has been tweaked slightly. It's a darker blue than the prior version.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/weather-app-icon-ios-15.jpg\" /><em><div><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a> b4 Weather app icon on left, ‌iOS 15‌ b5 Weather app icon on right</div></em>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Safari Reload Icon</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nIn Safari, when the address bar is collapsed while in the full web page view, the reload icon has been removed from the URL bar. The reload icon still shows in the standard view. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/ios-15-reload-icon.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the prior beta, the reload icon was shown in both views that are demonstrated in the screenshot above. In the current beta, it only shows in the standard view. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>iPadOS 15 Safari</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nIn ‌iPadOS 15‌, today's beta changes the shading of the tab interface in Safari in an effort to make it more clear which tab is the active tab.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/ipados-15-safari-design-b5.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>iPadOS 15 Home Screen Settings</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nIn the Settings app under <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/\">Home Screen</a> &amp; Dock, there's now an option on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> to use large icons.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/ipados-15-use-large-icons.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nWith the feature enabled, icons take up more space on the screen so there's less empty area, and it's also easier to tap on the app icon that you need. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/ipados-15-large-icons.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Control Center Camera Icon</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nApple in an earlier beta refined the icon for the Camera app, and in ‌iOS 15‌ beta 5, the camera icon in the Control Center is using the newly updated icon rather than the old icon.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/control-center-camera-icon-ios-15.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nDesign wise, the new icon does away with the shutter button.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/ios-15-lock-screen-camera-icon.jpg\" /><em><div>Old camera icon on left, new camera icon on right</div></em>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Control Center Sound Recognition Icon</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nApple has also changed the icon for the Sound Recognition feature in the Control Center. It was previously a sound wave in a square, but now it is a sound wave with a little magnifying glass search icon.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/sound-recognition-icon.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>iPhone Power Off</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nWhen turning off the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, there's now a tappable warning that the ‌iPhone‌ will remain findable after it's turned off. If you tap on it, there's an option to \"Temporarily Turn Off Finding.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/iphone-power-off-find-my.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Splash Screens</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nApple has added new splash screens with feature descriptions for apps like <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a>, Reminders, Home, and Maps.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/ios-15-splash-screens.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Background Sounds</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nThere's a new option to turn off Background Sounds when an ‌iPhone‌ is locked, which can be found under Settings &gt; Accessibility &gt; Audio and Visual&gt; Background Sounds.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>TestFlight Info in App Store</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nWhen you look up an app in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, if you have the TestFlight version installed from a developer, the ‌App Store‌ listing will display the TestFlight version that you have installed and will offer a link to open the TestFlight app. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/ios-15-testflight.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Legacy Contacts</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nAccording to Apple's release notes for the update, Legacy Contacts has been removed in beta 5 and will be re-added in a later update.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<h2>Other New Features</h2>\r\n<br />\r\nKnow of something new in the beta that we left out?
