Our review praised the improved display and the thin bezels, as well as the killer battery life. “That wasn’t quite our experience, but it’s close. With the display set at 150 nits and playing back a movie on an endless loop in the TV app, our battery lasted 17.5 hours—very close enough to Apple’s 18-hour claim,” the review reads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This 13.6-inch laptop features a Liquid Retina Display with vivid colors and deep contrast, as well as a 256GB SSD so you can store all your personal files and have plenty of room to install apps. And the M2 chip will ensure you have speedy performance and quick loading times, as well as Apple Intelligence support with macOS 15.1 coming next week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So hurry up and get your very own MacBook Air for its best price yet.
