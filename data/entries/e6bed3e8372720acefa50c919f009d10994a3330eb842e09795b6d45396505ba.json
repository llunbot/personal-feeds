Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>\n<p>CHARLOTTE, North Carolina — Before letting us loose on the freshly laid tarmac of Ten Tenths Motor Club, Chevrolet was at pains to tell us that the new Blazer SS \"is not a track car.\" Sure, there's a \"competitive mode\" to the suite of electronic settings and the fastest 0–60 mph time of any SS-badged Chevy to date. The upgrades have been focused on making the Blazer EV \"stop, go, and turn\" better, and you don't need to be driving hard to appreciate the benefits.</p>\n<p>The Blazer EV had a rocky start.

Nominal power output is 515 hp (384 kW) and 450 lb-ft (610 Nm), which jumps to 615 hp (458 kW) and 650 lb-ft (880 Nm) if you engage the \"Wide Open Watts\" mode.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/2025-chevrolet-blazer-ev-ss-first-drive-a-big-ride-and-handling-upgrade/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/04/2025-chevrolet-blazer-ev-ss-first-drive-a-big-ride-and-handling-upgrade/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
