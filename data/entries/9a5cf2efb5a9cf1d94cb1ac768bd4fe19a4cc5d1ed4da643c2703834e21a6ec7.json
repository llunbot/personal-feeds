Even though the term Business Intelligence (BI) has been around since the mid-1800s (according to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_intelligence\">Wikipedia</a>) adoption of contemporary BI tools within enterprises is still fairly low.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://quicksight.aws\">Amazon QuickSight</a> was designed to make it easier for you to put BI to work in your organization. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-quicksight-fast-easy-to-use-business-intelligence-for-big-data-at-110th-the-cost-of-traditional-solutions/\">Announced</a> in 2015 and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-quicksight-now-generally-available-fast-easy-to-use-business-analytics-for-big-data/\">launched</a> in 2016, <span>QuickSight</span> is a scalable BI service built for the cloud.

Today I am happy to announce the general availability of Q, and would like to show you how it works!</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2021/q_quick_q_v1.png\" />To recap, Q is a natural language query tool for the Enterprise Edition of <span>QuickSight</span>. Powered by machine learning, it makes your existing data more accessible, and therefore more valuable. Think of Q as your personal Business Intelligence Engineer or Data Analyst, one that is on call 24 hours a day and always ready to provide you with quick, meaningful results! You get high-quality results in seconds, always shown in an appropriate form.</p> \n<p>Behind the scenes, Q uses Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to discover the intent of your question. Aided by models that have been trained to recognize vocabulary and concepts drawn from multiple domains (sales, marketing, retail, HR, advertising, financial services, health care, and so forth), Q is able to answer questions that refer all data sources supported by <span>QuickSight</span>. This includes data from AWS sources such as <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/\">Amazon Redshift</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/rds/\">Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS)</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/\">Amazon Aurora</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/athena\">Amazon Athena</a>, and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/\">Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)</a> as well as third party sources &amp; SaaS apps such as Salesforce, Adobe Analytics, ServiceNow, and Excel.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Q in Action</strong></span><br /> Q is powered by topics, which are generally created by QuickSight Authors for use within an organization (if you are a QuickSight Author, you can learn more about <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/quicksight-q-get-started.html\">getting started</a>). Topics represent subject areas for questions, and are created interactively. To learn more about the five-step process that Authors use to create a topic, be sure to watch our new video, <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/586497463/e44b423dfd\">Tips to Create a Great Q Topic</a>.</p> \n<p>To use Q, I simply select a topic (<strong>B2B Sales</strong> in this case) and enter a question in the Q bar at the top of the page:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2021/q_how_are_sales_2.png\" /></p> \n<p>In addition to the actual results, Q gives me access to explanatory information that I can review to ensure that my question was understood and processed as desired. For example, I can click on <strong>sales</strong> and learn how Q handles the field:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2021/q_sales_bgd_1.png\" /></p> \n<p>I can fine-tune each aspect as well; here I clicked <strong>Sorted by</strong>:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2021/q_change_sales_sort_2.png\" /></p> \n<p>Q chooses an appropriate visual representation for each answer, but I can fine-tune that as well:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2021/q_change_sales_vis_type_1.png\" /></p> \n<p>Perhaps I want a donut chart instead:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2021/q_sales_donut_1.png\" /></p> \n<p>Now that you have seen how Q processes a question and gives you control over how the question is processed &amp; displayed, let’s take a look at a few more questions, starting with “which product sells best in south?”</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2021/q_best_sales_south_1.png\" /></p> \n<p>Here’s “what is total sales by region and category?” using the <strong>vertical stacked bar chart</strong> visual:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2021/q_total_sales_region_category_1.png\" /></p> \n<p><span><strong>Behind the Scenes – Q Topics</strong></span><br /> As I mentioned earlier, Q uses topics to represent a particular subject matter. I click <strong>Topics</strong> to see the list of topics that I have created or that have been shared with me:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2021/q_topics_1.png\" /></p> \n<p>I click <strong>B2B Sales</strong> to learn more. The Summary page is designed to provide QuickSight Authors with information that they can use to fine-tune the topic:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2021/q_topic_b2b_1.png\" /></p> \n<p>I can click on the <strong>Data</strong> tab and learn more about the list of fields that Q uses to answer questions. Each field can have some synonyms or friendly names to make the process of asking questions simpler and more natural:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2021/q_topic_fields_1.png\" /></p> \n<p>I can expand a field (row) to learn more about how Q “understands” and uses the field. I can make changes in order to exercise control over the types of aggregations that make sense for the field, and I can also provide additional semantic information:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2021/q_one_field_info_1.png\" /></p> \n<p>As an example of providing additional semantic information, if the field’s <strong>Semantic Type</strong> is <strong>Location</strong>, I can choose the appropriate sub-type:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2021/q_location_zip_1.png\" /></p> \n<p>The <strong>User Activity</strong> tab shows me the questions that users are asking of this topic:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2021/q_b2b_user_active_1.png\" /></p> \n<p><span>QuickSight</span> Authors can use this tab to monitor user feedback, get a sense of the most common questions, and also use the common questions to drive improvements to the content provided on QuickSight dashboards.</p> \n<p>Finally, the <strong>Verified answers</strong> tab shows the answers that have been manually reviewed and approved:</p> \n<p><img src=\"https://media.amazonwebservices.com/blog/2021/q_verified_1.png\" /></p> \n<p><span><strong>Things to Know</strong></span><br /> Here are a couple of things to know about Amazon QuickSight Q:</p> \n<p><strong>Pricing</strong> – There’s a monthly fee for each Reader and each Author; take a look at the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight/pricing/\">QuickSight Pricing Page</a> for more information.</p> \n<p><strong>Regions</strong> – Q is available in the <span>US East (N. Virginia)</span>, <span>US West (Oregon)</span>, <span>US East (Ohio)</span>, <span>Europe (Ireland)</span>, <span>Europe (Frankfurt)</span>, and <span>Europe (London)</span> Regions.</p> \n<p><strong>Supported Languages</strong> – We are launching with question support in English.</p> \n<p>— <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeffbarr\">Jeff</a>;</p>","author":"Jeff Barr","siteTitle":"AWS News Blog","siteHash":"6093e072e4117ec22616e844cb857d03ca62c57a411a8affc77cb5e8b6b15bf6","entryHash":"9a5cf2efb5a9cf1d94cb1ac768bd4fe19a4cc5d1ed4da643c2703834e21a6ec7","category":"Tech"}
