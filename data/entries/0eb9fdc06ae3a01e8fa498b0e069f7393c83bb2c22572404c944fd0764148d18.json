The initial pilot for the video ads, which Discord calls Video Quests on Mobile, will offer advertisers the ability to “showcase trailers, make impactful announcements, and highlight premium content” to users, Discord said.</p>\n<p>Discord was a <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2024-01-31_-_testimony_-_citron.pdf\">proudly ad-free</a> platform until March 2024, when it <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/discord-starts-down-the-dangerous-road-of-ads-this-week/\">introduced ads to its desktop and console</a> apps. Those ads offer Discord users rewards for PC games if they play certain games or get people to watch a stream of their gameplay through Discord. Discord followed up with Video Quests, which let developers show Discord users video ads, like trailers and announcements of new seasons and downloadable content. Discord users see prompts for both types of ads on the bottom-left side of their screen and can choose to expand or ignore them.</p>\n<p>Discord users can also opt out of personalized promotions and “hide an in-app promotion for a specific Quest or game you’re not interested in,” <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/22225719947543-Discord-Quests-FAQ#h_01HVPBZR5FP77BF55STCFXMRS9\">Discord said</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/discord-heightens-ad-focus-by-introducing-video-ads-to-mobile-apps-in-june/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/discord-heightens-ad-focus-by-introducing-video-ads-to-mobile-apps-in-june/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0eb9fdc06ae3a01e8fa498b0e069f7393c83bb2c22572404c944fd0764148d18","category":"Tech"}
