Your mobile provider will most likely want to charge a small fortune for overseas data plans or you’ll have to deal with the hassle of trying to buy a local SIM card when you arrive at your destination. Neither are great ways to start a holiday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, there’s a better solution – eSIMs. These allow you to set up your service before you leave home, don’t come with expensive rolling contracts, and can be used in a huge range of locations. That’s why they should be the first thing on your list when planning an international trip – plus the fact that you can get 10% off on your first <a href=\"https://go.ubigi.com/bO5n9B\">Ubigi eSIM</a> data plan purchase with the code <strong>MACWORLD </strong>right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is an eSIM?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As you may have already guessed from the name, these are software versions of SIM cards that don’t require you to put the actual plastic cards into your devices. This means you can’t lose them and they can be set up to be used in a huge selection of countries.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Ubigi eSIM promotion\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1080w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2.jpeg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><br /></figcaption></figure><p>Ubigi</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>They’re compatible with a variety of iPhones, going as far back as the XS, XS Max and XR, as well as plenty of the cellular equipped iPads. In fact, in recent years, US iPhones have become eSIM-only, but you can hold multiple ones on the same handset, which is one of the advantages of not being limited to physical cards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can get eSIMs from a range of suppliers, with Ubigi in particular being one of the most trusted names in the travel eSIM space.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Travel without hassle or expense</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s already plenty of things to think about when on a foreign trip, so you don’t want to be worrying about staying connected on your iPhone. That’s why eSIMs are so useful, as you can prepare everything before you leave. With Ubigi travel eSIMs you can even get them 6 months before you travel, with the peace of mind that they’ll automatically start working when you arrive at your destination. This means that the moment your plane lands or the boat docks, you’ll have an active data connection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best part is that you can avoid the roaming charges from your normal carriers, which can be expensive, and instead get close to the normal local rates of the country’s network providers. Should you be travelling through multiple locations, then Ubigi will follow you everywhere as it works in over 200 destinations worldwide. You only need to install the eSIM once and then you can use the dedicated app to top up data as your journey unfolds. No worries and no fuss, especially since you can top up via the app even if you run out of data and can’t connect to WiFi.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ubigi_device.webp?w=1200\" alt=\"Ubigi device\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ubigi_device.webp?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2732w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ubigi_device.webp?resize=300%2C225&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ubigi_device.webp?resize=768%2C576&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ubigi_device.webp?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ubigi_device.webp?resize=1536%2C1151&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Ubigi_device.webp?resize=2048%2C1535&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Ubigi</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Flexible plans that work for you</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.ubigi.com/bO5n9B\">Ubigi</a> travel eSIM data plans come in so many options that you’ll be bound to find one that suits your needs while abroad.
