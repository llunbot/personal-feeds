As with Matter, the idea is to have smart locks that are compatible with any smartphone or wearable device, without the need for an app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to the CSA, the <a href=\"https://csa-iot.org/all-solutions/aliro/\">goal for the Aliro protocol</a> is to \"foster widespread adoption of consumer electronic devices to unlock doors and openings\" by creating a consistent experience across certified hardware devices.\r<br />\n<blockquote>\"As we've seen with the introduction of Matter, it's been proven that global collaboration around a shared mission along open standards is the best way to achieve broader adoption of new technology,\" explains Connectivity Standards Alliance President and CEO Tobin Richardson. \"The Alliance and its members are now using that same model to unlock the potential of digital access experience, with the creation of a new standard and credential that makes adoption easier for mobile device and access control reader companies.\"</blockquote>\r<br />\nAliro would be a common communication protocol and credential that would make it much simpler to get a digital key for a smart lock and unlock a door using a wearable or smartphone. The CSA says that it will have a \"lasting impact\" on the way that people access homes, corporate offices, warehouses, hotel rooms, healthcare facilities, universities, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAliro will support a wide range of transmission technologies, including NFC, Bluetooth LE, and Ultra Wideband, along with asymmetric cryptography and credential data. It is meant to work the same way across devices regardless of hardware and operating system.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is an Aliro member, and it already has some of the groundwork for the functionality as it is described by the CSA. The CSA suggests that people will be able to use smartphones and wearables to unlock their homes in place of a physical key, something that Apple supports with Home Key already. Home Key allows a digital key to be added to the Wallet app to unlock a HomeKit-compatible door over NFC without opening an app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple, Google, Qualcomm, Samsung, and other CSA members support the Aliro effort.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/aliro/\">Aliro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/09/aliro-smart-lock-standard/\">New 'Aliro' Standard Aims to Simplify Unlocking Doors With Smartphones</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-aliro-standard-aims-to-simplify-unlocking-doors-with-smartphones.2410507/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e7826edaac22761e642d8289a4e886e7f2e8e09a03b0be1605966c2971b8306b","category":"Apple"}
