The spacecraft for the OSAM-1 mission is partially built, but NASA announced Friday that officials decided to cancel the project \"following an in-depth, independent project review.\"</p>\n<p>The space agency cited \"continued technical, cost, and schedule challenges\" for the decision to cancel OSAM-1.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2007727#p3\">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2007727&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b2d0f791a097c4010160790a91a6f246b4e7da644da883fd7bdaddccc8515f08","category":"Tech"}
