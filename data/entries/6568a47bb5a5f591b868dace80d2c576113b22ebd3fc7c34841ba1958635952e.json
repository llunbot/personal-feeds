Whether hauling groceries or kids, they can handle a lot more of the day-to-day errand running than most other forms of two-wheeled transport. The problem with some of the higher-end cargo bikes is that the upfront costs can be <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/09/haul-it-all-treks-latest-e-bike-offering-is-a-cargo-bike/3/\">competitive with a decent used car</a> (although operating costs will be dramatically lower) without offering quite the flexibility that a car might.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, as Beth Mole discovered, you don't necessarily have to spend that much to get <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/a-cycling-newb-tries-a-cargo-e-bike-the-user-friendly-maven/\">a decent riding experience</a>, putting cars at a further disadvantage. That left me curious as to what the price floor for a decent cargo bike might beâ€”how little can you pay and still get a satisfactory experience? I was also keen for a second try on my experiment of going a month without using a car, meant to happen during my earlier review but interrupted by wildfire smoke.</p>\n<p>All of which explains why I took delivery of a $1,500 cargo bike <a href=\"https://www.cycrown.com/products/cycwagen-dual-battery-cargo-ebike\">called the CycWagon</a>, from a company called Cycrown. It's currently well on its way toward getting me through a car-free month, but it has... well, a lot of issues.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044077#p3\">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044077&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6568a47bb5a5f591b868dace80d2c576113b22ebd3fc7c34841ba1958635952e","category":"Tech"}
