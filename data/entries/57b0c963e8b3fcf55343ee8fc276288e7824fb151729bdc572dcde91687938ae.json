We know that Intel will use a mix of up to four E-cores and four P-cores in the CPU, a step down in core count from what was available in Meteor Lake. We know Lunar Lake includes a next-generation Arc GPU based on the \"Battlemage\" architecture that promises up to 1.5 times better performance than the current Arc-integrated GPU. We know that at least some models are shifting to RAM that's soldered to the CPU package, similar to how Apple packages RAM in its M-series processors. And we know that Lunar Lake includes a boosted neural processing unit (NPU) for local generative AI processing, Intel's first chip fast enough to qualify for <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/microsofts-copilot-ai-pc-requirements-are-embarrassing-for-intel-and-amd/\">Microsoft's Copilot+ label</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040211#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2040211&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"57b0c963e8b3fcf55343ee8fc276288e7824fb151729bdc572dcde91687938ae","category":"Tech"}
