In 2017 and 2018, it released red mid-cycle versions of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 8 lines, respectively. Then in 2021, Apple added a purple color to the iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 mini models for the spring season in late April. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn March 2022, the iPhone 13 lineup received new green finishes, and in the same month last year, Apple released the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus in a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/07/apple-announces-yellow-iphone-14/\">new yellow color</a>. Each new color launch has been accompanied by a significant ad campaign to attract new customers and upgraders who did not make a purchase when the latest iPhone series was originally launched in the fall. This year could be different, however. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to Chinese Weibo-based leaker <a href=\"https://weibo.com/5143897135/O93GA1RPe?pagetype=profilefeed\">Instant Digital</a>, there is no new spring color scheme on the cards for the iPhone 15. It's also worth noting that Apple has already launched several iPhone cases and Apple Watch bands in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/04/apple-refreshes-cases-and-watch-bands/\">refreshed color options</a>. The refreshed accessories arrived when Apple released the new MacBook Air in early March. In previous years, such a move has often been accompanied by a new iPhone color.  \r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhy Apple would forego the opportunity to boost sales in the middle of an iPhone cycle is not entirely clear, so it is worth taking the latest rumor with a pinch of salt for now. Production delays have reportedly <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/28/new-ipad-models-may-launch/\">pushed the release of new iPads into May</a>, and Apple is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/09/apple-event-for-new-ipads-still-unlikely/\">not expected to hold a launch event</a> to announce the devices, but the debut of a new iPhone color could always come separately in the form of a press release, which Apple has opted for in the past.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instant-digital/\">Instant Digital</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15\">iPhone 15 (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/10/iphone-15-new-spring-color-unlikely/\">New Mid-Cycle iPhone 15 Color Looking Increasingly Unlikely This Year</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-mid-cycle-iphone-15-color-looking-increasingly-unlikely-this-year.2423915/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f166b5aa32fa63bf3cb184ec1525a9e865a0f4bc69aef28be7fc3fb882489c9c","category":"Apple"}
