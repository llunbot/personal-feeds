In terms of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-electric-mountain-bikes/\" target=\"_blank\">electric mountain bikes</a>, the Patron gets all the bells and whistles, including a few features you might not expect.</p>\n<p>At the centre of the Scott Patron eRIDE is a fully carbon frame, which is available in four sizes (S, M, L, XL). Scott says that smoother continuous lines make for a lighter carbon layup and stiffer overall construction.</p>\n<p>The bike’s geometry is up to date, with a slack 65-degree head angle, a relatively steep 76.9 degrees seat tube angle, a long-ish 1,253mm wheelbase and 454mm chainstays on the size large bike.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Rotating the motor by 46 degrees allows better structural support and cooling, Scott says.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Scott</i></span></div>\n<p>Bosch’s latest Performance CX drive unit is cradled in the frame. Scott says the motor has been rotated by 46 degrees to support it from beneath, create a stiffer structure, protect the motor and improve cooling. If you have never experienced an ebike motor overheating, well, now you probably never will.</p>\n<p>For longer days in the saddle, the bike utilises an all-new 750Wh battery, which is integrated into the down tube and easily removable without the need for any tools.</p>\n<p>This presents a 20 per cent increase in battery capacity (compared to older, smaller batteries), which Scott claims will give you a 100km range or 2,000m of climbing in Eco mode, or half the amount in Turbo.</p>\n<p>The Patron’s big battery, modern geometry and high-end construction are matched by its 160mm of front and rear suspension travel; it’s clearly suitable for big days out in the mountains. Scott’s proprietary TwinLoc remote flicks through three settings (Descend, Traction Control, Lockout) on the Fox suspension.</p>\n<p>Integration is a keyword in Scott’s launch material for the Patron, and perhaps the most surprising element of the bike is the rear shock placement.</p>\n<p>Hidden inside the top tube but easily accessible via a removable port, Scott says the shock integration protects it from the elements and helps make space elsewhere for large water bottles.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Patron’s integrated rear shock is hidden in the top tube.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Scott</i></span></div>\n<p>Continuing the integration theme, Scott deals with the bike’s numerous cables by routing them through the headset top cap and into the frame.</p>\n<p>So, what is included in the cockpit?</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The cockpit is tidied up by integrated cable routing.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Scott</i></span></div>\n<p>Aside from the obvious brakes and gear shifter, there’s also the TwinLoc lever, dropper seatpost lever, the new Bosch remote and new Bosch Kiox 300 display. Plus, there’s a remote for the bike’s integrated LED rear lights, which are powered by the motor’s battery and recessed into a supplied rear mud fender.</p>\n<p>It may be aimed at big trail rides in the mountains, but the Patron eRIDE is adaptable as a trekking bike or all-conditions transport.</p>\n<p>The bike comes with front and rear fenders, and those rear lights, and accessories available from Syncros, including a kickstand, rear rack, and even an action camera mount.</p>\n<h2>Scott Patron eRide models</h2>\n<p>Four build options range from £6,099 to £9,999.
