By default, when someone uses command-line tools built into Go to download or install packages, requests are routed through the service. A description on the site says the proxy is provided by the Go team and “run by Google.”</p>\n<h2>Caching in</h2>\n<p>Since November 2021, the Go Module Mirror has been hosting a backdoored version of a widely used module, security firm Socket <a href=\"https://socket.dev/blog/malicious-package-exploits-go-module-proxy-caching-for-persistence\">said Monday</a>. The file uses “typosquatting,” a technique that gives malicious files names similar to widely used legitimate ones and plants them in popular repositories. In the event someone makes a typo or even a minor variation from the correct name when fetching a file with the command line, they land on the malicious file instead of the one they wanted. (A similar typosquatting scheme is common with domain names, too.)</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/02/backdoored-package-in-go-mirror-site-went-unnoticed-for-3-years/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/02/backdoored-package-in-go-mirror-site-went-unnoticed-for-3-years/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b297a7a893cdab9e16b7309bee165f65372a1bde07db3b9573ba61c22f942cc6","category":"Tech"}
