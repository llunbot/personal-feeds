The curtain has officially come down on the last Grand Tour of the season. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/primoz-roglic\" target=\"_blank\">Primož Roglič</a> won the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/vuelta-a-espana\" target=\"_blank\">Vuelta a España</a> by 2min 36sec ahead of Ben O’Connor and 3min 13sec from Enric Mas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jay Vine climbed his way to the top of the mountains standings as fellow Aussie Kaden Groves won the points classification.

As O’Connor faded in the final stages, Roglič seemed to get stronger and stronger. By the final weekend, which involved a mountainous Stage 20 and final day individual time-trial, the outcome felt a foregone conclusion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roglič finished in second place on Stage 21, a day on which <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/groupama-fdj\" target=\"_blank\">Groupama-FDJ’s</a> Stefan Küng finally got his first Grand Tour stage victory. O’Connor managed to hold on for second overall. It marks the end of his tenure with Decathlon-AG2R La Mondiale as he departs for Jayco-AlUla next season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The perennial Vuelta bridesmaid, Enric Mas, who finished second in 2018, 2021 and 2022, placed third overall, seeing off all the challenges thrown at him by fourth place Richard Carapaz but not quite managing to overhaul O’Connor.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n

three-stage Tour de Romandie Féminin was won by <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/sd-worx-protime\" target=\"_blank\">SD Worx-Protime’s</a> Lotte Kopecky, narrowly beating teammate <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/demi-vollering\" target=\"_blank\">Demi Vollering</a>, with Lidl-Trek’s Gaia Realini completing the podium.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After Elisa Balsamo sprinted into the race lead on Stage 1, Stage 2 culminated with a Category 1 summit finish on Vercorin. It was in the final 2km that an attack from Realini drew out Kopecky and Vollering. The tenacious Italian kept making moves on the front to drop the SD Worx duo but couldn’t answer an attack from Vollering heading into the last kilometre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kopecky could though. The pair powered on towards the mountaintop finish. It went down to a sprint finish similar to Strade Bianche in 2023, both throwing their bikes to the line for stage honours, which would eventually be awarded to Vollering. It was a decent trade-off as Kopecky moved into the race lead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Visma-Lease a Bike’s Riejanne Markus won the two-up sprint against breakaway companion and future Lidl-Trek teammate Niamh Fisher-Black as Kopecky finished third on the final day, 21sec back, to secure overall victory. Vollering was one of many riders who went down in a crash in the final kilometre, but with the 3km rule in place, her podium spot was secure.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Stevie Williams wins men’s Tour of Britain</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/ToB-2024-075-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/ToB-2024-075-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/ToB-2024-075-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/ToB-2024-075-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/ToB-2024-075-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/ToB-2024-075-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/ToB-2024-075-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/ToB-2024-075-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/ToB-2024-075-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/ToB-2024-075-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/ToB-2024-075-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>James York</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Stevie Williams won the Tour of Britain by 16sec ahead of fellow Brit Oscar Onley and 36sec ahead of Frenchman Tom Donnenwirth over the six-stage race that ended in Felixstowe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a race that brought abundance for Soudal-QuickStep’s young sprinter Paul Magnier, who scored a hattrick of victories and all but won the points jersey.

Given that Dostiyev has admitted to the anti-doping violation, the rider has been suspended from racing, and his contract has been immediately terminated.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CERA is a variant of EPO, and when not being used to cheat in cycling races, it is typically used to treat anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See you next week.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/vuelta-a-espana-2024-reflections\">Vuelta a España 2024 reflections: Primož Roglič victorious, Australia’s champions, Equipo Kern Pharma and Max Poole shine</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-of-britain-2024-gallery\">The best photos from the Tour of Britain 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/vuelta-a-espana-2024-gallery\">The 21 best photos from the Vuelta a España 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/autumn-classics-guide\">Cycling autumn Classics 2024: Canadian and Italian race dates, details and live TV guide</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/pro-cycling-roglic-vuelta-tour-of-britain\">Pro Log: Roglič wins Vuelta, Vollering vs Kopecky (again), Astana doping case and Tour of Britain</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Robyn Davidson &#124; Editorial Assistant","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"3a4f4137b6cd4224aaf9084e9279b6d0f07516680fcadeb9cd8089185a589a04","category":"Cycling"}
