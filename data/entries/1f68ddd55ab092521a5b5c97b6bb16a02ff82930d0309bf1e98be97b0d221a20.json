{"title":"Free Fonts For Interface Designers","link":"https://smashingmagazine.com/2023/03/free-fonts-interface-designers/","date":1679302800000,"content":"<p>Not every project has the budget to spend a lot of money on fonts. But that doesn‚Äôt mean that typography needs to play a secondary role when the budget is tight. The variety and quality of free and open-source fonts out there is impressive and enables everyone to use <strong>beautiful, well-crafted typefaces</strong>.</p>\n<p>In this post, we compiled some free fonts that we came across and that you probably haven‚Äôt spotted before. Some of them shine with their flexibility, some put a special focus on readability, and others are a great choice if you want to make a bold statement. As different as the fonts are, they all have one thing in common: You can use them for free in both <strong>personal and commercial projects</strong>. A huge thank-you to the wonderful type designers and contributors for making their fonts available to all of us! üëèüèºüëèüèΩüëèüèæ </p>\nRecursive\n<p>Built to maximize versatility, control, and performance, <a href=\"https://www.recursive.design/\">Recursive</a> is a five-axis variable font that can go from Sans to Mono. Taking full advantage of variable font technology, it gives you <strong>full flexibility</strong>. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/open-source-fonts-roundup/recursive-opt.png\" /></p>\n<p>Recursive allows you to choose from a wide range of predefined styles or dial in exactly what you want for each of its axes: Monospace, Casual, Weight, Slant, and Cursive. Inspiration came from single-stroke casual signpainting to give the font a flexible and warmly energetic look, making it a great fit for data-rich-apps, technical documentation, code editors, and much more. Designed by Stephen Nixon, with contributions from Lisa Huang, Katja Schimmel, Rafa≈Ç Buchner, and Cris R HernaÃÅndez.</p>\nYrsa &amp; Rasa\n<p>The type families <a href=\"http://github.rosettatype.com/yrsa-rasa/\">Yrsa and Rasa</a> have a different approach than other type projects. They build upon the existing typefaces Merriweather and Skolar Gujarati to produce two entirely new type families that span <strong>different writing systems</strong>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/open-source-fonts-roundup/yrsa-rasa-opt.png\" /></p>\n<p>Yrsa supports over 92 languages in Latin script and has a special focus on properly shaping the accents in Central and East European languages. Rasa supports a wide array of basic and compound syllables used in Gujarati. Both type families include five weights and are intended for continuous reading on the web. Perfect for longer articles in online news, magazines, or blogs. Designed by Anna Giedry≈õ and David B≈ôezina.</p>\nSpace Grotesk\n<p><a href=\"https://fonts.floriankarsten.com/space-grotesk\">Space Grotesk</a> is a proportional sans-serif typeface variant based on Colophon Foundry‚Äôs fixed-width Space Mono family. It retains the idiosyncratic details of the monospace while optimizing for <strong>improved readability</strong> of non-display sizes.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/open-source-fonts-roundup/space-grotesk-opt.png\" /></p>\n<p>Space Grotesk includes four weights and open-type features like old-style and tabular figures, superscript and subscript numerals, fractions, and stylistic alternates. Latin Vietnamese, Pinyin, and all Western, Central, and South-Eastern European languages are supported. Designed by Kvƒõtoslav Barto≈° for Florian Karsten Typefaces.</p>\nFigtree\n<p><a href=\"https://www.erikdkennedy.com/projects/figtree.html\">Figtree</a> combines <strong>friendly curved shapes</strong>, a simple monolinear construction, a high x-height, and slight taper into a charming geometric typeface that ensures maximum readability.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/open-source-fonts-roundup/figtree-opt.png\" /></p>\n<p>Figtree comes in seven weights, ranging from Light to Black, and includes typographic finesses such as fractions, monospace numbers, and scientific inferiors. Minimal but not stiff, casual but not silly, the typeface beautifully manages to maintain a crisp, clean feeling. Designed by Erik Kennedy.</p>\nReforma\n<p><a href=\"https://pampatype.com/reforma\">Reforma</a> is a versatile font family designed for <strong>long-form reading</strong>. Commissioned to celebrate the centenary of the university reform of the Universidad Nacional de C√≥rdoba, Argentina, the typeface had to convey four premises: plurality, intellectual heritage, versatility, and free availability.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/open-source-fonts-roundup/reforma-opt.png\" /></p>\n<p>After three years of work, 20 font styles were born that work harmoniously in different contexts. They are grouped into three subfamilies ‚Äî from a classic serif to a modern sans-serif and an intermediate hybrid style with flare serifs ‚Äî and are available in three weights plus an ultra-black companion set for headings. Reforma beautifully manages to strike the balance between tradition and novelty while staying super-versatile. Designed by Alejandro Lo Celso, Jorge Ivan Moreno Majul, Francisco Galvez Pizarro, Francis Ramel, and Oscar Ya√±ez.</p>\nHanken Grotesk\n<p>If you‚Äôre looking for a versatile sans-serif typeface inspired by the classic grotesques, <a href=\"https://hanken.co/products/hanken-grotesk\">Hanken Grotesk</a> might be right down your alley. It shines with a friendly, distinguishable look and is equally suitable for <strong>small text and headings</strong>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/open-source-fonts-roundup/hanken-grotesk-opt.png\" /></p>\n<p>Nine weights are available, ranging from Thin to ExtraLight, Light, Regular, Medium, SemiBold, Bold, ExtraBold, and Black.

A modern classic designed by Alfredo Marco Pradil.</p>\nGrenze\n<p><a href=\"https://www.omnibus-type.com/fonts/Grenze/\">Grenze</a> combines the best of two worlds. As a <strong>hybrid</strong> between Roman and Blackletter styles, it transports a sense of boldness and texture while at the same time offering the readability of classical typefaces.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/open-source-fonts-roundup/grenze-opt.png\" /></p>\n<p>The family includes nine weights (Thin, Extra Light, Light, Regular, Medium, Semibold, Bold, Extra Bold, and Black) with matching italics. To respond to different needs, Grenze comes with some useful advanced features such as ligatures, ornaments, extended language support, and various figure sets.

Named after Braille Institute founder J. Robert Atkinson, the typeface focuses on <strong>letterform distinction</strong> to increase character recognition and improve readability.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/open-source-fonts-roundup/atkinson-hyperlegible-opt.png\" /></p>\n<p>Recognizable footprints, differentiated letterforms, unambiguous characters, and exaggerated forms are some of the techniques that optimize readability and give the typeface its distinctive look. Atkinson Hyperlegible includes four fonts, with two weights (Regular, Bold, Italics, Italics Bold). Thanks to accent characters, 27 languages are supported. Designed by Braille Institute of America.</p>\nAnek\n<p>The multi-script typeface <a href=\"https://design.google/library/anek-multiscript/\">Anek</a> tells a very special story. It covers <strong>nine Indian languages</strong> plus Latin and was created through a collaboration of twelve type designers working across eight cities in India. The design of each script is deeply rooted in its typographic culture, while the different scripts live together in visual harmony.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/open-source-fonts-roundup/anek-opt.png\" /></p>\n<p>All Anek fonts share visual similarities like circles and circular shapes, robust letter structures, and delicate joineries.

Hunt, <a href=\"https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro\">Source Sans</a> is Adobe‚Äôs first open-source typeface family. The sans-serif draws inspiration from classic grotesques and is characterized by a <strong>visual simplicity</strong> that works equally well in long-form texts just like as short labels in user interfaces.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/open-source-fonts-roundup/source-sans-opt.png\" /></p>\n<p>Source Sans comes in six weights (ExtraLight, Light, Regular, SemiBold, Bold, Black) plus matching italics.

Perfect for headings, branding, label design, logo type, quotes, and much more ‚Äî both on screen and in print.</p>\nDisket Mono\n<p>Monospace fonts often have a technical feel to them, waking connotations of coding editors or typewriters. <a href=\"https://rostype.com/disket/\">Disket Mono</a> is a bit different. The font strikes a <strong>perfect balance</strong> between the inspiration it draws from geometry, grids, and architecture and using soft corners for a more tactile, personal feel.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/open-source-fonts-roundup/disket-mono-opt.png\" /></p>\n<p>Disket Mono comes in two weights (Regular and Bold) and supports twenty languages.
