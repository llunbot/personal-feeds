Mokka to Go is a compact, light, and versatile stove-top percolator modeled after the coffee maker first designed in 1889 by Hanson Goodrich with patent No. 408,707. Much later, this design was popularized by the stove top octagonal coffee maker by Bialetti in 1933.</p>\n<p>What makes Mokka to Go unique is that it allows both hot brewing and cold dripping and it weighs only 271 grams AND fits in a standard bike bottle cage – It’s 179 mm tall and 75 mm wide. Each component of the unit is rebuildable, and it’s made to live a rough and tumble-lifestyle.</p>\n<p>Mokka to Go is available right now by reservation; a $1 deposit gets you a spot to pay $89, discounted from the $149 MSRP.
