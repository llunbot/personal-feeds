Like most sources, he has a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/\">mixed track record</a> with Apple rumors, with some hits and some misses. In 2020, he was the first source to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/14/prosser-airtags-design-likely-announced-tomorrow/\">reveal the design of the AirTag</a>, many months before it was announced. He also shared <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/11/ipad-mini-6-thinner-bezels-usb-c-rumor/\">many accurate details about the iPad mini 6</a>, months before that device was announced. On the other hand, he and others were wrong about the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/19/prosser-apple-watch-series-7-design/\">Apple Watch Series 7 having flat edges</a>, although perhaps Apple tested such a design.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nProsser has leaked several Apple-related details in recent weeks, including the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/iphone-17-pro-camera-design-leak/\">alleged designs of the iPhone 17 Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/17/iphone-17-air-front-page-tech-renders/\">iPhone 17 Air</a>. He also claimed that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/17/ios-19-redesigned-camera-app-visionos-rumor/\">iOS 19 will feature a redesigned Camera app</a> with a visionOS-like interface.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to announce the iPhone 17 Air in September.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<strong>Update:</strong> In response to this report, Young reiterated his <a href=\"https://x.com/DSCCRoss/status/1892716912091472071\">6.55-inch display size claim</a> for the iPhone 17 Air.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/\">Jon Prosser</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/20/iphone-17-air-now-rumored-to-feature-6-7-inch-display/\">iPhone 17 Air Now Rumored to Feature 6.7-Inch Display [Updated]</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-air-now-rumored-to-feature-6-7-inch-display-updated.2449819/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"10ef54d4b30ba033b05f5697f966a75ebb2da7dd3b0834ec3de094fef977f532","category":"Apple"}
