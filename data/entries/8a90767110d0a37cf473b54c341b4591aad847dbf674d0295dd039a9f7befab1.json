That would be a staggering challenge for any elite athlete. For someone who only started cycling less than three years ago it’s an extraordinary feat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It wasn’t long into her cycling journey that she got into ultracycling, and she rode the 2023 and 2024 editions of the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/riding-the-transcontinental-cycling\">Transcontinental Race</a>, plus the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/race-around-rwanda\">Race Around Rwanda</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I respond well to really aggressive targets from a mindset perspective,’ Ruggins says. ‘My first bike race was the TCR, which taught me that a lot of our limits are in our mind, and that I put restrictions on myself when I don’t have to, so setting a really aggressive target like the all-time record is a way for me to confront that and allow me to really push myself as hard as I think I can.’</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+6\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-6-970x300.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-6-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-6-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-6-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-6-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-6-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-6-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-6-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Route choice</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/sarah-training-ride-2024-04-07-16-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/sarah-training-ride-2024-04-07-16-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/sarah-training-ride-2024-04-07-16-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/sarah-training-ride-2024-04-07-16-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/sarah-training-ride-2024-04-07-16-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/sarah-training-ride-2024-04-07-16-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/sarah-training-ride-2024-04-07-16-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/sarah-training-ride-2024-04-07-16-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/sarah-training-ride-2024-04-07-16-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/sarah-training-ride-2024-04-07-16-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/sarah-training-ride-2024-04-07-16-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>James Busby</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Land’s End to John o’ Groats route is well known, but going for the overall record means Ruggins’s team needs to ensure she can navigate traffic and cities as fast as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The cities are really difficult and we want to avoid too many stop lights and things like that,’ she says. ‘Through Exeter, even though we’re on the ring roads, it will be incredibly busy so we know that I’m going to lose the follow cars when I get there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘When we get to these busy areas that we can’t avoid, the crew will be doing a hand-off to me before the city limits and then the second support vehicle will be waiting for me on the other side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The part I’m most looking forward to is crossing the border into Scotland. I spent six years of my life in Edinburgh, and it has a very special place in my heart, so I think I’ll get a big boost of energy knowing I’m heading for that border.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s worth noting that the Guinness World Record allows for either route – LEJOGLE or JOGLEJOG – because the record is officially just the fastest return journey between the two furthest points in the UK on a bicycle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Riders choose their direction based on expected conditions at the time of their record attempt, with MacDonald having chosen JOGLEJOG for his 2017 record due to the weather conditions.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n

She needed round-the-clock care and lost the ability to walk and use her hands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘CRPS is really severe nerve pain that will leave people bedridden or in a wheelchair for the rest of their lives, she explains. ‘Most often it develops after surgery. I had surgery on my feet because I had a running injury at the time, and your nervous system just inflames and starts telling you that you have third degree burns or broken bones all over your body when you don’t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I got that pain, but then I also got the paralysis of all of my limbs, so I couldn’t move as well. Typically for treatment they give you traditional pain blockers for pain management, but that didn’t work very well as it just made me into a zombie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Then you go through desensitisation therapy, where they train your body into understanding that things shouldn’t hurt you. They would rub a washcloth on your arm, which felt like knives, but they would have to do that over and over and over for months until my body retrained itself to know that that feeling didn’t hurt.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The experience of overcoming this devastating illness has left Ruggins with not just a profound motivation to see what she is physically capable but also a high pain threshold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘After having been through that and knowing that I could sit with that for years, these kind of events now are just a little bit of discomfort, so they don’t really phase me that much, and I’m not scared of much anymore,’ she says.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Closing chapters</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/sarah-ruggins-tcr-2-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/sarah-ruggins-tcr-2-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/sarah-ruggins-tcr-2-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/sarah-ruggins-tcr-2-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/sarah-ruggins-tcr-2-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/sarah-ruggins-tcr-2-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/sarah-ruggins-tcr-2-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/sarah-ruggins-tcr-2-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/sarah-ruggins-tcr-2-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/sarah-ruggins-tcr-2-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/sarah-ruggins-tcr-2-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>James Busby</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For Ruggins, going for this record is a way to turn the page on that particularly difficult period of her life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I was going to be a runner, I was going to be a competitive athlete in the Olympics and then that got taken away from me because of a life-changing illness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I struggled so much with mental health after my recovery and with doubting myself and my new capabilities. Doing this event and pushing myself to the limit and feeling the discomfort will be a way to experience some of the things that I felt when I was ill, but coming at it from a place of strength now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘I’m choosing to feel this way and I’m choosing to push myself, and I think that’s going to help me close the chapter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Cycling for me has just given me freedom, and it’s given me a whole new community of people that I didn’t know existed, and I’m terrified for the record, but extremely grateful to be able to go for it.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also not just about breaking the LEJOGLE record, but also an opportunity to help others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside the attempt she is raising money for the <a href=\"https://thebikeproject.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Bike Project</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikesforrefugees.scot/\" target=\"_blank\">Bikes for Refugees</a>, which help alleviate transportation poverty in England and Scotland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ruggins will start her LEJOGLE record attempt on either 11th or 12th May 2025, depending on weather conditions.
