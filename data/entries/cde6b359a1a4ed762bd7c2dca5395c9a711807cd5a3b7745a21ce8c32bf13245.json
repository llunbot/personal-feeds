The update allows users to connect to virtual training platforms (Zwift, Wahoo RGT, and others) without needing a power meter unit on their bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Wahoo-KICKR-ROLLR-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"493\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Wahoo-KICKR-ROLLR--800x493.jpeg\" alt=\"Wahoo KICKR ROLLR\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Wahoo-KICKR-ROLLR--800x493.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Wahoo-KICKR-ROLLR--297x183.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Wahoo-KICKR-ROLLR--120x74.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Wahoo-KICKR-ROLLR--768x473.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Wahoo-KICKR-ROLLR-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously, users needed a power meter unit on their bikes to enjoy the benefits of virtual training. The unit would piggy-pack off the bike’s power meter and translate that into resistance and speed on the roller unit.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Wahoo-KICKR-ROLLR-expander-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"492\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Wahoo-KICKR-ROLLR-expander--800x492.jpeg\" alt=\"Wahoo KICKR ROLLR expander\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Wahoo-KICKR-ROLLR-expander--800x492.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Wahoo-KICKR-ROLLR-expander--297x183.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Wahoo-KICKR-ROLLR-expander--120x74.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Wahoo-KICKR-ROLLR-expander--768x472.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Wahoo-KICKR-ROLLR-expander-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, users can enjoy the ride without needing extra equipment for the experience. Though this update would have made the Rollr a success from the start, it’s great to see it available. The update is good on any Wahoo Rollr system and enables the unit to control resistance, employ ERG mode, and simulate climbs without using an external power meter.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Wahoo-KICKR-ROLLR-out-of-the-saddle-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"499\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Wahoo-KICKR-ROLLR-out-of-the-saddle--800x499.jpeg\" alt=\"Wahoo KICKR ROLLR out of the saddle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Wahoo-KICKR-ROLLR-out-of-the-saddle--800x499.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Wahoo-KICKR-ROLLR-out-of-the-saddle--297x185.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Wahoo-KICKR-ROLLR-out-of-the-saddle--120x75.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Wahoo-KICKR-ROLLR-out-of-the-saddle--768x479.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Wahoo-KICKR-ROLLR-out-of-the-saddle-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is the Wahoo Kickr Rollr?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Wahoo markets the Rollr as a no-tools-needed-easy-set-trainer unit without needing to remove wheels or augment your outside ride setup. This unique roller and trainer combo makes the Wahoo Rollr an enticing unit for those looking for a quick spin or just starting their indoor training adventures.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Wahoo-KICKR-ROLLR-race-view-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"495\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Wahoo-KICKR-ROLLR-race-view--800x495.jpeg\" alt=\"Wahoo KICKR ROLLR race view\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Wahoo-KICKR-ROLLR-race-view--800x495.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Wahoo-KICKR-ROLLR-race-view--297x184.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Wahoo-KICKR-ROLLR-race-view--120x74.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Wahoo-KICKR-ROLLR-race-view--768x475.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Wahoo-KICKR-ROLLR-race-view-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Kickr Rollr comes with a free trial to Wahoo X, giving you immediate access to two unique indoor cycling apps, Wahoo Systm, and RGT, through one subscription.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The unit is the same price (around $800) and is available online <a href=\"https://www.wahoofitness.com\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wahoo-kickr-rollr-update-virtual-riding-with-no-power-meter/\">Wahoo Kickr Rollr Update Allows For Virtual Riding with No Power Meter</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jordan Villella","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"cde6b359a1a4ed762bd7c2dca5395c9a711807cd5a3b7745a21ce8c32bf13245","category":"Cycling"}
