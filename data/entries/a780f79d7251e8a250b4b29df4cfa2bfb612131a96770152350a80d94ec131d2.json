After years of delays, billions of dollars in federal funding, and a spectacular second-stage explosion, the large and impressive Vulcan rocket is finally ready to take flight.</p>\n<p>United Launch Alliance's heavy lift vehicle underwent its final review on Thursday, and the company cleared the rocket for its debut flight. With weather looking favorable, the Vulcan rocket is on track to lift off at 2:18 am ET (7:18 UTC) on Monday from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. The mission's primary payload is a lunar lander built by Astrobotic, and the launch will be <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZ6KTFMHenA\">streamed live here</a>.</p>\n<p>This marks an absolutely pivotal moment for the 20-year-old launch company, which has gone from the titan of the US launch industry to playing a distant second fiddle to its one-time upstart competitor SpaceX. Last year, SpaceX launched 98 rockets. United Launch Alliance, or ULA, tallied just three. The owners of ULA, Lockheed Martin and Boeing, are also on the cusp of selling the launch company if they can find a buyer willing to pay the right price. And critically, for the first time, ULA will be flying a new vehicle it designed and developed on its own—a rocket with some but not a majority of its heritage from the legacy Atlas and Delta rockets that have flown since the Cold War.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1993835#p3\">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1993835&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a780f79d7251e8a250b4b29df4cfa2bfb612131a96770152350a80d94ec131d2","category":"Tech"}
