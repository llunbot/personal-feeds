Good typography, great colors, and a new slogan and icon that exemplify Pennsylvania’s role as the birthplace of the longest-standing democracy the world has ever seen: the Liberty Bell.</p>\n\n<p>Bravo.</p>\n\n<p>(Next job: Apply this same design language to <a href=\"https://www.phillyvoice.com/pennsylvania-drivers-license-new-design-real-id-security/\">our god-awful driver’s licenses</a>.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Design credit for both <a href=\"https://posts.cv/robynkanner/eGLZaWHY7autqPaOwiUQ\">the new plates</a> and <a href=\"https://posts.cv/robynkanner/y1CcUwCt8wOdjkw8nFwL\">welcome signage</a> goes to Robyn Kanner.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/07/10/pa-license-plates-shapiro\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"feae6f3fda7d10f30a950446a6bf35a139fe4cf9e06f139261a2802b207cf031","category":"Tech"}
