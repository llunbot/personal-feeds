He had money problems\nand marital problems. His night life began after night games; he\ndrank with and without his teammates and was no stranger to drugs.\nHe claimed at one point to have turned Mantle and Whitey Ford on\nto marijuana, and in an interview in Rolling Stone magazine in\n2015, he recalled that when he was with the Cubs, fans in the\nbleachers would throw packets of joints and cocaine at him in the\noutfield, and he would hide them in the ivy that covered the\nstadium wall.</p>\n\n<p>“Used to be I was always the first person at the ballpark, and the\nfirst one to leave; next thing you know, people are wondering why\nI’m hanging out at the ballpark so long,” Pepitone told Rolling\nStone. When the manager, Leo Durocher, asked him what he was doing\nhanging around, he would say he was going to get a rubdown from\nthe trainer.</p>\n\n<p>“Then I’d be out in center field with my shorts on, looking\nthrough the ivy to find my dope,” he said. “I loved Chicago!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Love this quote from the Mick:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“I wish I could buy you for what you’re really worth,” Mantle once\nsaid to him, according to the website Baseball-Almanac.com, “then\nsell you for what you think you’re worth.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/24/joe-pepitone-rip\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"4b6bb5ed6818000418298ebc8ebdfe5d67bb7aae07e890d845438af6d7bf0eeb","category":"Tech"}
