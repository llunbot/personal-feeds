Click through for his <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/gadgets/zwift-play-first-ride-review/\">first ride review of Zwift Play</a>.</p>\n<h2>Taking control</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Zwift Play\" title=\"Zwift Play\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Zwift Play offers a new way to control the game while riding</span></figcaption><span> <i>Zwift</i></span></div>\n<p>Zwift Play is designed to streamline the way you interact with the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/zwift-your-complete-guide/\">Zwift app</a> while <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/beginners-guide-to-indoor-training-all-you-need-to-get-started/\">training indoors</a>.</p>\n<p>Before now, using Zwift practically required having the touchscreen of your smart device within reach while riding, or having a keyboard and mouse nearby to operate your laptop or computer.</p>\n<p>The Zwift Companion app, which is designed to be used on your smartphone while riding, can be used to navigate the action bar and to message nearby riders while riding. It can’t be used to navigate menus or for steering, though.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Zwift Play\" title=\"Zwift Play\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Zwift Play puts all the vital controls to navigate menus and control your avatar at your fingertips.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Zwift</i></span></div>\n<p>Like a controller for a video games console, Zwift Play is designed to perform almost all of the functions Zwift has to offer.</p>\n<p>This includes navigating in-app menus and virtual courses, using the action bar, skipping workout blocks and adjusting the interval difficulty in <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/erg-mode/\">ERG mode</a>, using Power Ups, giving Ride Ons, and more (depending on what kind of virtual ride you’re doing).</p>\n<p>It also has integrated, pressure-sensitive paddles for steering your avatar, incorporating the functionality of smart steering plates, such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/elite-sterzo-smart/\">Elite Sterzo</a>, into the controller.</p>\n<p>Zwift Play can also give haptic feedback for certain actions via vibrations from the main body of each controller, though this feature won’t be immediately available at launch.</p>\n<p>Lastly, and perhaps most interestingly, it also adds braking functionality.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Zwift Play\" title=\"Zwift Play\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The paddles behind the brake levers are pressure sensitive and enable you to steer and brake in Zwift.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Zwift</i></span></div>\n<p>Though Zwift doesn’t currently make use of braking beyond a new tech demo called Repack Rush (a time trial course involving video-game style time bonuses, speed boosts and hazards), it’s easy to see how these functions could be incorporated into virtual cycling and racing.</p>\n<p>For example, requiring riders to brake and steer to take the optimum lines through corners, or to position themselves within a virtual peloton or paceline for maximum draft effect, could add additional skill elements into the mix.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, it could simply help make virtual indoor cycling more immersive. Riders would need to be more actively engaged with the game, rather than solely focused on cranking out the power.</p>\n<h2>Universal drop-bar mounting</h2>\n<p>Zwift has designed each half of the Play controller to mount on each side of a drop handlebar. This places the action buttons just inside of the shifters, and the steering paddles and intensity modulation buttons behind the brake levers.</p>\n<p>The action buttons can be operated using your thumbs, while the steering paddles can be operated with your fingers.</p>\n<p>Zwift Play attaches to handlebars using thick rubber band mounts in a similar manner to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-lights-for-road-cycling/\">bike lights</a>.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Zwift Play\" title=\"Zwift Play\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Zwift says it has tested more than 400 bikes for compatibility.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Zwift</i></span></div>\n<p>The mounting straps are not removable or replaceable, but Zwift says it has done extensive durability testing to ensure these can withstand regular mounting and removal.</p>\n<p>While Zwift Play is designed for use only with drop handlebars (meaning it isn’t compatible with flat or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-handlebars/\">mountain bike handlebars</a>, or time trial and triathlon bars), Zwift claims it has tested more than 400 bikes for compatibility with a success rate of 97.6 per cent.</p>\n<p>Zwift includes spacers in the box to improve the fit on smaller-diameter bars.</p>\n<h2>Can Zwift Play be used with other indoor cycling apps?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Zwift Play\" title=\"Zwift Play\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Zwift isn’t the only indoor cycling app with in-game menus – could other apps take advantage of Zwift Play’s functionality?</span></figcaption><span> <i>Zwift</i></span></div>\n<p>Given Zwift Play connects to smart devices via a standard Bluetooth wireless protocol, it may be possible for manufacturers of other <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-indoor-cycling-apps/\">indoor cycling apps</a> to engineer compatibility with the controller into their apps in the future.</p>\n<p>When we put this to Zwift, it simply said “Zwift Play was designed exclusively for Zwift”, but stopped short of confirming that Zwift Play is a closed system.</p>\n<p>Given Zwift’s subscription-based business model, we don’t expect it to develop compatibility with other apps.</p>\n<h2>Zwift Play specification</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Zwift Play\" title=\"Zwift Play\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Zwift Play is available at a discounted price while the Zwift app undergoes a beta testing period.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Zwift</i></span></div>\n<p>Each Zwift Play controller contains an internal rechargeable battery, with a claimed life of around 20 hours of ride time.</p>\n<p>Recharging is done via USB-C, and a split cable is included in the box so both parts can be charged from a single plug or USB port. The controllers can also be charged while in use.</p>\n<p>Zwift Play communicates with smart devices via Bluetooth, and at launch there’s no support for a wired connection.</p>\n<p>The devices don’t have an official waterproof rating, but Zwift says it created its own internal protocol to ensure the controllers are well protected from sweat and spillages.</p>\n<p>Zwift Play is available now, exclusively from Zwift.</p>\n<p>As noted earlier, it has an RRP of £149/$149/€149, but is being launched at a promotional price of £99/$99/€99, to coincide with a beta period for the device and game.</p>\n<p>There’s currently no confirmed date for when this beta period will end, but Zwift said it was focused on “getting the experience right for our customers”.</p>","author":"Simon von Bromley","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"4d4b4e54c5eee416e57c1741f07fec402f559d4901dde26bc81b0889bfe8512b","category":"Cycling"}
