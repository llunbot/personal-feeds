This time the Amazon sale is dubbed Prime Big Deal Days and it will run from just after midnight Tuesday, October 8 to midnight Wednesday, October 9. In our experience you can get discounts on Macs all year round, but, some of the best Mac discounts fall during Amazon’s sales.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Amazon <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/prime-day\">Prime Day</a> sale is a great time way to save some money when buying a new Mac.
