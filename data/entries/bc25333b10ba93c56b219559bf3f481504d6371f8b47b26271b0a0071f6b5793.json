The latest product from Unitree hopes that you will: Meet the <a href=\"https://www.unitree.com/g1/\">Unitree G1,</a> a \"Humanoid agent AI avatar,\" aka a robot. If you haven't heard of Unitree, it's sort of the go-to \"budget Chinese option\" in the robot space. You're going to have to deal with company promotional materials that are <em>just barely</em> written in English, but you get some impressive bang-for-your-buck robots. You may have seen the Spot-knockoff Unitree Go2, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/this-lidar-equipped-30-pound-robot-dog-can-be-yours-for-1600/\">a $1,600 robot dog</a> that various resellers have equipped with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/you-can-now-buy-a-flame-throwing-robot-dog-for-under-10000/\">a flamethrower</a> or just straight-up <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/robot-dogs-armed-with-ai-targeting-rifles-undergo-us-marines-special-ops-evaluation/\">military rifles</a>.</p>\n<p>Unitree's promo video shows some impressive capabilities for such a cheap robot. It can stand up on its own from a flat-on-the-floor position. Just like the recent<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/boston-dynamics-debuts-humanoid-robot-destined-for-commercialization/\"> Boston Dynamics Atlas video</a>, the G1 stands up in probably the strangest way possible. While lying face-up on the floor, the G1 brings its knees up, puts its feet flat on the floor, and then pushes up on the feet to form a tripod with the head still on the ground. From there, it uses a limbo-like move to lean its knees forward, bringing up its head and torso with all core strength.</p>\n<p>The G1 is a budget robot, so the walk cycle is kind of primitive. It walks, stands, and \"runs\" in a permanent half-squat with its legs forward and knees bent all the time. The balance looks great thoughâ€”at one point a person shows up and roughs up the robot a bit, kicking it in the back and punching it in the chest. In both cases, it absorbs the abuse with just a step back or two and keeps on trucking.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025436#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025436&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bc25333b10ba93c56b219559bf3f481504d6371f8b47b26271b0a0071f6b5793","category":"Tech"}
