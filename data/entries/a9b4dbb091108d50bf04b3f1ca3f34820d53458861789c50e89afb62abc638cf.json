It's a simple dish: just tonnarelli pasta, pecorino cheese, and pepper. But its simplicity is deceptive. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cacio_e_pepe\">Cacio e pepe</a> (\"cheese and pepper\") is notoriously challenging to make because it's so easy for the sauce to form unappetizing clumps with a texture more akin to stringy mozzarella rather than being smooth and creamy.</p>\n<p>A team of Italian physicists has come to the rescue with a foolproof recipe based on their many scientific experiments, according to a new paper published in the journal Physics of Fluids. The trick: using corn starch for the cheese and pepper sauce instead of relying on however much starch leaches into the boiling water as the pasta is cooked.</p>\n<p>\"A true Italian grandmother or a skilled home chef from Rome would never need a scientific recipe for cacio e pepe, relying instead on instinct and years of experience,\" the authors wrote. \"For everyone else, this guide offers a practical way to master the dish. Preparing cacio e pepe successfully depends on getting the balance just right, particularly the ratio of starch to cheese. The concentration of starch plays a crucial role in keeping the sauce creamy and smooth, without clumps or separation.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/physics-of-the-perfect-cacio-e-pepe-sauce/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/physics-of-the-perfect-cacio-e-pepe-sauce/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a9b4dbb091108d50bf04b3f1ca3f34820d53458861789c50e89afb62abc638cf","category":"Tech"}
