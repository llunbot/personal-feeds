The Tern GSD has always been a compact and powerful cargo bike geared for family use. It can carry two passengers while remaining easy to ride, store, and share with other family members.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tern-Bicycles-New-3rd-Gen-GSD-first-pic-e1742858993702.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"713\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tern-Bicycles-New-3rd-Gen-GSD-first-pic-e1742858993702.webp\" alt=\"Tern Bicycles New 3rd Gen GSD first pic\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tern-Bicycles-New-3rd-Gen-GSD-first-pic-e1742858993702.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tern-Bicycles-New-3rd-Gen-GSD-first-pic-e1742858993702-297x165.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tern-Bicycles-New-3rd-Gen-GSD-first-pic-e1742858993702-120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tern-Bicycles-New-3rd-Gen-GSD-first-pic-e1742858993702-768x428.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos / Tern)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tern GSD pioneered the compact cargo bike space, and the latest version is better than ever. You’ll find best-in-class cargo capacity, patented folding side decks, and the Bosch Smart System has features like ABS braking, GPS tracking, and an eBike alarm.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s New?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>Everything.</em>” Says Tern Team Captain, Joshua Hon. He continues, “<em>Pretty much every aspect of the bike has been redesigned to work better. From big improvements like handling when heavily loaded to small details like how much effort it takes to get the bike up on the kickstand or how seatpost levers are easier for small hands to operate, the new GSD is just better</em>“.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tern-Bicycles-New-3rd-Gen-GSD-two-adults.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tern-Bicycles-New-3rd-Gen-GSD-two-adults.webp\" alt=\"Tern Bicycles New 3rd Gen GSD two adults\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tern-Bicycles-New-3rd-Gen-GSD-two-adults.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tern-Bicycles-New-3rd-Gen-GSD-two-adults-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tern-Bicycles-New-3rd-Gen-GSD-two-adults-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tern-Bicycles-New-3rd-Gen-GSD-two-adults-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new and improved GSD has an improved and beefy frame that allows for a larger cargo capacity of 463 lbs (max gross vehicle weight). So, it won’t be a problem hauling two kids, an adult, or heavy cargo.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Better Ride…</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Building on everything that made the prior generation of the GSD great, the new GSD is stronger, more stable, and easier to ride. The reinforced frame uses new larger diameter, hydroformed tubing that increases stiffness. It has a longer wheelbase and a lower center of gravity, meaning a more stable ride feel, and confidence while hauling heavy loads. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>It’s Smarter</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Tern uses the reliable, and smooth-running Bosch Cargo line of motors for all of the GSD models. They came in two flavors: eBike System 2, and the Smart System. Both of these deliver the same intuitive and powerful ride, except the Smart System models add advanced security, safety, and connectivity.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tern-Bicycles-New-3rd-Gen-GSD-USB-Port.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tern-Bicycles-New-3rd-Gen-GSD-USB-Port.webp\" alt=\"Tern Bicycles New 3rd Gen GSD USB Port\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tern-Bicycles-New-3rd-Gen-GSD-USB-Port.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tern-Bicycles-New-3rd-Gen-GSD-USB-Port-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tern-Bicycles-New-3rd-Gen-GSD-USB-Port-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tern-Bicycles-New-3rd-Gen-GSD-USB-Port-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tern-Bicycles-New-3rd-Gen-GSD-USB-Port-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tern-Bicycles-New-3rd-Gen-GSD-USB-Port-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the Smart System features include GPS tracking, eBike lock, and eBike alarm, adding extra levels of protection when locking your GSD. There are over-the-air updates, that seamlessly deliver the latest features and performance improvements. Not to mention that ABS braking comes standard on all Smart System models.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tern-Bicycles-New-3rd-Gen-GSD-bosch-abs.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tern-Bicycles-New-3rd-Gen-GSD-bosch-abs.webp\" alt=\"Tern Bicycles New 3rd Gen GSD bosch abs\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tern-Bicycles-New-3rd-Gen-GSD-bosch-abs.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tern-Bicycles-New-3rd-Gen-GSD-bosch-abs-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tern-Bicycles-New-3rd-Gen-GSD-bosch-abs-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tern-Bicycles-New-3rd-Gen-GSD-bosch-abs-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tern-Bicycles-New-3rd-Gen-GSD-bosch-abs-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tern-Bicycles-New-3rd-Gen-GSD-bosch-abs-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s explore the ABS System a bit. The intention of an Anti-Lock Brakes System (ABS), isn’t only about power, but control as well. In wet conditions, stop-and-go traffic, and other unpredictable urban situations, Tern says the Bosch ABS prevents front-wheel lock-ups and loss of traction – something that becomes even more important when carrying precious cargo.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tern Expands Accessory Ecosystem</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tern-Bicycles-New-3rd-Gen-GSD-stow-deck.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tern-Bicycles-New-3rd-Gen-GSD-stow-deck.webp\" alt=\"Tern Bicycles New 3rd Gen GSD stow deck\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tern-Bicycles-New-3rd-Gen-GSD-stow-deck.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tern-Bicycles-New-3rd-Gen-GSD-stow-deck-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tern-Bicycles-New-3rd-Gen-GSD-stow-deck-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tern-Bicycles-New-3rd-Gen-GSD-stow-deck-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tern-Bicycles-New-3rd-Gen-GSD-stow-deck-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tern-Bicycles-New-3rd-Gen-GSD-stow-deck-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tern-Bicycles-New-3rd-Gen-GSD-sunshield.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tern-Bicycles-New-3rd-Gen-GSD-sunshield.webp\" alt=\"Tern Bicycles New 3rd Gen GSD sunshield\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tern-Bicycles-New-3rd-Gen-GSD-sunshield.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tern-Bicycles-New-3rd-Gen-GSD-sunshield-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tern-Bicycles-New-3rd-Gen-GSD-sunshield-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tern-Bicycles-New-3rd-Gen-GSD-sunshield-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tern-Bicycles-New-3rd-Gen-GSD-sunshield-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Tern-Bicycles-New-3rd-Gen-GSD-sunshield-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tern GSD has a large ecosystem of accessories to customize and fit the user’s cargo, and passenger needs.

With vertical rolling, it’s easy to roll the GSD into a tight spot on its rear wheel. Combine that with the GSD’s ability to be parked vertically, and you have a capable cargo bike parked in a spot that takes up a very small footprint. It can even be FlatFolded into a compact package that fits behind the couch.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Seven-Year Support Plan</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“The GSD is built to last, and so is Tern’s commitment to keeping it on the road. Through the 7-Year Support program, essential replacement parts, including key drivetrain, braking, and electronic components, will remain available for years to come. As cargo bikes become an everyday transportation solution, riders can count on Tern’s long-term support to protect their investment and keep them rolling.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>GSD Models and Retail</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail: Starts at $4,999</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Models:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>R14 – Rohloff Speedhub and Gates belt drive, Bosch Smart System with Connect Module, Bosch ABS Braking</li>\n\n\n\n<li>S10 – Shimano Deore 1×10, Bosch Smart System with Connect Module, Bosch ABS Braking</li>\n\n\n\n<li>P00 – Enviolo IGH with Gates belt drive, Bosch eBike System 2</li>\n\n\n\n<li>P10 – Shimano Deore 1×10, Bosch eBike System 2</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Bikes will start to appear in shops this May.
