But the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-hybrid-bikes/\">best hybrid bikes</a> might not, and a cycling backpack is less hassle. A small bag can carry your essentials, while a larger one can fit in your laptop and a change of clothes.</p>\n<p>If you’ve invested in one of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-electric-bikes/\">best electric bikes</a> for the commute, you might need a sizeable backpack to carry your battery and charger. It isn’t wise to leave <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bike-helmets/\">the best road cycling helmets</a> locked to your bike, so consider if you can fit your lid in too.</p>\n<p>Our expert testers have picked the best cycling backpacks on the market and put them through their paces.</p>\n<p>We looked for backpacks with effective and dependable waterproofing or water resistance. This is perhaps the most important feature because if you’re <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/cycling-to-work-guide/\">cycling to work</a>, even only on nice days, you’ll eventually get caught out by a freak rain storm.</p>\n<p>On top of that, we looked for durable and easy-to-use closure systems, such as a roll-top or waterproof zips, and enough capacity to carry everything you’re likely to need on a day-to-day basis.</p>\n<p>Because this guide is geared mainly towards cycling backpacks for commuting and urban use, we’ve focused on hi-viz or reflective options. If those colours aren’t to your taste, many of them are also available in more muted tones.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve worked your way through all of the reviews, keep reading for our buyer’s guide to cycling backpacks.</p>\n<h2>Best cycling backpacks in 2023</h2>\n<h3>Camelbak Mule Commute 22L</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Camelbak Mule Commute 22L backpack\" title=\"Best of backpacks - Camelbak\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Mule can hold a hydration bladder inside and your helmet clips on top.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£120 as tested</li>\n<li>22 litres</li>\n<li>Available in black</li>\n<li>Weight: 717g</li>\n<li>Ideal for the daily commute</li>\n</ul><p>Camelbak’s Mule Commute 22 is a lightweight, low-volume cycling backpack and a shrewd choice for the sprightly commuter.</p>\n<p>The padded and weatherproof laptop section has a wraparound closure for added protection.

If you’re just looking to pop out for sunny pootles around your local park, then you’ll probably be fine with any old backpack.</p>\n<p>Just watch out for unexpected showers and think about lining your bag with a bin liner if you’ve got anything in there you don’t want to get wet.</p>\n<p>Those who cycle regularly or on mucky roads, though, will almost certainly appreciate the extra features cycling-specific backpacks offer. These usually include waterproofing, vented rear padding, increased visibility and mounts for locks and lights.</p>\n<h3>Backpack vs panniers</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Rad Power RadWagon\" title=\"Rad Power RadWagon\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> An e-cargo bike, such as this RadWagon by Rad Power Bikes, might just be the ultimate in load-carrying bikes, but is possibly overkill if you just want to carry your laptop to work.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>When deciding between the best bike bags for commuting, you typically have two choices: a backpack or a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-pannier-bags/\">pannier bag</a>.</p>\n<p>Most people riding short distances and carrying reasonably light loads are likely to be better off with a backpack rather than panniers.</p>\n<p>The simplicity and take-anywhere nature of a backpack is hard to beat. A cycling backpack can also usually be pressed into double duty as a backpack for hiking or city use.</p>\n<p>Panniers are great for touring, or for cyclists who want to carry larger or heavier loads, such as shopping, but you’ll need to install a rack on your bike (assuming it has the requisite mounts), and they’re usually more cumbersome to carry when off the bike.</p>\n<p>If you’re looking to transport really big loads, such as children or work equipment, you might even want to consider a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/load-carrying-bikes/\">cargo</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-electric-bikes/\">electric bike</a>.</p>\n<h3>Zips vs roll-top</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Black rucksack modelled by young man in faded orange t-shirt\" title=\"Chrome Mazer Ensign Rolltop backpack\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Roll-top designs are good for waterproofing.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Matthew Allen / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Roll-top bags are usually what you see professional cycle couriers using, and for good reason. Zips are compact and flexible for shaping, but can be a weak point for waterproofing, and are also much more likely to wear out and break with heavy use.</p>\n<p>A roll-top bag, on the other hand, can be opened/closed hundreds, if not thousands, of times without any major wear and tear. For this reason, many bags will use a combination of zipped pockets and roll-top main compartments. This helps maximise both durability and the convenience of having separate pockets for specific items.</p>\n<h3>How much capacity do you need?</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"CamelBak M.U.L.E. 15l mountain bike backpack\" title=\"20200205_SB_5DSR_MG_0222\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> It’s good to have more rather than less room.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley</i></span></div>\n<p>The majority of commuters carrying items such as a laptop, some spare clothes and valuables will generally need around 20 to 30 litres of space. Aspiring pro bike messengers might need up to 40 litres, but that’s probably overkill for most people.</p>\n<p>Those who commute during the winter will need a little more room for carrying bulkier jackets and the like.</p>\n<p>Likewise, if you commute in <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cycling-shorts/\">bib shorts</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cycling-jerseys/\">jersey</a> with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/how-to-use-clipless-pedals/\">clipless pedals</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-cycling-shoes/\" target=\"_blank\">cycling shoes</a>, you’ll probably want to change into something else at the end of the journey. Don’t forget to factor in extra space for a change of clothes and shoes.</p>\n<p>All things considered, it’s probably best to have a little more room than you think you’ll need – it’s always going to be useful to have enough space to be able to pop to the shops on the way home.</p>","author":"Simon von Bromley","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"292681bb948599d1114b05d74afd81aa86a75ae2dd61239748a519483090b5f1","category":"Cycling"}
