{"title":"M4 MacBook Air Reviews Are Now Out, Plus Sky Blue Unboxing Videos","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/review/m4-macbook-air/","date":1741698827000,"content":"The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/apple-announces-new-macbook-air-with-m4-and-sky-blue-color-option/\">new MacBook Air with the M4 chip</a> launches this Wednesday. Ahead of time, the first reviews of the laptop have been shared by selected publications and YouTube channels, offering a closer look at new features and changes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Apple-MacBook-Air-hero.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" />\r<br />\nWhile it is a minor spec-bump year for the MacBook Air, the new model does offer a few upgrades beyond the M4 chip. There is an improved 12-megapixel camera with support for <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/111102\">Center Stage</a>, support for two external displays even when the MacBook Air's lid is open, and a new Sky Blue color option. And in the U.S., the latest-generation 13-inch MacBook Air now starts at $999, down from $1,099 previously.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSince the M4 chip existed prior to the new MacBook Air, we already know that it offers up to 30% faster multi-core CPU performance compared to the M3 chip in the previous model. Geekbench 6 results for the new MacBook Air already confirmed this 30% performance increase, before Apple's review embargo lifted.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Highlights</h2>\r<br />\n<h3>Center Stage Camera</h3>\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/apple-macbook-air-m4-13-inch-and-15-inch-review-minimal-upgrades-at-a-much-better-price-130002570.html\"><em>Engadget</em>'s Devindra Hardawar said</a> the Center Stage camera offers a small but noticeable quality-of-life improvement during video calls:<blockquote>The leap to a 12-megapixel Center Stage camera isn't exactly Earth-shattering, but I appreciated having a slightly better picture during video calls. I typically turn off the actual Center Stage feature on Macs, but I'm sure some will appreciate its ability to track you around a room. The new camera also supports Desk View, which projects a slightly skewed view of the area directly in front of the MacBook Air.</blockquote><h3>$999 Value</h3>\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/03/m4-macbook-air-review-am-i-blue/\">Jason Snell of <em>Six Colors</em> said</a> it is \"generous\" for Apple to offer 16GB of RAM in the MacBook Air at the base $999 price point:<blockquote>That's why perhaps the most important change in the M4 MacBook Air is its base configuration, which starts at $999. When Apple introduced a winning new flat-with-rounded-corners Air design in 2022, it had to keep selling older models in order to get down under a thousand dollars. Three years later, Apple is finally able to sell a brand-new Air—with a generous 16GB of unified memory—at that important price.</blockquote><h3>Sky Blue</h3>\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/03/apple-m4-macbook-air-review-i-have-no-notes/\"><em>Ars Technica</em>'s Andrew Cunningham</a> likes Sky Blue, but he wishes the color was more saturated:<blockquote>The laptop comes in four finishes—the traditional silver, the gold-ish Starlight, Midnight (still a bit smudge-prone), and a new Sky Blue option that replaces Space Gray. I like Sky Blue, and it's probably my favorite of the three light-colored options, though I do wish it was more saturated. It's similar in hue to the blue finish Microsoft offers for its Surface devices, but I prefer Microsoft's version because it's more noticeably blue.</blockquote><h2>Reviews and Unboxings</h2>\r<br />\n<h3>More Articles</h3>\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/reviews/627186/apple-macbook-air-m4-13-15-inch-2025-laptop-review\">The Verge</a></li>\r<br />\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/m4-macbook-air-review-13-inch-2025-still-my-go-to-recommendation-for-most-people/\">CNET</a></li>\r<br />\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/review/macbook-air-13-inch-2025/\">WIRED</a></li></ul><h3>Videos</h3>\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\n<div></div><div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air\">15\" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">13\" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/review/m4-macbook-air/\">M4 MacBook Air Reviews Are Now Out, Plus Sky Blue Unboxing Videos</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m4-macbook-air-reviews-are-now-out-plus-sky-blue-unboxing-videos.2452795/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"cfa03c6f4ce2ee70bd095a84d87d2e1ab019421b105667bce4d6250939bf65c4","category":"Apple"}
