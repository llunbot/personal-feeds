Fortunately, that means that there are plenty of riding shoes for different disciplines and styles, whether you prefer going fast or riding in comfort. When Italian cycling shoe giant, <a href=\"https://www.northwave.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Northwave</a> asked someone here at Bikerumor to try out their <a href=\"https://www.northwave.com/en/bike/shoes/mtb/trailall-mountain/corsair-2#/56-taglia-36/161-color-blue\" target=\"_blank\">Corsair 2</a> All-Mountain Trail shoe, I was pretty keen to try something comfortable with a dial fastener, so I volunteered. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve been <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/shimano-enduro-dh-shoe-sh-ge700/\" target=\"_blank\">reviewing (and liking) the new Shimano GE-700</a>, which is a full lace-up shoe. But, I thought trying something different would be interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-Ride-your-way-e1720805177853.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"514\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-Ride-your-way-e1720805177853.jpeg\" alt=\"Northwave Corsair 2 First Look Ride your way\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-Ride-your-way-e1720805177853.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-Ride-your-way-e1720805177853-297x119.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-Ride-your-way-e1720805177853-120x48.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-Ride-your-way-e1720805177853-768x308.jpeg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Ride your way!

At $140, it seems to be a nice shoe for the budget-minded rider. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-on-the-rocks.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-on-the-rocks.jpeg\" alt=\"Northwave Corsair 2 First Look on the rocks\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-on-the-rocks.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-on-the-rocks-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-on-the-rocks-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-on-the-rocks-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-on-the-rocks-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-on-the-rocks-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The upper is made of a breathable Ripstop mesh with TPU inserts on the toe and the heel, for added protection. It uses an X-Dial SLW3 dial, which Northwave says is the “only dial with a step-by-step and full release in a single button”. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-fastening-system.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-fastening-system.jpeg\" alt=\"Northwave Corsair 2 First Look fastening system\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-fastening-system.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-fastening-system-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-fastening-system-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-fastening-system-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-fastening-system-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-fastening-system-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The older Corsair had a dial too but in combination with a Velcro over-strap as well. For the Corsair 2, the Velcro strap is gone, which makes for a sleek and clean look.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-clip-area.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-clip-area.jpeg\" alt=\"Northwave Corsair 2 First Look clip area\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-clip-area.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-clip-area-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-clip-area-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-clip-area-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-clip-area-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-clip-area-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Corsair 2 has an EVA midsole that reduces weight and is supposed to improve shock absorption. The Damp-Evo clipless sole looks like it would have plenty of on and off-the-bike grip. The clip area is nice and large and cleat pocket is 35mm long.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-Low-key-branading.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-Low-key-branading.jpeg\" alt=\"Northwave Corsair 2 First Look Low key branading\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-Low-key-branading.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-Low-key-branading-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-Low-key-branading-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-Low-key-branading-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-Low-key-branading-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-Low-key-branading-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Corsair 2 also seems to have plenty of flex in the sole, which makes sense since it is marketed to be comfy while walking. The EVA insole is really comfy. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-heel-cups.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-heel-cups.jpeg\" alt=\"Northwave Corsair 2 First Look heel cups\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-heel-cups.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-heel-cups-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-heel-cups-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-heel-cups-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-heel-cups-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-heel-cups-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Outta the Box</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-the-box.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-the-box.jpeg\" alt=\"Northwave Corsair 2 First Look the box\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-the-box.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-the-box-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-the-box-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-the-box-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-the-box-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-the-box-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The shoe is handsome. The branding is low-key, which is always my preference. The shoe doesn’t look too flashy, or racey. I would’ve picked a different color, but the blue is fine. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The shoe comes in blue (tested), black, and olive green… I’m a sucker for anything olive. So, I would’ve picked green.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-Corsair-2-weight.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-Corsair-2-weight.jpeg\" alt=\"Northwave Corsair 2 First Look Corsair 2 weight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-Corsair-2-weight.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-Corsair-2-weight-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-Corsair-2-weight-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-Corsair-2-weight-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-Corsair-2-weight-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-Corsair-2-weight-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Northwave Corsair 2 at 471g</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-Shimano-GE700-weight.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-Shimano-GE700-weight.jpeg\" alt=\"Northwave Corsair 2 First Look Shimano GE700 weight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-Shimano-GE700-weight.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-Shimano-GE700-weight-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-Shimano-GE700-weight-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-Shimano-GE700-weight-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-Shimano-GE700-weight-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-Shimano-GE700-weight-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Shimano GE-700 at 479g</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The shoe felt light in my hand. It seemed lighter than the Shimano shoes I’ve been reviewing. So, I weighed them (without the cleat). It turns out the Shimano shoe isn’t as heavy as I thought. I do find the Corsair 2 to be a bit sleeker and a little less bulky than the Shimano GE-700.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-new.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-new.jpeg\" alt=\"Northwave Corsair 2 First Look new\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-new.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-new-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-new-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-new-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-new-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-new-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The overall initial appearance of the Corsair 2 is very nice. Like I said, it’s a handsome shoe. But, it also looks like it is manufactured well, and for the price seems to be of good quality. It looks like it would last a few seasons. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Wearing The Corsair 2 </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-ready-to-rock.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-ready-to-rock.jpeg\" alt=\"Northwave Corsair 2 First Look ready to rock\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-ready-to-rock.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-ready-to-rock-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-ready-to-rock-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-ready-to-rock-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-ready-to-rock-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-ready-to-rock-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially, when I started to slip the shoes on, I immediately noticed how narrow the toe box felt. I mean, I wasn’t surprised, Northwave doesn’t market the show that way, so there were zero expectations. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-inside-is-comfy.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-inside-is-comfy.jpeg\" alt=\"Northwave Corsair 2 First Look inside is comfy\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-inside-is-comfy.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-inside-is-comfy-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-inside-is-comfy-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-inside-is-comfy-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-inside-is-comfy-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-inside-is-comfy-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But, once the shoe was on, it didn’t feel narrow or too snug in the toe box. It did, however, feel more snug than the Shimano GE-700. The heel cup seems great and the padding there and on the tongue is comfy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I went to use the dial to snug it up, I noticed that I had to turn the dial a lot. The Corsair 2’s last seems to be very large which requires a lot of turns of the dial to get the shoe tightened up. Speaking of the dial… the SLW3 dial does have some nice features. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-dial.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-dial.jpeg\" alt=\"Northwave Corsair 2 First Look dial\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-dial.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-dial-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-dial-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-dial-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-dial-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-dial-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I do like how the dial “micrometerically” tightens the shoe, it’s quick and efficient. Another dial feature I like is how pulling the button up, releases all tension immediately. It’s pretty neat and clean. Do I like these features better than laces? The verdict is still out on that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, on the topic of the dial, I will say that even though the dial has nice features, it sticks out a bit from the shoe doesn’t feel especially robust.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>In Conclusion, But Not the End</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Corsair 2 has a nice blend of stiffness and walkability. I have a steep, loose lil’ section of trail that I sometimes walk, and the shoe performed very well punching the bike up the hill. It had good traction and didn’t feel awkwardly stiff. The Shimano GE-700 isn’t quite as comfy on the same section of trail.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-on-a-ride-e1720805020669.jpeg\"><img width=\"851\" height=\"934\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-on-a-ride-e1720805020669.jpeg\" alt=\"Northwave Corsair 2 First Look on a ride\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-on-a-ride-e1720805020669.jpeg 851w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-on-a-ride-e1720805020669-273x300.jpeg 273w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-on-a-ride-e1720805020669-109x120.jpeg 109w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Northwave-Corsair-2-First-Look-on-a-ride-e1720805020669-768x843.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, I like shoes. I’m not fully sold on the use of a dial to tighten the shoe down. But, it’s very early in the review period, and that opinion could change. There is nothing glaringly dislikeable about the Corsair 2. It feels great while riding, feels very natural off the bike, and with the large cleat area, is a breeze to clip in and out of my pedals. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I obviously can’t comment on durability yet but know that I will be giving them a good flogging over the next few months, so tune in again here for those results. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.northwave.com/en/\" target=\"_blank\">NorthWave.com</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/northwave-corsair-2-all-mountain-mtb-shoes/\">First Ride: Northwave Corsair 2 All-Mountain MTB Shoes Ride Ready with Walking Comfort</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"ef2b32651f09ca80128f1559180546a120096b4f19a1b59448670ba96ca55aeb","category":"Cycling"}
