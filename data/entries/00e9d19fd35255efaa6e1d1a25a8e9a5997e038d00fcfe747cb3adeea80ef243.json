Now, RedSide is back with another 3D-printed tool. This time it’s designed to make those fork overhauls easier, with less potential damage…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Normally, when you’re overhauling your fork or doing a quick service, you remove the dust wiper seals. That’s often done with a tire lever, an open-ended wrench, or any other lever to pry the seal up from the fork lower. When done carefully, this method has worked for years, but it can result in damage to the seal itself and potentially the fork lower. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Redside-fork-seal-removal-tool1.jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1469\" height=\"1102\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Redside-fork-seal-removal-tool1.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Redside fork seal removal tool3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Redside-fork-seal-removal-tool1.jpg.webp 1469w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Redside-fork-seal-removal-tool1.jpg-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Redside-fork-seal-removal-tool1.jpg-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Redside-fork-seal-removal-tool1.jpg-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>RedSide wanted to create a better way, so they created their new Fork Seal Remover. Like the Hydraulic Bleed Syringe Holder, the Fork Seal Remover utilizes 3D-printed parts with a metal threaded rod. The ‘wings’ which support the underside of the fork seal flip up to allow it to be inserted into the seal, and then flip down with a threaded locknut securing them under the edges of the seal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, you simply thread the upper cup down onto the fork lower, and unscrew the handle to pull the seal out of the lower. The process eliminates any chance of damage to the fork with a controlled removal and plastic surfaces. Technically, RedSide says it won’t damage the seal either, although most fork manufacturers recommend to replace your seals any time they’re removed. However, if you ever find yourself without the right seals when your fork <em>needs</em> a service before that next ride, this could work in a pinch. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Redside-fork-seal-removal-tool2.jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1102\" height=\"1102\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Redside-fork-seal-removal-tool2.jpg.webp\" alt=\"Redside fork seal removal tool3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Redside-fork-seal-removal-tool2.jpg.webp 1102w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Redside-fork-seal-removal-tool2.jpg-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Redside-fork-seal-removal-tool2.jpg-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Redside-fork-seal-removal-tool2.jpg-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, the tool is designed around a single stanchion diameter with different models available for 32, 34, 35, 36, 38, and 40mm stanchions at $54.99 each. You can also pick up all six sizes for $314.99. RedSide mentions that they are working on a modular design so that one Fork Seal Remover base can be used with multiple sizes, which is coming soon. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.redsidemtb.com/product-page/fork-seal-remover\" target=\"_blank\">redsidemtb.com</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/redside-fork-seal-remover-tool/\">Found: RedSide Fork Seal Remover Won’t Damage Your Fork or Seals</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"00e9d19fd35255efaa6e1d1a25a8e9a5997e038d00fcfe747cb3adeea80ef243","category":"Cycling"}
