Using it, he was able to lift one of the air vents in the\nfloor, which allowed him to pry open the floor panels. He then\ncrawled under the server floor himself, used the knife to jimmy\nopen an electrical cabinet, pulled the server plugs, and waited\nto see what happened. Nothing exploded. The server was ready to\nbe moved.</p>\n\n<p>“Well that doesn’t seem super hard,” he said as Alex the Uzbek and\nthe rest of the gang stared. Musk was totally jazzed by this\npoint. It was, he said with a loud laugh, like a remake of\n<em>Mission: Impossible</em>, Sacramento edition.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s all a bunch of yucks until it turns to yikes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The servers had user data on them, and James did not initially\nrealize that, for privacy reasons, they were supposed to be wiped\nclean before being moved. “By the time we learned this, the\nservers had already been unplugged and rolled out, so there was no\nway we would roll them back, plug them in, and then wipe them,” he\nsays. Plus, the wiping software wasn’t working. “Fuck, what do we\ndo?” he asked. Elon recommended that they lock the trucks and\ntrack them.</p>\n\n<p>So James sent someone to Home Depot to buy big padlocks, and they\nsent the combination codes on a spreadsheet to Portland so the\ntrucks could be opened there. “I can’t believe it worked,” James\nsays. “They all made it to Portland safely.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A profound sense of urgency is beneficial to a leader, up to a point. Despite CNBC’s framing, Musk clearly goes way past that point. This entire endeavor was absurdly and unnecessarily reckless. In addition to the privacy violations, yanking these servers out of Sacramento, against the direct advice of Twitter’s infrastructure team, directly led to months of instability for users.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/11/musk-isaacson-servers\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"911d79979590e8d0586983813e4ec34f998dc0b36148c0359dec35140894478f","category":"Tech"}
