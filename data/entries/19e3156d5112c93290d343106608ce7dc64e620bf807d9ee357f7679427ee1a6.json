But if we can believe the latest rumors, that could be changing this year, as Apple prepared to launch a drastic overhaul to its cheapest notebook. Here’s everything we’ve heard about the new MacBook Air:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2022 MacBook Air: The latest rumors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>October 19: The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/346129/2021-macbook-pro-14-inch-16-inch-mini-led-m1x-touch-bar-price-release.html\">MacBook Pro</a> sheds some light on what Apple is likely planning for the MacBook Air, most notably MagSafe and an M2 chip.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>October 18:</strong> Now that the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/346129/2021-macbook-pro-14-inch-16-inch-mini-led-m1x-touch-bar-price-release.html\">MacBook Pro has arrived</a> with a notch for the display, the MacBook Air is expected to adopt a similar design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>September 27:</strong> Ming-Chi Kuo (<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/26/analyst-ming-chi-kuo-expects-new-macbook-air-with-next-generation-apple-silicon-to-arrive-in-q3-2022/&amp;xcust=1-1-346119-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">via 9to5Mac</a>) reports that the redesigned MacBook Air might not arrive until <strong>the third quarter of 2022.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>July 22:</strong> <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/22/mini-led-macbook-air-mid-2022/&amp;xcust=1-1-346119-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Ming-Chi Kuo reports (via Macrumors)</a> that the redesigned MacBook Air will <strong>arrive in mid-2022</strong> with <strong>a mini-LED display</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>July 5:</strong> <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/dylandkt/status/1412089676220055555&amp;xcust=1-1-346119-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Twitter user Dyan (@dylandkt) reports</a> that <strong>the MacBook Air will get the M2 chip</strong> rather than the heavily rumored M1X chip, which he says is “reserved for the Pro Mac devices.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>May 18: </strong><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-18/apple-readies-macbook-pro-macbook-air-revamps-with-faster-chips&amp;xcust=1-1-346119-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Mark Gurman of Bloomberg</a> reports the “redesigned, higher-end MacBook Air” will have <strong>a new System on a Chip (SoC) that replaces the M1</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2022 MacBook Air: Name and price</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re assuming for the sake of this article that Apple will stick with the MacBook Air name for the next revision, but Prosser noted that his sources haven’t confirmed that. So it’s possible that Apple reintroduces the MacBook, which was <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/233004/apple-kills-macbook-non-touch-bar-macbook-pro-notebook-shakeup.html\">discontinued</a> in 2019 and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/350115/apple-designates-the-2015-macbook-as-vintage-as-rumors-swirl-about-its-return.html\">recently vintaged by Apple</a>. Apple sold the Air alongside the MacBook Air for a short time, so it’s also possible that the current Air either gets a price cut to make room for the new model at the $999 tier or sticks around at the same price as a cheaper option for a higher-priced MacBook.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2022 MacBook Air: Design, and colors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s been reported for months that <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-22/apple-aapl-plans-new-macbook-air-with-magsafe-macbook-pro-with-sd-card-slot&amp;xcust=1-1-346119-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple is working on a lighter and thinner redesign</a> for the MacBook Air. More recently, serial leaker Jon Prosser reported on his Front Page Tech YouTube channel that the new MacBook Air will be switch to a flat design rather than the classic tapered look, but retain its incredible thinness. It could also have full-size function keys like the MacBook Pro, which would make the trackpad slightly smaller.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/prosser-macbook-colors.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" /></figure><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/RendersbyIan&amp;xcust=1-1-346119-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">@rendersbyian</a></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple will be making several colors for the MacBook Air, according to Prosser, likely in hues to match the new iMac, so green, blue, yellow, orange, pink, purple, and silver. Prosser also reports the bezels will be thinner and switch from black to white while the bottom will gain two rubber strips instead of the standard circular feet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We conducted a Twitter poll about the white bezels and the majority of Macworld followers weren’t jazzed about it:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>(see above)</p>— Macworld (@macworld) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/macworld/status/1392184220496375809?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-346119-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">May 11, 2021</a></blockquote></div></figure><h2>2022 MacBook Air: Display</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Mark Gurman at Bloomberg, Apple <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-22/apple-aapl-plans-new-macbook-air-with-magsafe-macbook-pro-with-sd-card-slot&amp;xcust=1-1-346119-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">considered a larger 15-inch screen</a> for the MacBook Air, but the company decided to shelve that model for the time being. However, even if the new Air sticks with the same size screen, it still could be getting an upgrade. We’ve heard rumblings months ago that the same Mini LED in the 12.9-inch iPad Pro <a href=\"https://www.macworld.co.uk/news/mini-led-macbook-air-2022-kuo-3802865/\">could be coming</a> to the MacBook Air. As seen in the new MacBook Pro, mini LED is a backlighting technology for displays, but as its name suggests, uses a higher concentration of smaller LEDs. This results in better control of the backlight, better image contrast, and greater dynamic range. It could also lead to a lighter and thinner design with slimmer bezels, all of which were introduced in Apple’s newest pro laptop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the new MacBook Pro was a announced with a screen notch, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/17/macbook-air-2022-notch-design/&amp;xcust=1-1-346119-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Macrumors </a><span><u>uncovered</u></span> a rumor from the spring that suggested the MacBook Air will have a similar design for the front camera. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2022 MacBook Air: MagSafe and ports</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The new MacBook Air, which could be released later this year or in early 2022, could mark the return of the MagSafe connector, according to Bloomberg’s <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-22/apple-aapl-plans-new-macbook-air-with-magsafe-macbook-pro-with-sd-card-slot&amp;xcust=1-1-346119-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Mark Gurman</a>. Now that the MacBook Pro has re-introduced the charging port, it seems likely to end up in the Air in a similar fashion. Apple allows charging through both MagSafe and Thunderbolt ports, and supports fast charging with a 96W power adapter on the 14-inch model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234834/best-magsafe-cases-chargers-accessories-iphone-12-12-pro-12-pro-max-12-mini.html\">reintroduced</a> the MagSafe branding as a magnetic charging system for the iPhone 12 and the new iMac has a magnetic power cord that doesn’t have the MagSafe branding. Presumably, any MagSafe-related technology for Apple’s laptops would be in a similar vein as its implementation starting in 2006 but will likely still use USB-C for charging.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/magsafe-macbook.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1024\" /><figcaption><p>MagSafe could be making a comeback in the next MacBook Air.</p></figcaption></figure><p>IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>As for connectivity ports, Apple has transitioned to Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports in its <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/345721/m1-mac-macbook-imac-mac-mini-cpu-gpu-memory-storage-benchmarks-storage-ports-price.html\">M1 Macs</a>, and it’s a good bet that Apple will continue with this in the new MacBook Air. The question then becomes how many ports—traditionally, the MacBook Air has two ports on one side. In his <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/346093/the-next-macbook-could-have-white-bezels-to-match-the-imac.html\">report</a> about the color offerings for a new MacBook Air or MacBook, Jon Prosser said that the new laptop will have two ports but with a better placement—one on each side rather than both on the left edge.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2022 MacBook Air: Processor and memory</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=&amp;xcust=1-1-346119-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Mark Gurman of Bloomberg</a> reported that at the end of 2021, we could see a new MacBook Air with a new System on a Chip (SoC) that replaces the M1. The new SoC will be faster but still reportedly have eight CPU cores (four performance cores, four efficiency cores) like the M1. The graphics cores could increase from seven or eight to nine or ten. While it was originally assumed that the chip would be the same M1 Pro chip that was launched with the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/346129/2021-macbook-pro-14-inch-16-inch-mini-led-m1x-touch-bar-sd-card-reader-magsafe-price-release-date.html\">MacBook Pro</a>, a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/dylandkt/status/1412089676220055555&amp;xcust=1-1-346119-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">rumor from Twitter user @dylandkt</a> says the MacBook Air might use the next-generation M2 chip instead. A separate report from <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/26/analyst-ming-chi-kuo-expects-new-macbook-air-with-next-generation-apple-silicon-to-arrive-in-q3-2022/&amp;xcust=1-1-346119-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said the MacBook Air will be using “upgraded Apple Silicon,” which likely means an M2 processor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We expect the MacBook Air to retain the same 8GB and 16GB memory options even though the MacBook Pro upped the limit to 64GB. Apple will likely keep those options at the pro level.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2022 MacBook Air: Price and release date</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After earlier rumors that suggested the MacBook Air could arrive in late 2021,  recent rumors have pushed the release to 2022, including <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/dylandkt/status/1412089676220055555&amp;xcust=1-1-346119-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">a report from Twitter user @dylandkt</a> also says the new laptop won’t arrive until 2022. A report in <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/26/analyst-ming-chi-kuo-expects-new-macbook-air-with-next-generation-apple-silicon-to-arrive-in-q3-2022/&amp;xcust=1-1-346119-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">September 2021 from Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said the MacBook Air might not arrive until the third quarter of 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As far as the price goes, Apple might start this new MacBook Air a little higher than the current model. With a mini-LED display and a new colorful design, it’s possible that Apple starts the new Air at $1,099 or $1,199 and leaves an older M1 model at the $999 tier, much like it did with the 21.5-inch iMac after the 24-inch model arrived.</p>\n</div>","author":"Roman Loyola","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"19e3156d5112c93290d343106608ce7dc64e620bf807d9ee357f7679427ee1a6","category":"Apple"}
