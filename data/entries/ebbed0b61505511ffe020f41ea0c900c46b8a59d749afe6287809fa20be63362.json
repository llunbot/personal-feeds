For five years, multiple people have worked on making Macromedia Director games playable on modern hardware, and today, that work is done.</p>\n<p>Director was a critical component of early CD games that failed to scale up as Windows advanced (and as software like QuickTime fell by the wayside). But playing <em>Spaceship Warlock</em> or the bizarre Japanese art piece <em>Eastern Mind: The Lost Souls of Tong Nou</em> is now possible on current hardware—without the use of specific emulators.</p>\n<div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/journeymanproject-640x480.png\" /><p>Time travel and killer robots at their most '90s.

As the ScummVM team continues to improve support for Director, there's a good chance we could see some of these games on the market again.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1787885#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1787885&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Matt Paprocki","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ebbed0b61505511ffe020f41ea0c900c46b8a59d749afe6287809fa20be63362","category":"Tech"}
