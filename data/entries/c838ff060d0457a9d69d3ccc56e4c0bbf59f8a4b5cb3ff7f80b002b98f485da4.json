The Action 4 is mostly a minor upgrade compared to the previous Action 3 (which was a major upgrade), however, it does include a new image sensor (1/1.3”), which can offer better low-light performance in some areas. I dive into whether or not it actually does that in the video (spoiler: It depends). Further, I go into detail on all the other new software features on the Action 4, including expanded Invisistick support to basically any mode you want (it allows you to use a 1.5m long selfie-stick, and then removes the stick in post-processing, sorta like how 360 cameras work).</p>\n<p>Further, there’s also a new remote control that can start/stop recording on the camera, as well as feed back GPS data to the video file.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/08/clip_image001.jpg\"><img width=\"720\" height=\"479\" title=\"clip_image001\" alt=\"clip_image001\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/08/clip_image001_thumb.jpg\" /></a></p>\n<p>From there you can do overlay tags/stickers of: Speed, Route, Direction, Total Distance, Elevation, G-Force, and Inclination Angle. Those can be individually turned on, and moved around as you see fit. I turned them all on below. I’ll be doing a separate review on that in the next few days.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/08/vlcsnap-2023-08-03-13h05m25s956.png\"><img width=\"720\" height=\"405\" title=\"vlcsnap-2023-08-03-13h05m25s956\" alt=\"vlcsnap-2023-08-03-13h05m25s956\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/08/vlcsnap-2023-08-03-13h05m25s956_thumb.png\" /></a></p>\n<p>In the review I cover four main areas, with the clickable timestamps below:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnSV1Db53co&amp;t=54s\">0:54</a> What’s New/Different Compared to Action 3<br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnSV1Db53co&amp;t=490s\">8:10</a> Side-by-side comparisons to Hero 11 Black<br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnSV1Db53co&amp;t=730s\">12:10</a> Overheating Considerations<br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MnSV1Db53co&amp;t=828s\">13:48</a> Final Thoughts/Recommendations</p>\n<p>I’m also working on a written review, though, it’s been a very busy week and next week is promising to be the same, so trying to slot it in (especially since written reviews of drones/action cams seems to be going out of style).</p>\n<p>For those that want to look at the raw/original/unedited comparison footage, <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/sh/qv1h5oezxiu8b9m/AAC0IqNqrwvnjegRvmpCYybTa?dl=0\">you’ll find it here</a>. This includes a number of comparisons sets, and I’m adding a few more here and there into it. In total there’s I think some 30GB+ of footage samples there, across a number of different scenarios.</p>\n<p>With that – thanks for watching!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/08/DJIAction4YT.jpg\"><img width=\"720\" height=\"405\" title=\"DJIAction4YT\" alt=\"DJIAction4YT\" src=\"https://media.dcrainmaker.com/images/2023/08/DJIAction4YT_thumb.jpg\" /></a></p>","author":"DC Rainmaker","siteTitle":"DC Rainmaker","siteHash":"32f541eec2062fbf675b0daf837db78b41cd6160cf993de3c4b5e9b44a978706","entryHash":"c838ff060d0457a9d69d3ccc56e4c0bbf59f8a4b5cb3ff7f80b002b98f485da4","category":"Cycling"}
