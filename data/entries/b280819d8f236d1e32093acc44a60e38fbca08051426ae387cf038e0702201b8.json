Then tap <em>Download and install</em> and wait for the update to download. Then tap <em>Install Now</em>.</p>\n</div>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"b280819d8f236d1e32093acc44a60e38fbca08051426ae387cf038e0702201b8","category":"Apple"}
