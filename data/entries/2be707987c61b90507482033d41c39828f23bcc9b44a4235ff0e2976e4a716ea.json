This year's <a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/winner-2025-dance-your-ph-d-contest\">overall winner</a> is the University of Helsinki's Sulo Roukka, who researches <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemesthesis#:~:text=Some%20of%20these%20sensations%20may,beverages%20is%20a%20trigeminal%20stimulant.\">chemesthesis</a>, specifically how people experience different sensory food compounds like capsaicin (hot) or menthol (cool).</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/02/dance-your-phds-2018-winner-mixes-superconductivity-and-swing-dancing/\">we've reported previously</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/page/announcing-annual-dance-your-ph-d-contest\">Dance Your PhD</a> contest was established in 2008 by science journalist John Bohannon, who is now a data scientist at South Park Commons. Bohannon <a href=\"https://slate.com/technology/2011/10/dance-your-ph-d-winners-of-the-annual-interpretive-dance-contest-for-scientists-videos.html\">told Slate in 2011</a> that he came up with the idea while trying to figure out how to get a group of stressed-out PhD students, who were in the middle of defending their theses, to let off a little steam. So he put together a dance party at Austria's <a href=\"https://www.imba.oeaw.ac.at\">Institute of Molecular Biotechnology</a>, including a contest for whichever candidate could best explain their thesis topics through interpretive dance.</p>\n<p>The contest was such a hit that Bohannon started getting emails asking when the next one would beâ€”and Dance Your PhD has continued ever since. It's now in its 17th year. There are four broad categories: physics, chemistry, biology, and social science, with a fairly liberal interpretation of what topics fall under each. All category winners receive $750. Roukka won the chemistry category and, as the overall champion, will receive an additional $2,750.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/meet-the-winners-of-the-2025-dance-your-phd-contest/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/meet-the-winners-of-the-2025-dance-your-phd-contest/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2be707987c61b90507482033d41c39828f23bcc9b44a4235ff0e2976e4a716ea","category":"Tech"}
