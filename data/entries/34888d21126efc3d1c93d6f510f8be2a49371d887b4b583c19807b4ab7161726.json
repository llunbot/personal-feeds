But I've still got a few tricks up my sleeve.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"Like what?\" says the Pixel.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"That's under wraps. But let's just say you'll be USB-C-ing soon!\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"You're finally getting USB-C charging?\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"What?\" says the iPhone as the cucumber slice slowly slithers off its camera lens. \"How did you know?\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"Lucky guess?\" replies the Pixel sarcastically. </blockquote>\"Rest up for October 4,\" reads the ad's tagline, in reference to Google's upcoming Pixel event, where it is expected to unveil a new Pixel 8 lineup, a new Pixel Watch, and potentially Pixel Buds updates.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nInvites for Google's event went out the day after Apple invited the media and others to watch its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/29/apple-september-12-event-announcement/\">iPhone 15 \"Wonderlust\" event on September 12</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSince the iPhone 5, Apple has kept the Lightning port on the ‌iPhone‌, despite much of the industry moving to USB-C. However, after coming under pressure to comply with new regulations implemented in Europe, Apple is swapping the Lightning port on iPhone 15 devices for a USB-C port.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith this transition, the Mac, iPhone, and iPad will all finally charge using USB-C, allowing Apple customers to charge their devices with what has effectively become the de facto universal charging standard for consumer mobile and laptop devices.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google-pixel/\">Google Pixel</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/usb-c-iphone/\">USB-C iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/05/google-pokes-fun-iphone-15-usb-c-adoption/\">Google Mocks iPhone 15 and Late USB-C Adoption in Latest Ad</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-mocks-iphone-15-and-late-usb-c-adoption-in-latest-ad.2400498/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"34888d21126efc3d1c93d6f510f8be2a49371d887b4b583c19807b4ab7161726","category":"Apple"}
