Apple says that the security flaws were potentially used in an \"extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOne of the issues impacts CoreAudio, and involves a maliciously crafted audio file. Processing the audio stream in the media file could result in code execution. Apple fixed the memory corruption issue with improved bounds checking.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe other vulnerability affected pointer authentication code, and an attacker with arbitrary read and write capability could bypass the Pointer Authentication features that prevent memory from being tampered with. Apple removed the vulnerable code to prevent the exploit from working.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll of the updates are available today, and focus primarily on the security fixes. iOS 18.4.1 also addresses an issue that could prevent some wireless <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/carplay/\">CarPlay</a> setups from working properly in select vehicles.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/\">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246\">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/16/ios-18-4-1-security-fixes/\">Update Now: iOS 18.4.1 and macOS Sequoia 15.4.1 Address Actively Exploited Vulnerabilities</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/update-now-ios-18-4-1-and-macos-sequoia-15-4-1-address-actively-exploited-vulnerabilities.2455451/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2f7df36e16dfae81601557cb360751e20c985301cc3683a5817b40d5f9faaccf","category":"Apple"}
