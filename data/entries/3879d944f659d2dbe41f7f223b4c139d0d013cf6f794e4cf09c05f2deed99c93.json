Apple plans to put the button on the right side of the ‌iPhone‌, in the space where the mmWave antenna is on iPhones that are sold in the United States. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs a capacitive button geared towards fine-grained photography controls, it is said to have <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/13/iphone-16-capture-button-features/\">support for multiple gestures</a> and the ability to respond to pressure. In a new post on X (Twitter), Chinese leaker DuanRui <a href=\"https://x.com/duanrui1205/status/1831245321222984112\">shared an image</a> of unofficial third-party silicone cases with an opening in the expected location of the Capture button. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile these unofficial cases have a cutout for the Capture button, a machine-translated comment on the image by DuanRui claims that \"the official protective case of Apple's iPhone 16 series will not have this opening and will be made into an integrated design, which will not affect the normal use of this capacitive button.\" \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Capture Button has been depicted in CAD renders and dummy models of all four ‌iPhone‌ devices, but <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman last week <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-11/iphone-16-preview-bigger-screens-new-colors-camera-button-ai-and-a18-chip-lzpk5495\">suggested</a> that there is a possibility that it will only be available on the Pro models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAlong with a Capture Button, the ‌iPhone 16‌ models will feature slightly bigger displays on the Pro devices, a new A18 chip that supports Apple Intelligence, and 8GB RAM for all models, which is necessary to power Apple's AI models.
