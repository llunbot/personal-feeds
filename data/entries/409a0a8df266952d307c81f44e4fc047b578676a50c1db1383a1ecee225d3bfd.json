We apologize for missing last week, but both Stephen and I were in transit to South Texas for the Starship launch. To make up for it this week's report is extra long, and a day early due to the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States. But that doesn't mean the spaceflight action stops, with an eagerly awaited hot fire test of the Ariane 6 rocket expected Thursday. See below for details on how to watch live.</p>\n<p>As always, we <a href=\"https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/\">welcome reader submissions</a>, and if you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.</p>\n<p></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1986054#p3\">Read 35 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1986054&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"409a0a8df266952d307c81f44e4fc047b578676a50c1db1383a1ecee225d3bfd","category":"Tech"}
