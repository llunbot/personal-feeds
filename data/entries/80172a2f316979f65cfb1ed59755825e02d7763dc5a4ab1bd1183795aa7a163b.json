The company says that users can create YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram content with a \"Hollywood\" cinematic look and feel.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll settings are adjustable, including frame rate, shutter angle, audio levels, tint, shutter speed, lens, white balance, and ISO, with a simple tap-based interface. The interface includes record parameters, histogram, focus peaking, levels, and frame guides, and it can be brought up with a swipe. Focusing can be done by tapping on the screen, and there are options for shooting in 16:9 or vertical aspect ratios.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n4K ProRes video can be recorded directly to Blackmagic Cloud and synced directly into DaVinci Resolve. Cloud integration allows video footage to be sent to a post production studio in a matter of minutes for simpler editing, and it is available to all members of a project.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nVideo can also be recorded to the phone's storage and then exported to an external drive for those who prefer not to use Blackmagic Cloud, or uploaded manually to Blackmagic Cloud. Footage from multiple iPhones can be sent to DaVinci Resolve and lined up using the software's Sync Bin tool.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMore information on the Blackmagic Camera app for iOS can be <a href=\"https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/blackmagiccamera\">found on the Blackmagic website</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBlackmagic Camera is free to use and can be downloaded from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> as of today.
