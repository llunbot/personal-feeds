His Ineos team set a fierce pace to soften up the peloton over the climb-heavy second half of the stage, then Yates himself attacked to force a split among the main contenders.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/10017/flanders-uci-road-cycling-world-championships-2021-key-information\">Flanders UCI Road Cycling World Championships 2021: Key information</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/913/tour-of-britain-route-riders-live-tv-guide-all-you-need-to-know\">Tour of Britain 2021: Route, teams and all you need to know</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/10082/why-this-team-rode-bright-green-front-wheels-at-the-tour-of-britain\">Why this team rode bright green front wheels at the Tour of Britain</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nYates, Roglič, Mas and Bahrain Victorious pair Jack Haig and Gino Mäder were in front, Egan Bernal (Ineos Grenadiers) and Miguel Ángel López (Movistar) – third overall at the start of the day ­– were behind. With Bernal unwilling to work against Yates, the gap grew and grew and López’s dreams of a podium evaporated.</p>\n<p>Bernal would eventually lose nearly 7 minutes by the time he crossed the line, while a devastated López didn’t even make it that far. He climbed off the bike with around 30km to go.</p>\n<p>As a result, Haig now moves up to third overall, with Yates fourth and the increasingly impressive Mäder now up to fifth with just today’s final time-trial to go.</p>\n<p>Here are Cyclist photographer Chris Auld’s impressions of the Vuelta’s final road stage:</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/10054/vuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-20-gallery#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 62</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/09/vuelta_a_espana_2021_stage_20_01.jpg?itok=ENWAhom0\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 1 of </span>62</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/in-depth/10054/vuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-20-gallery\">Vuelta a Espana 2021 Stage 20 gallery</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/in-depth\">In-depth</a></span>\n  </span><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/authors/chris-auld\">Chris Auld</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>5 Sep 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F10054%2Fvuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-20-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Vuelta%20a%20Espana%202021%20Stage%2020%20gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F10054%2Fvuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-20-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Vuelta%20a%20Espana%202021%20Stage%2020%20gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F10054%2Fvuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-20-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Vuelta%20a%20Espana%202021%20Stage%2020%20gallery&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F10054%2Fvuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-20-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/10054/vuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-20-gallery#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 62</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/09/vuelta_a_espana_2021_stage_20_01.jpg?itok=ENWAhom0\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"mjames","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"f4413f51ff600a9dad0469dbe933292010cc5390f382618c150d4e541e8d3552","category":"Cycling"}
