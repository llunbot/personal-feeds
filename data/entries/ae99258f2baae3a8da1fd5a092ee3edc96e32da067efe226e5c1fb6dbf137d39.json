Now loads of games launch in various forms of Early Access, in a wide variety of readiness. It's been a boon for games like <em><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/08/baldurs-gate-3-early-impressions-youll-spend-whole-weeks-in-here-and-love-it/\">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, </em>which came a long way across <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/10/baldurs-gate-3-early-access-mediocre-rpg-amazing-rendering-engine/\">years of Early Access</a>.</p>\n<p>Early Access, and the \"<a href=\"https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/453F-5C96-EAC2-9145\">Advanced Access</a>\" provided for complete games by major publishers for \"Deluxe Editions\" and the like, has also been a boon to freeloaders. Craven types could play a game for hours and hours, then demand a refund within <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/06/valve-begins-offering-refunds-for-all-steam-games/\">the standard two hours of play, 14 days after the purchase window</a> of the game's \"official\" release. Steam-maker Valve has noticed and, as of Tuesday night, <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/4195741362094579141\">updated its refund policy</a>.</p>\n<p>\"Playtime acquired during the Advanced Access period will now count towards the Steam refund period,\" reads the update. In other words: Playtime is playtime now, so if you've played more than two hours of a game in any state, you don't get a refund. That closes at least one way that people could, with time-crunched effort, play and enjoy games for free in either Early or Advanced access.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019648#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2019648&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ae99258f2baae3a8da1fd5a092ee3edc96e32da067efe226e5c1fb6dbf137d39","category":"Tech"}
