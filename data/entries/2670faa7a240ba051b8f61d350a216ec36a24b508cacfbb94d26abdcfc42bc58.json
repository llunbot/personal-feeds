So this morning I went looking\nfor AR ski goggles and of course they exist. Here are a pair of\ndemo videos from Sirius (made by <a href=\"https://www.ostloong.com/\">Oostloong</a>) and\n<a href=\"https://rekkie.com/products/rekkie-augmented-reality-ski-goggles\">Rekkie</a>.</p>\n\n<p>These goggles include features like real-time speed, clock,\ntemperature, friend finding/tracking, wayfinding (directions,\ncompass, elevation), HD recording, and phone notifications. Skiing\nis a natural use for AR — you’re wearing the bulky goggles for\nsafety anyway, so you can hide all the necessary tech in there\nwithout <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Glass\">looking</a><a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/mobile/heres-robert-scoble-showering-with-google-glass/\">ridiculous</a>, and taking your mittens\non and off to check the time or send/read texts is annoying.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The demo video for the Sirius goggles is particularly impressive. And the use case is simply incredible: skiers are already wearing bulky goggles.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/09/augmented-reality-ski-goggles\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"2670faa7a240ba051b8f61d350a216ec36a24b508cacfbb94d26abdcfc42bc58","category":"Tech"}
