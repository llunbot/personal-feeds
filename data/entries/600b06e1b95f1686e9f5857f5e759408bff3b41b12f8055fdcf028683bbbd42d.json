Compared with the last seven days, U.S. mobile app\nactive users on Truth Social increased by more than 400%, Sensor\nTower’s proprietary panel indicates.</p>\n\n<p>However, X is still much larger than Truth Social, Sensor Tower\nnotes, as it has 100× more U.S. mobile app users than Trump’s\nsocial network.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In a couple of <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/19/trump-walmart-tariffs\">recent</a> <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/23/trump-cook-apple-india\">posts</a> I’ve referred to Truth Social as Trump’s “blog”. (I expounded upon this <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2025/05/26/ep-422\">in a recent episode of The Talk Show</a>, with Stephen Hackett, starting after the 1h:20m mark, so if you listened to that, the following will sound familiar.) Long before this easily-predictable breakup of two unstable sociopathic egomaniacs (and who would be genuinely surprised if Musk is back in the Oval Office next week?), I’ve long wondered about one particular aspect of their alliance. To wit: that Musk famously spent $44 billion to buy Twitter/X, and envisions it as a world-conquering “<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2022/10/everything\">everything app</a>”. Trump was once the best known user on Twitter, but after being kicked off every legitimate social network after trying to overthrow the 2020 election, Trump started his own ostensible Twitter-like network, Truth Social. Ostensibly, they’re in direct competition with each other.</p>\n\n<p>Did Musk ever pitch Trump on shutting Truth Social down and coming back to X full time? How about buying Truth Social for a bribery price of a cool $1 billion to sweeten the deal? Truth Social isn’t really a functional social network. Let’s stipulate that Truth Social has 1 percent the active US mobile users of X. Even that’s a sham. <em>Nobody of note other than Trump himself uses Truth Social.</em> For all the pathetic obsequiousness of every single lickspittle official serving in the Trump 2.0 administration, none of them are even vaguely active on Truth Social. They’re all still on X. The Justice Department posts to <a href=\"https://x.com/TheJusticeDept\">its official account on X</a> multiple times per day, but the DOJ doesn’t even have an account on Truth Social. OK, JD Vance has posted to <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@JDVance1\">his Truth Social account</a> about a dozen times in the last month. But <a href=\"https://x.com/JDVance\">he’s posted to X</a> five times <em>today</em>.</p>\n\n<p>What I’ve realized is that Truth Social is essentially just Trump’s blog. Truth Social is exceedingly unpopular when judged as a social network; but it’s exceedingly successful as a blog. All the other people using Truth Social are effectively reading his blog and shitposting comments and memes in response to his posts, trying to get his attention. I’ve been thinking about this for a few weeks, and in that time, Trump’s own posts on Truth Social have made the news on a near-daily basis. I’ve never once, ever, seen a post from anyone else on Truth Social make the news. Trump is not just the one and only person of consequence using it, his is the one and only account on Truth Social that you ever, <em>ever</em> hear about.</p>\n\n<p>If Truth Social were actually <em>meant</em> to compete with X, Threads, Bluesky, and Mastodon, this almost certainly would have been a source of conflict between Trump and Musk. Because, if it were meant to be an actual competitive social network, it would occur to Trump to require all his flunkeys and toadies not only to post to Truth Social, but to <em>stop</em> posting to X. But he hasn’t done that, because Truth Social is functioning as intended: it’s just an outlet for Trump to spew his demented <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/23/trump-cook-apple-india\">mad-king musings</a> (today he’s <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/06/trump-retweet-rushmore.jpeg\">retweeting calls</a> for him to be added to Mount Rushmore) and, most importantly, get some of his all-caps-laden bangers read aloud on the TV news.</p>\n\n\n\n    ","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"600b06e1b95f1686e9f5857f5e759408bff3b41b12f8055fdcf028683bbbd42d","category":"Tech"}
