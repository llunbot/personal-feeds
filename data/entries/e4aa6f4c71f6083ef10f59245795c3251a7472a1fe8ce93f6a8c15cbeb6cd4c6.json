They declined to identify the software or provide details about the vulnerability until the vendor, which they privately notified, releases a patch. The vulnerability was exploited using a malicious file the hackers sent the researchers after first spending weeks establishing a working relationship.</p>\n<p>Malware used in the campaign closely matches code used in a previous campaign that was definitively tied to hackers backed by the North Korean government, Clement Lecigne and Maddie Stone, both researchers in Google’s Threat Analysis Group, said. That campaign first came to public awareness in January 2021 in posts from the <a href=\"https://blog.google/threat-analysis-group/new-campaign-targeting-security-researchers/\">same Google research group</a> and, a few days later, <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2021/01/28/zinc-attacks-against-security-researchers/\">Microsoft</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1966395#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1966395&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e4aa6f4c71f6083ef10f59245795c3251a7472a1fe8ce93f6a8c15cbeb6cd4c6","category":"Tech"}
