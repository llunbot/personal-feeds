{"title":"Prosser: Apple Watch Series 7 to Ship in Mid-October","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/30/apple-watch-series-7-mid-october-launch/","date":1633041108000,"content":"The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-series-7/\">Apple Watch Series 7</a> will ship in mid-October with pre-orders to begin \"as early as next week,\" claims leaker <a href=\"https://www.frontpagetech.com/2021/09/30/exclusive-apple-watch-series-7-to-begin-shipping-mid-october/\">Jon Prosser</a>, citing sources \"familiar with the release.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/Apple-Watch-Series-7-Pink-and-Green-Feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nApple introduced the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ at its September \"California Streaming\" event alongside the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a> models, but at the time, said the new Apple Watch would ship later in the fall.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThere has been no official word on when the Series 7 will be available, but most Apple Watch Series 6 models have been sold out in the United States for a couple of weeks now. Rumors suggest the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/31/apple-watch-series-7-production-delay/\">was delayed</a> because of manufacturing issues caused by the complexity of the device, which pushed back mass production.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> said in early September that Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/10/kuo-apple-watch-series-7-ship-late-sept/\">had resolved</a> the production issues and that manufacturing would ramp up in mid to late September.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nProsser says that Apple has started \"informing the press\" inquiring about review units to expect more information on the Series 7 \"in the coming weeks,\" with no other information available. Prosser has a mixed track record when it comes to leaks, particularly with launch date predictions, so this information should be viewed with some skepticism.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nStill, mid-October is a reasonable guess and timeline for the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ launch, especially as we are still expecting one more event this year that could take place in mid to late October.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ did not get the design changes we were expecting, including the flat-edged design described by Prosser earlier this year. There <em>is</em> a redesign with a larger display, slimmer borders, and new 41mm and 45mm size options, but the general curved design of the Apple Watch remains the same.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ does not feature new health tracking capabilities, but Apple improved durability and added a fast charging feature. Pricing on the ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ will start at $399.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 7</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/30/apple-watch-series-7-mid-october-launch/\">Prosser: Apple Watch Series 7 to Ship in Mid-October</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/prosser-apple-watch-series-7-to-ship-in-mid-october.2314714/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=5MwCKnUJI9o:9C4yLcoDT-4:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=5MwCKnUJI9o:9C4yLcoDT-4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/5MwCKnUJI9o\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6535338bb6474730ef2361f5495ab5d8cc01d9355d40186d920707653d295703","category":"Apple"}
