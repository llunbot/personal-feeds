{"title":"The Sierra Recycler is Built from Recycled & Reused Parts: You Can Win it at Sea Otter!","link":"https://bikerumor.com/sierra-recycler-custom-mountain-bike-sea-otter-raffle/","date":1681999200000,"content":"<p>For the 6th year in a row, Sierra Nevada is partnering with PAUL Component Engineering and a bunch of other great brands to dream up a custom bike. Like previous years, that bike will be on display at the Sea Otter Classic and then raffled off with the proceeds benefitting a worthy cause. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike previous years, this time there are minimal new parts used in the build. Wanting to create a conversation starter that would center around sustainability and environmental thoughtfulness, the team thought, “What if we built a bike out of as many repurposed, recycled, or reused parts as possible?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The result is the Sierra Recycler. A bike that will be raffled off to benefit Outdoor Alliance and one that you will definitely want to see in person. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Process-Mone-Bikes-18-Large.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Process-Mone-Bikes-18-Large-800x640.jpeg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Process-Mone-Bikes-18-Large-800x640.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Process-Mone-Bikes-18-Large-297x238.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Process-Mone-Bikes-18-Large-120x96.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Process-Mone-Bikes-18-Large-768x615.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Process-Mone-Bikes-18-Large.jpeg 1256w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Process-Mone-Bikes-9-Large.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Process-Mone-Bikes-9-Large-800x640.jpeg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Process-Mone-Bikes-9-Large-800x640.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Process-Mone-Bikes-9-Large-297x238.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Process-Mone-Bikes-9-Large-120x96.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Process-Mone-Bikes-9-Large-768x614.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Process-Mone-Bikes-9-Large.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Process-Mone-Bikes-3-Large.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Process-Mone-Bikes-3-Large-800x640.jpeg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Process-Mone-Bikes-3-Large-800x640.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Process-Mone-Bikes-3-Large-297x238.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Process-Mone-Bikes-3-Large-120x96.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Process-Mone-Bikes-3-Large-768x614.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Process-Mone-Bikes-3-Large.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The build started with a phone call to New Mexico frame builder Cjell at Monē Bikes and a 1949 Schwinn Cruiser. Already known for chopping up vintage cruisers and repurposing them into modern mountain bikes, Cjell whipped up this beauty that can now clear a 29 x 2.6″ knobby tire. There’s even a Sierra Nevada can used as a shim. Because of course, there is. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Process-PAUL-1-Large.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"640\"
