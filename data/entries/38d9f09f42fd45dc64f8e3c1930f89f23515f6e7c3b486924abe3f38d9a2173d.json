{"title":"Who Cares About Getting News That’s True When You’re Getting It Fast With a $32,000/Year Bloomberg Terminal Subscription?","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/06/apples-second-5g-modem-said-to-support-mmwave/","date":1741228245000,"content":"\n<p>Mark Gurman, reporting for Bloomberg on 6 December 2024, regarding Apple’s first in-house cellular modem, “<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-06/apple-s-three-year-modem-road-map-company-plans-to-beat-qualcomm-by-2027\">Apple Plans Three-Year Modem Rollout in Bid to Top Qualcomm</a>”:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For now, the modem won’t be used in Apple’s higher-end products.\nIt’s set to come to a new mid-tier iPhone later next year,\ncode-named D23, that features a far-thinner design than current\nmodels. The chip will also start rolling out as early as 2025 in\nApple’s lower-end iPads.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We now know the name of that modem, the C1, from <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2025/02/the_iphone_16e\">its debut in the iPhone 16e last month</a>. Then, also on December 6, in a separate report headlined “<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-06/apple-s-modem-chips-pave-way-for-slimmer-iphone-cellular-macs-and-headsets\">Apple Explores Macs, Headsets With Built-In Cellular Data</a>”:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The first modem will also appear in low-end iPads next year, with\nthe 2026 update coming to Pro versions of the iPhone and iPad.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The cellular models of the new 11th generation iPads announced yesterday do not, it turns out, use the C1. The specs don’t match those of the iPhone 16e, and when I asked an Apple representative, they confirmed that none of the new iPads (including the Airs) use the C1 modem. (But, Apple reassured me, they all offer terrific cellular networking.)</p>\n\n<p>I’m not saying Gurman was wrong, because there are nine full months left in 2025 for Apple to release a 12th-generation low-end iPad with the C1. The previous (10th) generation <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2022/10/apple-unveils-completely-redesigned-ipad-in-four-vibrant-colors/\">came out in October 2022</a>, but the 9th generation <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/09/apples-most-popular-ipad-delivers-even-more-performance-and-advanced-features/\">came in September 2021</a>, just 13 months prior. And this week’s new M3 iPad Airs replaced M2 models that <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/05/apple-unveils-the-redesigned-11-inch-and-all-new-13-inch-ipad-air-with-m2/\">arrived just 10 months ago</a>. But, you know, it sure seems doubtful Apple is going to rev this hardware in 2025, so I’ll place my bet that he was <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/05/gurman-ipads\">wrong about this too</a>.</p>\n\n<p>(And yes, a Bloomberg Terminal subscription really does <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bloomberg_terminal.asp\">start at $32,000/year per seat</a>.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/05/gurman-c1-modem-ipad\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"38d9f09f42fd45dc64f8e3c1930f89f23515f6e7c3b486924abe3f38d9a2173d","category":"Tech"}
