A new report claims Google's next phones will herald the arrival of a feature called Pixel Sense that will ingest data from virtually every Google app on your phone, fueling a new personalized experience. This app could be the premiere feature of the Pixel 10 series expected out late this year.</p>\n<p>According to a <a href=\"https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-sense-3531570/\">report from Android Authority</a>, Pixel Sense is the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/12/google-reportedly-plans-new-pixie-ai-assistant-exclusive-to-pixel-devices/\">new name for Pixie</a>, an AI that was supposed to integrate with Google Assistant before Gemini became the center of Google's universe. In late 2023, it looked as though Pixie would be launched on the Pixel 9 series, but that never happened. Now, it's allegedly coming back as Pixel Sense, and we have more details on how it might work.</p>\n<p>Pixel Sense will apparently be able to leverage data you create in apps like Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Maps, Keep Notes, Recorder, Wallet, and almost every other Google app. It can also process media files like screenshots in the same way the Pixel Screenshots app currently does. The goal of collecting all this data is to help you complete tasks faster by suggesting content, products, and names by understanding the context of how you use the phone. Pixel Sense will essentially try to predict what you need without being prompted.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/03/googles-ai-powered-pixel-sense-app-could-gobble-up-all-your-pixel-10-data/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/03/googles-ai-powered-pixel-sense-app-could-gobble-up-all-your-pixel-10-data/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ryan Whitwam","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cc6af45a4374f029c23703dc29b773af4964190675fac04bab3ef28461eb78ed","category":"Tech"}
