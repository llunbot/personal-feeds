Now, at the 2025 Boao Forum for Asia, <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vivo-announces-robotics-lab-and-showcases-its-first-mixed-reality-headset-at-the-boao-forum-2025-302410473.html\">Vivo unveiled</a> its first mixed reality headset, called the \"Vivo Vision.\" \r<br />\n\r<br />\nObservers were <a href=\"https://www.uploadvr.com/vivo-vision-looks-like-blatant-chinese-apple-vision-pro-clone/\">quick to notice</a> that the device's design closely mirrors that of Apple's Vision Pro, including a gray fabric facial interface, a curved glass front visor, two downward-pointing cameras, a knitted rear tension strap, and an external battery in an aluminum casing connected via a braided cable.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe \"Vivo Vision\" name is also a clear take on \"Vision Pro.\" The company even adopted Apple's terminology, using the phrase \"spatial computing\" in promotional materials to describe the capabilities of its headset. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nVivo positioned its announcement as part of a broader push into AI and robotics. The company simultaneously revealed the establishment of the Vivo Robotics Lab, which it claims will use technologies developed for Vivo Vision in the development of consumer robotics. According to Vivo Executive Vice President Hu Baishan, the lab will focus on the \"brain\" and \"eyes\" of robotics.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAlthough Vivo did not disclose any hardware specifications, pricing, or technical capabilities, it is expected to launch in \"mid-2025.\" No details have been provided regarding its availability outside of China. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Vivo Vision joins a series of consumer electronic device designs that have been very strongly influenced by Apple, particularly in Asia where the company's products often serve as reference points for domestic hardware development. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/vivo/\">Vivo</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro\">Vision Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/27/vivo-vision-copies-vision-pro/\">China's 'Vivo Vision' Overtly Copies Apple Vision Pro Design</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/chinas-vivo-vision-overtly-copies-apple-vision-pro-design.2454160/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"14fd431cfdba4930664879d7c7cda1cdc76e8cfa44eac67b9dace2ca63f7703c","category":"Apple"}
