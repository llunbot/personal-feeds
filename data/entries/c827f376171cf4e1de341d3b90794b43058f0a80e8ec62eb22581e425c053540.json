Beginning today, we're taking off in a new partnership with Delta in which Spotify will take over the \"audio\" section of Delta's in-flight seatback entertainment. This means passengers on Delta flights that are equipped with seatback entertainment globally can now enjoy their favorite audio content exclusively in-flight on Delta Studio. </blockquote>According to the press release, the free in-flight content is licensed directly by Delta and will include specially curated versions of Spotify's most popular playlists, along with 42 select podcast series to choose from. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn other words, not all Spotify content will be available, but passengers will be able to listen to playlists such as such as Mood Booster, Are &amp; Be, Hot Country, mint, Today's Top Hits, Relax &amp; Unwind, RapCaviar, and Ultimate Indie. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe first podcasts available will include Crime Junkie, Science Vs, StartUp, The Dave Chang Show, The Hottest Take, The Journal, and more.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSpotify says the update to Delta's in-flight entertainment is rolling out now, with more content being updated regularly and more coming in October. <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/spotify/\">Spotify</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/delta/\">Delta</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/02/spotify-in-flight-music-service-delta/\">Spotify Partners With Delta to Provide Free In-Flight Music and Podcasts Service</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/spotify-partners-with-delta-to-provide-free-in-flight-music-and-podcasts-service.2309491/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=VumKUoVPWlA:-fZFmroHlWA:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=VumKUoVPWlA:-fZFmroHlWA:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/VumKUoVPWlA\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c827f376171cf4e1de341d3b90794b43058f0a80e8ec62eb22581e425c053540","category":"Apple"}
