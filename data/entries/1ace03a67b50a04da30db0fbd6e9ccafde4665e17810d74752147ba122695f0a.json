Not just one that allows for internal cable routing, but one that has high quality bearings and sealing that won’t require complicated replacement in the near future. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wolf Tooth Components entered into the world of ENVE IN-Route compatible headsets toward the end of last summer when they introduced the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wolf-tooth-components-enve-in-route-headset/\" target=\"_blank\">EC44 IN-Route headset</a>. Now they’re expanding on that option with a second model, the IS52 IN-Route headset.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_IS52-Headset-for-ENVE-IN-ROUTE_Diagram-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1536\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_IS52-Headset-for-ENVE-IN-ROUTE_Diagram-1536x1536.webp\" alt=\"Wolf Tooth IS52 In Route ENVE headset exploded\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_IS52-Headset-for-ENVE-IN-ROUTE_Diagram-1536x1536.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_IS52-Headset-for-ENVE-IN-ROUTE_Diagram-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_IS52-Headset-for-ENVE-IN-ROUTE_Diagram-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_IS52-Headset-for-ENVE-IN-ROUTE_Diagram-768x768.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_IS52-Headset-for-ENVE-IN-ROUTE_Diagram-jpg.webp 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_IS52-Headset-for-ENVE-IN-ROUTE_Studio_5-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1536\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_IS52-Headset-for-ENVE-IN-ROUTE_Studio_5-1536x1536.webp\" alt=\"Wolf Tooth IS52 In Route ENVE headset close up\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_IS52-Headset-for-ENVE-IN-ROUTE_Studio_5-1536x1536.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_IS52-Headset-for-ENVE-IN-ROUTE_Studio_5-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_IS52-Headset-for-ENVE-IN-ROUTE_Studio_5-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_IS52-Headset-for-ENVE-IN-ROUTE_Studio_5-768x768.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_IS52-Headset-for-ENVE-IN-ROUTE_Studio_5-jpg.webp 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The headset design is fairly self-explanatory. This one is for frames that use an IS52 internal headset and it’s for use with the ENVE IN-Route stem and spacers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weighing in at 78g, the headset has a super low 3.5mm upper stack height so you can slam that stem… if you desire. It also features triple-sealed waterproofing with an upper o-ring seal, precision fit labyrinth and lip seal, and a crown race with dual lip seal. While the headset components are made in house by Wolf Tooth from 6061 aluminum, the stainless steel bearings come from Enduro with high-pressure waterproof grease and dual-lip bearing seals. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_IS52-Headset-for-ENVE-IN-ROUTE_5-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_IS52-Headset-for-ENVE-IN-ROUTE_5-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"Wolf Tooth IS52 In Route ENVE headset colors\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_IS52-Headset-for-ENVE-IN-ROUTE_5-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_IS52-Headset-for-ENVE-IN-ROUTE_5-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_IS52-Headset-for-ENVE-IN-ROUTE_5-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_IS52-Headset-for-ENVE-IN-ROUTE_5-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_IS52-Headset-for-ENVE-IN-ROUTE_5-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_IS52-Headset-for-ENVE-IN-ROUTE_5-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Wolf-Tooth_IS52-Headset-for-ENVE-IN-ROUTE_5-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As usual, the headsets are available in the WTC Color Shop with seven current anodized colors. Pricing for the headset is set at $179.95 with spare parts available through their commitment to Right to Repair. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wolftoothcomponents.com/collections/headset-related/products/wolf-tooth-premium-is52-internal-headset-for-enve-in-route-system\" target=\"_blank\"><em>wolftoothcomponents.com</em></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wolf-tooth-enve-in-route-headset-is52/\">Wolf Tooth Expands ENVE IN-Route Headset Options w/ IS52</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"1ace03a67b50a04da30db0fbd6e9ccafde4665e17810d74752147ba122695f0a","category":"Cycling"}
