On the women’s side, the GOAT Marianne Vos is a multi-time champ in road, cyclocross and even track as well and Pauline Ferrand-Prévot has World Championships in road, cyclocross, three mountain bike disciplines <em>and </em>gravel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the biggest stars are either coming off injuries or joining the CX season late to grab some much-needed off-season, the stage is set for a new generation of riders to fight for the top spots and replicate their success. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a few rounds of the UCI World Cup under their belt and a long way to go until the end of CX action, here are eight multi-discipline names to watch this winter. </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/zoe-backstedt-cyclist\">‘There was never pressure to be in cycling, it was just what I wanted to do’: Zoe Bäckstedt interview</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-rise-of-cyclocross\">The rise of cyclocross</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/is-cyclocross-the-future-of-cycling\">Is cyclocross the future of cycling?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>1.

Last year’s under-23 UCI World Champion, he’s jumped up to the elite levels for this season and is continuing to impress. He stormed to victory in the season opener at Waterloo, Wisconsin, currently sits fifth on the UCI World Cup leaderboard with ten races to go and is leading the X2O Trofee series. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The son of Sven Nys, one of the most successful CX riders of all time, Thibau has also enjoyed success on the road in his first pro season in 2023. He rounded off the podium in the Tour of Norway this year behind young Ineos pair Ben Tulett and Magnus Sheffield. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2.

At the start of the race he was back in tenth, but he clawed his way back into a chasing group and almost bridged the gap to Michael Vanthourenhout, who led all the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mason finished just seven seconds down on the winner and in doing so the 23-year-old truly announced himself as an elite contender after a few years on the rise. He was also a major part of the six-man British contingent that claimed a silver medal in the CX team relay. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While he sticks to the rough stuff, the Scot competes in several MTB disciplines and featured at the pointy end of some of the UCI World Series gravel races in 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3.

She had an even better season on the mountain bike, coming first overall in the UCI’s Mountain Bike World Cup in both the XCO and XCC disciplines in her first season in the elites. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In CX, she claimed the U23 European Championships title last season and has got off to a strong start this winter, coming second in the World Cup’s opening races in Waterloo and this weekend in Troyes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She’s also racing this season with the added boost of the National Champions’ jersey – not bad going considering the wealth of talent in the Dutch contingent – and she never finished lower than third last season, some talent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pieterse even took on two one-day road races in 2023 for Fenix-Deceuninck, one of which was her WorldTour debut, finishing an incredible fifth at Strade Bianche behind only Demi Vollering, Lotte Kopecky, Cecilie Uttrup Ludwig and Annemiek van Vleuten.

Although she’s already said she will limit her off-road racing this season to focus on next year’s Spring Classics, her early results so far make her one to watch. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5.

Fourth in last year’s junior European Championships, she took a stunning silver medal at this year’s in Pontchâteau, making the most of a strong starting position to lead the pack. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She fought off a late charge from Viktória Chladonová to secure second step on the podium, but went one better in the under-19 World Cup round in Troyes a couple of weeks later – again one step ahead of Chladonová. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ferguson also races on the road, she won the junior Tour of Flanders and Trofeo Alfredo Binda in 2023 and came second in the World Championships junior road race and tenth in the TT (and third and first respectively in those races at nationals) and signed for Movistar earlier this year, she’ll join the team int he back half of 2024. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This list could have been endless with the amount of talent on display and we’re only a few weeks into the season.
