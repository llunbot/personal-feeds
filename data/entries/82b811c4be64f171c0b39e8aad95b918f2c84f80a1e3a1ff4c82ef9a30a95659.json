Among other things, some 12-millimeter drivers support high-resolution audio via LDAC, but only AAC via Bluetooth 5.4 when connected to Apple devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to the open-ring design, people who wear glasses have no problems wearing open-ear headphone like the AeroClips. The right/left detection is better recognzable than with some other small headphones thanks to a colored circle. However, there is room for improvement here too, for example red for right and blue for left.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The AeroClip is controlled via touch operation with the wide bracket that connects the two ends. As the bracket is easy to reach, the operation is very safe. Soundcore has also thought things through here: there is no command for single tapping, only for double and triple tapping, so operating errors are minimized. Commands such as playback control, volume, and Siri can be assigned via the app. In addition to the control settings, you can also deactivate the dual connection to another audio device or select the sound effects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two microphones with AI support aim to ensure better sound when making calls. The battery promises a maximum of eight hours of music enjoyment, and the charging box can be used to charge the AeroClip three times before it needs to be returned to the charger. A ten-minute quick charge provides 30 minutes of playing time. A USB-C port is available for charging the charging case, not inductive charging. The IPX4 splash water protection is ideal for sports or use on the beach.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><div><ul><li><figure><img alt=\"Soundcore Aeroclip 04\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Soundcore_Aeroclip_04.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Soundcore Aeroclip 03\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Soundcore_Aeroclip_03.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Soundcore Aeroclip 05\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Soundcore_Aeroclip_05.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Soundcore Aeroclip 02\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Soundcore_Aeroclip_02.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Soundcore Aeroclip 01\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Soundcore_Aeroclip_01.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li></ul><a></a><a></a><a></a><div></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sound check with different music genres and films</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The sound of voices, such as in films or tutorials, is very convincing, with good sharpness and excellent intelligibility. This also applies to music, which sounds surprisingly lively for Bluetooth headphones. Take our first track, “Getting Away With It” by Electronic, for example. Even though the bass isn’t very deep, it’s fun to listen to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The positive results continue when we switch to the rocking pop music of Depeche Mode. The song “Going Backwards” also convinces with its bass at the beginning. However, you can’t really relax while listening to it; the AeroClip struggles with the mix and it sounds a little strained. The AeroClip on the studio album <em>Memento Mori</em> manages this much better. Soundcore has found an excellent balance between lively highs and decent bass.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Should you buy the Soundcore AeroClips?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The AeroClip impresses with its very balanced and good sound tuning for headphones that rest on the ear.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"82b811c4be64f171c0b39e8aad95b918f2c84f80a1e3a1ff4c82ef9a30a95659","category":"Apple"}
