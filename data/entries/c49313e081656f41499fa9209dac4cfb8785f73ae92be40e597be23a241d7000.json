Those plans were dashed in 1871 when vandals broke into the workshop of the museum's designer, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Waterhouse_Hawkins\">Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins</a>, and smashed the models with sledgehammers, burying the rubble in the southwestern corner of the park.</p>\n<p>The traditional take in paleontology circles is that the man behind the destruction was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_M._Tweed\">William \"Boss\" Tweed</a>, who pretty much ruled the city's Democratic Party political machine at the time with his cronies at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammany_Hall\">Tammany Hall</a>.

Rather, it seems to have been one of many \"crazy actions\" by Hilton. \"We find that Hilton exhibited an eccentric and destructive approach to cultural artifacts, and a remarkable ability to destroy everything he touched, including the huge fortune of the department store tycoon Alexander Stewart,\" Coules and Benton wrote. \"Hilton was not only bad but also mad.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1940411#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1940411&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c49313e081656f41499fa9209dac4cfb8785f73ae92be40e597be23a241d7000","category":"Tech"}
