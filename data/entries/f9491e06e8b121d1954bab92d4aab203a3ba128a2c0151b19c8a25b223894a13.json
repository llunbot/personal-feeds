The all-in-one app used AI to automatically schedule your events and tasks at ideal times, and it could learn your scheduling preferences and daily patterns over time to further optimize your calendar.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMayday's website said its app worked best when you used it with others. For example, it could automatically schedule a meeting at a time where both you and a co-worker were available. It also offered automatic rescheduling for flexibility.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe app was shut down shortly after the acquisition.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt would be reasonable to assume that some of Mayday's features and technologies could be added to Apple's Calendar app across the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, under the Apple Intelligence umbrella. But, it appears that will have to wait for iOS 27.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs for the Health app, Gurman has previously reported that it will get a new AI-powered health coaching feature that offers personalized health recommendations. He initially expected the revamp to be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/30/ios-19-4-revamped-health-app-rumor/\">part of iOS 19.4</a> (now iOS 26.4), but it now appears that it will not be ready until at least iOS 27 as well. That update will arrive next year. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/\">iOS 26</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/06/two-features-delayed-to-ios-27/\">Apple Reportedly Delays Two New iPhone Features Until iOS 27</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reportedly-delays-two-new-iphone-features-until-ios-27.2458302/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f9491e06e8b121d1954bab92d4aab203a3ba128a2c0151b19c8a25b223894a13","category":"Apple"}
