The feature was made possible by Europe's Digital Markets Act, which forced Apple to open its NFC chip to third-party developers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUnlike traditional wallet apps, Curve Pay operates as an independent payment authority rather than simply passing through stored card data. Users can reassign purchases to different cards after completing transactions and link various payment sources including PayPal accounts.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe app also provides real-time spending analytics and automated cashback programs. Its \"staged wallet\" architecture also gives users more control over the payment process compared to conventional digital wallets.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCurve claims more than six million users across its platform, which was previously available only on Android devices. The company joins PayPal in offering European iPhone users alternatives to Apple Pay, with German cooperative banks also planning to introduce their own NFC payment solution through their banking app this September.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNFC access is available for banking and wallet apps in the European Economic Area, which includes the 27 European Union countries plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nfc/\">NFC</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/23/curve-pay-launches-iphone-nfc-payments/\">Curve Pay Launches iPhone NFC Payments as Apple Pay Alternative</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/curve-pay-launches-iphone-nfc-payments-as-apple-pay-alternative.2457569/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d4fad3029505fd46c733f7e757f4890abd35a1468a48f62a1fbd4ffa22316da9","category":"Apple"}
