It was a strange statement considering the fact that Google designed and marketed the Pixel 8 to be AI-centric and then designed a smartphone-centric AI model called \"Gemini Nano\" yet still couldn't make the two work together.</p>\n<p>A few weeks later, Google is backtracking somewhat. The company announced on the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/266349981/new-gen-ai-features-coming-to-your-pixel?hl=en&amp;sjid=17904893691283717066-NA\">Pixel Phone Help</a> forum that the smaller Pixel 8 actually <em>will </em>get Gemini Nano in the next big quarterly Android release, which should happen in June. There's a catch, thoughâ€”while the Pixel 8 Pro will get Gemini Nano as a user-facing feature, on the Pixel 8, it's only being released \"as a developer option.\" That means you'll be able to turn it on only via the hidden Developer Options menu in the settings, and most people will miss out on it.</p>\n<p>Google's Seang Chau, VP of devices and services software, explained the decision on the company's in-house \"<a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/made-by-google-podcast/episodes/6602fa6073a3a40017353c91\">Made by Google\" podcast</a>. \"The Pixel 8 Pro, having 12GB of RAM, was a perfect place for us to put [Gemini Nano] on the device and see what we could do,\" Chau said. \"When we looked at the Pixel 8 as an example, the Pixel 8 has 4GB less memory, and it wasn't as easy of a call to just say, 'all right, we're going to enable it on Pixel 8 as well.'\" According to Chau, Google's trepidation is because the company doesn't want to \"degrade the experience\" on the smaller Pixel 8, which only has 8GB of RAM.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013446#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013446&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"78452c624510666593483de9c18954a299fff3ab7b2a567c75cbf6b42fe03a1b","category":"Tech"}
