{"title":"AWS Weekly Roundup: Amazon Bedrock, Amazon QuickSight, AWS Amplify, and more (March 31, 2025)","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-weekly-roundup-amazon-bedrock-amazon-quicksight-aws-amplify-and-more-march-31-2025/","date":1743437634000,"content":"<p>It’s AWS Summit season! Free events are now rolling out worldwide, bringing our cloud computing community together to connect, collaborate, and learn. Whether you prefer joining us online or in-person, these gatherings offer valuable opportunities to expand your AWS knowledge. I’ll be attending the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/events/summits/amsterdam/\">AWS Amsterdam Summit</a> and would love to meet you—if you’re planning to be there, please stop by to say hello! Visit the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/events/summits/?awsf.location=*all\">AWS Summit website</a> today to find events in your area, sign up for registration alerts, and reserve your spot at an AWS Summit near you.</p> \n<p>Speaking of AWS news, let’s look at last week’s new announcements.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Last week’s launches</strong></span><br /> Here are the launches that got my attention.</p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/firewall-support-for-aws-amplify-hosted-sites/\">AWS WAF integration with AWS Amplify Hosting now generally available</a></strong> – You can now directly attach <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/waf\">AWS WAF</a> to your <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/\">AWS Amplify</a> applications through a one-click integration in the Amplify console or using infrastructure as code (IaC). This integration provides access to the full range of AWS WAF capabilities, including managed rules that protect against common web exploits like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). You can also create custom rules based on your application needs, implement rate-based rules to protect against distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks by limiting request rates from IP addresses, and configure geo-blocking to restrict access from specific countries. Firewall support is available in all <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glossary/latest/reference/glos-chap.html#region\">AWS Regions</a> in which Amplify Hosting operates.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/03/amazon-bedrock-custom-model-import-real-time-cost-transparency/\"><strong>Amazon Bedrock Custom Model Import introduces real-time cost transparency</strong></a> – If you’re using <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/custom-model-import/\">Amazon Bedrock Custom Model Import</a> to run your customized <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/foundation-models/\">foundation models (FMs)</a>, you can now access full transparency into compute resources and calculate inference costs in real time. Before model invocation, you can view the minimum compute resources (custom model units or CMUs) required through both the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\">Amazon Bedrock</a> console and Amazon Bedrock APIs. As models scale to handle increased traffic, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/\">Amazon CloudWatch</a> metrics provide real-time visibility into total CMUs used, enabling better cost control through near-instant visibility. This helps you make on-the-fly model configuration changes to optimize costs. The feature is available in all Regions where Amazon Bedrock Custom Model Import is supported, with additional details available in <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/import-model-calculate-cost.html\">Calculate the cost of running a custom model</a> in the Amazon Bedrock User Guide.</p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/03/amazon-bedrock-knowledge-bases-opensearch-cluster-vector-storage/\">Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases now supports Amazon OpenSearch Managed Cluster for vector storage</a></strong> – <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/knowledge-bases/\">Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases</a> securely connects FMs to company data sources for <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/retrieval-augmented-generation/\">Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)</a>, delivering more relevant and accurate responses. With this launch, you can use <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/features/managed/\">Amazon OpenSearch Managed Cluster</a> as a vector database while using the full suite of Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases features. This integration expands the list of supported vector databases, which already includes <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/features/serverless/\">Amazon OpenSearch Serverless</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/aurora/\">Amazon Aurora</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/neptune-analytics/latest/userguide/what-is-neptune-analytics.html\">Amazon Neptune Analytics</a>, Pinecone, MongoDB Atlas, and Redis. The native integration with vector databases helps mitigate the need to build custom data source integrations. This feature is now generally available in all existing Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases and OpenSearch Service Regions.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/03/amazon-bedrock-guardrails-general-availability-image-content-filters/\"><strong>Amazon Bedrock Guardrails announces the general availability of industry-leading image content filters</strong></a> – This new capability offers industry-leading text and image content safeguards that help you block up to 88% of harmful multimodal content without building custom safeguards or relying on error-prone manual content moderation. Image content filters can be applied across all categories within the content filter policy including hate, insults, sexual, violence, misconduct, and prompt attacks. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/guardrails\">Amazon Bedrock Guardrails</a> provides configurable safeguards to detect and block harmful content and prompt attacks, define topics to deny and disallow specific topics, redact personally identifiable information (PII) such as personal data, and block specific words. It also provides contextual grounding checks to detect and block model hallucinations and to identify the relevance of model responses and claims, and to identify, correct, and explain factual claims in model responses using Automated Reasoning checks. This capability is generally available in the US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Europe (Frankfurt), and Asia Pacific (Tokyo) Regions.

Now you can explore past trends, forecast future scenarios, and model solutions without needing specialized skill, analyst support, or manual manipulation of data in spreadsheets. With its intuitive interface and step-by-step guidance, the scenarios capability of Amazon Q in QuickSight helps you perform complex data analysis up to 10x faster than spreadsheets. Whether you’re optimizing marketing budgets, streamlining supply chains, or analyzing investments, Amazon Q makes advanced data analysis accessible so you can make data-driven decisions across your organization. This capability is accessible from any Amazon QuickSight dashboard, so you can move seamlessly from visualizing data to asking what-if questions and comparing alternatives. Previous analyses can be easily modified, extended, and reused, helping you quickly adapt to changing business needs.</p> \n<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/new/\">For a full list of AWS announcements, be sure to keep an eye on the What's New at AWS page.</a> \n<p>We launched existing services and instance types in additional Regions:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/03/amazon-datazone-2-additional-commercial-regions/\"><strong>Amazon DataZone is now available in Asia Pacific (Mumbai) and Europe (Paris) AWS Regions</strong></a> – <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/datazone/\">Amazon DataZone</a> is a fully managed data management service to catalog, discover, analyze, share, and govern data between data producers and consumers in your organization.</li> \n <li><strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/03/next-generation-amazon-sagemaker-two-additional-regions/\">The next generation of Amazon SageMaker is now available in Asia Pacific (Mumbai) and Europe (Paris) AWS Regions</a></strong> – <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/\">Amazon SageMaker</a> is the center for all your data, analytics, and AI.
