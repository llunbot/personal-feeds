The big new changes are a very slick new installer, using the same <a href=\"https://canonical-subiquity.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/\">Subiquity</a> back-end as the Server releases, and redesigned with a whole new front-end in Flutter. ZFS encryption is back as a default install option, along with hardware-backed (i.e. TPM) full-disk encryption, plus more guidance for people looking to dual-boot with Windows setups and BitLocker. Netplan 1.0 is the default network configuration tool now.
