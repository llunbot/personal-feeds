Businesses can sign up for Branded Mail today, with logos appearing to customers later this year when iOS 18.2 is released. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn 2025, companies will be able to use Business Caller ID, which will show their name, logo, and department on an inbound call screen.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere's also now an option for businesses to display their logo in Tap to Pay on ‌iPhone‌, rather than a category icon. Apple says this change will help customers ensure they're making a payment to a verified business.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBusinesses have been able to claim and manage their location place cards for Maps using Business Connect, but now Business Connect is also available to businesses that operate a service or that operate online without a physical location.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMore information on signing up for Business Connect <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/business/connect/\">can be found on Apple's website</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/16/apple-business-connect-new-features/\">Apple Will Let Verified Businesses Display Logos in Apps Like Mail, Phone, and Wallet</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-will-let-verified-businesses-display-logos-in-apps-like-mail-phone-and-wallet.2440246/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"fe536f7f006ccfde1ff53f55849c3a20ea9f475651f844a2f9b1df776b0f9e57","category":"Apple"}
