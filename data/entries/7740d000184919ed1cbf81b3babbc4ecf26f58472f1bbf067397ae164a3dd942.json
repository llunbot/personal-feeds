These images, taken about a month ago, show the Tiangong complex in its fully assembled configuration with three modules staffed by three crew members.</p>\n<p>A departing crew of three astronauts captured the new panoramic views of the Tiangong station in low-Earth orbit October 30, shortly after departing the outpost to head for Earth at the end of a six-month mission. These are the first views showing the Tiangong station after China completed assembling its three main modules last year.</p>\n<p>The Tianhe core module is at the center of the complex. It launched in April 2021 with crew accommodations and life support systems for astronauts. Two experiment modules, named Wentian and Mengtian, launched in 2022. The first team of Chinese astronauts arrived at the station in June 2021, and Tiangong has been permanently staffed by rotating three-person crews since June 2022.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1986983#p3\">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1986983&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7740d000184919ed1cbf81b3babbc4ecf26f58472f1bbf067397ae164a3dd942","category":"Tech"}
