Meanwhile, the free tier of ChatGPT will get unlimited access to GPT-5 at a \"standard intelligence setting,\" and Plus and Pro subscribers will gain access to higher intelligence levels with additional features like voice, canvas, search, and deep research capabilities.\r<br />\n<blockquote>\"We want AI to 'just work' for you,\" said Altman. \"We realize how complicated our model and product offerings have gotten. We hate the model picker as much as you do and want to return to magic unified intelligence.\"</blockquote>Currently, Apple Intelligence's ChatGPT integration, which doesn't require a ChatGPT account, uses the GPT-4o model. When users who aren't signed into an account reach daily limits, the system switches to a basic mode, likely powered by the GPT-4o mini model. Given OpenAI's roadmap, Apple device users who make use of Apple's suite of AI tools should benefit from the new models when they're rolled out. \r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-2-iphone-chatgpt-integration/\">Everything Your iPhone Can Do With ChatGPT</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nAltman didn't provide specific release dates for GPT-4.5 and GPT-5, but he suggested in a <a href=\"https://x.com/sama/status/1889757267425370415\">follow-up post</a> that they should arrive within \"weeks / months,\" respectively.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chatgpt/\">ChatGPT</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/openai/\">OpenAI</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/openai-reveals-gpt-4-5-gpt-5-roadmap/\">OpenAI Reveals GPT-4.5 and GPT-5 Roadmap, Promises Simplified AI Experience</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/openai-reveals-gpt-4-5-and-gpt-5-roadmap-promises-simplified-ai-experience.2449308/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3d78b8cdbce45107a495b0d8607bfeb1fe92b1ad665a840f131ba73b8d81c283","category":"Apple"}
