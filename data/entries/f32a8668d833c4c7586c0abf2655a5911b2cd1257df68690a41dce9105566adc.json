For those unfamiliar with the construction of the traditional alloy frame, it joins tubes with welds at the highest stress point. D’Aluisio Smartweld delivers the highest strength at the lowest weight using hydroformed tube junctions. This construction allows Specialized to move the weld away from the area of the highest stress and create a “valley” for the weld bead to lay in.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-1536x1152.jpeg\" alt=\"Specialized Chisel Comp FS\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-2048x1536.jpeg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-BB-scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-BB-1536x1152.jpeg\" alt=\"Specialized Chisel Comp FS BB\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-BB-1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-BB-297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-BB-120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-BB-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-BB-2048x1536.jpeg 2048w\" /></a><figcaption><br />(Photos: Jordan Villella/Bikerumor.com)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-bb-crankset--scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-bb-crankset--1536x1152.jpeg\" alt=\"Specialized Chisel Comp FS bb crankset\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-bb-crankset--1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-bb-crankset--297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-bb-crankset--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-bb-crankset--768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-bb-crankset--2048x1536.jpeg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>One-Piece Seat Tube/Bottom Bracket:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first of its kind, Chisel shaves extra material and weight with a one-piece hydroformed seat tube.

That’s why there is a frame-only option. That said, our review ride weighs 28 lbs on the dot in a size medium – not bad for aluminum.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-front-lockout--scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-front-lockout--scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Specialized Chisel Comp FS front lockout\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-front-lockout--scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-front-lockout--297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-front-lockout--1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-front-lockout--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-front-lockout--768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-front-lockout--2048x1536.jpeg 2048w\" /></a><figcaption><br />(Photo: Jordan Villella/Bikerumor.com)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-lockout--scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-lockout--scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Specialized Chisel Comp FS lockout\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-lockout--scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-lockout--297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-lockout--1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-lockout--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-lockout--768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-lockout--2048x1536.jpeg 2048w\" /></a><figcaption><br />(Photo: Jordan Villella/Bikerumor.com)</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As for all-day riding and various types of trails, the Chisel does the job well. I want a remote lockout option or a hole in the frame to accommodate one, but that may not be the crowd for this bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The flip-switch lockout isn’t challenging, but it takes some getting used to if you’re an XC geek like myself. The 120mm of travel is nicely expressed with the Chisel frame’s setup, and you forget you’re on an alloy bike reasonably quickly into the ride. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-rider-view--scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-rider-view--scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Specialized Chisel Comp FS rider view\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-rider-view--scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-rider-view--297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-rider-view--1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-rider-view--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-rider-view--768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-rider-view--2048x1536.jpeg 2048w\" /></a><figcaption><br />(Photo: Jordan Villella/Bikerumor.com)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Components </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The component setup is spot on, IMO. The Shimano SLX groupset combines solid shifting with a slight weight reduction. The brakes are the same Shimano model I use on my hardtail Chisel and perform great. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-rear-brake--scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-rear-brake--scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Specialized Chisel Comp FS rear brake\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-rear-brake--scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-rear-brake--297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-rear-brake--1536x1152.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-rear-brake--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-rear-brake--768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Specialized-Chisel-Comp-FS-rear-brake--2048x1536.jpeg 2048w\" /></a><figcaption><br />(Photo: Jordan Villella/Bikerumor.com)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If I were looking to shed weight quickly (and not break the bank) on the Chisel FS, I would opt for lighter wheels (like the Hunt Race alloy) and a carbon bar.
