If EVs and their ginormous batteries are expensive, resource-intensive purchases, the thinking went, maybe we should get something more out of them than just groceries and school pick-ups. Maybe we could find other things for that huge battery to do during <a href=\"https://usa.streetsblog.org/2016/03/10/its-true-the-typical-car-is-parked-95-percent-of-the-time\">the 95 percent of time it spends parked</a> in or near our homes.</p>\n<p>An EV powering your whole home, or even pushing power back to the grid, is something higher-end EVs might do at some point with some utilities. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/superchargers-are-the-reliable-fast-charging-backup-my-chevy-bolt-always-needed\">I have a Chevy Bolt</a>, an EV that does not have even a three-prong 110 V plug on it, let alone power-your-home potential. If I wanted to keep the essentials running during an outage, it seemed like I needed to buy a fuel-based generator—or one of those <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-portable-power-stations/\">big portable power stations</a>.</p>\n<p>Or so I thought, until I came across inverter kits. Inverters take the direct current available from your vehicle's 12V battery—the lead-acid brick inside almost every car—and turns it into alternating current suitable for standard plugs. Inverters designed for car batteries have been around a long time, opening up both novel and emergency uses. The catch is that you have to start the car's gas engine often enough to keep the battery charged.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/old-bolt-new-tricks-making-an-ev-into-a-backup-power-station-with-an-inverter/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/old-bolt-new-tricks-making-an-ev-into-a-backup-power-station-with-an-inverter/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"474749baf1c1d3e15c9e061e24fbf3b392f14628f85da9a58c3fa56ebdc520ca","category":"Tech"}
