The services the EU wants to include would have more than 45 million monthly active EU users and more than 10,000 yearly active business in the EU, a business turnover of at least 7.5 billion euros, or a market cap of 75 billion euros, with the caveat that these are just guidelines and the EU is open to arguments in both directions. When the initial list was announced back in September, the EU said that iMessage actually met the thresholds for regulation, but it was left off the list while it listens to Apple's arguments that it should not qualify.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1982260#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1982260&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"726dd70af77f760292b35f33522008b947228584756f87b899c8f70aee828aa8","category":"Tech"}
