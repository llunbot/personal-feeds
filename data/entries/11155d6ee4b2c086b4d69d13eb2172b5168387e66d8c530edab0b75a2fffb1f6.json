They call the trend \"AI cinema.\" We spoke to one of its practitioners, Julie Wieland, and asked her about her technique, which she calls \"synthography,\" for synthetic photography.</p>\n<h2>The origins of “AI cinema” as a still image art form</h2>\n<p>Last year, image synthesis models like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/openai-image-generator-dall-e-now-available-without-waitlist/\">DALL-E 2</a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/09/with-stable-diffusion-you-may-never-believe-what-you-see-online-again/\">Stable Diffusion</a>, and Midjourney began allowing anyone with a text description (called a \"prompt\") to generate a still image in many different styles. The technique has been <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/artstation-artists-stage-mass-protest-against-ai-generated-artwork/\">controversial</a> among some artists, but other artists have embraced the new tools and run with them.</p>\n\n<p>While anyone with a prompt can make an AI-generated image, it soon became clear that some people possessed a special talent for finessing these new AI tools to produce better content. As with painting or photography, the human creative spark is still necessary to produce notable results consistently.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1904461#p3\">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1904461&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"11155d6ee4b2c086b4d69d13eb2172b5168387e66d8c530edab0b75a2fffb1f6","category":"Tech"}
