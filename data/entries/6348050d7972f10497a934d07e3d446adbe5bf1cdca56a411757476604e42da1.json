A market that's increasingly skeptical of EVs in general isn't helping, but that age-old work-minded segment that looked set for a reinvention just a few years ago now seems increasingly reluctant to change.</p>\n<p>Rivian's excellent <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/06/rivians-revamped-r1-electric-pickup-and-suv-tested-on-and-off-road/\">R1T</a> hasn't taken the market by storm, while <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/01/a-week-with-a-ford-f-150-lightning-this-truck-is-too-big-for-city-life/\">Ford's F-150 Lightning</a> isn't reinventing the work truck landscape the way many (including myself) had hoped.
