The account can be opened and managed in the Wallet app on the iPhone, and it has no fees, no minimum deposits, and no minimum balance requirements. You must have an Apple Card, be a U.S. resident, and be at least 18 years old to open an account.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe account allows Apple Card holders to earn interest on their Daily Cash cashback balance, and on funds deposited via a linked bank account or an Apple Cash balance. The maximum balance allowed <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/01/apple-card-savings-1-million-limit/\">is now $1,000,000</a>, up from a previous limit of $250,000.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen the account first became available, Apple and Goldman Sachs offered an APY of 4.15%. The rate then increased three times, first to 4.25%, then to 4.35%, and finally to 4.5%. The drop to 4.4% is the first time the rate has gone down.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo open a savings account in the Wallet app, tap on your Apple Card, tap on the circle with three dots at the top of the screen, tap Daily Cash, and select Set Up Savings.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGoldman Sachs reportedly plans to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/28/apple-goldman-sachs-partnership-ending/\">end its consumer lending partnership with Apple</a>, but it is unclear if this will have any impact on Apple Card holders.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-card/\">Apple Card</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/apple-card-savings-rate-comparison-april/\">Apple Card Savings Account's Interest Rate Lowered to 4.4% Today</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-card-savings-accounts-interest-rate-lowered-to-4-4-today.2423294/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ab112d6f7035bdfbfa3602ef7eaab57f1cc24e35794a1520ea36a7b53d98de06","category":"Apple"}
