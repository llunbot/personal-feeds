This will offer better display performance than the current 10.9-inch ‌iPad Air‌ that uses an a-Si backplane.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNext in line for release are the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled-ipad-pro/\">OLED iPad Pro</a> models that have been rumored for some time. Apple will launch a new 11-inch and 13-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ with a redesigned chassis and new M3 chip in the second quarter.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKuo believes that last on Apple's 2024 production roadmap are a new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a>, and an 11th-generation ‌iPad‌ – a new version of Apple's most affordable tablet. This will see the discontinuation of Apple's 9th-generation ‌iPad‌ currently still offered alongside the 10th-generation model in Apple's lineup.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKuo believes these changes will see only modest gains in ‌iPad‌ shipments compared to this year, and predicts around 52-54 million units in 2024 compared to 2023. Such an increase remains way off Apple's peak of 63 million iPads shipped in 2022 during the pandemic.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> recently also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/05/all-ipads-expected-to-be-updated-in-2024/\">suggested</a> Apple will update its entire ‌iPad‌ lineup throughout 2024, but his timeline prediction is slightly different to Kuo and does not mention a new larger ‌iPad Air‌. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/22/gurman-new-ipads-scheduled-for-march-2024-launch/\">previously reported</a> that the low-end to mid-range iPads could be updated as early as March 2024, while he expects new 11-inch and 13-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ models with the M3 chip and OLED displays to launch in the first half of 2024. The next ‌iPad Air‌ and ‌iPad mini‌ are likely to be equipped with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> and A16 Bionic chips, respectively.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air </a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad\">iPad (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air\">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini\">iPad Mini (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/12/larger-ipad-air-launching-early-2024/\">Kuo: Larger 12.9-inch iPad Air Coming Early 2024 Amid Lineup Refresh</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-larger-12-9-inch-ipad-air-coming-early-2024-amid-lineup-refresh.2410742/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f57041359fcea50ae4f02007034f8e949581d7a4821ebf879115a6321946a402","category":"Apple"}
