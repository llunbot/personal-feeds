It found that using human-style encouragement improved math skills dramatically, in line with earlier results.</p>\n<p>In a paper called \"<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03409\">Large Language Models as Optimizers</a>\" listed this month on arXiv, DeepMind scientists introduced Optimization by PROmpting (OPRO), a method to improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s PaLM 2. This new approach sidesteps the limitations of traditional math-based optimizers by using natural language to guide LLMs in problem-solving. \"Natural language\" is a fancy way of saying everyday human speech.</p>\n\n<p>\"Instead of formally defining the optimization problem and deriving the update step with a programmed solver,\" the researchers write, \"we describe the optimization problem in natural language, then instruct the LLM to iteratively generate new solutions based on the problem description and the previously found solutions.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1969012#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1969012&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2cac2de14dc8c2f3feddf97de618b8c62f55976a841c2493163e7b4c2cf25805","category":"Tech"}
