I fell into road bikes through track bikes, but am a mountain biker at heart, and like the owners of this platform, I love getting way out into the wilderness.</p>\n<p>This road bike stopped me in my tracks and had me reaching for the bottom drawers where the bib shorts reside, and I can say that only a Prova has provided that same tingling in the toes. I’d seen photos of this Pegoretti as a frameset, then at Baum Cycles where it was assembled and undoubtedly had Darren Baum cursing Dario’s brilliance, and the missed opportunity for collaboration between the two.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Pegoretti-Mxxxxxo-021.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Pegoretti-Mxxxxxo-021.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Pegoretti-Mxxxxxo-021.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Pegoretti-Mxxxxxo-021.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Pegoretti-Mxxxxxo-022.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Pegoretti-Mxxxxxo-022.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Pegoretti-Mxxxxxo-022.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Pegoretti-Mxxxxxo-022.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The owner of this bike has many fine fillies in his stable and always wanted a Pegoretti. Though he had the opportunity to get it from the source in Italy, it came to be via <a href=\"https://abovecategory.com/\">Above Category</a>, the two-wheeled temple of excellence in Marin County, California.</p>\n<p>The brief was simple: an Mxxxxxo model, with custom geometry, “Not the old man headtube,” and a Ciavete paint scheme, which gives creative freedom to the painters, with only your preferred color as a guide. “Give me something offensive,” was the directive – a new Pantone perhaps? – and the result is nothing short of art.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Pegoretti-Mxxxxxo-05.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Pegoretti-Mxxxxxo-05.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Pegoretti-Mxxxxxo-05.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Pegoretti-Mxxxxxo-05.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Expletives adorn the bike in Italian Veneto dialect on the driveside and in English on the reverse, with the brush stroke effect Pegoretti made famous, signed off by Dario just a year before his passing.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Pegoretti-Mxxxxxo-038.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Pegoretti-Mxxxxxo-038.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Pegoretti-Mxxxxxo-038.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Pegoretti-Mxxxxxo-038.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Pegoretti-Mxxxxxo-039.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Pegoretti-Mxxxxxo-039.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Pegoretti-Mxxxxxo-039.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Pegoretti-Mxxxxxo-039.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Busyman leatherwork for the bar tape and saddle, with rich pops of color accenting the deep black kangaroo hide.</p>\n<p>Some think this is hotter with the addition of Campagolo Super Record and Lightweights. For me, their understated styling complements the bike without distraction, making the frame the hero that it is, worthy of display in an art gallery.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Pegoretti-Mxxxxxo-033.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Pegoretti-Mxxxxxo-033.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Pegoretti-Mxxxxxo-033.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/03/Pegoretti-Mxxxxxo-033.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Whatever it is in the water of northern Italy, they never cease to create true desire with breathtaking shapes, shades, and strokes.</p>\n<p>You can easily hang this bike on your wall.
