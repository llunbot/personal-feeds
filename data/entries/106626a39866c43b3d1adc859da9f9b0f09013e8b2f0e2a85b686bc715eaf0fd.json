The beta currently only supports Instagram integration, but other Meta-owned platforms like Facebook and Threads are expected to be included in the official update.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAny social media links are displayed on a user's WhatsApp profile alongside existing information such as their name, phone number, and \"About\" section. According to the report, WhatsApp will use privacy controls similar to those already available for profile photos, allowing users to manage who can see their linked social media profiles.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBusiness accounts on WhatsApp can already display social media links after completing an authentication process, so it's likely WhatsApp will introduce similar authentication requirements before the feature's public release, which could arrive in a matter of weeks, if past beta features are anything to go by.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/whatsapp/\">WhatsApp</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/12/whatsapp-link-social-media-accounts/\">WhatsApp Will Soon Let Users Add Instagram Links to Profiles</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/whatsapp-will-soon-let-users-add-instagram-links-to-profiles.2449240/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"106626a39866c43b3d1adc859da9f9b0f09013e8b2f0e2a85b686bc715eaf0fd","category":"Apple"}
