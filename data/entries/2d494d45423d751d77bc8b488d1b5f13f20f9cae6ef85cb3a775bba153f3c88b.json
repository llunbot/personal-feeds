{"title":"When You Search for ‘Google’ on Bing, Bing Attempts to Trick You Into Thinking the Results Page Is Google","link":"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337117/microsoft-bing-search-results-google-design-trick","date":1736380270000,"content":"\n<p>Tom Warren, The Verge:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Microsoft is pulling yet another trick to get people to use its\nBing search engine. If you use Bing right now without signing into\na Microsoft account and search for Google, you’ll get a page that\nlooks an awful lot like... Google.</p>\n\n<p>It’s a clear attempt from Microsoft to make Bing look like Google\nfor this specific search query, and other searches just list the\nusual Bing search results without this special interface. The\n<a href=\"https://www.bing.com/search?q=Google\">Google result</a> includes a search bar, an image that looks a\nlot like a Google Doodle, and even some small text under the\nsearch bar just like Google does. Microsoft even automatically\nscrolls down the page slightly to mask its own Bing search bar\nthat appears at the top of search results.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The idea here is that Edge is the default browser on Windows, and Edge remains the only browser that sets Bing as its default search engine. And so a lot of technically un-savvy Windows users open their browser (Edge) and type “Google”. This trick is meant to make them think they’re now <em>on</em> Google, and I have to say, it’s really well done. The lack of Google’s main logo above the search box is explained by the <a href=\"https://doodles.google/\">Google-Doodle</a>-style illustration. It’s common for Google itself to do that. The autoscrolling moves the page down just far enough to move Bing’s own page header out of the viewable page content. But because they just autoscroll down from the Bing page header, as opposed to hiding it completely (say, using <code>display: none</code> in CSS) you can see it by just scrolling back up. But who thinks to scroll <em>up</em> immediately after typing a search term and hitting Return? (No one.) They even actually <em>have</em> the word “Google” and Google’s actual logo on the results page, in an “info box” for Google, the “American tech company”. <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/01/bing-google-masquerade.png\">See for yourself</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It’s an exquisite dirty trick, and I’ll bet it actually works remarkably well. Google itself has long claimed <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/1/22703263/google-lawyer-argues-bing-used-find-google-top-search-defaults\">that “google” is the most-searched-for term on Bing</a>. I’ll bet that presenting the results for that search this way <em>greatly</em> increases the number of users who, thinking they’re actually now on Google, perform the search they intended to do on Google right there on Bing. And then do it again, and again, until some helpful friend or colleague shows them how to install a better browser or just <a href=\"https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/464?hl=en#zippy=%2Cmicrosoft-edge\">switch Edge’s default search to Google</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This is the most classic old-school Microsoft <a href=\"https://greensdictofslang.com/entry/qwrjp2y\">rat fuck</a> they’ve pulled in a long while. They used to scheme up these type of devious moves <em>all the time</em> back in the ’80s and ’90s. Deceptive enough to work, but with plausible deniability, however thin, for every aspect of it. Glad to see they’ve still got it in them.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/08/bing-google-masquerade\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"2d494d45423d751d77bc8b488d1b5f13f20f9cae6ef85cb3a775bba153f3c88b","category":"Tech"}
