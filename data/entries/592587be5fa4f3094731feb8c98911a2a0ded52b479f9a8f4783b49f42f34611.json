The FTC is facing down District Court Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley's finding that the regulator \"has not shown a likelihood it will prevail on its claim this particular vertical merger in this specific industry may substantially lessen competition.\"</p>\n<p>An appeal would have to convince a circuit court judge of some key unconsidered area of fact or law to overturn that decision, which could be a high bar in this case. Still, the appeal filing itself shows that the FTC is not willing to give up easily in this high-profile case.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1953562#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1953562&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"592587be5fa4f3094731feb8c98911a2a0ded52b479f9a8f4783b49f42f34611","category":"Tech"}
