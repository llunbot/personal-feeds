I turned around at east sheen roundabout and started riding full speed to the cafe about 500 metres away,” he wrote on Instagram. “They simply rode one of the motor bikes into me at 60kph. I came off the bike and the first motor bike lost control. I held onto my bike however the second motor bike then dragged me and the bike along the floor for another 100 metres. After this they pulled out a 15 inch machete 🔪 at which point I thought better and let the bike go.”</p><p>Richardson shared a photo of a badly scraped leg and said that he gave details of the incident to the police.</p><p>“I’m pretty cut up and bruised with a swollen hip but tomorrow is another day,” he wrote. “Please be careful in the area and note this is becoming a common occurrence in parts of London.
