With several all-new clipless pedals, platform pedals, traditional &amp; direct-mount stems, and MTB bars that come with vibration-damping lock-on grips, Leatt drops in with commitment to the mountain bike component segment. Plus, there’s multiple levels of components, from mid-level performance spec alloy, up to top-tier lightweight Ceramag ceramic-coated magnesium &amp; titanium components.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s take a closer look…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2025 Leatt all-new mountain bike components</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components_wide-mountain-bike-line-up.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2050\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components_wide-mountain-bike-line-up.jpg\" alt=\"2025 Leatt MTB Components line-up\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components_wide-mountain-bike-line-up.jpg 2050w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components_wide-mountain-bike-line-up-297x217.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components_wide-mountain-bike-line-up-1536x1124.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components_wide-mountain-bike-line-up-120x88.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components_wide-mountain-bike-line-up-768x562.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components_wide-mountain-bike-line-up-2048x1499.jpg 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s the 20th anniversary of Leatt – founded on the concept of the safety of a neck brace. And now the South African company is breaking away from soft goods that you wear, to hard goods that connect you to the bike. On offer are 5 completely new product categories. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Connecting your feet to the bike, there are 4 lines of pedals – 1 flat and 3 clipless pedals from XC to DH – each with two or three spec levels. In between your hands and the bike are ergo grips in 2 thicknesses, alloy bars in 2 rise options, and conventional or direct mount stems in a few lengths. And lastly, a couple of new water bottles, with one being uniquely full-face-friendly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ceramag tech or classic alloy</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components-white-Ceramag-stem-and-alloy-handlebar-on-bike.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components-white-Ceramag-stem-and-alloy-handlebar-on-bike.jpg\" alt=\"2025 Leatt MTB Components, Ceramag magnesium stem in white\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components-white-Ceramag-stem-and-alloy-handlebar-on-bike.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components-white-Ceramag-stem-and-alloy-handlebar-on-bike-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components-white-Ceramag-stem-and-alloy-handlebar-on-bike-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components-white-Ceramag-stem-and-alloy-handlebar-on-bike-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components-white-Ceramag-stem-and-alloy-handlebar-on-bike-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components-white-Ceramag-stem-and-alloy-handlebar-on-bike-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components-white-Ceramag-stem-and-alloy-handlebar-on-bike-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Both the pedals and stems have a few performance tiers, with ceramic-coated magnesium Cermag being the top-level – in black or white – promising super light weights, gravity-ready strength &amp; stiffness, and the ability to damp more vibration than aluminum. Or you can pick from traditional aluminum alloys – 6061-T6 for pedals and 7075-T6 for stems in black, silver, or bronze – sharing the same shaping, just at a higher weight and more affordable price points.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lightweight and high strength are the big benefits of the use of magnesium for Leatt. Then, improved ride comfort comes as an added bonus due to the material’s vibration-damping properties. But its susceptibility to corrosion means the protective finish is extra important.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components-ceramag-ceramic-coated-magnesium-details.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components-ceramag-ceramic-coated-magnesium-details.jpg\" alt=\"2025 Leatt MTB Components, Ceramag magnesium tech details\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components-ceramag-ceramic-coated-magnesium-details.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components-ceramag-ceramic-coated-magnesium-details-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components-ceramag-ceramic-coated-magnesium-details-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components-ceramag-ceramic-coated-magnesium-details-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components-ceramag-ceramic-coated-magnesium-details-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So Leatt first gives the magnesium components a ‘plasma ceramic corrosion seal’ treatment, then a ‘high wear resistance’ coating on top of that. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components_all-mountain-bike-clipless-pedals_all-mtn-pedal-in-Ceramag-magnesium-black.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components_all-mountain-bike-clipless-pedals_all-mtn-pedal-in-Ceramag-magnesium-black.jpg\" alt=\"2025 Leatt MTB Components, Ceramad All-Mtn clipless in black\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components_all-mountain-bike-clipless-pedals_all-mtn-pedal-in-Ceramag-magnesium-black.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components_all-mountain-bike-clipless-pedals_all-mtn-pedal-in-Ceramag-magnesium-black-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components_all-mountain-bike-clipless-pedals_all-mtn-pedal-in-Ceramag-magnesium-black-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components_all-mountain-bike-clipless-pedals_all-mtn-pedal-in-Ceramag-magnesium-black-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components_all-mountain-bike-clipless-pedals_all-mtn-pedal-in-Ceramag-magnesium-black-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components_all-mountain-bike-clipless-pedals_all-mtn-pedal-in-Ceramag-magnesium-black-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components_all-mountain-bike-clipless-pedals_all-mtn-pedal-in-Ceramag-magnesium-black-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The result is a matte white or black finish with a deeper texture to it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that ceramic coating does appear quite resistant to regular MTB trail wear. We had a sneak peek at these same white Leatt 8.0 Ceramag flat pedals back in March.

At its core, magnesium is abundant and easy to source from the environment. It can be 100% recycled. And refining and processing it is less energy intensive than aluminum.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mountain Bike Pedals</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components_wide-platform-and-clipless-mountain-bike-pedal-range.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1030\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components_wide-platform-and-clipless-mountain-bike-pedal-range.jpg\" alt=\"2025 Leatt MTB Components, wide flat &amp; clipless pedal family\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components_wide-platform-and-clipless-mountain-bike-pedal-range.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components_wide-platform-and-clipless-mountain-bike-pedal-range-297x153.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components_wide-platform-and-clipless-mountain-bike-pedal-range-1536x791.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components_wide-platform-and-clipless-mountain-bike-pedal-range-120x62.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components_wide-platform-and-clipless-mountain-bike-pedal-range-768x396.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest spread of new kit in the 2025 Leatt MTB Component line-up are 5 all-new mountain bike pedal designs.

Designed for XC &amp; Marathon riding to support Leatt’s latest move into the realm of endurance mountain bike racing, they’ll likely also be a popular gravel choice, too. Especially, since they’re a claimed 12g lighter than XTR or 44g lighter than XT – the benchmark of pedal performance for much of gravel &amp; XC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Leatt MTB Components Clip Pedal Endurance 6.0 starts out at just $159 / 159€ in aluminum (382g, claimed).

The grip themselves are not quite round (but almost) with a “variable diameter taper profile” that puts more solid rubber on the outer edge of the grip and under your palm. Pick them in regular 33/31mm diameter, or a slightly thinner 31/29mm version, still with Reaflex inside. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The grips feature thin, flexy ribs under your thumb and forefinger for positive grip, and waffles under fingertips for extra control. Plus, there’s just an inboard lock-on ring and a padded outer bumper to protect your bar – whether in a crash, laid on the ground (gasp!), or to protect a wall or your car when you lean your bike against the first inanimate object you find after a tough ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components-pedal-axle-and-grip-tech.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components-pedal-axle-and-grip-tech.jpg\" alt=\"2025 Leatt MTB Components, pedal and grips tech details\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components-pedal-axle-and-grip-tech.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components-pedal-axle-and-grip-tech-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components-pedal-axle-and-grip-tech-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components-pedal-axle-and-grip-tech-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components-pedal-axle-and-grip-tech-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components-pedal-axle-and-grip-tech-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components-pedal-axle-and-grip-tech-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out a closer look at what’s inside all of the pedals and the new grips.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Full-face-specific water bottle</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components_steady-sip-bottle-for-full-face-helmets.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components_steady-sip-bottle-for-full-face-helmets.jpg\" alt=\"2025 Leatt MTB Components, standout full-face-specific water bottle with Hydrapak extension\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components_steady-sip-bottle-for-full-face-helmets.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components_steady-sip-bottle-for-full-face-helmets-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components_steady-sip-bottle-for-full-face-helmets-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components_steady-sip-bottle-for-full-face-helmets-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Image/Leatt)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This one feels almost silly to get excited about, especially since I haven’t seen it in person yet. But after a few hot summer days testing enduro gear in bikeparks, I long for a water bottle that’s easy to drink out of when wearing a full-face helmet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The secret to the all-new $30 / 30€ Leaat Steady-Sip Convertible water bottle is that there is a tube inside that draws water from the bottom of the bottle and some sophisticated valves to keep it ready-to-drink at all times. What you get is a bidon you can sip from without turning it upside-down. And there is either the standard Hydrapak Blaster bite valve on the top cap. Or… the new Leatt water bottle also includes a short Hydrapak extension tube that you can leave attached to the bottle, and can be angled inside of a full-face helmet for easier mid-ride refueling. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I’ve been drinking in between runs where I take my goggles off and squeeze a normal bottle in above my chin bar. But the thought of quick and easy mid-ride rehydration kinda sounds like a dream during this hot &amp; sweaty summer of bikepark riding!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Affordable All-Mountain to Gravity riding kit</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-affordable-gravity-riding-clothing-for-kids-and-adults.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-affordable-gravity-riding-clothing-for-kids-and-adults.jpg\" alt=\"2025 Leatt MTB Components, low cost 1.0 Ride kit for all-mountain, enduro &amp; gravity for kids and adults\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-affordable-gravity-riding-clothing-for-kids-and-adults.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-affordable-gravity-riding-clothing-for-kids-and-adults-225x300.jpg 225w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-affordable-gravity-riding-clothing-for-kids-and-adults-90x120.jpg 90w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-affordable-gravity-riding-clothing-for-kids-and-adults-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-affordable-gravity-riding-clothing-for-kids-and-adults-1152x1536.jpg 1152w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-Trail-wear-riding-kit-for-men-and-women.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-Trail-wear-riding-kit-for-men-and-women.jpg\" alt=\"2025 Leatt MTB Trail collection clothing expands for women\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-Trail-wear-riding-kit-for-men-and-women.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-Trail-wear-riding-kit-for-men-and-women-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-Trail-wear-riding-kit-for-men-and-women-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-Trail-wear-riding-kit-for-men-and-women-768x768.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I briefly mentioned riding apparel. And while that makes up the bulk of Leatt’s product SKUs, they were also light on the detail at Eurobike here, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what stood out to me was this $100 / 100€ 1.0 Ride Kit. Sold as a set for a hundred bucks – including a long-sleeve jersey and a pair of long pants – you get a solid all-mountain to enduro to DH set of riding gear for a super reasonable price. Fabrics are simple but durable synthetics – and Bluesign certified! – and based on the higher-end Leatt gravity riding gear. The feature list reads like something out of Leatt’s much more pricey lineup, and we’re psyched to give it a test. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, there’s a kids version too, for just $90 / 90€ for the jersey &amp; pants pairing. Bonus for enduro parents!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, Leatt says they’ve greatly expanded their trail clothing offerings for MY25, making sure that women get parity with men on options at all levels We’ve tested a number of the higher-end women’s gravity clothing options from Leatt over the last couple of seasons and have always come away pleased, but wishing there were as many options as there were for men. It sounds like our concerns are being addressed. We’ll be keeping an eye on it!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Leatt MTB Components – Availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components_wide-mountain-bike-line-up.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2050\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components_wide-mountain-bike-line-up.jpg\" alt=\"2025 Leatt MTB Components line-up\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components_wide-mountain-bike-line-up.jpg 2050w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components_wide-mountain-bike-line-up-297x217.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components_wide-mountain-bike-line-up-1536x1124.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components_wide-mountain-bike-line-up-120x88.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components_wide-mountain-bike-line-up-768x562.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/2025-Leatt-MTB-Components_wide-mountain-bike-line-up-2048x1499.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All of the all-new Leatt MTB Components, the new affordable gravity wear, and the updated men’s &amp; women’s trail kit are officially model year 2025 products. That means officially you won’t be able to buy it until the start of next year. But, we’ve seen in the past that Leatt manages to sneak some of their next year’s kit out to dealers in early winter. And we’ve heard that some of the new MY25 gear – like the Ceramag components, for example – should be available earlier in the fall. Hit up your local Leatt distributor or dealer to get updated delivery timelines in your market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re especially curious to try out the Ceramag kit to see how it stands up to real-world (ab)use, and to see if the budget gravity wear is as good as Leatt’s more premium enduro riding clothing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://leatt.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Leatt.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2025-leatt-all-new-mountain-bike-components/\">Leatt Enters MTB Component World w/ Vibration-Absorbing Stems, Grips, Pedals &amp; Full Face Bidon!</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"0288caf1b31e165c06790e5a3f0e83e47b84c6b41e7f29ea3fe6c41c9ee66685","category":"Cycling"}
