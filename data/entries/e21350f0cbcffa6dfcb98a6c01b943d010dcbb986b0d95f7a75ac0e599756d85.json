Before that, I had a series of BMX bikes and a few 26″ cruisers, but it wasn’t until I moved away from coastal North Carolina for college that a legit MTB was on my radar. Central NC has some great riding and I picked up a used Gary Fisher Tassajara to cut my teeth on singletrack.</p>\n<p>Yet, hanging above the cash wrap in one of my local shops was a Yo Eddy! with that beautiful segmented fork dripping in Suntour XC components. That image has forever remained burned into my hippocampus like a cattle brand. The fork, the graphics, the big tires. It was unobtainable for a college student studying architecture, but it’s why I’m writing about this bike today.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/07/20220505_Schusler_TPC_0149.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/07/20220505_Schusler_TPC_0149.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/07/20220505_Schusler_TPC_0149.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/07/20220505_Schusler_TPC_0149.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/07/20220505_Schusler_TPC_0149.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/07/20220505_Schusler_TPC_0149.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/07/20220505_Schusler_TPC_0149.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/07/20220505_Schusler_TPC_0149.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Fast forward to 2022.

While the frame has some clever detailing, it’s the segmented fork—the first of its kind—that is the most recognizable feature of the Yo. According to the lore, Chris Chance wanted a more robust fork for his new bike model, the Yo Eddy!, and he wasn’t enamored with a unicrown fork for the build. His early Fat Chance bikes had a large box crown (which was not light and prone to breaking with heavy use) and he left Fat City HQ one Friday afternoon mulling over a new design. While he was away, the team stayed in house all weekend working on a new design.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-29.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-29.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-29.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-29.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-29.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-29.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-29.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-29.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-12.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-12.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-12.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-12.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-12.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-12.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-12.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-12.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>When he returned Monday, a prototype fork was ready for his eyes. Here’s where the history is blurry. Some people say this was Chris Igleheart’s work, while others credit it as a team effort. One thing is for certain: Whoever designed the segmented fork made the Yo one of the best-looking race machines of the 1990s. These segmented forks were topped with the iconic “Yo Eddy!” character, drawn by Mike Pappaconstantine, and tear-drop-shaped gussets lined the back of the fork, strengthening its blades for the rigors of NORBA racing.</p>\n<p>Yet, that wasn’t the only iconic frame detail found on the Yo…</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div><span>﻿</span><span>﻿</span></div>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Bullet Caps, aka Domes</h3>\n<p>Eagle-eye frame aficionados will be drawn to the Yo’s dropouts, where the chain and seat stays terminate. These terminations are shaped, like the tip of a bullet, hence the nickname “Bullet Caps,” or as Chris Chance calls them, “Domes.” Around the 35-second mark in the video above, you can see the process that Fat City Cycles used to create these unique profiles.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-87.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-87.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-87.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-87.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-87.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-87.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-87.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-87.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-25.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-25.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-25.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-25.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-25.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-25.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-25.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-25.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Continue watching and you can see where Chris explains the purpose of these oversized, thick chainstays and bullet caps: stiffness for racing acceleration.

At some point, the frame was sent back to Fat City Cycles for a touring package, along with Fat’s anti-chain suck device, the “tooth picks” added to the underside of the chainstays. These keep the chain from ripping up that beautiful paint behind the chainrings.</p>\n<p><em>Funny anecdote: while I was building up the frame, the chain fell off the inner ring and marred the fresh paint.

That means riders would dial in their fit by extending the seat post for proper leg extension and an appropriate stem length for the necessary reach and “racing fit.”</p>\n<p>Back then, you’d go to a dealer and try out various stem sizes before they’d order your bike. For obvious reasons, I didn’t have access to this method, so I improvised. I measured where my ideal reach was on a similar bike, took a photo of the Yo on wheels with my proper saddle height, scaled it, and drew some projections in CAD to determine I needed a 130mm stem.</p>\n<p>I ordered a 130mm Salsa stem off eBay and sent it to Rick at D&amp;D with the frame to paint it the same color. When it returned with the frame, I used NOS Suntour Rollercam pulleys for the stem and front derailleur pulleys. As for the stem and post extension, the fit is perfect for me, but I’ll admit it took me a little bit to get used to seeing all that exposed silver seat post!</p>\n<p>While discussing build details, let’s look at the parts kit.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/VintageMTBComponents-2.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/VintageMTBComponents-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/VintageMTBComponents-2.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/VintageMTBComponents-2.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/VintageMTBComponents-2.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/VintageMTBComponents-2.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/VintageMTBComponents-2.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/VintageMTBComponents-2.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>A 1990s Build Kit</h3>\n<p>Earlier this week, we looked at the build kit for this frame. I chose an early Suntour XC Pro group with a 7-speed freewheel. I could have gone 8-speed, but felt like since this was an early Yo frame, I’d go with early XC Pro. I’m a big fan of Suntour—its history, the minds behind the MTB line (which we’ll touch on later), and the fabled “Grease Guard” system.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-30.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-30.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-30.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-30.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-30.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-30.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-30.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-30.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-33.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-33.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-33.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-33.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-33.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-33.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-33.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-33.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>What is Grease Guard? It’s a brilliant design that allows the user to keep their components feeling fresh by injecting fresh grease into ports throughout the components and, by doing so, the old grease is forced out. Grease Guard was used in headsets, pedals, hubs, and bottom brackets. It’s such a genius design, but for some dumb reason (read: late capitalism), it died when Suntour shut its doors.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-60.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-60.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-60.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-60.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-60.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-60.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-60.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-60.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-17.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-17.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-17.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-17.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-17.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-17.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-17.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-17.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Although Suntour is no more, one component manufacturer I specced here is still thriving! I love Paul Components and wanted to incorporate some of <a href=\"https://www.paulcomp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Component Engineering</a>‘s vintage bits into this build. Here are Paul Stoplight cantilever brakes, the first gen Moon Unit cable yoke, and the first gen short pull levers, with the comfort pad intact!</p>\n<p>The most noticeable feature of the Stoplight brakes is the elegant arms, drilled out through a process called “drillium,” also known as “Swiss cheese” drillings. Then, have a look at those brake levers. The ends are elegantly bent, giving you a solid ergonomic grasp while pulling those cantis as hard as you can on a steep descent. I love how the comfort pads match the Grab On grips so well.

It seems 7 and 8-speed indexed shifting works great with 5mm housing.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-36.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-36.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-36.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-36.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-36.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-36.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-36.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-36.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-79.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-79.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-79.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-79.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-79.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-79.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-79.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-79.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>The handlebars are <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/fullmetalcycles/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Full Metal Cycles</a> repro bars, made to mimic Titec, Bontrager, or WTB titanium bars. I happened to be online on the Facebook boards when this last batch came out. I felt like it would add a bit of bling and personality to the build and since vintage bars were often chopped to unreasonable widths, it would save me the hassle of extending them. They also have a good deal of flex, which softens the stiff ride of the Yo Eddy! fork.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-45.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-45.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-45.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-45.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-45.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-45.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-45.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/04/1991-Fat-Chance-Team-Yo-Eddy-45.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>The last touch was an unexpected one.

I took the Yo on its first dirt ride Monday night after photographing it, and the Yo is worlds apart from my other vintage bikes. It’s stiff, has steep angles, and is ultralight. The complete, as shown, weighs 22 lbs on the nose. For an all-metal steed, that ain’t bad!</p>\n<p>What’s most noticeable about the Yo Eddy! compared to, say, my 1980 Ritchey is how the bike wants to be ridden at full tilt. It accelerates quickly and careens and glides around tight singletrack due to the steeper angles and shorter rear end. The steeper seat angle puts you further over the bottom bracket when the going gets steep and vertical. Overall, it’s clear the Yo is a racing machine, and even for someone who lives for the casual pedal, it’s fun to rip around on.</p>\n<p>I’m done spinning yarn, er rather, spinnin’ bullet stay caps about this bike; check out plenty of detailed photos in the gallery. I also wanted to thank everyone who helped out with this one! Martin from Second Spin, Rick at D&amp;D, Paul and Travis from Paul Component Engineering, and Bailey at Sincere Cycles for assisting me with the build.</p>\n<h3>Build List:</h3>\n<p>Frame: 1991 Fat Chance Yo Eddy SN# 864Y1L<br />\nFork: Fat Chance Yo Eddy<br />\nHeadset: Chris King Gripnut<br />\nStem: Salsa Motoroller<br />\nHandlebars: FMC Ti<br />\nGrips: Grab On MTN-2<br />\nBrake levers: Paul Short Pull<br />\nFront brake: Paul Stoplight<br />\nRear brake: Paul Stoplight<br />\nFront derailleur: SunTour XC Pro<br />\nRear derailleur: SunTour XC Pro<br />\nRims: Weinmann BCR1<br />\nHubs: SunTour XC Pro Grease Guard<br />\nSkewers: Ringle Holey Stix<br />\nFront tire: Ultradynamico Mars 2.22″<br />\nRear tire: Ultradynamico Mars 2.22″<br />\nSaddle: Selle Italia Turbo “Perforated”<br />\nSeatpost: Syncros Polished<br />\nSeat collar: DKG for Fat City (with NOS moisture seal)<br />\nPedals: Suntour XC Pro w/ Grease Guard<br />\nHousing: Nissen “Italian”<br />\nCage: Blackburn</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Got questions?
