Unfortunately, the fierce mandibles of termite soldiers cause injuries that, if infected, can turn fatal. Ants back at the nest rush to the injured and can tell which wounds are infected. They then secrete an antibiotic for them.</p>\n<p>An international team of researchers observed these ants closely and analyzed their antibiotic secretion. They found it can reduce mortality by about 90 percent in injured ants and that the ants can identify chemical changes that result from infected wounds, focusing treatment on those that need it most.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1996092#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1996092&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Elizabeth Rayne","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f6dff101e27121ae894dae714f76bac32a659c8d57c0c676d8767c17d3d4b431","category":"Tech"}
