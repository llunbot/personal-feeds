Did they die of asphyxiation, from the extreme heat, or from a combination of factors? A <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/earth-science/articles/10.3389/feart.2024.1386960/full\">new pape</a>r published in the journal Frontiers in Earth Science examines the complicating effects of earthquakes that occurred just prior to and concurrently with the eruption. Of most interest was the discovery of two skeletons of people who likely died when their shelter collapsed around them, weakened by the seismic tremors.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/10/archaeologists-find-evidence-of-neurons-in-glassy-brain-of-vesuvius-victim/\">previously reported</a>, the eruption of Mount Vesuvius released thermal energy roughly equivalent to 100,000 times the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War II, spewing molten rock, pumice, and hot ash over the cities of Pompeii and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herculaneum\">Herculaneum</a> in particular. Archaeologists believed that the vast majority of the victims died of asphyxiation, choking to death on the thick clouds of noxious gas and ash.</p>\n<p>However, <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/35071167\">a 2001 study</a> in Nature, co-authored by University of Naples archaeologist Pierpaolo Petrone, estimated a temperature of 500° Celsius (932° Fahrenheit) for the pyroclastic surge that destroyed Pompeii, sufficient to kill inhabitants in fractions of a second. In 2018, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/10/extreme-heat-of-vesuvius-eruption-vaporized-body-fluids-exploded-skulls/\">we reported</a> on Petrone's conclusion that inhabitants of Herculaneum may have suffered a similar fate. He observed fracturing in the bones of some 100 excavated skeletons, as well as \"cracking and explosion\" of the skullcaps, consistent with forensic cases where skulls burst from extreme heat.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037477#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037477&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c268e45545739540336b1ee1cc09b4863358d9e52da4121a7d79595d29789205","category":"Tech"}
