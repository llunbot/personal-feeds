During an exhibition at Sea Otter?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re as cool as <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/david-byrne-met-gala-2023/\">David Byrne</a>, you could always take it to the Met Gala — after buying your $50,000 ticket, of course. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After all, this special-edition bike from Colnago wants to embody the golden spiral trophy of the Giro d’Italia, the coveted <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/giro-ditalia-launches-nft-collectibles-details-a-bit-cryptic/\">Trofeo Senza Fine</a>. As the renowned race has entered its 106th edition this year, Colnago has made just 50 of these opulent bikes, which the company named the Colnago Gioiello, or “jewel” in Italian. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>So maybe also cruising around on an Italian Grand Tour now following the Giro?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Colnago Gioiello limited edition carbon road bike adorned in gold &amp; diamonds</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s the latest bike meant to “make the whole world appreciate and admire the Italian spirit,” Colnago said in a press release. “And that is exactly what happened with the latest bicycle we have created.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on the company’s existing C68 frame, the new model gets a gold leaf finish and frequent accents of Colnago’s signature ace of clubs symbol.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other details that “ennoble” the Colnago Gioiello include a gear cage with 3D-printed oversize pulleys in titanium. Caps on the bar ends and through-axles get gold leaf as well. The spokes of the hand-assembled wheels? Also gold. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Colnago-Gioiello-gold.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Colnago-Gioiello-gold-800x533.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Colnago-Gioiello-gold-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Colnago-Gioiello-gold-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Colnago-Gioiello-gold-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Colnago-Gioiello-gold-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Colnago-Gioiello-gold-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Colnago-Gioiello-gold.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Most important of all, however? The bottle cage…in gold. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Finally, the element that links most directly with the Trofeo Senza Fine is the 3D printed bottle cage, also covered in gold leaf, which incorporates the spirals of the <a href=\"https://pezcyclingnews.com/features/giro23-a-bit-of-la-corsa-rosa-history/\" target=\"_blank\">Corsa Rosa</a> symbol.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh yeah, we think there’s a diamond in the headset cap, too… because why not?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The strictly limited Colnago Gioiello costs €22,000… or about $24,000, according to the company announcement. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.colnago.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Colnago.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/golden-colnago-gioiello-giro-ditalia/\">Italian Bling: Golden LTD Colnago Gioiello Celebrates 106th Giro d’Italia</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Andrew McLemore","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"ac94aaa17e6b8f802212d594cfad1ddf2d9ae9a140dcd8f8b8e5eefefca308a9","category":"Cycling"}
