The constraints will impact ‌iPhone‌ and ‌iPad‌ sales in particular.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIt is not clear if these predicted supply constraints will affect the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a> models that are expected to launch in September.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple CEO <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a> was asked whether the supply constraints will continue into the holiday quarter, but Cook said that he doesn't want to predict that. \"We're going to take it one quarter at a time,\" he said. \"We will do everything we can to mitigate whatever set of circumstances we're dealt.\" Cook went on to say that the constraints that Apple is seeing are the same constraints that are impacting other companies as well.<blockquote>The majority of the constraints are of the variety that others are seeing. I would classify it as industry shortage. We do have some shortages in addition to that where the demand has been so great and so beyond our own expectation that it's difficult to get the entire set of parts within the lead times that we try to get those. It's a little bit of that as well. As I said before, the latest nodes, which we use in several of our products, have not been as much of an issue. The legacy nodes are where the supply constraints have been, on silicon.</blockquote>Cook also said that though Apple is expecting supply constraints, component costs in the aggregate have declined, but Apple is currently paying out more for freight than it would like.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/earnings/\">earnings</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/27/iphone-ipad-supply-constraints-september-quarter/\">Apple Expecting iPhone and iPad Supply Constraints in September Quarter</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-expecting-iphone-and-ipad-supply-constraints-in-september-quarter.2305718/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=RUdMb1IXU28:B5lywK_jjTY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=RUdMb1IXU28:B5lywK_jjTY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/RUdMb1IXU28\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c35cf551d957fa6c306341f2b10ac17368c794d1b6630113cfdd24a6c88e4e35","category":"Apple"}
