But years of Pi shortages made me worried about its scarcity, and I figured I'd buy first and ask questions later rather than want it later and be totally unable to get one. In the end, it will probably knock each of my other Pis down a level in my tech setup: the Pi 5 becomes the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/building-a-retro-gaming-super-console-with-100-and-a-raspberry-pi-2022-edition/\">retro emulation box</a>, the Pi 4 becomes the multi-use always-on light-duty server (currently running a combo of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/how-i-saved-money-on-homekit-smartbulbs-with-philips-wiz-and-a-raspberry-pi/\">HomeBridge</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pivpn.io/\">WireGuard</a>, and a dynamic DNS IP address updater), the Pi 3B+ joins the Pi 3B as either \"test hardware for small one-off projects\" or \"the retro emulation box I lent to a friend which may or may not have been ruined when their basement flooded.\"</p>\n<p>Before I did that, though, I wanted to take another crack at trying to use a Pi as an everyday general-purpose desktop computer. The Raspberry Pi's operating system has always included many of the tools you'd need to take a crack at this, including a lightweight desktop environment and a couple of web browser options, and the <a href=\"https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-400/\">Pi 4-based Pi 400 variant</a> has always been pitched specifically as a general-purpose computer.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1986894#p3\">Read 35 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1986894&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c6ac385180ea21188f2628cc84750472a306d72078db0a31572d8e6289a4608d","category":"Tech"}
