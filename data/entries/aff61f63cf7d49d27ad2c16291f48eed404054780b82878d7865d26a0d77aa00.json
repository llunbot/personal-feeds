But for roadies, there’s no denying the benefits, and few brands are pushing the concept as hard (or for as long) as Parcours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve ever wondered how tire size and rim profiles affect aerodynamics, this episode is for you! My guest is Dov Tate, founder of <a href=\"https://www.parcours.cc\" target=\"_blank\">Parcours Wheels</a>, a UK brand that’s been pushing the envelope on wider rims optimized around wider tires.</p>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n<p>The story of how he got to that point, from putting 360º wind sensors low on the bike to intentionally doing wind tunnel tests <em>without</em> a bike frame attached to the wheels, is really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/dov-tate-parcours-wheels-interview-about-wide-aero-rims.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/dov-tate-parcours-wheels-interview-about-wide-aero-rims.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/dov-tate-parcours-wheels-interview-about-wide-aero-rims.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/dov-tate-parcours-wheels-interview-about-wide-aero-rims-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/dov-tate-parcours-wheels-interview-about-wide-aero-rims-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/dov-tate-parcours-wheels-interview-about-wide-aero-rims-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/dov-tate-parcours-wheels-interview-about-wide-aero-rims-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/dov-tate-parcours-wheels-interview-about-wide-aero-rims-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/dov-tate-parcours-wheels-interview-about-wide-aero-rims-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We dive pretty deep on leading edge, trailing edge, optimizing for gravel tires, and a whole lot more, with stories about how he’s built his company mixed in for the entrepreneurs among us.There’s even talk about some new wheels (like the first-ever <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/classified-races-triathlon-time-trials-with-parcours-powershift-2x-disc-tt-wheel/\" target=\"_blank\">full disc wheel with the Classified internally geared hub</a>) and where they might be headed with future product development.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>This episode sponsored by:</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"1000\" height=\"210\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/TPC-logo-tpc-green-large-1000px.png\" alt=\"TPC logo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/TPC-logo-tpc-green-large-1000px.png 1000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/TPC-logo-tpc-green-large-1000px-297x62.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/TPC-logo-tpc-green-large-1000px-800x168.png 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/TPC-logo-tpc-green-large-1000px-120x25.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/TPC-logo-tpc-green-large-1000px-768x161.png 768w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Spring is the perfect time to upgrade your ride.
