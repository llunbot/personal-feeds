It features an aluminum frame, mullet MX wheelsize combo, and Bosch’s recently upgraded Performance Line CX motor, i.e. boosted to 750 Watts of power and 100Nm of torque. Going forward, Nicolai’s Swift series of eMTBs will all feature Bosch drive systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Nicolai S18 SWIFT long-travel, full-power super enduro eMTB </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-side.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"681\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-side.webp\" alt=\"Nicolai S18 SWIFT eMTB, drive side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-side.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-side-297x169.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-side-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-side-768x436.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Nicolai builds the S18 Swift’s frame out of their preferred hydroformed 7020-T6 aluminum. They claim this grade of alloy offers 30% greater tensile strength and 20% more elasticity than conventional 6061 aluminum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nicolai covers their frames with a five-year warranty against manufacturing or material defects.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>S18 Swift – Key Specs and Frame Features</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-linkage.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-linkage.webp\" alt=\"Nicolai S18 SWIFT eMTB, linkage\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-linkage.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-linkage-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-linkage-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-linkage-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-linkage-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-linkage-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This beastly eMTB offers 180mm of rear travel, controlled by a Horst link 4-bar suspension linkage rotating on double-sealed Enduro bearings. Nicolai specs 180mm forks stock on the complete model, but says the frame can run a 190mm fork for those looking to go bigger. I didn’t see explicit mention of the words ‘dual crown’ anywhere, but they do say up to 40mm stanchions are OK on this frame… and we know what that means.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suspension-wise, Nicolai refined the S18 Swift’s anti-squat to maximize traction and efficiency for climbing, but the linkage allows for fully active suspension while descending. A variable progression rate offers initial sensitivity, a supportive mid-stroke, and strong bottom-out resistance. The eMTB really wants to fly downhill.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The single complete S18 Swift built that Nicolai offers comes on a set of MX wheels. But full 29” setups are also possible, even though geometry will change between the two different rear wheel configurations.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-seat-mast.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-seat-mast.webp\" alt=\"Nicolai S18 SWIFT eMTB, seat mast\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-seat-mast.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-seat-mast-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-seat-mast-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-seat-mast-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-seat-mast-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-seat-mast-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The S18 Swift frame is designed with a full-length straight seattube for long travel 30.9mm dropper post compatibility. Small frames can run up to 160mm posts, L &amp; XLs can run up to 250mm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The frame runs a Boost 148mm rear axle, offers SRAM UDH dropouts, and allows ample clearance for up to 2.5” tires (27.5 or 29”). Other finishing touches include internal cable routing, and water bottle/accessory mounts on the downtube and underside of toptube.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Boosted Bosch CX Drive System</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-Bosch-motor.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-Bosch-motor.webp\" alt=\"Nicolai S18 SWIFT eMTB, Bosch motor\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-Bosch-motor.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-Bosch-motor-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-Bosch-motor-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-Bosch-motor-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-Bosch-motor-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-Bosch-motor-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The S18 Swift is assisted by the latest and most powerful Bosch Performance Line CX motor available, now offering 750W peak power and 100Nm of torque with a recent firmware update. The S18 Swift comes set up with four assist modes: ECO+, TOUR+, EMTB+, and TURBO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Supplying power is Bosch’s PowerTube 600Wh internal battery. To keep the frame leaner, Nicolai went with an enclosed battery rather than including an easy removal mechanism. You’ll have to charge this battery while inside the bike. And if you’re looking for more range, Bosch’s PowerMore 250Wh range extender is also available from Nicolai, or in the aftermarket.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-display-remote.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-display-remote.webp\" alt=\"Nicolai S18 SWIFT eMTB, display and remote control\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-display-remote.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-display-remote-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-display-remote-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-display-remote-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-display-remote-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-display-remote-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Bosch KIOX 400C display unit now integrates directly into the S18’s top tube, showing you all your key ride info in vivid full color. And its mini remote provides compact, ergonomic handlebar-mounted controls. As usual for Bosch, their eBike Flow app can be used for fine tuning or customization of the drive system.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Stock Mullet or Optional Full 29er Geometry</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>MX Geo:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-MX-geometry.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"538\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-MX-geometry.webp\" alt=\"Nicolai S18 SWIFT eMTB, MX geometry\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-MX-geometry.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-MX-geometry-297x133.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-MX-geometry-120x54.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-MX-geometry-768x344.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption><em>*NOTE – There is a slight error in one of these charts. The seat angles must be incorrect, as they are shown the same across the MX chart, but vary by frame size on the 29er chart.</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to Nicolai’s Geolution Trail design, there are lots of variations in geometry between frame sizes. You’ll notice slight changes in head tube angles, for example. This is because Nicolai has optimized each frame to ensure the rider’s weight distribution, handling, and bike response remains consistent across the size range. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nicolai has also found a ratio between reach and stack numbers to help ensure a proportionally tuned ride for everyone. Frames are available in five sizes from S to XXL, covering riders from roughly 5’3” to 6’11”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steering is slack, varying from 63.5° to 64.5° on the complete MX bikes and coming in a tad steeper on 29er setups. Across all possible sizes and configurations, seat mast angles range from 77.8° to 78.8°.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reach numbers are on the lengthy side, with a medium MX build coming in at 475mm, and a large at 497.5mm. Nicolai offers four different chainstay lengths across five frame sizes, ranging on MX models from 440mm to 462mm (S and M share the same). One other thing to note is that standover height ranges a fair bit across the five sizes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>29″ Geo:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-29-geometry.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"536\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-29-geometry.webp\" alt=\"Nicolai S18 SWIFT eMTB, 29&quot; geometry\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-29-geometry.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-29-geometry-297x133.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-29-geometry-120x54.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-29-geometry-768x343.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, there are two different geometries for MX and full 29” wheel setups, since they share the same frameset.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Nicolai S18 eMTB: Stock MX Build &amp; Options</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-front-angle.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-front-angle.webp\" alt=\"Nicolai S18 SWIFT eMTB, front angle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-front-angle.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-front-angle-297x180.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-front-angle-120x73.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-front-angle-768x466.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Nicolai offers one stock build of the S18 Swift. See Nicolai’s website for an (almost) complete list of the stock components… but here’s a rundown of the key parts</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The complete S18 Swift gets a Fox Factory suspension package, with a 38 Grip X2 fork and a custom-tuned Float X2 two-position rear shock. Drivetrain went with SRAM GX AXS Eagle, including 160mm GX crankarms.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-brake.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-brake.webp\" alt=\"Nicolai S18 SWIFT eMTB, Magura brake\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-brake.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-brake-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-brake-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-brake-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-brake-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-brake-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Magura’s MT7 Pro HC brakes with 220/203mm rotors handle stopping duties, which also allows for a possible Bosch ABS Pro upgrade if you want anti-lock brakes suitable to a performance gravity ebike like this. The S18 Swift rolls on a DT Swiss HX1501 mullet wheelset, wrapped with 2.4” wide Continental Kryptotal tires. BikeYoke provides their Divine dropper posts (travel numbers by frame size are not listed). <strong> </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A size medium complete bike weighs 23.7kg (52.24lb). MSRP starts at 11,000€ for the stock build with no optional add-ons.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-pink.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"684\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-pink.webp\" alt=\"Nicolai S18 SWIFT eMTB, pink\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-pink.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-pink-297x169.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-pink-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-pink-768x438.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For no extra charge, frames are available in Factory Raw or Texture Black. For an extra 400€ though, you can request a custom powder-coated color from over 50 available options. Furthermore, Nicolai’s website says “A separate color is possible for each welded frame component”! Buyers can even choose different anodized colors for their rocker arms and other milled frame components (e.g. bearing caps and cable clips).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Custom component options or even complete custom builds are also available, apparently. But info on their website about these custom options is scant… There’s just a link to send questions to Nicolai.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-jump.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-jump.webp\" alt=\"Nicolai S18 SWIFT eMTB, jump pic\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-jump.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-jump-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-jump-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-jump-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-jump-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Nicolai-S18-SWIFT-jump-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption><em>(All photos / Nicolai)</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Nicolai also says they offer an S18 Swift frame kit. But it is currently not shown online. And there’s no pricing or info available about what parts are included, so you’ll just have to ask. Likely it will be in a similar range to the 6300€ S14 Swift framekit with a Bosch SX motor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.nicolai-bicycles.com/s18-swift-bike-en\" target=\"_blank\">Nicolai-bicycles.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/the-2025-nicolai-s18-swift-emtb-is-a-powerful-long-travel-self-shuttle-rig/\">The 2025 Nicolai S18 SWIFT eMTB is a Powerful, Long-Travel Self-Shuttle Rig</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Steve Fisher","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"89aab28c151c58d491e2c913782045395b66ab5564c54e3c2f51498c3e6382d1","category":"Cycling"}
