Naturally, this means more riders are looking to mount their phone to a bike.</p>\n<p>While the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-computers/\">best bike computers</a> put everything you could possibly want in a compact, bike-specific package, some riders prefer a smartphone – especially for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/whats-the-best-bike-for-commuting/\">commuting bikes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-hybrid-bikes/\">hybrid bikes</a>.</p>\n<p>There are pros and cons to both. A dedicated bike computer won’t drain your phone’s battery, is designed specifically for the job in hand and offers connectivity (typically both ANT+ and Bluetooth) to a wide range of accessories.</p>\n<p>Using a smartphone, on the other hand, means you don’t have to splash out on a separate device and normally offers a user-friendly interface. Plus there’s a growing number of apps and, generally speaking, you’ve always got your phone on you for quick trips by bike, so it’s a popular choice for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/cycling-to-work-guide/\">cycling to work</a>.</p>\n<p>If you do use your phone on a bike, you’ll want to make sure it’s securely mounted.

We tested the basic stem mount (which can also be fitted to a handlebar) and snap-case combo, but you can select from the two out-front mounts to suit and build your kit from there.</p>\n<p>The case is sleek, even with the mount on the back, meaning we just left it on even when not riding. The stem mount we tried attaches securely using rubber O-rings. Once in place it doesn’t move, with a push-and-twist locking system that’s smooth to use. To release, pull down the retaining ring and twist – even though the lock is firm, it’s an easy operation.</p>\n<p>With its high-quality construction and a kit system that allows you to buy only the parts you need, the Quad Lock feels worth its relatively high price.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Birzman Zyklop Navigator III</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Birzman Zyklop Navigator III is easy to fit and easy to use.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Price:</strong> £20 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Weight:</strong> 78g</li>\n<li><strong>Included:</strong> Top tube-mounted bag</li>\n<li><strong>Optional extras:</strong> None</li>\n</ul><p>The Zyklop Navigator doesn’t look as stylish as some of the other options on test, but as with the other bag/holder models it’s very practical.</p>\n<p>The padded bag sits on the top tube, attaching around that and the stem with Velcro straps.

The phone goes into its holder easily, but because it isn’t held firmly against the cover, reflection from the plastic can sometimes make it hard to see the screen.</p>\n<p>Also, the touchscreen connection isn’t always spot-on.

An advantage of this is that you don’t need to shell out for a separate bike computer.</p>\n<p>Most bicycle phone mounts are small plastic brackets that you attach to your bike and then clip your phone into. Some are transparent pockets which are part of bags you can strap to your frame, and also use for storage. Either way, they need to provide a sturdy way to carry your phone on your bike and protect it from the elements, while also allowing you to use it.</p>\n<h3>Case + mount</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This case-type mount from Quad Lock achieves a clean, secure look for mounting your smartphone.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jamie Beach / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Bike phone cases tend to be for stem or handlebar mounts, and they’re usually variations on a similar theme: your phone is held in a case that is specific to the size and model of your phone, which can then be clipped securely into a small plastic block on your handlebar or stem. The case may or may not be waterproof.</p>\n<p>These sorts of mounts, generally speaking, will allow you to align your phone in either portrait or landscape orientation. Although for the sake of keeping it out of the way of errant knees, it’s best to use portrait orientation if the phone is mounted on the stem.</p>\n<h3>Universal bracket</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> This universal phone mount from Olixar is a good bet if your phone is an unusual shape or size.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oli Woodman / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n</div>\n<p>These are similar to the above mounts, but they don’t rely on a dedicated case to put your phone into. Instead, they use a universal mount that attaches to your handlebars or stem, and will grip practically any phone even if it’s already in a protective case.</p>\n<p>The obvious advantage is that you don’t need to buy a new mount when you change phones (and you can lend it to people), but therein lies its disadvantage, too: we reckon they’re a lot less secure.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Frame bag</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Your phone goes into the front bit, behind a touchscreen-compatible plastic screen.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Reuben Bakker-Dyos / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>If you’d rather keep the real estate on your bar clear, then carrying your phone in a frame bag is the alternative. A phone frame bag sits on your top tube, just behind the head tube. As well as providing some storage space, this will also have a transparent sleeve for your phone to slide into.</p>\n<p>The key consideration is whether the transparent window provides sufficient protection from the elements while also allowing you to operate the phone’s touchscreen.</p>\n<p>The major downside of this option is that you have to look/reach down further than you would if your phone were mounted on your bar. So if you can’t hear the audio alerts, the frame-bag option may be more suitable for riders who are willing to stop when they want to use their phones.</p>\n<h2>Check the compatibility of your bike phone mount</h2>\n<p>The deciding factor on which mount you end up choosing will ultimately be which one works with your phone. Most mounts come in various sizes and guises to accommodate as many varieties of phone as possible, but double-check before you plough ahead with your purchase.</p>\n<p>On a similar note, if you’re on a contract and are likely to change/upgrade the model soon, it may be worth holding off until you know what model you’ll be switching to. There’s no point buying a phone-specific mount for a model you won’t be using in a few weeks.</p>","author":"BikeRadar","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"5aba75f7b8de8cdf6722b0c1cf0b04de191f0e30e0836340ca55a15b7586162d","category":"Cycling"}
