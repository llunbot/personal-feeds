Today’s deal fixes that: <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.costco.com/mac-mini-%E2%80%93-apple-m2-pro-chip-10-core-cpu,-16-core-gpu-%E2%80%93-16gb-memory-%E2%80%93-512gb-ssd-%E2%80%93-silver.product.100943080.html&amp;xcust=1-1-1788881-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Costco is selling the M2 Pro Mac mini with 512GB of storage for $1,100</a>, a massive savings of $199 and the best price we’ve seen so far. If you’d rather get the M2 model, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Desktop-Computer-10%E2%80%91core-Ethernet/dp/B0BSHGHGXR/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Amazon has the 256GB model for $500</a> ($99 off) or <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Desktop-Computer-10%E2%80%91core-Ethernet/dp/B0BSHGTPMV/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">the 512GB model for $690</a> ($109 off), matching the best prices we’ve ever seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The M2 Pro Mac mini is an impressive upgrade to the entry-level model, bringing a faster chip, twice as much storage (512GB vs 256GB), and double the RAM (16GB vs 8GB). It also has two additional Thunderbolt 4 ports for a total of four and support for up to three displays, versus two with the M2 model. And all of that is packed into an incredibly small case that can fit wherever you need it to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1480091/mac-mini-m2-pro-review.html\">4-star review</a>, we called the M2 Pro Mac mini “a worthy successor to the aging Intel-based Mac mini” but lamented its high price. This discount wipes away that criticism and then some, so if you’ve had your eye on one, go grab it right now.</p>\n\nMac Mini</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"48e2402fe89b97137919f7b2e6caf04d09850555f29776d706ab95a451e10e0c","category":"Apple"}
