Some stores may play the video on Macs and televisions within the store, but Apple no longer holds official watch parties for its keynotes.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"e3e9e27ce40d207bf8e63b14c2f801b439ac55a82ede60936333c0302bd60ff1","category":"Apple"}
