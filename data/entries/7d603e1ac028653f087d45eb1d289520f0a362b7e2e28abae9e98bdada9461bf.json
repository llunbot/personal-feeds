Going forward, iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, and visionOS will be identified by year, rather than by version number. We're not going to be getting iOS 19, we're getting <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/\">iOS 26</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/iOS-26-Mock-Rainbow-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\n‌iOS 26‌ will be accompanied by iPadOS 26, macOS 26, tvOS 26, watchOS 26, and visionOS 26 instead of iPadOS 19, macOS 16, tvOS 19, watchOS 12, and visionOS 3.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nChanging the name of the operating systems will introduce consistency across the lineup, rather than having several disparate numbers that don't match up. Apple is using vehicle-style numbering for operating systems and choosing the number of the upcoming year, so it'll be ‌iOS 26‌ instead of iOS 25 because the update will be available across both 2025 and 2026.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe names will reflect a new effort by Apple to provide a more unified design across operating systems on different devices. The refreshed visionOS-like design update is coming to iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple plans to announce the new naming scheme at the Worldwide Developers Conference that's set to begin on Monday, June 9.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/28/apple-ios-26/\">No iOS 19: Apple Going Straight to iOS 26</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/no-ios-19-apple-going-straight-to-ios-26.2457838/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7d603e1ac028653f087d45eb1d289520f0a362b7e2e28abae9e98bdada9461bf","category":"Apple"}
