Android users will now see a dedicated games row and games tab in the Netflix app, and will be able to select games to download and play.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIt's not clear how the iOS version of the app will work. Netflix can have a \"catalog\" app like its main Netflix app (or a separate Games app) that lists gaming titles, linking out to games that can be downloaded from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>. Alternatively, Netflix can use a web-based solution, but games would need to be streaming titles.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nNetflix says that it will continue to improve the mobile gaming experience in the coming months, but there is no word yet on when Netflix's games will come to iOS devices.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/netflix/\">Netflix</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/02/netflix-games-launch-android/\">Netflix Taking on Apple Arcade With Official Games Launch on Android</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/netflix-taking-on-apple-arcade-with-official-games-launch-on-android.2321441/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=nQdmOFy_mHE:1boSWNmOyuo:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=nQdmOFy_mHE:1boSWNmOyuo:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/nQdmOFy_mHE\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c8925be057537d8737d1be6ba4e664736698c614383ea73891eb506bcca7a77f","category":"Apple"}
