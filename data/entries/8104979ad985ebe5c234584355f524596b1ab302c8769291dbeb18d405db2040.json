Starting in October, the ad-free tier of Disney+ will rise from $11 to $14 a month, while ad-free Hulu will increase from $14 to $18 a month. Both services will also be offered together for $20 a month, and the ad-supported tiers will maintain their current pricing; both strategies seem intended to drive viewers to either sign up for multiple services or drop down to an ad-supported tier.</p>\n<p>This is the <em>second</em> price hike for both services in the last calendar year, and most subscription services have been doing the same thing recently. Here are the big-name video streaming services that have increased their prices in the last 12 months (not counting bundles or other discounts or add-ons, all prices monthly):</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>Netflix</th>\n<th>Hulu</th>\n<th>(HBO) Max</th>\n<th>Disney+</th>\n<th>Amazon Prime Video</th>\n<th>Apple TV+</th>\n<th>Paramount+</th>\n<th>Peacock</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Ad-free (before)</th>\n<td>$13.99</td>\n<td>$12.99</td>\n<td>$14.99</td>\n<td>$7.99</td>\n<td>$8.99 standalone, $12.99 with Prime</td>\n<td>$4.99</td>\n<td>$9.99</td>\n<td>$9.99</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Ad-free (after)</th>\n<td>$15.49</td>\n<td>$17.99</td>\n<td>$15.99</td>\n<td>$13.99</td>\n<td>$8.99 standalone, $14.99 with Prime</td>\n<td>$6.99</td>\n<td>$11.99</td>\n<td>$11.99</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>With ads (before)</th>\n<td>N/A (launched November 2022)</td>\n<td>$6.99</td>\n<td>$9.99</td>\n<td>N/A (launched December 2022)</td>\n<td>N/A, but \"<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/7/23752686/amazon-prime-video-ad-supported-tier-rumors\">in talks</a>\"</td>\n<td>N/A, but <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/24/23614183/apple-tv-plus-ads-ad-supportied-tier-hire\">hiring personnel</a></td>\n<td>$4.99</td>\n<td>$4.99</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>With ads (after)</th>\n<td>$6.99</td>\n<td>$7.99</td>\n<td>$9.99</td>\n<td>$7.99</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n<td>$5.99</td>\n<td>$5.99</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>And that's just capturing price increases from the last year or so; many of these services have increased prices steadily over the last two or three years, as subscriber growth has <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/07/netflix-bleeds-subscribers-in-us-and-canada-with-no-sign-of-recovery/\">slowed or declined</a>. If you pay for more than a couple of these services (and especially if you pay for music, games, or other software on top of your streaming apps), your prices have either gone up a lot in the last year, or you've decided to let TV advertising back into your life.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1960033#p3\">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1960033&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8104979ad985ebe5c234584355f524596b1ab302c8769291dbeb18d405db2040","category":"Tech"}
