The mall is located in Tysons, Virginia, a Washington, D.C. suburb.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/Apple-Tysons-Corner-2001.jpeg\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" /><div><em>Apple Tysons Corner in 2001</em></div>\r<br />\nSteeber said the following message was posted on a temporary wall at a new location in the mall:<blockquote>The first-ever Apple Store opened 22 years ago here at Tysons Corner. Soon we look forward to welcoming you to this newly reimagined space. Thank you for being part of our story. Here's to the next chapter.</blockquote>Apple has yet to announce a grand opening date for the new location, and the current store remains open for now. On the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/retail/tysonscorner/\">store's page</a>, Apple teases that \"a new chapter is coming soon,\" without providing any further details. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn what has become an iconic video, Steve Jobs conducted a tour of Apple Tysons Corner, unveiling the Genius Bar and more. The store opened to the public on May 19, 2001, just a few hours before Apple Glendale Galleria opened its doors in Glendale, California. The two locations welcomed over 7,700 people and sold a combined total of $599,000 of merchandise through the first weekend of operations, according to Apple.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nSteeber said the new store's opening will be significant:<blockquote>It goes without saying that this opening will be significant because it's the first time the first Apple Store has ever moved. But this opening will be much more than that â€” trust me. Tysons Corner is where it all began.</blockquote>The existing storefront had already received a facelift in the 2000s, losing its iconic black facade with two backlit Apple logos on each side of the entrance.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple now operates 525 stores around the world.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/\">Apple Store</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/01/apple-tysons-corner-relocating/\">Apple's First-Ever Store Moving to New Location: 'A New Chapter is Coming Soon'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-first-ever-store-moving-to-new-location-a-new-chapter-is-coming-soon.2388338/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3149e24b39ebebb494f4bdfc92b10803ba9ed658a15b002355b4d50fd7b53c81","category":"Apple"}
