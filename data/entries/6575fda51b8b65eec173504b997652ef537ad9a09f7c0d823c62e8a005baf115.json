More tires + more miles has a way of accelerating erosion, especially in certain regions where the soil composition tends to wear away quickly. If you’re lucky, your favorite trails will be routinely maintained by an army of paid, or more likely, volunteer trail workers. But even then, it can be tough to keep up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what’s the answer to more sustainable mountain bike trails? As Seth from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@BermPeakExpress\" target=\"_blank\">Berm Peak Express</a> points out in one of his latest videos, the answer could be paving the trails. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That will sound like blasphemy to many MTB ‘purists’, but for heavily trafficked trails like some in Bentonville, AR, it makes a lot of sense. Though there are a few other ways to make trails more sustainable short of paving them. </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/are-paved-trails-the-future-of-sustainable-mountain-biking/\">Are Paved Trails the Future of Sustainable Mountain Biking?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"6575fda51b8b65eec173504b997652ef537ad9a09f7c0d823c62e8a005baf115","category":"Cycling"}
