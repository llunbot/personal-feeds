A test of your own personal limits that strips you back to your most basic self. I’ve had a privileged upbringing and more opportunities than anyone could hope for. I still choose the bike. The bike brings me freedoms and joy that I’ve yet to find anywhere else in my life. During The Alt Tour, in my deepest holes, I wasn’t alone. I could draw on the idea that with each pedal stroke I was sharing that freedom and joy with someone who hadn’t yet had the opportunity to experience riding. I could smile at the endless possibilities that a bike could bring them. In many ways, World Bicycle Relief helped me achieve my goals as much as they helped bring the beauty of the bicycle to so many. And for both those reasons, I’m forever grateful.</em>”</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12131726/Win-Lachlan-Morton-Alt-Tour-Cannondale-SuperSix-EVO-road-bike-to-support-World-Bicycle-Relief_photo-by-Rapha-WBR.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12131726/Win-Lachlan-Morton-Alt-Tour-Cannondale-SuperSix-EVO-road-bike-to-support-World-Bicycle-Relief_photo-by-Rapha-WBR.jpg\" alt=\"Win Lachlan Morton Alt Tour Cannondale SuperSix EVO road bike to support World Bicycle Relief, WBR\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1500\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12131726/Win-Lachlan-Morton-Alt-Tour-Cannondale-SuperSix-EVO-road-bike-to-support-World-Bicycle-Relief_photo-by-Rapha-WBR.jpg 1500w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12131726/Win-Lachlan-Morton-Alt-Tour-Cannondale-SuperSix-EVO-road-bike-to-support-World-Bicycle-Relief_photo-by-Rapha-WBR-297x297.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12131726/Win-Lachlan-Morton-Alt-Tour-Cannondale-SuperSix-EVO-road-bike-to-support-World-Bicycle-Relief_photo-by-Rapha-WBR-800x800.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12131726/Win-Lachlan-Morton-Alt-Tour-Cannondale-SuperSix-EVO-road-bike-to-support-World-Bicycle-Relief_photo-by-Rapha-WBR-120x120.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12131726/Win-Lachlan-Morton-Alt-Tour-Cannondale-SuperSix-EVO-road-bike-to-support-World-Bicycle-Relief_photo-by-Rapha-WBR-768x768.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/12131726/Win-Lachlan-Morton-Alt-Tour-Cannondale-SuperSix-EVO-road-bike-to-support-World-Bicycle-Relief_photo-by-Rapha-WBR-125x125.jpg 125w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\"></a></p><p>Allison Dufosee, CEO, World Bicycle Relief UK, said: “<em>It is difficult to verbalise the effect of Lachlan’s Alt Tour for World Bicycle Relief – it seems as though we are seeing the effects of his incredible efforts build on a weekly basis, which has a significant impact upon the work that we can do to bring bicycles to people who need them throughout the world. To date, the Alt Tour has raised some £521,000, with donations coming in from more than sixty countries – it has been a truly global effort.

He reminded us there’s more than one way to tour France in July, and I hope more people explore their worlds by bike no matter where they find themselves. Beyond Lachlan’s adventure, his effort raised half a million pounds — enough to donate 4,245 bicycles to those who need them to gain better access to education. At EF, we believe that education and understanding can help solve many of the world’s problems, and we’re so proud of Lachlan and honored to help empower people with access to education. Thanks to Lachy for reminding us that the bike isn’t only a tool to explore, but also one to better humanity.</em>”</p></section></article></div></div>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"d18208c94d1c93939680d16f7f7d36cad1fd90ff59f098b94a450e2cde5ce58d","category":"Cycling"}
