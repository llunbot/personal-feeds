Sony and Honda teamed up for the Afeela, a $90k car with a futuristic design and a whole glut of screens inside, plus a built-in gaming system. It's an EV that can go up to 300 miles, and it has some autonomous driving features.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs for more traditional tech, the Displace is a truly wireless TV that can run off of batteries, so it technically doesn't need to be plugged in except when it's charging. It comes in 27-inch and 55-inch models, and has an OLED display. There are attachments for HDMI inputs, a browser for watching any internet-based content, and apps, and it can apparently be mounted in 10 seconds using an active suction system.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPricing starts at $2,499. While there's a 10,000mAh battery and extra battery accessories available, Displace didn't share details on how long the battery lasts in the standard models. The company's website suggests that the more expensive Pro model lasts for up to 60 hours when included speakers and soundbar are attached.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOther highlights from the show floor so far included the tri-fold ultra portable projector from Aurzen, multi-camera bird feeder from Birdfy, a couple of robot lawnmowers, and the Hypershell Exoskeleton.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDan will be checking out more products today, so make sure to stay tuned to see tomorrow's CES roundup video.
