{"title":"Gurman Reports Apple Is (Finally) Breaking Passwords Into a Standalone App for the Mac and iOS","link":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-06/apple-to-debut-passwords-app-in-challenge-to-1password-lastpass","date":1717711080000,"content":"\n<p>Mark Gurman:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple Inc. will introduce a new homegrown app next week called\nPasswords, aiming to make it easier for customers to log in to\nwebsites and software, according to people with knowledge of\nthe matter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This isn’t an all-new app, but rather it’s breaking the Passwords panel out of the Settings app sidebar and into its own proper standalone app. I’ll bet Apple introduces new features, too, but Gurman doesn’t describe any. The Passwords panel in Settings, including the system-wide integrations with Safari and WebKit, already has the scope and breadth of an app. I’ve personally been all-in for many years on using iCloud for my own passwords, authentication codes, and now passkeys. For me it’s proven robust and trustworthy.</p>\n\n<p>Making Passwords its own proper app is overdue, though. Apple tries to manage a good balance with how many standalone apps ships as part of the system on iOS. On the Mac, there’s an easier split: Apple puts a dozen or so of the system’s most-used apps in the Dock by default, and puts 46 apps in the Applications folder, and another 18 nerdier apps in the Utilities sub-folder within Applications. On iOS Apple puts some of its own apps within folders, but that still adds to the visual complexity of the default home screens. Password management is so important, and Apple’s own system is so good, that it deserves more prominence. Making Passwords its own app won’t just make it more discoverable, it will (correctly) set the perception that Apple Passwords is a serious personal security management tool that users should considering adopting.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/06/gurman-passwords-app\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b14fb6e4d75cee776edfeee0b79f9c24808699c7ceff81f0586c047d477b0754","category":"Tech"}
