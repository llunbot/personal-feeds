over a decade and one of my biggest qualms with them is how you’ll buy a brand new basket from your local shop and if you’re not paying attention closely, you’ll end up buying one with a busted weld. Usually, these broken welds are where the side members attach to the top rim of the basket. Or you’ll bump it into a sign post or tree and the rack’s welds will break.</p>\n<p>From then on, it’s nothing but rattles. Well, that ain’t happenin’ over here. The Old Man Mountain Basket is super strong. I didn’t stand on it because it’s not a SRAM Transmission derailleur, but you probably could! The stamped and folded design is welded in a clean seam at the corners, promising years of use and abuse.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-5.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-5.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-5.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-5.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-5.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-5.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-5.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-5.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1334\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-15a.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-15a.jpg?w=1334&amp;quality=75 1334w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-15a.jpg?resize=1024,1535&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-15a.jpg?resize=768,1151&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-15a.jpg?resize=700,1049&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-15a.jpg?resize=1025,1536&amp;quality=75 1025w\" /></p>\n<h3>Attached</h3>\n<p>The beauty of the Basket is if you’re using an Old Man Mountain Rack, it bolts right in without a hiccup.

For starters, it’s a universal rack, with countless means of attaching itself to just about any bike. That’s right. Got an old 1980s Stumpjumper? The Elkhorn will attach to it thanks to OMM’s quick-release rack mount kit. What about a carbon gravel bike with thru-axles? Yep, that too. Any bike with standard rack mounts can easily run the Elkhorn as well. The fit kits are optional in those cases–like how I installed it here on my Sklar tourer–I could have simply installed it to the fork’s rack mounts at the dropout.</p>\n<p>Through Old Man Mountain’s integration with Robert Axle Project, just about any thru-axle thread pitch and width is covered. All I had to do was figure out which pitch the Paragon Machine Works fork ends use (M15 x 1.5″ boost) and the rack bolted right into the axle ends. The Elkhorn has a 25-lb weight capacity.</p>\n<p>The Elkhorn comes in two heights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Short fits tires up to 27.5 x 2.8″ or 700c x 50mm</li>\n<li>The Tall is for maximum mud clearance and fits tires up to 29 x 3.25″</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-14.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-14.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-14.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-14.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-14.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-14.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-14.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-14.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-17.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-17.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-17.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-17.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-17.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-17.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-17.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-17.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Then I used the supplied brace, which has a nice, simple curve, and attached it to the three-pack mounts on the fork. Since the Elkhorn has three-pack rack mounts on it as well, I don’t mind losing that single bolt. :-) I kept the hardware loose to line it up perfectly before tightening it all down. Also, as a habit, I always use blue Loctite on all rack hardware.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-10.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-10.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-10.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-10.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-10.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-10.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-10.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-10.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>I’m still messing around with the Nitto light attachment for my Sinewave Beacon lamp as I prefer to have the beam slightly turned outward, into the shoulder of the road, rather than directly out in front of the bike. This is because when I ride singletrack, I rely on a headlamp for a more stable beam, so this is primarily used for pavement or dirt road rides when visibility is important.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-8.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-8.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-8.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-8.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-8.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-8.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-8.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-8.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-13.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-13.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-13.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-13.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-13.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-13.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-13.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-13.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>One thing to be mindful of is “cold setting” the rack legs. Since these racks are designed to fit on the front or the rear of the bike, you’ll have to carefully spread the legs to fit a super boost rear end. The same can be said for a boost front end, which will then need to be slightly squished inward. I found it best to soft-tighten the rack legs and crank down on either side, turn by turn.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-6.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-6.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-6.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-6.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-6.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-6.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-6.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Old-Man-Mountain-Basket-Review-6.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>\n<p>I’m not much of a Molle guy. I dunno why. I just don’t do “tactical” and “bike,” yet plenty of people love Molle bags. That said, it’s super smart for OMM to utilize a standardized pattern on the Basket. Got a Molle bear spray holster? Check. Molle first aid kit? Check. Molle slingshot rack? Check. All that stuff will attach directly to the Molle pattern. Or you can just run ski straps through your favorite chair or z-rest sleeping pad.</p>\n<p><em>Honestly, I’m very intrigued at how this would integrate with the <a href=\"https://builtbyswift.com/shop/sugarloaf-basket-bag/\" target=\"_blank\">Swift Industries Sugar Loaf</a> bag!</em></p>\n<p>The Basket is the bike thing I didn’t think I needed. It attaches cleanly to the Old Man Mountain racks, is rattle-free, and looks to be able to withstand lots of use (and some abuse.) It, along with the Elkhorn provides yet another configuration for my dedicated touring bike and honestly, it might be the cleanest solution to carrying light and airy camping items yet.</p>\n<p>And the price is right for a bomber piece of hardware, backed by a lifetime warranty. With endless possibilities for what you can carry, the Basket and Elkhorn will prove to be noble allies on my next long tour.</p>\n<p>Check out my Pros and Cons for the Basket…</p>\n<h3>Pros</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Durable, stamped aluminum construction</li>\n<li>Works with 137-designed bags or cargo nets</li>\n<li>Molle compatible</li>\n<li>Lightweight at 499 grams (compared to a Wald 137 that weighs 525 grams)</li>\n<li>Rattle-free construction, bolts right into Old Man Mountain racks</li>\n<li>Lifetime warranty</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cons</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Currently on backorder</li>\n<li>$80 is roughly over two times the cost of a Wald 137</li>\n<li>Made in Taiwan, whereas the Wald 137 is made in the USA.</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>See more on the <a href=\"https://oldmanmountain.com/product/basket/\" target=\"_blank\">Basket</a> and the <a href=\"https://oldmanmountain.com/product/elkhorn-bike-rack/\" target=\"_blank\">Elkhorn</a> at <a href=\"https://oldmanmountain.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Old Man Mountain</a>.</em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/old-man-mountain-basket-and-elkhorn-rack-review/\">No More Jostlin’: An Old Man Mountain Basket and Elkhorn Rack Review</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"b797a3c9a3a57651db711fe746df08f40d262b7b54ce96fa783132118854949a","category":"Cycling"}
