{"title":"Tim Cook, on His Favorite Website, Teases Apple Product Launch Next Week","link":"https://x.com/tim_cook/status/1890068457825394918","date":1739482200000,"content":"\n<p>Tim Cook, on X:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Get ready to meet the newest member of the family.</p>\n\n<p>Wednesday, February 19. #AppleLaunch</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Most people are guessing, I think correctly, that this is about the iPhone SE 4. We’re also right on schedule for the M4 generation of MacBook Airs, but I don’t think MacBook Airs would qualify for “newest member of the family”. They’re more like an updated version of the current member of the family. But the next-gen iPhone SE is going to be a very different iPhone SE — it will mark the end of the Home button and Touch ID. Maybe it won’t even be named “SE” but given a new name?</p>\n\n<p>The “#AppleLaunch” isn’t merely a hashtag, but a “<a href=\"https://creativemarket.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-hashflags\">Hashflag</a>” — a paid promotion with X that includes a custom emoji icon. For this one, it’s a shiny liquid-metal treatment of the Apple logo (<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/02/hashflag-applelaunch.png\">screenshot</a>). I don’t know what these “hashflag” promotions cost now, but when they launched a decade ago, <a href=\"https://www.adweek.com/performance-marketing/twitters-branded-emojis-come-million-dollar-commitment-169327/\">AdWeek reported that the price started at $1 million</a>. And you’ll never guess who has interrupted his busy day running the federal government <a href=\"https://x.com/arjunkhemani/status/1890072629207531914\">to retweet it</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I don’t really get Apple’s angle on this return to advertising on X. Placating Trump through flattery and his <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/03/allen-tim-cook-1m-trump-inauguration\">“inauguration fund” racket</a>, I get. He’s the president of the United States now and he’s nakedly corrupt and such a profound narcissist that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/07/us/politics/foreign-leaders-flattery-trump.html\">simple abject obsequious flattery</a> works on him. But why appease Musk too? Because Musk has Trump’s ear, I guess? (Feel free to substitute another piece of Trump’s anatomy if you think <em>ear</em> doesn’t properly convey <a href=\"https://politicalwire.com/2025/02/07/trump-isnt-going-to-like-this/\">their apparent power dynamic</a> — which, in turn, might answer my question re: the need Cook sees to appease Musk.)</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/13/cook-x-product-launch\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"54c2f6bb32e14591e703ea348859c42333c586f693d77bdadbcd2a552f2d52fc","category":"Tech"}
