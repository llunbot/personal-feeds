A few years ago we got the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234483/27-inch-apple-imac-2020-review.html\">last update to the Intel-based 27-inch iMac</a> in August, but that was an odd exception to the rule. September is when the company releases new iPhones and Apple Watches, along with major operating system updates for all its products. The company is too busy building up to that big September to push out new stuff in August. If it’s not ready for WWDC in June, it’s coming in the fall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While we don’t expect any new hardware in August, the software side starts to get interesting as the beta releases of the next big operating systems start to become more complete and polished. And of course, the Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade releases never stop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s everything we expect from Apple in August 2023. For everything else that’s coming read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671090/new-apple-products.html\">Every new Apple product coming in 2023 and 2024.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New hardware releases</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s going to be a big month—the whole iPhone 15 lineup, Apple Watch Series 9, maybe even a new iPad mini or USB-C AirPods!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh wait, that’s in September. In August, we don’t expect any new hardware <em>at all</em>. It’s not inconceivable that something new arrives this month—in 2020, an update to the 27-inch iMac arrived on August 27—but the best information available now suggests there’s nothing on the way until the iPhone event in the second week of September.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as always, September’s going to be big, so there’s a lot o look forward to. And to get things started, invitations for the iPhone 15 event might go out at the end of August, depending on how early in September the event is. The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2019105/iphone-15-event-september-13-rumor.html\">latest rumors</a> say the event will be on Wednesday, September 13, which means the invitations could go out on August 30 or 31. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apps and software updates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Near the end of July, Apple released iOS 16.6 with a huge list of security updates but no new features. We didn’t get an iOS 16.7 beta in July, so that might have been the last release for iOS 16 other than Rapid Security Response updates and other security releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, all efforts are behind the release of iOS 17 in the fall, along with iPadOS 17, tvOS 17, a HomePod update, watchOS 10, and macOS Sonoma. Public Betas are out now and will be updated a couple of times throughout the month of August, with Developer Beta releases perhaps a little more frequent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iOS 17 Beta:</strong> The first iOS 17 Public Beta was released on July 12, but a second public beta was not released in July. We expect further developer betas (we closed the month on Developer Beta 4) and a couple more Public Beta releases in August, with maybe one more round of beta releases next month before iOS 17 is released in the middle of September.
