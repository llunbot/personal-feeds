In addition to good strategy and the timely appearance of key allies like the French, Continental soldiers relied on several key technological innovations in weaponry. But just how accurate is an 18th-century musket when it comes to hitting a target? Did the rifle really determine the outcome of the war? And just how much damage did cannon inflict? A team of military weapons experts and re-enactors set about testing some of those questions in a new NOVA documentary, <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/\"><em>Revolutionary War Weapons</em></a>.</p>\n<p>The documentary examines the firing range and accuracy of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Bess\">Brown Bess muskets</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_rifle\">long rifles</a> used by both the British and the Continental Army during the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battles_of_Lexington_and_Concord\">Battles of Lexington and Concord</a>; the effectiveness of Native American <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomahawk\">tomahawks</a> for close combat (no, they were usually not thrown as depicted in so many popular films, but there are modern throwing competitions today); and the effectiveness of cannons against the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabion#:~:text=A%20gabion%20(from%20Italian%20gabbione,building%2C%20military%20applications%20and%20landscaping.\">gabions</a> and other defenses employed to protect the British fortress during the pivotal <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Yorktown\">Siege of Yorktown</a>. There is even a fascinating segment on the first military submarine, dubbed \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_(submersible)\">the Turtle</a>,\" created by American inventor David Bushnell.</p>\n<p>To capture all the high-speed ballistics action, director Stuart Powell relied upon a range of high-speed cameras called the Phantom Range. \"It is like a supercomputer,\" Powell told Ars. \"It is a camera, but it doesn't feel like a camera. You need to be really well-coordinated on the day when you're using it because it bursts for, like, 10 seconds. It doesn't record constantly because it's taking so much data. Depending on what the frame rate is, you only get a certain amount of time. So you're trying to coordinate that with someone trying to fire a 250-year-old piece of technology. If the gun doesn't go off, if something goes wrong on set, you'll miss it. Then it takes five minutes to reboot and get ready for the new shot. So a lot of the shoot revolves around the camera; that's not normally the case.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/new-nova-doc-puts-revolutionary-war-weapons-to-the-test/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/new-nova-doc-puts-revolutionary-war-weapons-to-the-test/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9c2860e732d6dbf9debcb964b755823a0bfd41e8da7a46a67dd247cda9c9c201","category":"Tech"}
