Studying antimatter, therefore, has been extremely difficult. But that's changed a bit in recent years, as CERN has set up a facility that produces and traps antimatter, allowing for <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/09/antimatter-falls-downward-not-upward-just-like-regular-matter/\" target=\"_blank\">extensive studies</a> of its <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2011/06/antimatter-atom-held-trapped-for-15-minutes/\" target=\"_blank\">properties</a>, including <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2010/11/researchers-trap-antihydrogen-atoms/\" target=\"_blank\">entire anti-atoms</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the hardware used to capture antiprotons also produces interference that limits the precision with which measurements can be made. So CERN decided that it might be good to determine how to move the antimatter away from where it's produced. Since it was tackling that problem anyway, CERN decided to make a shipping container for antimatter, allowing it to be put on a truck and potentially taken to labs throughout Europe.</p>\n<h2>A shipping container for antimatter</h2>\n<p>The problem facing CERN comes from its own hardware. The antimatter it captures is produced by smashing a particle beam into a stationary target. As a result, all the anti-particles that come out of the debris carry a lot of energy. If you want to hold on to any of them, you have to slow them down, which is done using electromagnetic fields that can act on the charged antimatter particles. Unfortunately, as the team behind the new work notes, many of the measurements we'd like to do with the antimatter are \"extremely sensitive to external magnetic field noise.\"</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/cern-gears-up-to-ship-antimatter-across-europe/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/cern-gears-up-to-ship-antimatter-across-europe/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e9256672b54cb2af37276610eda57b00723e76743f13fdb3e5a7104ede11d31e","category":"Tech"}
