Unboxing videos shared today confirm that this trend has continued with the new iMac, Mac mini, and MacBook Pro models launching this Friday.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nApple has stopped including stickers with its latest devices as part of its goal of removing plastic from its packaging by next year. One exception is the latest MacBook Air, which still comes with Apple stickers in the box, but that will likely no longer be the case once the laptop receives its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/23/m4-macbook-air-production-beginning-soon/\">rumored update to the M4 chip</a> around March next year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYou can still ask to receive Apple stickers for free when purchasing one of these devices in person at an Apple Store, provided they have supply, so the era of Apple stickers is not completely over. You'll just no longer find them inside the box.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/07/rip-apple-stickers-kind-of/\">RIP, Apple Stickers (Kind Of)</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/rip-apple-stickers-kind-of.2442239/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0a454a09e8d199e99df343cfa20d46b93fa77e988d190873cf74d71ce05eb917","category":"Apple"}
