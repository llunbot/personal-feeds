Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy terminated the city's congestion charge, which made drivers pay for going below 60th Street.</p>\n<p>Duffy claimed that it's unfair that drivers should have to pay to use roads since there are already tolls on bridges into Manhattan and claimed there are no alternatives, ignoring the buses and subway trains operated by the Metropolitan Transit Authority.</p>\n<p>Further, the city is being unfair against people who live far away, Duffy said. \"The toll program leaves drivers without any free highway alternative and instead takes more money from working people to pay for a transit system and not highways. Itâ€™s backwards and unfair,\" he said in a statement.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/trump-rescinds-dot-approval-for-nyc-congestion-toll-condemns-city-to-pollution/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/02/trump-rescinds-dot-approval-for-nyc-congestion-toll-condemns-city-to-pollution/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
