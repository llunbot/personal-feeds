The simplicity of tapping on the screen when they want things to happen means they can learn to use them in seconds, but there’s plenty that Apple’s tablets can do. Whether it’s educational games, entertainment apps, using them to create art with an Apple Pencil or just something to stop them getting bored on car journeys, iPads can be a godsend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Choosing the right one can feel a bit daunting. After all, don’t they all do the same things? What’s the difference between the normal iPad and the iPad Air? Well, we’re here to simplify things so you can be sure you’re buying the right one. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also read our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673581/best-kids-apps-games-for-iphone-ipad.html\">best iPhone and iPad apps for kids</a> guide to get them off to a good start. Plus, we have a roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/334296/the-best-iphone-for-kids.html\">best iPhones for kids</a> if you want to immerse them fully in the Apple world as they grow up. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Should I get an iPad for my child? </strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s been lots of research published about how much screen time our kids should be allowed. Some parents might argue that kids shouldn’t be exposed to screens at such a young age, but frankly, in a world where everything is dominated by technology we think that we owe it to our kids to make sure they are comfortable in that environment, hence the introduction of an iPad is good for their education.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, just sticking them in front of an iPad rather than interacting with them probably isn’t great: Disney+ shouldn’t really be babysitting your kids for hours on end, but if it allows you a few minutes of peace to make dinner then fair enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that out of the way, there are many reasons why you should be confident about getting an iPad for your kids to use. There are, after all, many other tablets on the market, most of which are cheaper than the iPad. So, if you are looking for some reassurance on is whether the iPad is the best option for your child, here are a few compelling reasons:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>The App Store is full of great apps designed specifically for kids.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Many of those apps will be ideal for school children of various ages, or even toddlers.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>There is an ecosystem of great accessories designed to work with the iPad.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPadOS is easy to use, especially if your child has used your iPhone. The bonus is your iPhone apps will be available on your iPad too and vice versa.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have older children, then take a look at our guide to the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668914/best-ipad-for-students.html\">best iPads for students</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What iPads are there to choose from?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time of writing, Apple offers four categories of iPad, which are as follows.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li> <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-668916-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/ipad-10.2/\" target=\"_blank\">iPad</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li> <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-668916-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/ipad-mini/\" target=\"_blank\">iPad mini</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li> <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-668916-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/ipad-air/\" target=\"_blank\">iPad Air</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li> <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-668916-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/uk/ipad-pro/\" target=\"_blank\">iPad Pro</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In all honesty, we wouldn’t recommend the iPad Pros or the new Airs for children, as you’d just be paying quite sizeable amounts for performance and compatibility features that they just won’t need. The standard iPad and mini range already offers plenty of scope and power for younger users, so our advice is to stick with those and ignore the Pros and Airs for now. When it comes to students though, it’s a potentially different argument, but the good news is you can put that off for a few years and save up for the more expensive iPad in the meantime. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of savings, check out our round-up of the best iPad deals you can get on the whole range of iPads here:  <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672807/crazy-ipad-deals-for-april-2022.html\" target=\"_blank\">The best iPad deals</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Is 64GB enough? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This depends on how you want to use the iPad. For long trips, you might want to download lots of movies, TV shows, or games to entertain the kids in the car or on the plane. In that case, more storage is better. Otherwise, any apps you purchase can always be deleted and then downloaded again, plus public Wi-Fi can often be available as an easy solution for the little ones streaming a few episodes of their favorite shows.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are buying a refurbished or used iPad, then we’d advise against a 32GB or even 16GB model (although these are much rarer now as it’s been several years since Apple sold any iPads with less than 64GB storage). 64GB should really be the lowest you go in terms of storage, as this gives you enough space to store a good amount of downloaded content. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more advice regarding buying a used or refurbished iPad read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670633/where-buy-refurbished-ipad.html\">Why a refurbished iPad could be the best tablet for you.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Do I need cellular?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Probably not. If you want to add cellular capabilities to your kids’ iPad, we recommend that when you are outside the house you <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671125/how-to-set-up-an-iphone-hotspot.html\">hotspot from your own iPhone</a> rather than spend money on a contract for your child. We most apps will work offline and you can download movies to the device when heading on a long trip.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best iPad for kids and toddlers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s our advice on which iPad to choose when buying for a child.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t10th-gen iPad (2022) – Best overall\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" alt=\"10th-gen iPad (2022) - Best overall\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Apple-iPad-10-inch-2022-review_1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><figure><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" alt=\"10th-gen iPad (2022) - Best overall\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><figure><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" alt=\"10th-gen iPad (2022) - Best overall\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tModern buttonless design\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t10.9-inch Liquid Retina Display\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tA14 Bionic processor\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tUSB-C for charging\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tVarious colors\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\t64GB might be too small\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tOnly supports Apple Pencil (Gen 1)\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFrom $349 (64GB) | $499 (256GB)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BJLXMVMV?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$329 at  Amazon</a><a href=\"https%3A%2F%2Fapple.sjv.io%2Fc%2F321564%2F473657%2F7613%3Fprodsku%3DMPQ03LL%252FA%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.apple.com%252Fus%252Fshop%252Fgo%252Fproduct%252FMPQ03%26intsrc%3DCATF_3652&amp;subid1=1-1-668916-6-1370877-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$349 at  Apple</a><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-668916-6-1370877-9934&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/us/shop/go/product/MPQ23\" target=\"_blank\">$349 at  Apple United States</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>Apple gave its standard iPad a makeover when it launched this 10th-generation model, replacing the classic Home button design with the mini/Air approach of gesture-based controls. There is still Touch ID available, but now you’ll find the sensor embedded in the power button on the top edge. This means there’s more space for the display, which increases from the 10.2-inch panel in the 9th generation iPad to 10.9-inch in this 10th generation model.</p>\n\n<p>As with the previous standard iPad models, the display isn’t laminated, meaning there is a slight air gap between the glass and the display beneath. This is a minor thing and probably won’t even be something you notice, unless you use an Apple Pencil often, in which case you’ll probably experience a slight lag as you write. It’s all good though, and after no time at all, you’ll be able to incorporate that into your technique and scribble away with the best of them.  One thing to note (pardon the pun), is that this model only supports the 1st generation Apple Pencil and requires a $9/£9 adapter to recharge it unless you buy a brand new one (as Apple includes the adapter in the box). </p>\n\n<p>Apple fits the new iPad with an A14 Bionic processor, which is the same tech that powers the iPhone 12 range (including the Pros), so there’s plenty of performance on tap for playing games, streaming content, and running educational apps. Another notable feature is the inclusion of a USB-C port rather than Lightning. This opens up a world of peripherals that you can use with the iPad, and you can even connect it to a compatible monitor if your child needs a desktop-style experience. </p>\n\n<p>Of course, you can always pair it with a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse to create the perfect, compact laptop for homework and any creative endeavors your child wants to try. </p>\n\n<p>One of the best features Apple included with the 10th generation iPad is a recent price drop. So, you can now pick them up for the following prices:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>iPad (10th gen) 64GB – $349/£349</li>\n\n<li>iPad (10th gen) 256GB – $499/£499</li>\n\n<li>iPad (10th gen, cellular) 64GB – $499/£499</li>\n\n<li>iPad (10th gen, cellular) 256GB – $649/£649</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As with the other iPads on this list, you might want to consider opting for the 256GB storage variants, as 64GB can fill up pretty quickly if you’re downloading games, large apps, or TV/movie content. Apple also offers a bespoke two-part keyboard case called the Magic Keyboard Folio, which is nice but costs a whopping $249/£279, so we’d advise looking for cheaper (and often just as good) third-party products instead. </p>\n\n<p>The iPad comes in four lovely colors (Blue, Pink, Yellow, and Silver), so your child can pick one that reflects their personality or just the one with the hues they like the most. </p>\n\n<p> <span>Check our guide to the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/677736/best-10in-ipad-deals.html\">best iPad 10th-gen deals</a> to see if you can get one for a lower price. </span></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1370887/ipad-10th-gen-vs-ipad-9th-gen-design-display-specs.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t10th-gen 10.9-inch iPad (2022) review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiPad mini (2021) – Best for small hands\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure><img alt=\"iPad mini (2021) - Best for small hands\" src=\"https://images.techadvisor.com/cmsdata/reviews/3809323/apple_ipad_mini_2021_review_12.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><figure><img alt=\"iPad mini (2021) - Best for small hands\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><figure><img alt=\"iPad mini (2021) - Best for small hands\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tLightweight\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tPowerful\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tApple Pencil support (2nd Gen)\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tMore expensive than the previous iPad Mini\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tNo Smart Keyboard Support\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFrom $499 (64GB) | $649 (256GB)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G9BXKF5?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$399.99 at  Amazon</a><a href=\"https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/321564/1175784/1036?prodsku=ACMK7M3LLA&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Facmk7m3lla.html&amp;intsrc=CATF_9102\" target=\"_blank\">$499 at  Adorama</a><a href=\"https%3A%2F%2Fapple.sjv.io%2Fc%2F321564%2F473657%2F7613%3Fprodsku%3DMK7M3LL%252FA%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.apple.com%252Fus%252Fshop%252Fgo%252Fproduct%252FMK7M3%26intsrc%3DCATF_3652&amp;subid1=1-1-668916-6-664584-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$499 at  Apple</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p><span>While the iPad mini (2021) might be the smallest member of the family, don’t let that fool you, there’s plenty of power and features packed into the diminutive frame.

It’s still brilliant, but not quite as much of a bargain for kids as its bigger brother. </span></p>\n\n<p><span>The 8.3-inch Liquid Retina display is gorgeous and the surrounding bezels are now quite small as Apple has removed the Home button and instead put a Touch ID  sensor in the Power button on the side. </span></p>\n\n<p><span>Under the hood, there’s an A15 Bionic driving thing</span>s<span>, so there’s no lack of power in this smaller iPad, ensuring the latest games and apps will absolutely fly on this device.

There are also four different colors to choose from, including Purple and Pink.  Oh, and there are 5G versions if you want to add a fast data connection for streaming and messaging on the go. </span></p>\n\n<p>Just keep in mind that Apple may soon update the range of iPads with the next generation of processors, which means we could see a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678361/ipad-mini-7-specs-design-processor-release.html\">new iPad mini</a> at some point in the next year.  </p>\n\n<p><span>The iPad mini (2021) is available in these configurations:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>iPad mini (2021) 64GB – $499/£</span>499</li>\n\n<li><span>iPad mini (2021) 256GB: – </span>$649/£649</li>\n\n<li>iPad mini (2021, cellular) 64GB – $649/£649</li>\n\n<li>iPad mini (2021, cellular) 256GB – $799/£799</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>Check our guide to the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/677718/best-ipad-mini-deals-cheapest-price-for-ipad-mini-6th-generation.html\">best iPad mini deals</a> to see if you can get one for a lower price. </span></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668134/ipad-mini-2021-vs-ipad-2021.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tApple iPad mini (6th gen, A15, 2021) review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t9th-gen iPad (2021) – Best refurbished/second-hand \t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure><img alt=\"9th-gen iPad (2021) - Best refurbished/second-hand \" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/apple_ipad_2021_review_1.png\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><figure><img alt=\"9th-gen iPad (2021) - Best refurbished/second-hand \" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><figure><img alt=\"9th-gen iPad (2021) - Best refurbished/second-hand \" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tInexpensive\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tApple Pencil Support (1st Gen)\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tA13 Bionic Processor, Headphone Jack\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tLower quality screen than other models\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tOlder design.\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li> \n\t\t\t\t\tNo longer in production\t\t\t\t\t</li> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$329 (64GB) | $479 (256GB) \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G9CJM1Z?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$249 at  Amazon</a><a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/321564/633495/10014?prodsku=6539358&amp;u=https://api.bestbuy.com/click/-/4901809/pdp&amp;intsrc=CATF_4831&amp;subid1=1-1-668916-6-664585-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$249.99 at  Best Buy</a><a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/321564/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/2021-Apple-10-2-inch-iPad-Wi-Fi-64GB-Space-Gray-9th-Generation/483978365&amp;subid1=1-1-668916-6-664585-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$279 at  Walmart</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>While it’s no longer in production, the 9th generation iPad is one that’s worth seeking out in the refurb or second-hand market, as it offered plenty of bang for the buck even when it was new. It most recently sold for $329 and is often <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G9FPHY6/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">on sale for $249</a> or less.</p>\n\n<p>It came with a powerful A13 Bionic chip (the same as in the iPhone 11 range), and a front-facing camera that supports cool features such as Center Stage, which keeps you in the middle of the screen on video calls even if you move around. It’s still got plenty of power for games, streaming, capturing photos and videos, not to mention pretty much any app you want to throw at it. The 9th-gen iPad’s older design has useful bezels that make it easy for small hands to hold onto without accidentally triggering things on the screen, plus the 10.2in size also makes it an ideal screen for watching on long car journeys. Support for Apple Pencil (1st Gen) means your junior Picasso can create their masterpieces without leaving smudges on the furniture.  </p>\n\n<p>Yes, you don’t get the fancier Liquid Retina Displays like on the iPad mini or the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678387/ipad-10th-generation-2022-design-specs-price-release.html\">10th-gen iPad</a>, but we can’t see many kids complaining about the panel in the iPad as it’s bright, colorful, and pleasant to use.</p>\n\n<p>One thing to note is that it features a headphone jack. So, if you don’t want to be driven insane by the high-pitched noises that often explode from child-focused content, this alone might make it worth hunting down. </p>\n\n<p>Read our roundup of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/677736/ipad-9th-generation-deals-best-price-for-10-2in-ipad.html\">best 9th-gen iPad deals</a>.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668134/ipad-mini-2021-vs-ipad-2021.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tApple iPad 10.2in (2021) review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\niPad</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"68b2562667ae1c2c7c5bb54b411b90fb8a9403f56f02ac72942fe838bffb5233","category":"Apple"}
