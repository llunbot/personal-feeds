Employees in Riccio’s Vision\nProducts Group, which includes a couple thousand engineers working\non headsets and related technology, were told they would become\nthe responsibility of John Ternus, Apple’s hardware boss.</p>\n\n<p>Mike Rockwell, Riccio’s current lieutenant, will continue to lead\nthe Vision Products Group on a day-to-day basis, said the people,\nwho asked not to be identified because the changes aren’t public.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Gurman’s framing here in his lede could leave casual readers with the impression that Riccio is perhaps leaving because of the tepid consumer response to Vision Pro, but as Gurman subsequently mentions, this timeline was seemingly in the cards ever since <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/01/dan-riccio-begins-a-new-chapter-at-apple/\">Riccio stepped down as senior vice president of all hardware</a> (a role now filled by John Ternus) in 2021.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/10/riccio-retirement\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"5afaac475fee22487ab8d51c81cb2ddbac23738153651067065630b363d80b38","category":"Tech"}
