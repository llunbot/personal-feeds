The lighter system lets them build their top model down to just 16.7kg (36.8lbs).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024-MMR-Kaizen-lightweight-trail-e-mountain-bike-3.jpg\"><img width=\"1827\" height=\"1218\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024-MMR-Kaizen-lightweight-trail-e-mountain-bike-3.jpg\" alt=\"MMR Kaizen lightweight eMTB shown from rear angle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024-MMR-Kaizen-lightweight-trail-e-mountain-bike-3.jpg 1827w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024-MMR-Kaizen-lightweight-trail-e-mountain-bike-3-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024-MMR-Kaizen-lightweight-trail-e-mountain-bike-3-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024-MMR-Kaizen-lightweight-trail-e-mountain-bike-3-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024-MMR-Kaizen-lightweight-trail-e-mountain-bike-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024-MMR-Kaizen-lightweight-trail-e-mountain-bike-3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024-MMR-Kaizen-lightweight-trail-e-mountain-bike-3-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024-MMR-Kaizen-lightweight-trail-e-mountain-bike-5.jpg\"><img width=\"2025\" height=\"667\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024-MMR-Kaizen-lightweight-trail-e-mountain-bike-5.jpg\" alt=\"closeup motor and controller details on MMR Kaizen lightweight eMTB\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024-MMR-Kaizen-lightweight-trail-e-mountain-bike-5.jpg 2025w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024-MMR-Kaizen-lightweight-trail-e-mountain-bike-5-297x98.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024-MMR-Kaizen-lightweight-trail-e-mountain-bike-5-800x264.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024-MMR-Kaizen-lightweight-trail-e-mountain-bike-5-120x40.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024-MMR-Kaizen-lightweight-trail-e-mountain-bike-5-768x253.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024-MMR-Kaizen-lightweight-trail-e-mountain-bike-5-1536x506.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Add a 250Wh range extender for longer rides and you’ll still have room for a water bottle inside the front triangle, too!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024-MMR-Kaizen-lightweight-trail-e-mountain-bike-2.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024-MMR-Kaizen-lightweight-trail-e-mountain-bike-2.jpg\" alt=\"MMR Kaizen lightweight eMTB on the trail dropping in\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024-MMR-Kaizen-lightweight-trail-e-mountain-bike-2.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024-MMR-Kaizen-lightweight-trail-e-mountain-bike-2-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024-MMR-Kaizen-lightweight-trail-e-mountain-bike-2-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024-MMR-Kaizen-lightweight-trail-e-mountain-bike-2-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024-MMR-Kaizen-lightweight-trail-e-mountain-bike-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024-MMR-Kaizen-lightweight-trail-e-mountain-bike-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024-MMR-Kaizen-lightweight-trail-e-mountain-bike-2-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Kaizen rolls on 29er wheels front and rear, with 140mm travel on both ends, too. A slack 66º head angle and long reach with short stem should help it handle like a bike with a bit more squish, but the looks are more reminiscent of an XC race bike. A slim Purion display and controller continue the pared-down motif.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024-MMR-Kaizen-lightweight-trail-e-mountain-bike-4.jpg\"><img width=\"1411\" height=\"941\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024-MMR-Kaizen-lightweight-trail-e-mountain-bike-4.jpg\" alt=\"MMR Kaizen lightweight eMTB shown from side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024-MMR-Kaizen-lightweight-trail-e-mountain-bike-4.jpg 1411w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024-MMR-Kaizen-lightweight-trail-e-mountain-bike-4-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024-MMR-Kaizen-lightweight-trail-e-mountain-bike-4-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024-MMR-Kaizen-lightweight-trail-e-mountain-bike-4-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024-MMR-Kaizen-lightweight-trail-e-mountain-bike-4-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/2024-MMR-Kaizen-lightweight-trail-e-mountain-bike-4-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes with 2.4″ tires, though, and 4-piston brakes.
