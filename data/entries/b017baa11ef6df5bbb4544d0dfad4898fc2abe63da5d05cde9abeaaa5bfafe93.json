The automaker went on a hiring spree, luring design and engineering talent away from the likes of BMW and Audi to grow its own competency in these areas. It worked—few can rival the efficiency or charging speed of the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2020/12/everything-we-know-about-hyundai-and-kias-new-electric-vehicle-platform/\">current crop of Korean electric vehicles</a>, for instance. And Hyundai's N division has shown it can turn <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/04/the-2021-hyundai-veloster-n-sometimes-america-does-get-the-good-one/\">prosaic underpinnings</a> into <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/06/the-refreshed-2024-hyundai-elantra-n-remains-a-darn-good-enthusiast-car/\">performance cars</a> that push all the right buttons. Both of those things are on vivid display with the Ioniq 5 N.</p>\n<p>The regular <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/12/the-hyundai-ioniq-5-is-the-best-ev-weve-driven-in-2021/\">Ioniq 5</a> has been on sale for a while now, long enough to have <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/09/hyundai-ioniq-5s-will-be-made-in-usa-with-native-tesla-style-ports/\">just received a facelift</a>. It's one of our favorite EVs, with styling that calls back to the angular hatchbacks of the 1980s and an 800 V powertrain that's easily best-in-class. Now, the company's in-house tuners have had their way with it, applying lessons learned from rallying and touring car racing to up the fun factor.</p>\n<p>It's not exactly a novel approach, even for EVs. Kia beat Hyundai to the punch with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/03/the-2023-ev6-gt-we-determine-its-fun-formula/\">the EV6 GT</a>; the car is fearsomely fast, but <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/12/an-electric-kia-thats-faster-than-a-lamborghini-the-2023-ev6-gt-driven/\">I found it less compelling</a> than the normal version, which is cheaper, less powerful, and more efficient. In fact, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/12/looking-for-a-new-ev-dont-get-suckered-by-the-top-of-the-line-model/\">I'm on record</a> as saying that when looking at EVs, the cheapest, least-powerful version is almost always the one to get.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047845#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047845&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
