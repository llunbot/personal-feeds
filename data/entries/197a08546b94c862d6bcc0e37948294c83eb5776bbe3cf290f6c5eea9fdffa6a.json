The plant-based theme ingredient came from a Toronto startup called <a href=\"https://www.newschoolfoods.co/\">New School Foods</a> that has been developing a way to construct a salmon substitute with not just the taste but also the texture of the real thing.</p>\n<p>New School treated a table’s worth of journalists to a tasting dinner in Toronto in late June—subject to a no-food-photos rule for attendees but with no restrictions on taking notes. That comped meal came hours after CEO Chris Bryson gave his sales pitch for the company during a panel at the <a href=\"https://collisionconf.com/\">Collision conference</a> there, in which he said that New School’s goal was to see its products “enthusiastically adopted by non-vegans.”</p>\n<p>New School has given itself a tall order by making salmon its go-to-market product. Salmon both has a distinctive, delicate texture and one of the most identifiable flavor profiles among seafood. And people prepare it with a wider range of techniques than most kinds of meat allow—grilling, poaching, sautéing, smoking, roasting, or even not cooking it at all. For plant-based salmon to pass muster, it has to work across those use cases.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1961837#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1961837&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Staff","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"197a08546b94c862d6bcc0e37948294c83eb5776bbe3cf290f6c5eea9fdffa6a","category":"Tech"}
