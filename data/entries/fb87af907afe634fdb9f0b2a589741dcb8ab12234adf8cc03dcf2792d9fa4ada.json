{"title":"iOS 18.3 Might Have a Last-Minute Change, Here's Why","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/24/ios-18-3-might-have-last-minute-change/","date":1737741384000,"content":"A private account on social media platform X today leaked the final build number for Apple's upcoming iOS 18.3 and iPadOS 18.3 updates: 22D61. That is a very slight change compared to the 22D60 build number for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/21/apple-releases-ios-18-3-rc/\">iOS 18.3 and iPadOS 18.3 Release Candidates</a>, which are essentially the final beta versions of each update.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/iOS-18.3-Apple-Intelligence-Color-Palette-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThe account has a good track record of sharing iOS-related information, but it has had some occasional misses. We continue to respect the account owner's request to not link to its posts, as they wish to remain anonymous and maintain a low profile.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe change suggests that iOS 18.3 and iPadOS 18.3 could include a very minor, last-minute change or two. Exactly what those changes might be remains to be seen, but we can speculate about one possibility: a 2025 Black Unity collection.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn each of the past four years, Apple has announced a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/apple-watch-black-unity-band-2024/\">Black Unity campaign</a> in the second half of January, and this has typically included a new Apple Watch band, Apple Watch face, and iPhone wallpaper featuring the colors of the Pan-African flag. We recently discovered that the upcoming tvOS 18.3 update for the Apple TV has a new <a href=\"https://x.com/aaronp613/status/1882223043889758219\">UNITY25 reference hidden within its code</a>, which suggests that the Black Unity campaign may continue in 2025. If so, it is likely that Apple will make an announcement about it next week.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFebruary is Black History Month in the United States, and Apple typically features content from Black creators across apps like Apple Books and Apple Podcasts.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn 2021 and 2022, Apple announced its Black Unity campaign just hours before it released watchOS 7.3 and watchOS 8.3, respectively, with a corresponding Black Unity watch face. Starting in 2023, and continuing in 2024, Apple included a matching iPhone wallpaper as well. As a result, it mentioned the Black Unity wallpaper in its release notes for the iOS 16.3 and iOS 17.3 Release Candidates in those years.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's release notes for the iOS 18.3 Release Candidate made no mention of a Black Unity wallpaper, but perhaps it is something that will still arrive in the final iOS 18.3 release, and this could explain the revised build number.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/23/ios-18-3-expected-to-be-released-next-week/\">expected to release iOS 18.3 next week</a>, so we will find out for sure soon.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/24/ios-18-3-might-have-last-minute-change/\">iOS 18.3 Might Have a Last-Minute Change, Here's Why</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-3-might-have-a-last-minute-change-heres-why.2448052/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"fb87af907afe634fdb9f0b2a589741dcb8ab12234adf8cc03dcf2792d9fa4ada","category":"Apple"}
