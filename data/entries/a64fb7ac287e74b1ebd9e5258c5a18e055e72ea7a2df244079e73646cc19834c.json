Running four years late, the Ariane 6 is set to become Europe's next flagship launcher. But delays in its development, combined with other factors, forced European governments to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/03/its-official-europe-turns-to-the-falcon-9-to-launch-its-navigation-satellites/\">pay SpaceX to deliver several payloads to orbit</a>.</p>\n<p>With Tuesday's test flight, European space officials hope those days are behind them. The European Space Agency paid more than $4 billion to get the Ariane 6 rocket to this point, with the goal of replacing the Ariane 5 with a cheaper, more capable launcher. There are still pressing questions about Ariane 6's cost per launch, and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/11/ariane-6-cost-and-delays-bring-european-launch-industry-to-a-breaking-point/\">whether the rocket will ever be able to meet its price target</a> and compete with SpaceX and other companies in the commercial market.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035900#p3\">Read 38 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035900&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a64fb7ac287e74b1ebd9e5258c5a18e055e72ea7a2df244079e73646cc19834c","category":"Tech"}
