Jagged Alliance </em>sold okay and became a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2008/08/jagged-alliance-coming-to-ds-the-cult-rejoices/\">minor cult classic</a> but is not mentioned in even a fraction of as many histories or ranked lists.</p>\n<p><em>Jagged Alliance 2Â </em>was a richer, cruder, funnier, far better game. The sequel more fully meshed '80s action movie tropes and stereotypes with the peculiar fun of micromanaging a jungle gunfight, while also managing a cast of real characters. Like <em>Soldier of Fortune</em> magazine, or dozens of VHS box covers from the \"Action\" section, it's only realistic at a glance. As Darius Kazemi puts it in <a href=\"https://bossfightbooks.com/products/jagged-alliance-2-by-darius-kazemi\">his wonderful book on the game</a>: \"No matter what a war-themed video game claims to do, it inevitably simulates the cultural fantasy of war and never war itself.\"</p>\n<p>Like its predecessor, <em>Jagged Alliance 2</em> had exponentially more developer cred than sales. It racked up editors' awards and high review scores, but its most notable nod was a nomination for \"<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20000817183235/http://gamespot.com/features/1999/p2_08.html\">Best Game Nobody Played</a>\" in 1999. Nobody expected a true sequel 24 years later. But here we are, with a <em>Jagged Alliance 3</em> that feels very direct in its sequel-dom.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1954726#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1954726&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"43531a7f6b8de542d0c1ebcc966f3296d91ef0c458dead8a3eddb20aaeec1f1b","category":"Tech"}
