It’s easy to fit on the screen and take it off when you need to, and you can leave it on, and it won’t interfere with closing the MacBook.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>I usually work at home, but I like to go to a local coffee shop and work there while I grab some lunch. When I do go to the office, it’s an open space. In both of those situations, I feel a little exposed because people can easily see what I’m doing on my MacBook screen. We’ve all had that instance when we’ve caught someone peeking at the screen you’re working on–it’s awkward regardless of how discrete you care to be about what you’re working on. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can maintain some of that privacy on your MacBook by using a screen overlay that cuts down the viewing angle of the MacBook. I’ve been using the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.startech.com/en-us/privacy-screens#apple-tab&amp;xcust=1-1-2336202-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">StarTech.com Laptop Privacy Screen</a> and it’s helped me feel less exposed and more comfortable in those open situations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the Privacy Screen on a MacBook’s display, the viewing angle is reduced to 30 degrees left or right of center. Go beyond that, and the screen angle that’s farthest away from your view gets distorted. For example, when I’m centered in front of the display, everything on screen is clear, but as I move towards my right, the view of the left side of the display distorts, and the more I move over, the more distortion covers toward the center and the right of the display. I’ve used the Privacy Screen for over 50 hours and from the start I haven’t had issues with it getting in the way of my own viewing experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you do need to allow for viewing at wide angles, you can simply take the Privacy Screen off. The version of the Privacy Screen in this review has a magnetic strip at the top to attach to the MacBook, and the overlay lays flat over the screen. It has a notch cutout so it doesn’t interfere with the FaceTime camera and it provides complete coverage of the screen. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/16in-macbook-pro-left-angle-display-text.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"MacBook Pro left angle display text\" width=\"2400\" height=\"1800\" loading=\"lazy\" /><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/16in-macbook-pro-left-angle-startech.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"StarTech Privacy Screen left angle\" width=\"2400\" height=\"1800\" loading=\"lazy\" /></div><figcaption>How the MacBook Pro looks with and without the StarTech.com Privacy Screen from a left angle.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/16in-macbook-pro-right-angle-display-text.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"MacBook Pro right angle display text\" width=\"2400\" height=\"1800\" loading=\"lazy\" /><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/16in-macbook-pro-right-angle-startech.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"StarTech Privacy Screen right angle\" width=\"2400\" height=\"1800\" loading=\"lazy\" /></div><figcaption>How the MacBook Pro looks with and without the StarTech.com Privacy Screen from a right angle.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Privacy Screen is also reversible, with a glossy side and a matte side. The matte side does affect color vibrancy and sharpness, but it also cuts down glare. If you’re doing image or video work, you’ll want to use the glossy side that maintains the integrity of the display.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The filter is thin enough to leave on the MacBook and doesn’t interfere when you close it. StarTech does provide an envelope for storing the filter, as well as a couple of adhesive strips and a cloth for wiping off dust. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>StarTech.com claims that the Privacy Screen cuts down blue light emissions from the display by 51 percent. I don’t have a way of gauging that, and I don’t usually experience eye strain or fatigue after prolonged computer use in the first place. But it seems like a nice secondary benefit of the overlay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>StarTech.com makes Privacy Screens for the iPad Pro, MacBook Air, and MacBook Pro. The Privacy Screen I reviewed is part of the company’s Black Magnetic Filters line. The more affordable Black Standard Filters line uses adhesive strips instead of magnets. The Gold Standard Filters also use adhesives but also have a glossy side that has a mirror-like gold finish for blocking the view.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><div><ul><li><figure><img alt=\"StarTech Privacy Screen MacBook Pro install\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/startech-privacy-screen-install.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"StarTech Privacy Screen magnetic strip\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/startech-privacy-screen-magnetic-edge.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"StarTech Privacy Screen MacBook Pro notch\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/startech-privacy-screen-package-notch.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"StarTech Privacy Screen\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/startech-privacy-screen-package.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li></ul><a></a><a></a><a></a><div></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Should you buy the StarTech.com Privacy Laptop Screen?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The StarTech.com Privacy Laptop Screen (Black Magnetic Filter) does a good job of cutting down the viewing angles while providing clarity as you work. It’s easy to fit on the screen and take it off when you need to, and you can leave it on and it won’t interfere with closing the MacBook. It’s a little pricey; the one for the 16-inch MacBook Pro in this review is $61.99/£55.19, but you may be able to find it on third-party retailers <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/StarTech-com-Removable-Reversible-Anti-Glare-Magnetic/dp/B0CSG9G6LZ/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">such as Amazon</a> for a lower price. Considering how well-made it is and how it works, it’s worth the price in exchange for a little bit of privacy.</p>\n\nLaptop Accessories, MacBook</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"780846f25f36c41f6ef588dcaa758c3249df851d13c56421986ea53768711abc","category":"Apple"}
