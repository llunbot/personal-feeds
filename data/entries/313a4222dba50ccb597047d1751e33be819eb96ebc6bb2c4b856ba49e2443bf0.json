The iPhone maker also has developed an advanced table-top home device that uses robotics to move a display around, they said.</blockquote>Apple is investigating the use of AI algorithms that would help robots \"navigate cluttered spaces within people's homes,\" the report says. Apple has apparently wanted to create robots that can \"handle chores, like cleaning dishes in a sink,\" but Gurman said this feat is unlikely this decade due to \"extraordinarily difficult engineering challenges.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's home robot could compete with the likes of Amazon's Astro, which serves as a mobile virtual assistant and provides home security monitoring.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs for the table-top device, Gurman said one idea was for its display to \"mimic the head movements\" of a person on a FaceTime video call. However, he said Apple has faced technical challenges related to \"balancing the weight of a robotic motor on a small stand,\" and some Apple executives have apparently debated whether to develop such a device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe robotics projects are said to be in the very early stages of research, and it is unclear if any of them will ever be released to the public. For now, these are just moonshot ideas, but they are fascinating ones to learn about.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/apple-reportedly-investigating-robotics/\">Apple Exploring 'Mobile Robot' That 'Follows Users Around Their Homes'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-exploring-mobile-robot-that-follows-users-around-their-homes.2423460/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"313a4222dba50ccb597047d1751e33be819eb96ebc6bb2c4b856ba49e2443bf0","category":"Apple"}
