There still isn't a Kindle with buttons and the feature seems unlikely to return, but buyers of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/review-amazons-2024-kindle-paperwhite-makes-the-best-e-reader-a-little-better/\">the latest Kindle Paperwhite</a> or <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/amazons-first-color-kindle-e-reader-the-kindle-colorsoft-will-run-you-280/\">the Kindle Colorsoft</a> are getting a possible consolation prize in the new 5.18.1 software update: a \"double tap to page turn\" feature that will turn the page or move to the next screen when you double-tap on the back or side of the device.</p>\n<p>The 5.18.1 software update is available on all Kindle readers going back to 2018's \"10th generation\" models, but the double-tap feature only works on the newest 12th-generation Paperwhite and the Colorsoft, not on any older Kindles or either Kindle Scribe model.
