This can be a problem in extreme environments, from subzero polar temperatures to the ruthless heat of the Sahara, and it doesn’t stop at Earth. Maintaining temperature is also an issue for astronauts. The vacuum of space is a gargantuan freezer, and exposure to direct sunlight out there can be just as brutal as the cold.</p>\n<p>Clothing tech that regulates body temperature usually goes only one way: heating or cooling. It also tends to be bulky and needs substantial energy that eventually drains any batteries. What if there was a system that both heat and cool while running on a constant renewable energy source?</p>\n<p>A team of researchers, led by Ziyuan Wang of Nankai University in Tianjin, China, has created a flexible, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/03/floating-solar-panels-could-provide-over-a-third-of-global-electricity/\">solar-powered</a> device that can be incorporated into clothing and regulate the body by actively heating or cooling the skin. It also works continuously for 24 hours and only needs sunlight to recharge.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1993722#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1993722&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Elizabeth Rayne","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"033d62191f3b33f99ffb275d64583f018dcfb04d724defd12bfc8a710903ba59","category":"Tech"}
