During this mission, similar to Apollo 9, a precursor to the Apollo 11 lunar landing, the crew would validate the ability of Orion and Starship to dock and test habitability inside Starship. The crew would then return to Earth. In another option NASA is considering, a crew would launch in Orion and fly to a small space station near the Moon, the Lunar Gateway, and then return to Earth.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018588#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2018588&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4b9b75f5c87aa2b266f935dd318bfac4edbaa458af0714204728b760d8741685","category":"Tech"}
