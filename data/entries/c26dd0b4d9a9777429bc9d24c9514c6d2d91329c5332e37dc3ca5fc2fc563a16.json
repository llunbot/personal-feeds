Now, thanks to a new McDonald's China promotion, you can add \"giant plastic chicken nugget with an LCD screen\" to that list of official <em>Tetris</em> ports (to say nothing of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2010/06/google-blocks-tetris-clones-from-android-market/\">the unofficial ones</a>).</p>\n<p>RetroDodo <a href=\"https://retrododo.com/mcdonalds-tetris-handheld/\">has the story</a> of this strange promotion, which is centered around the 40th anniversary of the Chicken McNugget's premiere in 1983. That makes the protein-filled treat just a year older than <em>Tetris</em> itself, which was <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/unsolved-mysteries-tetris-creators-alexey-pajitnov-and-henk-rogers/\">created on a Russian government mainframe computer by Alexei Pajitnov</a> in 1984. And that, apparently, is close enough to make the game part of an International Children's Day promotion that will \"take you on the time machine leading to childhood,\" according to a machine translation of <a href=\"https://www.mcdonalds.com.cn/news/20230524-McNuggets-40-years-2\">the official McDonald's China webpage</a> announcing the machine.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SjUtznS3EQ\">video unboxing and demonstration</a> posted by one Chinese McDonald's fan shows crisp shots of nugget-<em>Tetris</em> and its unlit LCD screen, as well as the included customization stickers and carrying case. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Dj0fI8vx4U\">Another unboxing video</a> includes a better look at the back of the machine, including a removable battery pack, speaker grate, and power switch.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1942348#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1942348&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c26dd0b4d9a9777429bc9d24c9514c6d2d91329c5332e37dc3ca5fc2fc563a16","category":"Tech"}
