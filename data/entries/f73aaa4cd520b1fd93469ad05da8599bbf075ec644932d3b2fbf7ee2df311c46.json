Rising device costs, limited differences between model upgrades, and economic and environment-related desires to keep electronics alive as long as possible are making people turn to refurbished phones, data shared this week by analyst Counterpoint found. And if someone is buying a refurbished phone, there's a good chance it's an iPhone.</p>\n<p>According to Counterpoint, Apple represented 49 percent of refurbished phones sold worldwide in 2022. The number of refurbished iPhones sold increased 16 percent year-over-year, with the overall used smartphone market growing 5 percent year-over-year, Counterpoint said. The numbers would be even higher, but a reported 17 percent drop in refurbished smartphone sales in China—driven, the firm said, by an increase in COVID-19 cases and related policies—was detrimental.</p>\n<p>By Counterpoint's measures, Apple grew its market share here from 44 percent in 2021 to 49 percent. Samsung is the biggest competitor, but it lost market share.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1934317#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1934317&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f73aaa4cd520b1fd93469ad05da8599bbf075ec644932d3b2fbf7ee2df311c46","category":"Tech"}
