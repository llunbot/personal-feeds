[...] </p>\n\n<p>But analysts <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/4798ab77-e063-4784-bdf3-19852b41fd1f\">told the Financial Times</a> that the US is still \nmoving too slowly to become a global chip leader. One engineer \ntold FT that by 2028, “Nvidia and other AI chip vendors are likely \nto have migrated to 2nm” process technology, ahead of the TSMC \nArizona fabs reaching that goal. In January, TSMC Chairman Mark \nLiu told investors that Taiwan-based fabs “will start 2nm mass \nproduction next year” and that the company has “plans to build \n‘multiple’ more fabs operating on that technology” in Taiwan, FT \nreported. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The goal should be to jump ahead of Taiwan, not merely catch up. I suspect that’s just not remotely feasible, though. Still though, any domestic chip fabrication is better than no domestic chip fabrication.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/09/tsmc-arizona\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"691883a9dc9299be9de34aa407aca3e574d07e5bdfe84951142ea65653b37318","category":"Tech"}
