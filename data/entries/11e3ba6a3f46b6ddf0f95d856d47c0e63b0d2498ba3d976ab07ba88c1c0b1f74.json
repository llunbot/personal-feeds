The update will enable Bluetooth LE connections with iPhones or iPads on every Xbox One controller with Bluetooth support, including Xbox Elite Series 2 controllers. On the Apple side, all you need is <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/350966/ios-15-super-guide-features-tips-tricks-updates-safari-facetime-focus-notification-summary.html\">iOS 15</a> or iPadOS 15, which is currently in beta and should be released in the next few weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, the new firmware adds a really big quality-of-life improvement: it will remember one Xbox Wireless host (like an Xbox console) and one Bluetooth host (like an iPhone, iPad, or Mac), then switch between them with a double-tap of the pair button. This eliminates a really annoying process of re-pairing your Xbox controller if you use it for both mobile and console gaming. Microsoft recently <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/343635/xbox-cloud-gaming-iphone-ipad-mac-game-pass-ultimate.html\">made Xbox Cloud Gaming available on iOS</a> through the browser, but itâ€™s one of your best options for playing even native iPhone games that support game controllers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/233059/how-to-pair-an-xbox-one-controller-with-iphone-or-ipad.html\">step-by-step guide for how to pair your Xbox controller with your iPhone or iPad</a>. The firmware that adds Bluetooth LE support and quick switching between Bluetooth and Xbox Wireless is currently being beta-tested with Xbox Insiders, and should roll out widely this fall.</p>\n</div>","author":"Jason Cross","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"11e3ba6a3f46b6ddf0f95d856d47c0e63b0d2498ba3d976ab07ba88c1c0b1f74","category":"Apple"}
