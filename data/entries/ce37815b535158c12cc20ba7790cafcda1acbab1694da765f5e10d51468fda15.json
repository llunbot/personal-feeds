The new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a> is also available in a mix of colors, mirroring Starlight and Pink from the â€ŒApple Watch Series 7â€Œ and â€ŒiPhone 13â€Œ, carrying over Space Gray, and introducing a new Purple color.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe Apple Watch's Blue and Red tones have been slightly tweaked from last year's offerings, while Green is a totally new option. Midnight replaces Space Gray with a very dark navy, while Starlight replaces Silver and Gold with a subtle champagne color.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWith such significant changes coming to the Apple Watch's color options this year, some customers have expressed confusion and irritation with the new hues. The replacement of Silver and Gold with Starlight has attracted particular ire, with some fans of the previous options being disappointed with the single new champagne-style color. Some fans of Silver have criticized Starlight for being too warm, while some fans of Gold have found it to be too desaturated.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>If they made a gold aluminum Apple Watch this year I probably would be ordering one on Friday. Starlight is too silver and stainless steel is too expensive!</p>â€” Becky Hansmeyer (@bhansmeyer) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bhansmeyer/status/1445074759667142667?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 4, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhile there are still Silver and Gold stainless steel Apple Watch options this year, Space Black has been replaced by Graphite, except on the HermÃ©s models.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>Are there really no non-HermÃ©s Space Black Apple Watch series 7 configurations? But that was my favorite one! <br /><br />I mean, not that Iâ€™m getting a Watch this year anyway, but I actually donâ€™t know what I would pick if I were. Apple is making some strange color decisions this year.</p>â€” Brian \"Spooktober\" Hough ðŸ‘» (@bwhough) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bwhough/status/1446463475136356353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 8, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nStainless steel Link Bracelet users have also noted incongruity with some Series 7 models. This is particularly evident with the Graphite Stainless Steel Apple Watch, which no longer matches its accompanying Link Bracelet.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>Just give me a silver Apple Watch. Silver. Not dirty gold Starlight. Silver.</p>â€” Myke Hamilton (@MykeHamilton) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MykeHamilton/status/1445124986528804878?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 4, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough the Link Bracelet is a stainless steel band designed to twin with a stainless steel Apple Watch, some users have enjoyed using the band with the Silver aluminum Apple Watch in previous years. With Starlight replacing Silver, some users have noted that the cool silver of the Link bracelet now clashes with the warm tone of Starlight.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>I hadnâ€™t realized that this yearâ€™s Apple Watch is only available in Starlight, not silver. That settles that, then! Not something Iâ€™d want to wear at all with my Steel Link band <a href=\"https://t.co/WWKm7Pjdq8\">pic.twitter.com/WWKm7Pjdq8</a></p>â€” Steve Troughton-Smith (@stroughtonsmith) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1446456737234567170?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 8, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOther mismatching band and casing combinations have been noted by users across various social media platforms and websites, with some claiming that the Series 7's colors mismatch with more bands, more severely compared to the color options offered in previous years.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThere is now an unprecedented level of fragmentation with Apple's color options across its product lines. The â€ŒiPhone 13â€Œ and â€ŒApple Watch Series 7â€Œ now contrast with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/\">AirPods Max</a> models, as well as the 24-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a>, with other devices like the â€ŒiPad miniâ€Œ overlapping the divide. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>I think itâ€™s a pretty popular opinion. Colors are a mess this year. The iPad Mini comes in starlight but not in midnight (still space gray), the iPhone 13 comes in both but the starlight seems to be just white and then the Apple Watch comes in midnight and starlight.</p>â€” cedric1997 (@PomerleauCedric) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PomerleauCedric/status/1446167705338490883?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 7, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple effectively now has three separate color palettes for its devices, in addition to the pre-existing tonal differences with the same shade that was common to see with the likes of Space Gray. Other product lines, such as the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, MacBook Pro, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a>, also no longer have any matching colors with the aluminum â€ŒApple Watch Series 7â€Œ or standard â€ŒiPhone 13â€Œ models. This appears to have irked some users who like to have matching colors across multiple Apple devices.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs yet, there are no rumors about what colors Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/14-inch-macbook-pro/\">redesigned MacBook Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/22/gurman-high-end-mac-mini-this-fall/\">Mac mini</a> machines could be available in. When they do arrive, likely at an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/01/potential-october-apple-event-five-things/\">event later this month</a>, there may be some more clarity about Apple's plans for color options going forward.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 7</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/08/customers-unhappy-with-series-7-color-options/\">Some Customers Unhappy With Apple Watch Series 7 Color Options</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/some-customers-unhappy-with-apple-watch-series-7-color-options.2316042/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=MX2OGg6GeVM:zg3l022xA5Y:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=MX2OGg6GeVM:zg3l022xA5Y:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/MX2OGg6GeVM\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ce37815b535158c12cc20ba7790cafcda1acbab1694da765f5e10d51468fda15","category":"Apple"}
