As a civilian, I do not know what it means to go to war. However, as a lifelong cyclist, I do understand the therapeutic benefits of a simple bike ride. I refer to the peace I feel while riding as my Happy Place. The goal of Project VA is to build custom bikes for Veterans so they can find their own Happy Place where they are at peace. I just finished the second of what I hope will be many, and I have made a personal commitment to sponsor a Veteran every year for as long as I can. This project will never reach large numbers of Veterans, but for those sponsored, it has the potential to have a big impact on their life.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1574\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00991.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00991.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00991.jpg?resize=1024,806&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00991.jpg?resize=768,604&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00991.jpg?resize=1800,1417&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00991.jpg?resize=1335,1051&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00991.jpg?resize=700,551&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00991.jpg?resize=1536,1209&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>This year’s recipient is Darvin. Darvin is a Marine and an all-around great guy. I know him from my local bike path along the banks of the Great Miami River. If it is a nice day, it is likely that Darvin will be out enjoying the views along the river on his bike. It is so good to stop and talk to Darvin. So willing to share the history of the area, and stories of his service in the Marines. A few years ago, I noticed that Darvin was having a mechanical issue on the trail. I stopped to help, but his old bike’s components were just worn out. I am so honored that years later Darvin allowed me to be the builder of his dream bike. This year-long experience will be something that both of us will never forget.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00925.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00925.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00925.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00925.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00925.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00925.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00925.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00925.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1738\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00962.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00962.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00962.jpg?resize=1024,890&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00962.jpg?resize=768,667&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00962.jpg?resize=1800,1564&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00962.jpg?resize=1335,1160&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00962.jpg?resize=700,608&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00962.jpg?resize=1536,1335&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00959.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00959.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00959.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00959.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00959.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00959.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00959.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00959.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Darvin requested a road bike for his favorite route along the river. He wanted something comfortable with an upright riding position. Full fenders are a must because a little rain isn’t going to stop Darvin. Darvin was involved in every part of the design of his bike. He even stopped by the Relstone Cycles Garage to roll the radius in his top tube. Together we came up with a design that fit Darvin perfectly. When it came time to choose the paint Darvin pointed to a Sram component box I had laying around. Dark Matter Finishing matched the matte grey with subtle red highlights better than what we imagined.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00919.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00919.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00919.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00919.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00919.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00919.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00919.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00919.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00920.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00920.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00920.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00920.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00920.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00920.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00920.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/06/DSC00920.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>A big part of Project VA is sharing my vision with contacts in the bike industry to see if they are willing to sponsor a Veteran’s bike with the materials and components they make.

The top tube is curved to allow for maximum stand over and a taller head tube for an upright position. The fork features a Pacenti stainless crown, slender raked blades for comfort and double eyelets to allow for twin fender stays.

Also, as a retired machinist, Darvin has appreciation for the craftmanship and time it takes to go from a vision to functional art with sharp silver brazed lug lines. Darvin loves the smoothness of shifting and braking. Most importantly, Darvin had a great custom bike experience over the course of a year and received the bike of his dreams to enjoy.</p>\n<p>I feel so honored to have the opportunity to build this bike for a Veteran and an awesome person. I hope it provides many years of peace and enjoyment in Darvin’s Happy Place along the banks of the Great Miami River.</p>\n<p>-Guy Stone</p>\n<hr />\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>We’d like to thank all of you who <a href=\"mailto:readersrides@theradavist.com\" target=\"_blank\">submitted Readers Rides</a> builds to be shared here at The Radavist.
