Morton had been plagued with punctures, and knee pain led to him swapping out his cycling shoes for a pair of sandals, which stayed with him for much of the trip going through various alterations including cutting off one of the straps and adding carbon insoles, donated by a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cycling-apps/#:~:text=if%20you%E2%80%99re%20into%20long-distance%20racing%2C%20dotwatcher%20is%20a%20must-visit.\" target=\"_blank\">dot watcher</a>.</p>\n<p>When <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/lachlan-morton-podcast/\">BikeRadar spoke to Morton</a> midway through the Alt Tour as part of our <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/tour-de-france-podcast/\">Tour de France podcast series</a>, he had climbed the Alps and the double pass of Mont Ventoux, explaining how he had subsisted on cider, melon and prosciutto.</p>\n\n<p>After the Alps, he still had to tackle the Pyrennes. He had a healthy buffer over the peloton, but he was still riding around 12 hours a day â€“ a necessity to get back up to the north of France and complete the 700km of transfer from the end of Stage 20 and the final stage of the Tour coming into Paris.</p>\n<p>Out of the mountains, Morton remarked that it was practically downhill to Paris, but he was confronted with a virtually never-ending headwind and the ride became as much a mental battle as a physical one.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The ride wasnâ€™t without its difficulties.

This was the longest stage of the route at 579km and helped Morton achieve his goal of doing a day that was as far as the longest ever Tour de France stage â€“ a whopping 428km, which was part of the 1919 edition of the race.</p>\n<p>Morton set out with the intention of riding through the night, which he did coming into Paris in the early hours of the morning.</p>\n<p>Beyond being an epic ride, the Alt Tour was raising funds for World Bicycle Relief, a non-profit organisation that provides bicycles to people in need.</p>\n<p>Rapha and EF-Education Nippo both donated 500 bicycles to the charity, but over the course of the ride, the Alt Tour also raised a staggering Â£356,477 for the organisation, which will go to help 3,000 people.</p>","author":"Stan Portus","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"f09b3067c31de85feb5bd1c67bafa37d4015ac9d8d0dffb0f0524d5a102cfcbb","category":"Cycling"}
