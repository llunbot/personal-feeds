Unlike the last couple of stages, the peloton led by Jumbo-Visma and Movistar wasn’t as keen to let the breakaway ride away with the stage. The breakaway only got about two minutes gap to the peloton behind.</p><p>By the time the race hit the categorie two climb with around 10 km to go Magnus Cort Nielsen (EF Education First-Nippo) decided to leave his breakaway mates behind. Over the top of the climb to Puerto de Locubín Nielsen only held a 23-second advantage over the peloton led by David De La Cruz who attacked the peloton in a hunt for some mountain points.</p><p>At the base of the final wall to the finish with 900 meters to go, Nielsen led by 19 seconds. Sepp Kuss took the peloton into the final climb, but Enric Mas was the one to catch Nielsen in the final meters. The steep slopes of the final climb favoured Roglič who won the stage ahead of the two riders from Movistar.</p><hr><div><div><p>La Vuelta ciclista a España (2.UWT) <span>Antequera → Valdepeñas de Jaén</span></p></div><p><img src=\"https://www.procyclingstats.com/images/riders/cw/cc/primoz-roglic-2021.jpeg\"></p></div></div></div>","author":"Abby Mickey","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"3f3f60a691918f2cedc42dc160e7ed7672ec9840d4908222511011d56cdac62d","category":"Cycling"}
