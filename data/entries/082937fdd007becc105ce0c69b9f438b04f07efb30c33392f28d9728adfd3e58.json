Sometimes these come with restrictions, like <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/qualcomm-huawei-tech/qualcomm-receives-u-s-permission-to-sell-4g-chips-to-huawei-in-exception-to-ban-idUSKBN27U0MW/\">Qualcomm's license</a>, which allowed it to ship smartphone chips to Huawei, but not \"5G\" chips. That led to Qualcomm creating special <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/07/huaweis-latest-flagship-phone-has-harmonyos-a-qualcomm-soc-and-no-5g/\">4G-only versions</a> of its 5G chips for Huawei, and the company ended up with 4G-only Snapdragon 888 phones in 2021.</p>\n<p>Since then, Huawei has been working on its own Arm chips from its chip design division, HiSilicon. In April, the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/huawei-phone-has-a-pop-out-camera-lens-just-like-a-point-and-shoot-camera/\">Huawei Pura 70</a> smartphone launched with an in-house HiSilicon Kirin 9010 SoC made at SMIC, a Chinese chip fab that is also facing export restrictions. With what is probably still a<a href=\"https://www.techinsights.com/blog/techinsights-finds-smic-7nm-n2-huawei-mate-60-pro\"> 7 nm manufacturing process</a>, it's <a href=\"https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_matepad_pro_13_2-review-2644p4.php#pt\">more of a 2020 chip</a> than a 2024 chip, but that's still fast enough for many use cases.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022821#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022821&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"082937fdd007becc105ce0c69b9f438b04f07efb30c33392f28d9728adfd3e58","category":"Tech"}
