The feature appears to use <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/image-playground/\">Image Playground</a>, and there will be ‌Image Playground‌ style options that include Animation, Illustration, and Sketch.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Messages backgrounds will be customizable on a per-conversation basis, so <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, and Mac users will be able to set a different background for each of their message threads. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> previously said that the backgrounds will sync between all participants in a Messages conversation. So if you set a specific background for an iMessage chat with a friend, the friend will see the same background.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOther messaging apps like WhatsApp support custom background options, so Apple is playing catch-up with the new Messages app background feature.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Messages app is also set to gain support for polls, automatic translation for incoming messages in other languages, and the option to create <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/genmoji/\">Genmoji</a> by combining two existing standard emoji. Apple plans to call the ‌Genmoji‌ mixing feature \"Mixmoji.\" With this feature, you will be able to combine two emoji such as cake and balloons into a new emoji that features a cake and a balloon for a celebration.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has other AI features in the works, such as an Apple Intelligence-powered version of the Shortcuts app. Apple could call the new Shortcuts option \"Generative Shortcuts,\" and it appears it will use natural language to help users create powerful multi-step shortcut actions.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌iOS 26‌ and the new Messages features will be shown off at <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/wwdc/\">WWDC 2025</a>, which is set to begin on Monday, June 9 with a 10:00 a.m. keynote event.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/\">iOS 26</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/06/ios-26-ai-backgrounds-mixmoji/\">iOS 26 Getting Custom AI-Generated Message Backgrounds, Generative Shortcuts and 'Mixmoji'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-26-getting-custom-ai-generated-message-backgrounds-generative-shortcuts-and-mixmoji.2458311/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5f251b92f820f1ce49ec87046b79531f06cdab36edbd4514051c7bd763ca1292","category":"Apple"}
