Also, like the carbon bike, it has the top-tube integrated MasterMind Control Unit and in-built display.</p>\n<p>The down tube of the Turbo Levo Comp Alloy model houses Specialized’s 700Wh battery, while the Turbo Levo Alloy gets a 500Wh version.</p>\n<h3>Progressive suspension</h3>\n<p>Also like the carbon fibre bike, the alloy version has 150mm of rear-wheel travel that’s been tuned to offer small-bump compliance with plenty of support in compressions, while pedalling well.</p>\n<p>It has the same suspension kinematics, where according to Specialized’s leverage rate graph, the rear end is roughly 22 per cent progressive, and for 45mm of its travel, it has a rearward axle path.</p>\n<h3>Geometry adjustment</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> In-built chainstay protection and geometry adjustment feature on the alloy version of the Turbo Levo.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Specialized</i></span></div>\n<p>Following the trend of not bucking it, the alloy version inherits the carbon bike’s geometry adjustability, too. This is done via a flip chip on the chainstay/seatstay pivot that alters the bottom-bracket height between high and low.</p>\n<p>There’s also an offset headset cup that can be rotated through 180 degrees for slack or steep head angles, and a neutral cup for the middle setting.</p>\n<p>Head angles can be adjusted between 63 and 65.5 degrees and bottom-bracket heights by 7mm depending on setting.</p>\n<div>\n                <table><caption>2022 Specialized Turbo Levo Alloy geometry</caption>\n                <colgroup><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>﻿Size</th><th>S1</th><th>S2</th><th>S3</th><th>S4</th><th>S5</th><th>S6</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Stack (mm)</td><td>605</td><td>617</td><td>626</td><td>635</td><td>644</td><td>653</td>        </tr><tr><td>Reach (mm)</td><td>412</td><td>432</td><td>452</td><td>477</td><td>502</td><td>532</td>        </tr><tr><td>Head tube length (mm)</td><td>105</td><td>105</td><td>115</td><td>125</td><td>135</td><td>145</td>        </tr><tr><td>Head tube angle (degrees)</td><td>64.5</td><td>64.5</td><td>64.5</td><td>64.5</td><td>64.5</td><td>64.5</td>        </tr><tr><td>BB height (mm)</td><td>352</td><td>350</td><td>350</td><td>350</td><td>350</td><td>350</td>        </tr><tr><td>BB drop (mm)</td><td>25</td><td>27</td><td>27</td><td>27</td><td>27</td><td>27</td>        </tr><tr><td>Front centre (mm)</td><td>738</td><td>760</td><td>784</td><td>814</td><td>843</td><td>878</td>        </tr><tr><td>Chainstay (mm)</td><td>442</td><td>442</td><td>442</td><td>442</td><td>442</td><td>442</td>        </tr><tr><td>Wheelbase (mm)</td><td>1,179</td><td>1,200</td><td>1,225</td><td>1,255</td><td>1,284</td><td>1,318</td>        </tr><tr><td>Standover (mm)</td><td>752</td><td>776</td><td>783</td><td>787</td><td>788</td><td>790</td>        </tr><tr><td>Seat tube length (mm)</td><td>380</td><td>390</td><td>405</td><td>425</td><td>445</td><td>465</td>        </tr><tr><td>Seat tube angle (degrees)</td><td>78</td><td>77.2</td><td>76.7</td><td>76.2</td><td>76.2</td><td>76.2</td>        </tr></tbody></table></div>\n\n<p>Just like the carbon bike, there are six sizes, using Specialized’s S-Sizing, where the focus is on keeping standover heights low (from 752mm for the S1 to 790mm for the S6), but making the bikes longer so shorter people can ride bigger bikes, if they choose.</p>\n<p>Seat tube angles sit around the 76.5-degree mark depending on size, and are suitably steep for comfortable climbing.</p>\n<h2>2022 Specialized Turbo Levo Alloy motor and battery</h2>\n<p>Continuing the theme, the Turbo Levo Alloy is fitted with Specialized’s 90Nm and 565W Turbo Full Power 2.2 motor with upgraded drive belt.</p>\n<p>The high-capacity 700Wh battery is fitted to the Turbo Levo Alloy Comp, while the Turbo Levo Alloy gets a 500Wh version.</p>\n<p>According to Specialized, its Smart Control system – where you can plug your ride data into its app – will help prevent you from running out of battery by selecting the most suitable assistance mode to conserve battery life.</p>\n<p>The 700Wh battery is claimed to support you for up to five hours of ride time, slightly shorter than the Turbo Levo S-Works’ 5.5 hours.</p>\n<p>Like the carbon bike, the aluminium model has all the connectivity (ANT+, Bluetooth) and display functionality on its in-built TCU.</p>\n<h2>2022 Specialized Turbo Levo Alloy models, specifications and pricing</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Hopefully, the new Turbo Levoy Alloy can be ridden as hard as its S-Works family member.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Specialized</i></span></div>\n<p>The two-bike range of aluminium Turbo Levo models is intended to make the Turbo Levo experience more affordable without sacrificing performance.</p>\n<p>The base Turbo Levo Alloy is fitted with a RockShox 35 Silver fork, that uses a similar chassis to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/rockshox-debonair-spring-2021/\">Pike</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/forks/suspension-forks/2021-rockshox-lyrik-ultimate-fork-review/\">Lyrik</a> forks, but foregoes the sophisticated Charger damper. Out back, it’s fitted with a RockShox Deluxe Select R rear shock.</p>\n<p>Drivetrain duties are taken care of by SRAM’s SX and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-mountain/sram-nx-eagle-review/\">NX Eagle 12-speed</a> mix, while it has SRAM Guide RE brakes that use a Guide lever blade but Code calipers. It’s fitted with a host of aluminium Specialized finishing kit.</p>\n<p>The control system and user interface don’t use Specialized’s MasterMind TCU seen on the carbon bikes, however. Instead, the previous generation’s TCU is used, with a 10-LED charger display and 3-LED ride mode display. It does have the all-new 2.2 motor, although this is plugged into a 500Wh battery.</p>\n<p>The Turbo Levo Alloy retails for £5,250.</p>\n<p>The Turbo Levo Comp Alloy does get the MasterMind TCU and 700Wh battery, however.</p>\n<p>Spec-wise, it’s a significant leap from the base model and is fitted with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/forks/suspension-forks/2021-fox-36-factory-grip2-fork-review/\">Fox’s 36</a> Rhythm fork with GRIP damper. Out-back is a Fox Float X Performance rear shock (except for the S1 size that gets a DPS Performance damper).</p>\n<p>It’s fitted with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/groupset-mountain/sram-gx-eagle-12-speed-drivetrain-review/\">SRAM’s GX Eagle 12-speed drivetrain</a> and Code R brakes.

Retailing for £5,765, it’s fitted with a Fox 38 Performance Elite fork and DHX2 rear shock, along with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/shimano-du-ep800-motor/\">Shimano’s EP-8 motor</a>.</p>\n<p>It also butts heads with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/nukeproof-megawatt-297-factory-review/\">Nukeproof’s MegaWatt</a> Elite, which costs £5,999 but is specced with the Shimano EP-8 and Performance Elite series 38 fork and X2 rear shock.

Even the middle model – the Rise H15 – that’s decked out with a Fox 36 is remarkably similar in terms of intentions to the Turbo Levo Comp Alloy.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Rise H has true trail-bike geometry.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Orbea</i></span></div>\n<p>That is until you look at the geometry, where the Turbo Levo is bounds ahead of the Rise.
