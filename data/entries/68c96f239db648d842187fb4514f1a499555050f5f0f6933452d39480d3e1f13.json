On Thursday, Google dropped its latest party trick: <a href=\"https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/thinking-mode\">Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental</a>, which is a new AI model that uses runtime \"reasoning\" techniques similar to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/12/openais-new-200-mo-chatgpt-subscription-will-buy-you-more-compute-time/\">OpenAI's o1</a> to achieve \"deeper thinking\" on problems fed into it.</p>\n<p>The experimental model builds on Google's newly released <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/google-goes-agentic-with-gemini-2-0s-ambitious-ai-agent-features/\">Gemini 2.0 Flash</a> and runs on its AI Studio platform, but early tests <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/19/google-releases-its-own-reasoning-ai-model/\">conducted</a> by TechCrunch reporter Kyle Wiggers reveal accuracy issues with some basic tasks, such as incorrectly counting that the word \"strawberry\" contains two R's.</p>\n<p>These so-called reasoning models differ from standard AI models by incorporating feedback loops of self-checking mechanisms, similar to techniques we <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/hype-grows-over-autonomous-ai-agents-that-loop-gpt-4-outputs/\">first saw in early 2023</a> with hobbyist projects like \"Baby AGI.\" The process requires more computing time, often adding extra seconds or minutes to response times. Companies have turned to reasoning models as traditional scaling methods at training time have been showing diminishing returns.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/not-to-be-outdone-by-openai-google-releases-its-own-reasoning-ai-model/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/12/not-to-be-outdone-by-openai-google-releases-its-own-reasoning-ai-model/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"68c96f239db648d842187fb4514f1a499555050f5f0f6933452d39480d3e1f13","category":"Tech"}
