The company also confirmed that Roku OS 10.5 will begin rolling out “in the coming weeks,” bringing new audio features and improved search and voice capabilities to compatible Roku devices.</p>\n<p>The Roku Mobile app also boasts a few new functions, including a feature to fix audio delays on wireless earbuds paired to Roku streamers. We also have a preview of a new wireless soundbar from TCL and a refresh to the Walmart-exclusive Roku Ultra LT.</p>\n<h2>Roku OS 10.5 and the Roku Mobile app</h2>\n<p>Sound is a big theme in Roku’s latest release. The mobile app’s new audio/video sound sync feature is aimed at fixing delays for those using wireless headphones with their Rokus. It works by first attempting to fix sync issues automatically, via a headphone-specific troubleshooter. If the issue persists, users can activate their smartphone camera from within the Roku app to visually assist in syncing audio. A preloaded video will play on-screen as it instructs you to point the phone camera at it to allow the app to attempt to properly sync the audio and video.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1796513#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1796513&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Corey Gaskin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"05b00ce7f3414612d2aa3125f371e455e64ffe04531b989dc2884b3d6560fd84","category":"Tech"}
