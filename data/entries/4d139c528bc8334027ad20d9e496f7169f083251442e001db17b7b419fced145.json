{"title":"Apple Announces, With Much Surprise, Mac Studios With M4 Max and M3 Ultra (!) Chips","link":"https://sixcolors.com/post/2025/03/new-mac-studio-spans-the-generations-with-m4-max-m3-ultra-chips/","date":1741227955000,"content":"\n<p>Jason Snell, at Six Colors:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>With the <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/11/m4-mac-mini-review-phenomenal-cosmic-power-itty-bitty-form-factor/\">M4 Mac mini</a> being <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/11/indecision-at-the-intersection-of-mac-studio-and-mac-mini/\">powerfully tempting</a> for\ndesktop Mac users who crave power, Apple has upgraded the Mac\nStudio to blast past the mini in terms of performance. The base\nmodel, still starting at $1999, is powered by the M4 Max chip\npreviously available only in the <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/11/m4-m4-pro-macbook-pro-review-brighter-clearer-faster/\">M4 MacBook Pro</a>. And the\nnew high-end Mac Studio, starting at the same $3999 price tag, is\npowered by a monstrous chip with 32 CPU cores (including 24\nperformance cores) and up to 80 GPU cores. It’s a chip never seen\nbefore anywhere — the M3 Ultra.</p>\n\n<p>You heard me. For Apple’s fastest Mac ever — and it’s clear that\nit will be — Apple’s shipping a chip based on two high-end chips\n(fused together with Apple’s UltraFusion technology) from Apple’s\nprevious processor generation. Weird, right? It seems like a few\nthings are going on here: first, that the development of the Ultra\nchip takes longer and that Apple won’t commit to shipping an Ultra\nchip in every chip generation. Second, that the first-generation\nthree-nanometer chip process of Apple’s chipmaking partner, TSMC,\nisn’t as dead and buried as generally thought. Just this week\nApple also introduced an iPad Air with an M3 processor, and of\ncourse the <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2024/10/ipad-mini-2024-review-a-familiar-friend-gets-an-a-i-refresh/\">new iPad mini</a> shipped with an A17 Pro processor\nbased on the same process.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This M3/M4 generational fork — the M3 Ultra chip debuting in new Mac Studio models alongside the M4 Max — was so unexpected that, during my embargoed press briefing about the news yesterday, I thought the Apple rep misspoke when he said M3, not M4, for the Ultra models. But no, the Ultra chip really is a generation behind. When asked the obvious question — why — Apple’s answer was straightforward: the Ultra chips take a lot longer to engineer.</p>\n\n<p>The M4 Max Studio models are, computationally, equivalent (exactly, I think) with the M4 Max MacBook Pros <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/10/new-macbook-pro-features-m4-family-of-chips-and-apple-intelligence/\">that debuted October 30</a>, maxing out (no pun intended) at 16 CPU cores, 40 GPU cores, 8 TB of storage, and 128 GB of RAM. The M4 Max Studio models start at $2,000, but that starting price only gets you a 14-core CPU, 32-core GPU, 16-core Neural Engine, 512 GB of storage, and a measly 36 GB of RAM.</p>\n\n<p>The intriguing M3 Ultra models start at $4,000, which gets you a 28-core CPU, 60-core GPU, 32-core Neural Engine, 1 TB of storage, and a healthy 96 GB of RAM. Available upgrades to, uh, ultra out the Ultra models:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>32-core CPU + 80-core GPU: +$1,500</li>\n<li>256 GB of RAM: +$1,600</li>\n<li>512 GB of RAM: +$4,000 (only available with the 32-core CPU/80-core GPU)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>SSD storage options for the Ultra models go up to 16 TB (a cool $4,600 over the base storage).</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/05/apple-announces-with-much-surprise-mac-studios-with-m4-max-and-m3-ultra-chips\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"4d139c528bc8334027ad20d9e496f7169f083251442e001db17b7b419fced145","category":"Tech"}
