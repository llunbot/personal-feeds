Based in Squamish, B.C., the crew at 7mesh ride in all kinds of weather and temperatures, and their new WTV 200 garments provide lightweight, breathable options for cool days on the trails or roads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>7mesh’s new WTV 200 is a lower-loft version of their existing WTV fabric (which is used on the <strong><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/7mesh-wtv-chilco-anorak-lizard-skinz-monitor-3-szn-gloves-review/\">Chilco Anorak</a></strong> I reviewed last Spring). 7mesh is offering a new jacket, hoody, and jersey featuring the new WTV 200. Aside from the WTV 200 garments, the Mission Jacket is one new piece from 7mesh’s Fall/Winter collection, offering lightweight weather protection for road riders.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>7mesh WTV 200 Fabric:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-WTV-200-graphic.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"721\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-WTV-200-graphic.jpg\" alt=\"7mesh WTV 200 fabric graphic\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-WTV-200-graphic.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-WTV-200-graphic-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-WTV-200-graphic-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-WTV-200-graphic-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Featured on the Spruce Jacket, Spruce Hoody, and Tantalus Jersey, the new WTV 200 fabric offers cool weather performance and light weather protection. WTV 200 is made from 92% recycled polyester, and is 100% PFAS and PFC free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The big difference between 7mesh’s original WTV fabric and the new WTV 200 is its construction. The materials used are the same between the two, but the WTV 200 offers a lower loft design that traps less air than the thicker original fabric (now referred to as WTV 300). The WTV 200’s tighter waffle construction vents more heat and moisture, so it performs better in high-output situations.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Spruce Jacket:</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-Spruce-jacket-woman-MTB-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-Spruce-jacket-woman-MTB-jpg.webp\" alt=\"7mesh Spruce Jacket, MTB\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-Spruce-jacket-woman-MTB-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-Spruce-jacket-woman-MTB-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-Spruce-jacket-woman-MTB-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-Spruce-jacket-woman-MTB-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-Spruce-jacket-woman-MTB-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-Spruce-jacket-woman-MTB-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Spruce Jacket is a mid-weight jacket designed to make an ideal mid-layer for frigid rides or an outer layer for Spring or Fall temperatures. This jacket offers a trim fit with an articulated shape and is intended for road, gravel, or MTB riders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Spruce Jacket features a full-length zipper for convenience and quick venting. Up top you’ll find a fleece-lined medium height collar. Its elastic-bound cuffs are designed to stay in place when pushed up your arm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In nasty weather conditions, the Spruce Jacket’s back and side hem drawcords can cinch it down tight and keep the wind at bay. For storage, the jacket includes a zippered inside rear pocket with two inner compartments and hand-friendly soft linings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>7mesh lists the Spruce Jacket’s weight at 330g (men’s) or 315g (women’s). It is available in men’s and women’s sizes XS-XXL. Men’s color options are Black or Raisin, and women’s color choices are Black or Trail Mix. MSRP is $160.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Spruce Hoody:</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-Spruce-Hoody-raisin-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-Spruce-Hoody-raisin-jpg.webp\" alt=\"7mesh Spruce Hoody, Raisin color\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-Spruce-Hoody-raisin-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-Spruce-Hoody-raisin-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-Spruce-Hoody-raisin-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-Spruce-Hoody-raisin-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-Spruce-Hoody-raisin-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-Spruce-Hoody-raisin-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption><em>I’m expecting to receive a Spruce hoody for testing soon, so watch Bikerumor for a late-season review! </em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Also intended for all kinds of riding, the Spruce Hoody offers a hooded version of the jacket above in a relaxed fit. It includes many of the same features and similarly works well as either a mid-layer or an outer layer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The hoody includes the same full-length zipper and elastic-bound cuffs as the Spruce Jacket. The waist is also elasticized to keep the hoody close fitting and keep the wind out. The hood features an elastic binding to ensure a snug fit, and the collar gets a fleece chin guard for comfort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Spruce hoody offers two zippered side pockets with soft interior fabric. The pockets are anchored to the body so they won’t flop around with cargo inside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>7mesh’s Spruce Hoody weighs 390g/385g (men’s/women’s). Sizes XS-XXL are available for men and women. Men’s color options are Black, Raisin, or Bamboo, while women’s models come in Black or Bamboo. The Spruce Hoody retails for $180.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tantalus Jersey:</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-Tantalus-jersey-female-rider-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"1800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-Tantalus-jersey-female-rider-jpg.webp\" alt=\"7mesh Tantalus jersey, female rider\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-Tantalus-jersey-female-rider-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-Tantalus-jersey-female-rider-200x300.webp 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-Tantalus-jersey-female-rider-80x120.webp 80w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-Tantalus-jersey-female-rider-768x1152.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-Tantalus-jersey-female-rider-1024x1536.webp 1024w\" /></a><figcaption><em>The Tantalus Jersey is also shown in the article’s title shot.</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Tantalus Jersey offers the new WTV 200 fabric in a snug, articulated ‘skin fit’ long-sleeved jersey. Intended for road riding the Tantalus Jersey is ideal as a first layer, but its full front zipper makes it easy to add over a thin jersey for extra warmth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This jersey offers a fleece-lined mid-height collar with a fleece chin guard, and at the bottom, an elastic hem with a silicone gripper keeps it from shifting around. The Tantalus Jersey includes 7mesh’s Anything Pocket System, with three large pockets across the lower back. A reflective logo on the rear pocket adds a little low-light visibility. The jersey weighs 320g (men’s) or 290g (women’s).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Men’s color choices are Black, Bamboo, or Alpine, while ladies can pick between Bamboo or Alpine. Sizes for both range from XS-XXL. The Tantalus Jersey sells for $180.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>7mesh Fall/Winter 2024 Collection: Mission Jacket</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-Mission-jacket-two-riders-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-Mission-jacket-two-riders-jpg.webp\" alt=\"7mesh Mission Jacket, road riders\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-Mission-jacket-two-riders-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-Mission-jacket-two-riders-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-Mission-jacket-two-riders-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-Mission-jacket-two-riders-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-Mission-jacket-two-riders-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-Mission-jacket-two-riders-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For road riders, the Mission Jacket is a lightweight, soft-touch stretchy jacket intended for cold-weather riding. This jacket is waterproof, fully seam taped, and made from a PFAS-free monolithic PU membrane shell. The face and backer are made from 100% recycled polyester. 7mesh’s crew has been testing this fabric over the last few years, and one thing they note is that it doesn’t make noise when it’s flapping in the wind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A two-way watertight zipper allows you to dump heat quickly and easily, and rear/side vents let body heat escape while you ride. When you’re looking to keep warmth in and wind out, Smoothlock adjustable drawcords at the side hem keep the jacket fitting snug.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-Mission-jacket-on-male-rider-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-Mission-jacket-on-male-rider-jpg.webp\" alt=\"7mesh Mission Jacket, on rider\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-Mission-jacket-on-male-rider-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-Mission-jacket-on-male-rider-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-Mission-jacket-on-male-rider-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-Mission-jacket-on-male-rider-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-Mission-jacket-on-male-rider-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-Mission-jacket-on-male-rider-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Mission Jacket offers a trim fit with an articulated road riding position and is intended to be layered over a tight-fitting jersey. For storage, it includes three rear jersey-style cargo pockets with free-floating bottom sections inspired by 7mesh’s Anything System pockets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This jacket also features a minimalist version of 7mesh’s StashSystem so you can stuff it into its back pocket and strap it to your frame when not needed. Final details include stretch cuffs, plus a reflective rear panel (and logos) to keep you visible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A size medium jacket weighs just 175g (women’s model) or 185g (men’s model). Men’s and women’s sizes range from XS-XXL, and both are available in black only. MSRP is $350.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-Fall-winter-collection-riders.jpg\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-Fall-winter-collection-riders.jpg\" alt=\"7mesh Fall/winter collection, MTB riders\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-Fall-winter-collection-riders.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-Fall-winter-collection-riders-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-Fall-winter-collection-riders-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-Fall-winter-collection-riders-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-Fall-winter-collection-riders-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/7mesh-Fall-winter-collection-riders-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Images c. 7mesh</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Visit 7mesh’s website to check out the rest of their recently announced Fall/Winter lineup. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://7mesh.com/\"><em>7mesh.com</em></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/7mesh-fall-winter-collection-new-wtv-200-garments/\">7mesh Follows Up Fall/Winter Collection With New WTV 200 Garments</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Steve Fisher","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"26c4bf09a58857fcee95df012997a1c6681b91146a1db40d4a50e618bff06c07","category":"Cycling"}
