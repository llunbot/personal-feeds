As we have now passed the watershed opening to the transfer market on 1st August, moves can start to be revealed publicly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means teams and riders can finally put us out of our misery and share the news of their new team for 2025, but the rumours keep on circling until all rosters are filled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the men, Simon Yates and Jai Hindley are among the hottest properties on the transfer market this year. There are also plenty of rumours brewing around riders cutting ties early, however. On the women’s side, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-femmes\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de France Femmes</a> champion Demi Vollering is expected to move away from SD Worx-Protime, Visma-Lease a Bike are rumoured to be signing MTB World and Olympics champ Pauline Ferrand-Prévot, and Elisa Longo Borghini is on the market.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Confirmed: Simon Yates to Visma-Lease a Bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2160425177-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"simon yates visma\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2160425177-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2160425177-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2160425177-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2160425177-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2160425177-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2160425177-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2160425177-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2160425177-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2160425177-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/GettyImages-2160425177-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Dario Belingheri/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It has been formally announced this week that <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/simon-yates-profile\" target=\"_blank\">Simon Yates’s</a> next destination will be Visma-Lease a Bike. The British rider has penned a contract with the team until 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite previous interest from Israel-Premier Tech, Dutch squad <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/visma-lease-a-bike\" target=\"_blank\">Visma-Lease a Bike</a> won the hunt for Yates’s signature after a lacklustre performance at the 2024 Tour de France. Much like his brother <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/adam-yates-profile\" target=\"_blank\">Adam</a> at UAE, Simon will be hoping to star in a powerful mountain train at future Tours de France.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Visma-Lease a Bike director Grischa Niermann said that Yates would provide ‘a significant boost for the general classification squad. Simon will have the opportunity to go for his own results with us, but he will also be a valuable asset for the team in the mountains.’ </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After ten years spent at the Jayco-AlUla, this will mark the end of one of cycling’s longest-running partnerships, which saw Yates claim a Vuelta a España victory and a Giro d’Italia podium.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a quest to strengthen its grip on the Classics, Visma-Lease a Bike has also announced the signing of French rider Alex Zingle from Cofidis.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n

announced that they will replace Simon Yates with Perth-born Ben O’Connor. High in confidence from a fourth-place finish at the Giro in May, O’Connor will lead Jayco-AlUla’s Tour de France hopes for at least the next two seasons. Despite his Australian nationality, O’Connor has never ridden for<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/jayco-alula\" target=\"_blank\"> the GreenEdge project</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘To be honest, it’s really an idea I’ve always loved; to race as an Aussie and win on an Aussie team,’ O’Connor told the press following the announcement on Thursday. ‘I’m at a point now where I need to deliver, so it’ll be even more special to do it with an Australian set-up. To have the opportunity to race with mates at the top level is rare, and I am just so keen to get stuck in.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>O’Connor will leave Decathlon-AG2R after securing two Grand Tour top five finishes at the team.

For 2025, they have added two names to bolster their roster even further: Jhonatan Narváez and Florian Vermeersch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Narváez recently upset <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tadej-pogacar\" target=\"_blank\">Tadej Pogačar</a> at the Giro to take the victory on Stage 1, outsprinting his future teammate to claim the first pink jersey. The Ecuadorian also has strong results in the cobbled Classics and offers a strong card to play in the Ardennes. Narváez will depart an Ineos Grenadiers team that he has been a part of for five years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Florian Vermeersch has also been brought into UAE Team Emirates from Lotto-Dstny to fight for Classics wins and support stage race teams according to UAE’s announcement. The Belgian scored a big result at the 2021 Paris-Roubaix, finishing in second place. He has also made the podium of the UCI Gravel World Championships and the Renewi Tour since that breakthrough. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Confirmed: Bob Jungels and Victor Langelotti to Ineos Grenadiers</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-08-02T150814.044-970x647.png\" alt=\"bob jungels ineos\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-08-02T150814.044-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-08-02T150814.044-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-08-02T150814.044-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-08-02T150814.044-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-08-02T150814.044-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-08-02T150814.044-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-08-02T150814.044-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-08-02T150814.044-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-08-02T150814.044-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-08-02T150814.044.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Bob Jungels made a major breakthrough during the mid-2010s. The Luxembourger finished inside the top ten at the Giro on two occasions, then he added Liège-Bastogne-Liège to his <em>palmarès</em>. Since then, it’s been turbulent. However, a stage win at the 2022 Tour de France showed us that he isn’t done yet. It has now been confirmed that Jungels will make the move to Ineos Grenadiers for 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scott Drawer, Ineos’s performance director, said that Jungels is ‘a very popular guy and in all our discussions he’s been very impressive. His approach to the sport, and what he believes he’ll bring to the team, align perfectly with our goals for the future and what we want to achieve together.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more surprising Ineos transfer is Victor Langelotti. The 29-year-old Monégasque rider will move across from the second-tier team Burgos-BH. He is a strong climber who has shown some solid results in second-tier races across Europe.

Pidcock is also already a Red Bull UK athlete and works closely with the brand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lidl-Trek have received a big budget increase too, plus Trek already have a mountain bike team and the squad have added more multi-discipline riders over the past two seasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These rumours come alongside Pauline Ferrand-Prévot’s Ineos odeparture. The women’s cross-country World and Olympic champion will reportedly move to Visma-Lease a Bike to return to road racing, with her sights set on the Tour de France.

The potential arrival of Demi Vollering and the current rise of French climber <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/evita-muzic-interview\" target=\"_blank\">Évita Muzic</a> threaten Uttrup Ludwig’s niche within the team. Chiara Consonni, already a stage winner at the<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-d-italia-women-route-live-coverage-prize-money-teams\" target=\"_blank\"> Giro d’Italia Women</a>, is also linked to Canyon-SRAM.
