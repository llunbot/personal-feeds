{"title":"Silca Launches Elettrico Micro & Ultimate Electric Pumps, U.S. Misses Out Due to Tariffs","link":"https://bikerumor.com/silca-launches-elettrico-micro-ultimate-electric-pumps-u-s-misses-out-due-to-tariffs/","date":1745515609000,"content":"<p><img src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Silca-Elettrico-micro-pumps3-1536x1024.webp\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" alt=\"Silca Elettrico micro pumps\" /></p>\n<p>Electric mini pumps are hot right now, and not just because the tiny devices are working hard to inflate your tires. Offering effortless inflation that fits in your pocket, most of these devices can inflate multiple tires on a single charge. While brands like <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/sea-otter-day-favorites-jordan-villella/\">Viair</a> have the jump on others with products like the Recon Mini, it’s not surprising to see brands like Silca come out with their own electric mini pumps. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately for us in the United States, we’ll be out of luck after the initial run of 100 pumps sells out. Silca says this is due to the fact that a 5-day production delay took them from squeezing in on a 50% tariff, to the following orders ballooning to 145%. Silca could decide not to sell them at wholesale to shops and distributors and just sell them direct with increased cost, but they didn’t feel that would be right (and would struggle with the cash flow hit just to get the pumps to port), so the choice was made to launch them internationally, but not here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Less than 100 of that first batch that they managed to get here before the pricing increased are currently available for sale on the Silca site. Once they’re gone, that’s it until the tariff situation returns to normal. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Elettrico Ultimate &amp; Micro Pumps</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Offered in two versions, Silca will have a slightly larger pump called the Elettrico Ultimate, and a smaller, lighter version called the Micro. Both work with Presta or Schrader valves out of the box, and are threaded to work with Silca Shradero or HIro Locking air chucks. Both also include an extension air hose with a Presta adapter for the hose, and a ball needle. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly, Silca claims the Elettrico is quieter than the competition with a noise rating of 4-8db. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Silca-ultimate-inflator-psi-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"2304\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Silca-ultimate-inflator-psi-1536x2304.webp\" alt=\"Silca Elettrico micro pumps psi\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Silca-ultimate-inflator-psi-1536x2304.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Silca-ultimate-inflator-psi-200x300.webp 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Silca-ultimate-inflator-psi-80x120.webp 80w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Silca-ultimate-inflator-psi-768x1152.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Silca-ultimate-inflator-psi-1024x1536.webp 1024w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Silca-ultimate-inflator-psi-1365x2048.webp 1365w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Silca-ultimate-inflator-psi-scaled.webp 1707w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Elettrico_ULTIMATE_Accessories_1080x504_DSC_3262.webp\"><img width=\"1080\" height=\"504\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Elettrico_ULTIMATE_Accessories_1080x504_DSC_3262.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Elettrico_ULTIMATE_Accessories_1080x504_DSC_3262.webp 1080w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Elettrico_ULTIMATE_Accessories_1080x504_DSC_3262-297x139.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Elettrico_ULTIMATE_Accessories_1080x504_DSC_3262-120x56.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Elettrico_ULTIMATE_Accessories_1080x504_DSC_3262-768x358.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ultimate has a larger 600mAh USB-C rechargeable battery, but it also has a display and buttons to allow you to fine-tune the pressure in 1psi increments. Weighing in at 222g, charging is said to take 1 hour, and the pump can fill 8-9 road tires, or 3-5 gravel/MTB tires per charge. If you want a pump that you can dial in the exact pressure up to 100 psi, you will want the Ultimate which sells for $149, for now…</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC00363-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC00363-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"Silca Elettrico micro pumps\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC00363-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC00363-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC00363-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC00363-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC00363-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC00363-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC00363-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Micro, on the other hand, eliminates the display and the ability to fine-tune the pressure. Instead, it has an auto shut-off at 72psi for safety on hookless rims. If you want to inflate your tire to less than 72 psi, it seems you’ll just have to get it close and guess based on the feel. Or carry a separate gauge. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Elettrico_MICRO_accessories_1080x617_DSC_3243.webp\"><img width=\"1080\" height=\"617\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Elettrico_MICRO_accessories_1080x617_DSC_3243.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Elettrico_MICRO_accessories_1080x617_DSC_3243.webp 1080w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Elettrico_MICRO_accessories_1080x617_DSC_3243-297x170.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Elettrico_MICRO_accessories_1080x617_DSC_3243-120x69.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Elettrico_MICRO_accessories_1080x617_DSC_3243-768x439.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Micro is about half the weight, though, at 111g, which makes it lighter than many CO2 setups. The 400mAh battery is USB-C rechargeable in 25 minutes and will fill up to 3 road tires per charge. Pricing for the Micro is set at $119 – though it’s already sold out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://silca.cc/products/elettrico-mini-inflator?variant=52441064800627\" target=\"_blank\">silca.cc</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/silca-launches-elettrico-micro-ultimate-electric-pumps-u-s-misses-out-due-to-tariffs/\">Silca Launches Elettrico Micro &amp; Ultimate Electric Pumps, U.S. Misses Out Due to Tariffs</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"af3f94eb004f3cc8c71ad04a58c28ea80472231488dead61275005256a6b049d","category":"Cycling"}
