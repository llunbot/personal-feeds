{"title":"Gurman: Apple Is Readying System to Apply Software Updates to Still-in-Box iPhones","link":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-15/apple-october-2023-executive-promotions-new-vps-of-retail-software-operations-lnrh4t94","date":1697664941000,"content":"\n<p>Mark Gurman, in his weekly Power On column for Bloomberg:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When a customer buys a new iPhone from an Apple retail store, the \ndevice sometimes comes with outdated software. For instance, the \nfirst iPhone 15 models out of the factory shipped with iOS 17, but \niOS 17.0.1 was already available by the time the devices were \navailable for purchase. Buying a new iPhone without the latest \nsoftware isn’t ideal, especially if there are some high-profile \nbugs. But that situation is about to change. </p>\n\n<p>Apple is planning a new system for its retail stores that will \nupdate the software on iPhones prior to sale. The company has \ndeveloped a proprietary pad-like device that the store can place \nboxes of iPhones on top of. That system can then wirelessly turn \non the iPhone, update its software and then power it back down — \nall without the phone’s packaging ever being opened. The company \naims to begin rolling this out to its stores before the end of \nthe year. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Fascinating idea, but I have so many questions. What exactly is the trigger here? Something related to MagSafe? When the system is put into place, will it work with existing still-in-the-box iPhones or will it only work with <em>new</em> units, that ship from the factory running iOS 17.2 or whatever? Will the same system eventually come to other products, like iPads and Apple Watches? Maybe even Macs?</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/10/18/gurman-inbox-software-update\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"38b2392ccd2198d975b965b4ec3ad910bbf00a80d5514e7d0a872287532f362e","category":"Tech"}
