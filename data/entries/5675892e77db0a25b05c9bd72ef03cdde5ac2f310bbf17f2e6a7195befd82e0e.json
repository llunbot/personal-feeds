Apple releases new Apple Watch models (called “series”) on a yearly cadence, and the price rarely changes by all that much. So to avoid buying an Apple Watch that is outdated after just a few weeks, you want to time it right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re expecting to see <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2157474/new-apple-watch-2024-release-date.html\">Apple Watch Series 10, Apple Watch Ultra 3 and Apple Watch SE 3rd generation</a>, running <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362011/watchos-11-watch-faces-fitness-vitals-translate.html\">watchOS 11</a>, launch in September 2024 at the company’s <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/831417/apple-september-iphone-event-date-time.html\">Glowtime event</a> (see <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673671/how-to-watch-apples-event.html\">how to watch the September event</a>).

Read our reviews: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2114964/apple-watch-series-9-review.html\">Apple Watch Series 9 review</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2203062/apple-watch-ultra-2-review-2.html\">Apple Watch Ultra 2 review</a> to find out what we thought of them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple tends to update the Apple Watch yearly, so you can be pretty certain that new models will launch in September. Indeed, a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2157474/new-apple-watch-2024-release-date.html\">new Apple Watch 10 (X) is expected in September 2024</a>, as is a new Apple Watch Ultra and a new Apple Watch SE 3. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Apple introduces the new Apple Watch models it usually discontinues older models. When Apple discontinues the older models and introduces the new ones the price of the older models, if you can find them available from a third-party, usually goes down. So following the introduction of the new Apple Watches you may be able to get a good deal on an older Apple Watch. See our round-up of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672795/best-apple-watch-deals.html\">best Apple Watch deals</a>, updated monthly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only reason to buy before Apple updates the range is if you think that the company will increase prices where you are when the new products launch. This happens from time-to-time, especially if you aren’t based in the U.S. where Apple may adjust pricing due to fluctuating exchange rates. The price can also go down, of course. </p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>Apple Watch Series 9</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img width=\"2400\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Apple-Watch-S9-carbon-neutral-lineup-230912.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Apple Watch Series 9\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Apple-Watch-S9-carbon-neutral-lineup-230912.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Apple-Watch-S9-carbon-neutral-lineup-230912.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Apple-Watch-S9-carbon-neutral-lineup-230912.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Apple-Watch-S9-carbon-neutral-lineup-230912.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Apple-Watch-S9-carbon-neutral-lineup-230912.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Apple-Watch-S9-carbon-neutral-lineup-230912.jpg?resize=2048%2C1152&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Apple-Watch-S9-carbon-neutral-lineup-230912.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Apple-Watch-S9-carbon-neutral-lineup-230912.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2066958/apple-watch-series-9-vs-series-8-s9-chip-display-storage.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFrom $399\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.target.com/p/apple-watch-series-9-gps-2023-41mm-starlight-aluminum-case-with-starlight-sport-loop/-/A-85966368\" target=\"_blank\">$269.99 at  Target </a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-Watch-Series-9-With-Blood-Oxygen-GPS-41mm-Midnight-Aluminum-Case-with-Midnight-Sport-Loop/5032387730\" target=\"_blank\">$397.99 at  Walmart Electronics</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch\" target=\"_blank\">$399 at  Apple</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<h2>When is the best time to buy an Apple Watch?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s easier to say when the <em>worst</em> time to buy a new Apple Watch is. That would be in the run-up to September. If you buy a new Apple Watch in August expect to be kicking yourself a month later when the new model arrives and resellers start to discount the older model to sell it off at a lower price. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only reason to buy an Apple Watch model in the run-up to an event is if it’s the model you want and you aren’t interested in any of the rumored new features. Apple tends to discontinue the previous generation when new models are introduced, so if you want to buy an older you may not be able to for longer. However, you will probably be able to take advantage of discounts on the older models after the new ones arrive. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best time to buy an Apple Watch isn’t necessarily when a new model launches though. If you wait a month or two you may be able to take advantages of discounts and price drops from resellers. During October and November we see lots of sales, such as Amazon Prime Day and Black Friday, and you can expect to get some money off at these events. Apple doesn’t discount its products, but it does offer vouchers with new purchases from time to time–and Black Friday is one of those times. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When does Apple update the Apple Watch?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple usually updates the Apple Watch at an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/831417/apple-september-iphone-event-date-time.html\">Apple Event in September</a>. Failing that the update could happen in October. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, not every Apple Watch gets updated every year. The Apple Watch SE can go two or more years between updates. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more advice read our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671574/best-apple-watch.html\">Apple Watch buying guide</a>. </p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"5675892e77db0a25b05c9bd72ef03cdde5ac2f310bbf17f2e6a7195befd82e0e","category":"Apple"}
