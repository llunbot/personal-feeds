Several Apple chips have joined the line-up, including the M1, M1 Pro, M1 Max, and M1 Ultra; M2, M2 Pro, M2 Max, and M2 Ultra; M3, M3 Pro, M3 Max, and M3 Ultra; and M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max. The final Mac to move from Intel to Apple Silicon was the Mac Pro in June 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that the transition from Intel to Apple’s silicon is long complete, and it has been a while since Apple sold any new Macs powered by an Intel chip, you might think that there is no point in comparing Intel and Apple. However, some stores are still selling Intel-powered Macs and may users still have them. Those wishing to upgrade from an Intel-powered Mac to an M-series Mac may also be curious about how much of a difference to expect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With such variety on offer, there is also a question of which Apple processor is best, or at least sufficient for your needs. The current M4 series represents the fourth generation of Apple Silicon, but the M4 is still less powerful than the M1 Ultra, for example. It’s also worth noting that the difference between a Pro and Max version of Apple’s ships is all in the GPUs and memory support: the CPU is essentially the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we will compare all the Mac and MacBook CPUs, GPUs, and other specs, such as RAM (a.k.a. unified memory), to demonstrate how the M1-, M2-, M3-, and M4-series chips compare to each other and their Intel predecessors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more help choosing which Mac to buy read our buying guides where we assess the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/219909/best-mac.html\">Best Mac</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/669997/best-macbook-apple-laptop.html\">Best MacBook</a>.

The Mac Studio also ships with the M2 Max. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>October 2023</strong>: The M3 series arrives with the M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max landing simultaneously. The MacBook Pro ships with M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max chips, while the iMac offers the M3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>October 2024</strong>: The M4 series arrives on the Mac with the M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max. The iMac has an M4. The Mac mini has an M4 or M4 Pro. The MacBook Pro has an M4, M4 Pro, or M4 Max.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>March 2025</strong>: Apple introduces the M3 Ultra, which is in the $3,999 Mac Studio. Apple also released the M4 Max Mac Studio for $1,999, and the M4 MacBook AIr.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which processor should you choose for your Mac, and does it really matter? Read on to find out.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Mac and MacBook processors compared</h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3810180/should_i_buy_a_macbook_air_m1_main.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"MacBook Air with M1\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>The M1 arrived with the MacBook Air, 13-inch MacBook Pro, and Mac mini at the end of 2020.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The processor inside a Mac makes a big difference to how powerful the Mac is. However, it can be quite confusing if you aren’t familiar with the terminology. The processor is sometimes referred to as the CPU (central processing unit), which is different from the GPU (graphics processing unit). Sometimes people will refer to the processor when they actually mean the SoC (system on a chip) that contains both the CPU and GPU. You may even hear it referred to as a SiP (system in package).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We often refer to Apple Silicon as chips because they are system-on-chips that combine the CPU and GPU (and, for that matter, RAM, which Apple refers to as unified memory). The various M-series chips offer a variety of CPU and GPU cores.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, many different Intel chips combine several CPU cores with integrated or discrete graphics options, all of which we will discuss below.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>We also offer advice about how much storage, RAM and cores in <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2308505/how-much-macbook-gpu-cpu-ram-ssd.html\">How much MacBook GPU, CPU, RAM and SSD do you really need?</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>Mac processors from Apple</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>M1 </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In June 2020, Apple announced that it would transition Mac from Intel to its “world-class custom silicon.” This process began with Apple’s M1 processor, which was introduced in November 2020.

However, some people criticized the RAM limitations, with the M1 Macs only able to support up to 16GB of unified memory.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>M1 Pro</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple introduced the M1 Pro in October 2021.  It is no longer available in any new Macs, but you may get one in Apple’s refurbished store or elsewhere. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The M1 Pro was in these Macs:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>14-inch MacBook Pro (2021)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>16-inch MacBook Pro (2021)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The M1 Pro specs were as follows: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>8- or 10-core CPU (6 or 8 performance cores, 2 efficiency cores)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>14- or 16-core GPU</li>\n\n\n\n<li>16-core Neural Engine</li>\n\n\n\n<li>16GB or 32GB of unified memory</li>\n\n\n\n<li>200GBps memory bandwidth</li>\n\n\n\n<li>33.7 billion transistors</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The M1 Pro offers a 14-core GPU or a 16-core GPU. At launch, Apple claimed the GPU in the M1 Pro to be 2x faster than the M1. Apple also claimed that the GPU was up to 7x faster than the integrated graphics on the latest 8-core PC laptop chip.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The M1 Pro also added a ProRes accelerator in the media engine to speed up video processing. Apple claimed that the M1 Pro could deliver up to 200GBps of memory bandwidth, which is nearly 3x the bandwidth of the M1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The M1 Pro supports up to 32GB RAM, compared to a maximum of 16GB for the M1.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>M1 Max</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The M1 Max was also introduced in October 2021 as a standard option for the 16-inch MacBook Pro and a build-to-order option for the 14-inch MacBook Pro. Then, in March 2022, the M1 Max became one of the options for the Mac Studio. The M1 Max is no longer available in any new Macs, but you may get one in Apple’s refurbished store or elsewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The M1 Max was in these Macs:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>14-inch MacBook Pro (2021)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>16-inch MacBook Pro (2021)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mac Studio (2022)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The M1 Max specs are as follows: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>10-core CPU (8 performance cores, 2 efficiency cores)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>24- or 32-core GPU</li>\n\n\n\n<li>16-core Neural Engine</li>\n\n\n\n<li>32GB or 64GB of unified memory</li>\n\n\n\n<li>400GBps memory bandwidth</li>\n\n\n\n<li>57 billion</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The M1 Max has the same 10-core CPU as the M1 Pro, but everything else is significantly enhanced. The GPU is the most important difference between the M1 Pro and M1 Max. The M1 Max GPU goes all the way up to 32 cores. At launch, Apple claimed the graphics performance of the 32-core GPU to be up to 4x faster than the M1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The M1 Max also has two ProRes accelerators that help it deliver up to 2x faster video encoding than M1 Pro. Apple claimed the M1 Max-powered MacBook Pros can edit up to 30 streams of 4K ProRes video or up to seven streams of 8K ProRes video in Final Cut Pro. That’s more streams than on a 28-core Mac Pro with Afterburner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At launch, Apple stated that the performance of the M1 Max is “similar to that of the highest-end GPU in the largest PC laptops while using up to 100 watts less power.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>M1 Max also offers up to 400GBps of memory bandwidth. That is 2x that of M1 Pro and nearly 6x that of M1. As a result, a maximum of 64GB of RAM is possible with the Max.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>M1 Ultra</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The M1 Ultra was also introduced in March 2022 as an option for the Mac Studio. You may still find a 2022 Mac Studio available, potentially at a good discount.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The M1 Ultra was in the:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Mac Studio (2022) </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The M1 Ultra specs were as follows: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>20-core CPU (16 performance cores, 4 efficiency cores)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>48- or 64-core GPU</li>\n\n\n\n<li>32-core Neural Engine</li>\n\n\n\n<li>64GB or 128GB of unified memory</li>\n\n\n\n<li>800GBps memory bandwidth</li>\n\n\n\n<li>114 billion transistors</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The M1 Ultra is essentially two M1 Mac chips, so it can offer a 20-core CPU and up to a 64-core GPU. Apple achieves this using UltraFusion architecture to connect the two M1 Max chips to avoid trade-offs such as increased latency, reduced bandwidth, and increased power consumption. Apple also explained that the M1 Ultra behaves like, and is recognized by software, as one chip.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At launch, Apple claimed to offer “4x the bandwidth of the leading multi-chip interconnect technology” and that the M1 Ultra “delivers 90 percent higher multi-threaded performance than the fastest available 16-core PC desktop chip in the same power envelope.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple also claimed that the 64-core GPU delivers faster performance than the highest-end PC GPU available, all while using 200 fewer watts of power.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The M1 Ultra can be configured with up to 128GB unified memory; according to Apple, the most powerful PC graphics cards max out at 48GB. The ‌M1‌ Ultra also offers twice the media engine capabilities of the ‌M1 Max‌, for accelerated video encoding and decoding.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>M2 </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The M2 was introduced in June 2022 with the MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro.

Max, which were released in the latter part of 2024.  The fastest chip is the M3 Ultra, released in 2025 in the Mac Studio</p>\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n<h2>M1 vs Intel: Benchmarks</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As for how Apple’s silicon compares to the Intel processors that used to power Macs, when we tested we found that even Apple’s M1 chips delivered a performance that was equal to, or even better, than the most powerful Intel laptop chips found in Macs at the time and the M1 Macs weren’t even targeted at the kind of people who need the most powerful laptops. The M1 really was better than a comparable Intel chip–just as Apple claimed when it launched.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see from the benchmarks above and below, there is no reason to avoid buying an M1-, M2-, M3-, or M4-series Mac over any Intel-powered Mac. Even the iMac with M3 beats the fastest iMac Pro (with a 2.3GHz Intel Xeon W-2191B) by some margin.</p>\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n<p><sup>Results are expressed as Geekbench scores. Higher scores/longer bars are faster.</sup></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>M1 vs Intel: What’s the difference between Apple Silicon and Intel?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Intel processors that Apple used in its Macs since 2006 were x86 chips. Apple Silicon is based on Arm but includes a number of Apple technologies (so they aren’t Arm chips, strictly speaking). Arm and x86 are completely different architecture, which means that they need different code, and hence the operating systems and software need to be tailored to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, one of the main concerns with the move to Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3, or M4) could be whether the required software is compatible with Arm. Apple addressed this with Rosetta 2, which translates the code from x86 to Arm. With a few exceptions, there was no issue with software written for x86 running on the M1 Macs. Many software developers were quick to update their software to run on M-series Macs, though.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3489917/macbook_air_2019_vs_mb_31_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"MacBook Air or MacBook Pro\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>The M1-series Macs were a huge step up from  the equivalent Intel models.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>One advantage of Arm over Intel’s X86 is power consumption, this is evident in the long battery life of the M-series Macs. The 16-inch MacBook Pro has the longest-ever battery life for a Mac at 24 hours. The 2019 Intel-powered 16-inch MacBook Pro could only manage 11 hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are other ways in which the M-series chips are more efficient than Intel processors. Macs with Apple chips have two kinds of processor cores: high-performance and efficiency. Having two types of cores ensures that background processes don’t slow down the computer because there is always enough power available for programs to run. For example, even the fastest Intel-powered Mac might have experienced slowdowns and performance drops if a system process like iCloud, or the indexing of Photos or Spotlight, was running in the background.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is all great in theory, but in practice, the benchmarks prove that there is a leap in performance from Intel to M1 and beyond.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Mac processors made by Intel</h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3489917/macbook_air_2019_review_10_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"MacBook\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>If you bought your Mac before the end of 2020 it will have Intel inside.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has used various generations of Intel processors over the years. Here are details of some of the Intel chips you may find inside any Macs that predate Apple’s move to the M1 and beyond.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple no longer sells Macs with Intel processors, not even old models in the Apple Certified Refurbished Store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are considering buying a used Intel-powered Mac we would recommend that you don’t! Read <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678277/why-you-shouldnt-buy-a-second-hand-mac.html\">Should I buy a secondhand Mac?</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back when Macs were powered by Intel, Apple specified an Intel processor generation for each Mac in its marketing materials. So you would have seen a description such as ‘2.0GHz quad-core 10th-generation Intel Core i5 processor’ associated with a particular Mac. However, without those marketing materials, it isn’t so easy to find out which processor is inside an Intel-powered Mac because the About This Mac information shows the year that Mac went on sale and the processor specifics such as GHz and the number of cores, but not the processor generation. Identifying the processor generation can be useful in comparing different Macs – and PCs. If you want to find out the specs of your Intel Mac we suggest you read our guide to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671418/how-to-check-the-specs-of-your-mac-find-out-processor-and-ram.html\">how to check the specs of your Mac.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how the Intel processor lineup has looked since around 2011:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>1st Generation – Nehalem (2011)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2nd Generation – Sandy Bridge (2011)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>3rd Generation – Ivy Bridge (2012)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>4th Generation – Haswell (2013)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>5th Generation – Broadwell (2015)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>6th Generation – Skylake (2015)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>7th Generation – Kaby Lake (2017)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>8th Generation – Coffee Lake (2018)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>9th Generation – Coffee Lake Refresh (2018)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>10th Generation – Ice Lake (2019)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to choose a Mac processor</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you are comparing two Macs with Apple chips, or one Apple chip and one Intel chip, or even two Intel chips, this is what to consider: </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How many CPU cores?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You will notice that Apple’s M1 has eight CPU cores, the M1 Pro and M1 Max have ten CPU cores, and the M1 Ultra has 20 CPU cores. The M2 series extends that, with the M2 CPU having 10 or 12 CPU cores, the M2 Pro and M2 Max having a 12-core CPU, and the M2 Ultra having 24 cores. That extension continues with the M3 and M4 and will keep going with future chips.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among the Intel Macs, you would generally find dual-core, quad-core, 6-core, 8-core, and 10-core CPUs, while the Mac Pro offers a Xeon processor with 8, 12, 16, 24, or 28 cores.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having more cores available means that your Mac will be able to run multiple processes at once. Apple’s M-series Macs have two kinds of cores: high-performance and high-efficiency cores. The difference between high-performance and efficiency cores is that the efficiency cores are power-saving while the performance cores can be used for more demanding tasks. So while the performance cores focus on demanding tasks there won’t be a hit on power-efficient processing, both can happen in tandem. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How many GPU cores? </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is more apparent on the M-series Macs because Apple highlights the number of GPU cores and this extends as you move up the range. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s M1 has 7 or 8 GPU cores, the M1 Pro had a 14-core or 16-core GPU, the M1 Max had a 24-core or 32-core GPU, and the M1 Ultra had a 48-core or 64-core GPU. The M2 series extends that, with the M2 GPU having 8 or 10 GPU cores, the M2 Pro having 14 or 16 GPU cores, the M2 Max having a 30-core or 38-core GPU, and the M2 Ultra having a 60-core or 76-core GPU. The same pattern follows (but with more cores) with the M3 and M4 chips.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Intel Macs either had integrated graphics or a discrete graphics card. The discrete option was more for professionals who were using graphics-intensive programs on their Macs. A discrete graphics card has its own memory, while integrated graphics share memory with the processor. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because the M-series Macs integrate the GPU, the CPU the RAM into the same system on chip (SoC), the GPU and CPU can exchange information quickly, and the RAM can be shared efficiently–Apple refers to its Unified Memory Architecture which makes this possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see from the chart above, even the Pro, Max, and Ultra variants of the M1 topped the best graphics options in the Intel-powered Macs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How many GHz?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>GHz (gigahertz) reflects the number of clock cycles per second. So a 2.3GHz processor’s internal clock beats 2.3 billion times per second. Hence, people refer to the number of GHz as the clock speed. It’s not easy to compare the M1 with an Intel processor because while Intel lists GHz, Apple doesn’t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each range of Intel-equipped Macs usually has more than one option in terms of GHz. Sometimes it will look like a more powerful Mac has a slower clock speed. This is invariably due to the Mac in question having more cores available. For example, the 3.1GHz 6-Core iMac costs considerably more than the  3.6GHz Quad-Core model. At first glance, that might look like a bad deal, but that’s six 3.1GHz cores, rather than four 3.6GHz cores. And the more cores, the better.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3489917/imac_21_5_2019_with_mba2019_01_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"iMac or MacBook Pro\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>With Intel Macs, it’s not only GHz you need to consider, but also how many cores and the generation of the processor.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>What is Turbo Boost?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no Turbo Boost figure to consider with Apple’s M-series Macs, but it was a significant part of Intel’s marketing, so we will discuss it here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The simplest way to think of Turbo Boost is as a way of safely overclocking the cores on a processor. This figure can sometimes give a clue as to how one generation’s processor compares to the next.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Turbo Boost controller samples the power consumption and temperature of the cores hundreds of times a second while monitoring the demands made by software. If any of the cores are being driven to their theoretical maximum, Turbo Boost can, if enough power is available and the temperature is at a safe level ‘over-clock’ the core and enable it to work faster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the eight cores in a MacBook Pro’s 2.3GHz 8-Core i9 processor can, if needed, be pushed to 4.8GHz subject to power consumption and heat dissipation. Not all processors can Turbo Boost. The i3 processors, found in the 3.6GHz Quad-Core iMac, do not include Turbo Boost, so the 3.6GHz speed is never going to be overclocked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why would you need Turbo Boost? Turbo Boost kicks in when you aren’t using all the cores, so the clock speed can be increased on the cores that are in use. So, Turbo Boost is a feature that will benefit you most if you aren’t using applications that use multiple cores.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why might you not want Turbo Boost? When Turbo Boost is in use, your computer will be using more power, so if you have a laptop it might not be in your interest to have Turbo Boost.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3489917/apple_imac_2019_review_21_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"iMac cores\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption>Apple would quote Turbo Boost figure for older Macs, like the iMac above. </figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Intel processor types</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not only the processor generation you need to consider with Intel. There was a lot of variety in terms of processor speed, number of cores, Turbo Boost figures, and whether it was an i3 or an i9. Wondering if i5 is better than i7, or if i3 is going to be inadequate? We look through the different processors right up to i9 below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Core M</strong> – The M is a mobile version of Intel’s chips – it appeared in the first Retina MacBook when it launched in 2014. There were three M processors with increasing performance: m3, m5, and m7.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Core i3</strong> – i3 processors featured in some Macs. They don’t feature Turbo Boost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Core i5</strong> – The majority of Macs used to use Intel’s i5 processors. The i5 tended to be quad-core or 6-core. If you find a dual-core, it’s an older generation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Core i7</strong> – The i7 is worth looking out for if you are thinking of purchasing an older Mac because, in older generations of Macs, when it came to quad-core, the i5 and i7 versions were not equal. The quad-core i7, which was once used in the 15-inch MacBook Pro offered some features that the quad-core i5 didn’t, one of which was Hyper-threading. Another difference was the size of the cache. Thanks to these features, i7 processors were better for multitasking, multimedia, high-end gaming, and scientific work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Core i9</strong> – Intel’s i9 processors arrived with the 9th generation Coffee Lake refresh, and have up to 8 cores.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Xeon</strong> – Intel’s Xeon processors are workstation or server processors. Xeon processors support more memory than the i5/i7/i9 processors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Hyper-threading</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Hyper-threading allows the processor to handle twice as many ‘streams’ as it has cores, by fooling software into thinking it has twice as many cores. So, a quad-core processor with hyperthreading should be able to execute four times as many sets of instructions in a given time period as a dual-core processor with the same clock speed but without hyperthreading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means that a quad-core i7, for example, can act like it has eight cores, but a quad-core i5 will only be able to use the four cores available to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Which Mac processor should you choose?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that Apple has completed its transition from Intel to Apple Silicon, the question of which processor is no longer a choice between Intel and Apple. We have in the past recommended waiting for a second-generation product, but we are so many years into the transition that there really is no reason to wait. If you need a powerful Mac, go ahead and buy one.
