The vulnerability <a href=\"https://github.com/netsecfish/dlink\">came to light</a> two weeks ago. The researcher said they were making the threat public because D-Link said it had no plans to patch the vulnerabilities, which are present only in end-of-life devices, meaning they are no longer supported by the manufacturer.</p>\n<h2>An ideal recipe</h2>\n<p>On Monday, researchers said their sensors began detecting active attempts to <a href=\"https://infosec.exchange/@greynoise/112236315274772968\">exploit the vulnerabilities</a> starting over the weekend. Greynoise, one of the organizations reporting the in-the-wild exploitation, said in an email that the activity began around 02:17 UTC on Sunday. The attacks attempted to download and install one of several pieces of malware on vulnerable devices depending on their specific hardware profile. One such piece of malware is <a href=\"https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/1b1f226a2de6581606a6aa9249c9d89b9c771a14e02022371405396c278da62d\">flagged</a> under various names by 40 endpoint protection services.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015480#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015480&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4b5fe70d8a7e52dc8d4a94eafd99380202ebd1e3c44a2bc2a35af242532750df","category":"Tech"}
