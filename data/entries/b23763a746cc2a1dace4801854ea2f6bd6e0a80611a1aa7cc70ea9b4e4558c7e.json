You could mount up a cargo cage, get a dry bag, and some straps. Then you’d just have to deal with redoing the straps every time you need something out of the bag – and you’re left with bulky cargo cages on your bike even if you remove the bag. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Or</em>, you could check out the new Fork Pack System from Tailfin. Like every other product we’ve checked out from the British design company, the Fork Pack System is likely over-engineered to make it the easiest way to carry cargo on your fork. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Permanent Mount, No Cage</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TAILFIN-FORK-PACK-LIFESTYLE-18-Large.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TAILFIN-FORK-PACK-LIFESTYLE-18-Large-800x534.jpeg\" alt=\"Tailfin fork pack mount\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TAILFIN-FORK-PACK-LIFESTYLE-18-Large-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TAILFIN-FORK-PACK-LIFESTYLE-18-Large-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TAILFIN-FORK-PACK-LIFESTYLE-18-Large-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TAILFIN-FORK-PACK-LIFESTYLE-18-Large-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TAILFIN-FORK-PACK-LIFESTYLE-18-Large-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TAILFIN-FORK-PACK-LIFESTYLE-18-Large.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of the typical cargo cage, the Fork Pack System relies on the Fork Pack Mount. This hard-anodized 7075-T6 aluminum mount bolts to two- or three-bolt bosses on your fork and stays there. In addition to protecting your fork’s finish, there are rubber load pads to help stabilize the mount and prevent rattle or movement. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mount provides an attachment point for the proven Tailfin X-Clamp system that is used on their other <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/tailfin-mini-pannier-bags-might-actually-make-you-consider-panniers-for-bikepacking/\" target=\"_blank\">cargo panniers</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What happens if you’re on a tour and lose or break one of the X-Clamp bags? Tailfin has thought of that too – there are two recesses behind the Fork Pack Mount that will allow you to use it as a traditional cargo cage with standard cargo straps. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5 or 10 Liter</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TAILFIN-FORK-PACK-LIFESTYLE-24-Large.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"854\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TAILFIN-FORK-PACK-LIFESTYLE-24-Large.jpeg\" alt=\"Tailfin fork pack 5 and 10 liter\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TAILFIN-FORK-PACK-LIFESTYLE-24-Large.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TAILFIN-FORK-PACK-LIFESTYLE-24-Large-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TAILFIN-FORK-PACK-LIFESTYLE-24-Large-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TAILFIN-FORK-PACK-LIFESTYLE-24-Large-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TAILFIN-FORK-PACK-LIFESTYLE-24-Large-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TAILFIN-FORK-PACK-LIFESTYLE-24-Large-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FORK-PACK-BACK-Large.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FORK-PACK-BACK-Large-800x534.jpeg\" alt=\"Tailfin fork pack mount\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FORK-PACK-BACK-Large-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FORK-PACK-BACK-Large-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FORK-PACK-BACK-Large-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FORK-PACK-BACK-Large-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FORK-PACK-BACK-Large-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FORK-PACK-BACK-Large.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FORK-PACK-MOUNTING-Large.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FORK-PACK-MOUNTING-Large-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Tailfin fork pack mount\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FORK-PACK-MOUNTING-Large-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FORK-PACK-MOUNTING-Large-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FORK-PACK-MOUNTING-Large-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FORK-PACK-MOUNTING-Large-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FORK-PACK-MOUNTING-Large-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/FORK-PACK-MOUNTING-Large.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TAILFIN-FORK-PACK-LIFESTYLE-6-Large.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TAILFIN-FORK-PACK-LIFESTYLE-6-Large-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Tailfin fork pack mount\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TAILFIN-FORK-PACK-LIFESTYLE-6-Large-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TAILFIN-FORK-PACK-LIFESTYLE-6-Large-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TAILFIN-FORK-PACK-LIFESTYLE-6-Large-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TAILFIN-FORK-PACK-LIFESTYLE-6-Large-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TAILFIN-FORK-PACK-LIFESTYLE-6-Large-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TAILFIN-FORK-PACK-LIFESTYLE-6-Large.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To mount the pannier, simply hook the mounts on the top and make sure the hook at the bottom is engaged, then close the lever.

The roll-top closures can be fastened to themselves, or the included compression straps. Those same straps can be used to add extra storage across the front of the pack as well (like the sandals below). All of the hardware is replaceable and you can even swap it between the Mini Panniers. Also, that hardware is made from 304 stainless steel with Torx T25 heads for durability. As usual, the bags include a comprehensive 5-year warranty and a 30% discount for crash replacements. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pricing &amp; Availability </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TAILFIN-FORK-PACK-LIFESTYLE-17-Large.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TAILFIN-FORK-PACK-LIFESTYLE-17-Large-800x534.jpeg\" alt=\"Tailfin fork pack on bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TAILFIN-FORK-PACK-LIFESTYLE-17-Large-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TAILFIN-FORK-PACK-LIFESTYLE-17-Large-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TAILFIN-FORK-PACK-LIFESTYLE-17-Large-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TAILFIN-FORK-PACK-LIFESTYLE-17-Large-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TAILFIN-FORK-PACK-LIFESTYLE-17-Large-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TAILFIN-FORK-PACK-LIFESTYLE-17-Large.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TAILFIN-FORK-PACK-LIFESTYLE-13-Large.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TAILFIN-FORK-PACK-LIFESTYLE-13-Large-800x534.jpeg\" alt=\"Tailfin fork pack\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TAILFIN-FORK-PACK-LIFESTYLE-13-Large-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TAILFIN-FORK-PACK-LIFESTYLE-13-Large-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TAILFIN-FORK-PACK-LIFESTYLE-13-Large-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TAILFIN-FORK-PACK-LIFESTYLE-13-Large-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TAILFIN-FORK-PACK-LIFESTYLE-13-Large-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TAILFIN-FORK-PACK-LIFESTYLE-13-Large.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with the easy removal and installation, the system has been designed to place the weight as lot as possible on the fork for better balance and handling.
