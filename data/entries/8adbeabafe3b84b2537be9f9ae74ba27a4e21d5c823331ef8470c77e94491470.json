The photo shows the anomaly—a fireball of hydrogen igniting—to the left of Blue Origin's rocket engine test stand.</p>\n<p>After the author posted this photo on Twitter, United Launch Alliance chief executive Tory Bruno offered a more detailed assessment of the anomaly. \"Most of what you’re seeing is insulation and smaller bits from the test rig. One piece of the hydrogen tank’s dome, about a foot square, ended up a few feet away. The test article is still inside the rig and largely intact, which will significantly help with the investigation\", <a href=\"https://twitter.com/torybruno/status/1644512271203442689?s=11\">Bruno said</a> via Twitter.</p>\n<p><strong>Original post</strong>: On the evening of March 29, at Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama, United Launch Alliance started pressurizing the upper stage of its new Vulcan rocket. But then, suddenly, something went wrong with this Centaur upper stage.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1929875#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1929875&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8adbeabafe3b84b2537be9f9ae74ba27a4e21d5c823331ef8470c77e94491470","category":"Tech"}
