Install the 5G Preferred Over Wi-Fi profile (\"profile\") on devices running iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 Beta 4 or greater to greatly increase the likelihood of seeing 5G preferred over Wi-Fi connections and to ensure your networking path logic is optimized for situations where 5G will be preferred. For more information, see <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/5g/\">https://developer.apple.com/5g/</a>.</blockquote>Apple says that developers who want to prioritize 5G usage on their devices can do so by running the fourth beta of ‌iOS 15‌/‌iPadOS 15‌ or later and downloading the <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/download/all/\">5G Preferred Over WiFi Profile.</a>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn iOS and ‌iPadOS 15‌, Apple has already added a new feature that causes 5G devices to automatically prioritize 5G when it provides an improved connection over WiFi, so this developer tool should boost that capability even further. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-developer-program/\">Apple Developer Program</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/11/ios-15-wifi-5g-developer-tool/\">iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 Developer Tool Can More Heavily Prioritize 5G Versus Wi-Fi Connections</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-15-and-ipados-15-developer-tool-can-more-heavily-prioritize-5g-versus-wi-fi-connections.2307277/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=mtXrhX16sR0:u2fxC5E-qck:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=mtXrhX16sR0:u2fxC5E-qck:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/mtXrhX16sR0\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7d4c707ef90c0cc1fb725fd9f788cbc0b4dd13a3fc329c2b1f3cf1cf168a7737","category":"Apple"}
