Most bikes are fitted with  significantly <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/sizing-and-fit/narrow-handlebars/\">narrower handlebars</a> than this, in proportion to the rider’s size.</p>\n<p>Following the well-established trend towards wider <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-handlebars/\">mountain bike handlebars</a>, there’s a growing trend towards super-wide <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/gravel-bike-handlebars/\">gravel bike handlebars</a> that sometimes exceed this 50cm limit, for riders who enjoy the wide, stable stance for more techy off-road trails.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Katherine Moore riding the Cotic Cascade gravel bike\" title=\"Katherine Moore riding the Cotic Cascade gravel bike\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Flared handlebars can offer more control on technical descents.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Richard Baybutt</i></span></div>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/first-look-friday/pnw-rainier-dropper/\">PNW Components Coast cockpit</a> is just one example of this, with a 52cm option (measured at the hoods), giving a mega-wide measurement in the drops of 60cm.</p>\n<p>While cyclocross bars tend to feature a traditional drop, flared bars are common on gravel bikes. These bars vary from a very subtle degree of flare to very steep angles, which means that the position in the drops is wider than on the hoods (as seen in the photo above), giving a more stable position for descending.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Rå Valravn steel gravel bike with SRAM XPLR groupset, RockShox Rudy Ultimate XPLR fork and RockShox Reverb AXS XPLR dropper post\" title=\"Rå Valravn steel gravel bike with SRAM XPLR groupset, RockShox Rudy Ultimate XPLR fork and RockShox Reverb AXS XPLR dropper post\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The RockShox Rudy Ultimate XPLR is a gravel-specific suspension fork.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Some gravel bikes also feature seatposts designed to flex (such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/seatposts/seatpost-and-seat-pin/canyon-vcls-post-2-0-review/\">Canyon VCLS Post 2.0</a>) to improve comfort over longer, bumpier rides, and there are a number of gravel suspension options on offer too, as well as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-dropper-posts/\">dropper seatposts</a>.</p>\n<p>Gravel suspension options include minimalist travel built into an otherwise rigid frame and fork, such as the Futureshock system on the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/gravel-bikes/specialized-diverge-comp-carbon-review/\">Specialized Diverge gravel bike</a>, through to full-on, gravel-specific suspension forks, such as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/forks/suspension-forks/rockshox-rudy-ultimate-xplr-fork-review/\">RockShox Rudy Ultimate XPLR</a> with 30mm or 40mm of travel.</p>\n<h2>Can I use my cyclocross bike for gravel riding?</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Specialized Crux Expert gravel bike\" title=\"Specialized Crux Expert - 01\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Specialized Crux is the brand’s cyclocross and gravel race bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>In a word, yes.</p>\n<p>While tyre clearances may be your limiting factor for squeezing some chunkier rubber into your cyclocross frame, many riders do choose to adapt cyclocross bikes for general riding off-road.</p>\n<p>In some cases, the geometry differences between gravel and cyclocross models are marginal: for example, the 2022 <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/cannondale-supersix-evo-cx-se/\">Cannondale SuperSix EVO</a> frame is available in two builds, for gravel racing (SE) and cyclocross (CX), and the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/gravel-bikes/specialized-crux-expert-review-2/\">Specialized Crux</a> has been rebranded as a gravel racing rig.</p>\n<p>Aftermarket components such as flared handlebars can be added to a cyclocross bike to improve stability over rougher trails, and you can always adapt the gearing if you find you need a wider range.</p>\n<h2>Can I use my gravel bike for cyclocross racing?</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"HOOGERHEIDE, NETHERLANDS - FEBRUARY 05: Mathieu Van Der Poel of The Netherlands competes during the 74th World Championships Cyclo-Cross 2023 - Men's Elite / #CXWorldCup / #Hoogerheide2023 / on February 05, 2023 in Hoogerheide, Netherlands.
