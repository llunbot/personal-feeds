Yet another teaser for S4 is how the streaming giant has chosen to mark the occasion—and it's frankly a bit underwhelming.</p>\n<p>Teasers for S4 have been trickling out of Netflix over the last year or so, and tonally, they've been all over the place. For instance, the teaser that appeared <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/05/stranger-things-hints-at-return-of-elevens-papa-in-new-teaser/\">in May</a> was classic <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tag/stranger-things/\"><em>Stranger Things</em></a>, ominously hinting at the return of Eleven's (Millie Bobby Brown) childhood tormentor and \"Papa,\" Dr. Martin Brenner (Matthew Modine). Brenner was supposedly killed by the <a href=\"https://strangerthings.fandom.com/wiki/The_Demogorgon\">Demogorgon</a> in S1, but there have been hints of his possible survival. We already knew that David Harbour will be returning as Hopper, along with the rest of the main cast: Winona Ryder, Finn Wolfhard, Natalia Dyer, Noah Schnapp, Charlie Heaton, Joe Keery, Caleb McLaughlin, and Sadie Sink.</p>\n<p>We also know season 4 will be the first to take place largely outside of Hawkins, since Eleven and the Byerses have moved away, and Hopper seems to be imprisoned by the Russians. Maya Thurman Hawke returns as Robin, Brett Gelman will be back as Murray Bauman, Cara Buono returns as the Wheeler matriarch, and we'll be seeing more of Priah Ferguson, who plays Lucas' sassy younger sister, Erica. Among the new cast members is Robert Englund of <em>Nightmare on Elm Street</em> fame, which is a nice little link to classic '80s horror.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1810971#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1810971&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e7846f29887bdac8a669cc44b02a84fe2cce7dbb4be4f9d1cd6de998078a8449","category":"Tech"}
