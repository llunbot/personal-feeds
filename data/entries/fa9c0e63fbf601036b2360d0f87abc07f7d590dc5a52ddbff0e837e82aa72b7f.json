As we noted when we first started <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/staff/2021/11/best-early-black-friday-deals-best-buy-amazon-target-more-tech/\" target=\"_blank\">seeing \"early Black Friday\" sales</a> pop up earlier this month, what started out as a weekend of sales to help people get ahead of their holiday shopping has turned into a weeks-long barrage of breathless promotions.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, with the actual Black Friday arriving this week, various retailers appear to have set many of their Black Friday deals live in earnest. <a href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/1305166/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2F&amp;subid1=ArsEarlyBF2021\" target=\"_blank\">Target</a>, <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cf23stDcXu9\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a>, and many more have started explicitly advertising their sales as such, with Amazon and others price-matching many of the better offers.</p>\n<p>As usual, though, much of these sales aren't worth your time. Sometimes, a price isn't <em>really</em> a discount; other times, a product is just mediocre. So, to help those who want to get a jump-start on their gift-getting, we're poring over every Black Friday sale we can find (\"early\" or not) and compiling the deals we consider genuinely good, based on price histories, our own testing, and user feedback from around the web.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1814581#p3\">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1814581&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jeff Dunn","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fa9c0e63fbf601036b2360d0f87abc07f7d590dc5a52ddbff0e837e82aa72b7f","category":"Tech"}
