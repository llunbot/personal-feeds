The iOS 17 update was made available to hundreds of millions of iPhones on Monday, September 18, 2023. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>New features in iOS 17 include contact posters, NameDrop, StandBy, Live Voicemail, FaceTime video voicemail, a whole new Siri voice recognition model, huge improvements to autocorrect and dictation, and a lot more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s almost like getting a new iPhone without paying a penny. In this article, we discuss everything you need to know about iOS 17, including all the features and any issues that arise, as well as keeping tabs on the latest version and what is coming in the next update. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Update 27 September:</strong><em><strong> </strong>iOS 17 has already been updated twice! iOS 17.0.1 arrived on September 22 alongside a iOS 17.0.2 update just for iPhone 15 models. But then on September 26 Apple issued the iOS 17.0.2 update for other compatible iPhones.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 17: What’s the latest version?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The initial iOS 17 release was on September 18, but just days later on September 21 <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213926&amp;xcust=1-1-1519552-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple issued</a> <strong>iOS 17.0.1</strong> with three zero-day security patches that “may have been actively exploited”. More information here: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2079324/ios-17-update-iphone-15-bug-fixes-security-updates.html\">Apple pushes out critical iOS 17.0.1 update just days after iOS 17 release.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That same day there was a <strong>iOS 17.0.2</strong> update for iPhone 15 models that fixed a bug for new iPhone buyers. Some users who bought new iPhone 15 models discovered that they were <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2082901/ios-17-0-2-released-iphones-fix-setup-transfer-bug.html\">not able to transfer data from an old iPhone</a> during the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/434754/iphone-setup-tips-transfer-data.html\">new iPhone setup process</a>. This same fix was then issued for other iPhones on September 27. All new iPhones should be updated to <strong>iOS 17.0.2</strong> before attempting a data transfer from an old iPhone. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will be a lot of updates over the coming months, both minor point releases for bug fixes and security updates and major releases that add new features. Here’s a look at just some of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1961587/ios-17-features-not-available-at-launch-september-2023.html\">iOS 17 features coming in later updates</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/631448/ios-16-features-compatibility-how-to-update.html\">iOS 16</a> is also still receiving security updates. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 17 beta: Latest version</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has run a beta program since it revealed the details of iOS 17 at WWDC. Now that the full version of iOS 17 is available to the public the beta testing will continue. The current beta version is still the iOS 17 Release Candidate, but Apple is likely to start work on iOS 17.1 very soon, which is likely to address any early bugs and problems with the first version of iOS 17. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’d like to continue to receive iOS 17 beta updates read <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671198/how-to-install-ios-beta.html\">How to get the iOS 17 beta on your iPhone</a>. We also describe how to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1067004/how-to-remove-ios-beta-iphone.html\">revert from iOS 17 beta to a non-beta version of iOS</a> for those testers who wish to use the full version of iOS 17. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 17: Bugs and problems</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Security</strong>: Apple issued an update to iOS 17 on September 21 to address some security flaws. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Slowdowns, battery life: </strong>Some people when updating iOS complain that their iPhone slows down, or that their battery runs out quickly, or that their phone feels hot. This can be typical behavior after an iOS update as the iPhone spends a few days carrying background tasks related to the update, such as re-indexing, this can in turn cause it to use more battery up, and get hot. You could try restarting your iPhone to see if that helps. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has previously addressed this issue in a Tweet: </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>Thanks for reaching out! We'll be happy to help. It's normal for your apps and features to need to adjust up to 48 hours after an update.<br /><br />Let's have you reach out to us in a DM if this is still an issue after that time so we can help you look into this further.</p>— Apple Support (@AppleSupport) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/AppleSupport/status/1505275496837357573?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-1519552-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">March 19, 2022</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Wi-Fi</strong>: Another issue people sometimes encounter after updating the iOS is that their iPhone struggles to stay connected to Wi-Fi networks. Again, it’s worth restarting the iPhone if this happens. Alternatively, look at: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/674925/how-to-stop-iphone-dropping-wi-fi-connection.html\">How to stop an iPhone dropping Wi-Fi connection</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Standby won’t show correct time zone</strong>: We encountered this issue (the clock was stuck in Cupertino). The fix was as follows: </p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Long press the clock that appears in Standby mode</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap the + in the top left</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Add the clock widget with the correct time to the list</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 17: How to install iOS 17 on your iPhone</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Installing iOS 17 couldn’t be simpler. Just follow these steps:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Open the <em>Settings</em> app</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap <em>General</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap <em>Software Update</em></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>On this screen you’ll see the version of iOS you have installed, and if a new version is available it will say so. It may say “Install Now” if the update was already downloaded in the background but not yet applied, or “Download and Install” if you haven’t even downloaded it yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just follow the instructions there to upgrade to iOS 17. You may need to re-agree to terms and conditions, and it will take several minutes to download, verify, and apply. Then your iPhone will restart, and you’ll be presented with some welcome screens that introduce new features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have more information about installing iOS 17 and addressing any issues with it here: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670944/how-to-update-ios-on-your-iphone.html\">How to update to iOS 17 on your iPhone.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you install an update and want to revert to the previous version there is a very small window in which you can do that, but it can be done, read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2020596/downgrade-iphone-older-version-ios.html\">How to downgrade iOS</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 17 Compatibility: Which phones can run the latest software?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>iOS 17 will not support the iPhone 8, 8 Plus, or the iPhone X. They are all able to run iOS 16 though, so they should get support through security updates for at least another year. The following iPhones get <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1942219/ios-17-iphone-compatibility-features.html\">support for iOS 17</a>, although some won’t support all of the new features: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 14 Pro Max</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 13, iPhone 13 mini, iPhone 13 Pro, iPhone 13 Pro Max</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 12, iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone XR</li>\n\n\n\n<li>iPhone SE(2nd gen or later)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if your chosen device is granted another year of software support, it’s worth noting that older iPhones may not get the full range of new features. In 2022, for example, the iPhone 8 and iPhone X missed out on <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/805172/ios-16-features-iphone-a12-bionic-processor-compatibility.html\">a bunch of cool stuff</a> due to their older processor. For more information take a look at <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1659017/ios-versions-list.html\">every version of iOS released so far</a> and find out <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1811287/which-version-of-ios-can-my-iphone-run.html\">which version of iOS your iPhone supports</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 17: Features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There were many new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/631448/ios-16-features-compatibility-how-to-update.html\">features in iOS 16</a>, including a redesigned Lock Screen, unsending iMessages, and the iCloud Shared Photo Library, but what is new in iOS 17? Initial rumors suggested that there would be “fewer major changes” than usual–but at WWDC 2023 Apple announced numerous new features for the update which we will describe below. You can also read <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1963549/ios-16-vs-ios-17-compatability-features-security-release.html\">our comparison of iOS 16 vs iOS 17</a> for an overview of what’s new.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all the new features were available at launch though. At least <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1961587/ios-17-features-not-available-at-launch-september-2023.html\">five iOS 17 features weren’t ready</a> including AirDrop over the Internet, the Journal app, Collaborative Apple Music playlists, AirPlay in hotel rooms, and NameDrop to Apple Watch. These features will come “later this year” in a subsequent software update. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may like to read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1944314/ios-17-small-changes-features-notes-spotlight-medication-timers.html\">iOS 17 features didn’t make the WWDC keynote</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1940357/ios-17-features-live-voicemail-autocorrect-contact-posters-standby.html\">iOS 17 features that make us want to upgrade</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Journal </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a brand new app that builds on Memories in Photos to bring a new way to relive special moments, remember and write about experiences with text, location, and photos, and more. There is also a Suggestions API for developers to use in their apps. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Coming in a subsequent update ‘later this year’</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>StandBy</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This seems to borrow from the Apple Watch. Put the phone in landscape on a stand at night and see the time with a clock and a range of clock styles. You can also shuffle through your best photos, display widgets, and see Live Activities, like game scores. You can also choose Night Mode to display red text and minimize eye strain at night. Remember alarm clocks? It’s a bit like that.

You can customize your poster with images, fonts, and colors. This works with Call Kit so it can be used in third-party VOIP apps. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>See: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2017358/ios-17-how-to-create-customize-contact-poster.html\">How to create and customize your Contact Poster in iOS 17</a></p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Contact-Posters.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Contact Posters iOS 17\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Contact-Posters.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Contact-Posters.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Contact-Posters.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Contact-Posters.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" /></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Live Voicemail </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If someone calls and leaves a message you will see a live transcript as they speak.

You’ll also be able to jump to the first unread message in a group chat, swipe to reply on any bubble, and automatically transcribe audio messages. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A new Check-In feature will also let Family and Friends know if you’ve made it to a destination safely. Messages can recognize if you aren’t making progress toward the destination and prompt you to respond. If you don’t, it will share information with the selected contact, including your location, battery level, and cell service status.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Ring Tones and Text Tones </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are 24 new Ringtones in iOS 17 including Dollop, Kettle, Scavenger, Steps, Storytime, Unfold and Valley.

You can turn live animated photos into Live Stickers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1995029/ios-17-emoji-2024-lime-phoenix-head-shaking-chain-mushroom-directionality.html\">Here’s a look at the new emoji that could come to iOS 17 in 2024</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Add-Sticker-iOS-17.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Add Sticker iOS 17\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Add-Sticker-iOS-17.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Add-Sticker-iOS-17.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Add-Sticker-iOS-17.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Add-Sticker-iOS-17.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" /></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>AirDrop</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is changing the way AirDrop works it will be much simpler to use. You only need to bring your phones close together and you will be able to share information. You can easily choose the phone numbers and email addresses you want to share on an iPhone or Apple Watch. For example, if you want to share photos, just bring your phones close together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another AirDrop related change will come in a later update – the ability to start an AirDrop in person, but then leave before the transfer completes with the transfer finishing over the Internet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>AirDrop over the Internet is coming in a subsequent update.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>NameDrop </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A new feature that takes advantage of AirDrop is NameDrop, an easy way to exchange contact info.

You can get predictions in line as you type and just tap the space bar to add them. Machine learning will also learn your writing style and adapt autocorrect accordingly. Additionally, Dictation leverages a new speech recognition model to make it even more accurate.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><s>Hey</s> Siri </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You no longer need to say, “Hey” every time you want to summon Siri. Siri is powered by the new transformer model that the new dictation and autocorrect is, making it far more accurate and better able to understand what you mean. You can also make multiple requests in the same command.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Photos </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The People album in iOS 17 will be able to use on-device machine learning to recognize “more photos of a user’s favorite people” as well as cats and dogs. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Safari and private browsing </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s web browser will gain a new Profiles feature to allow a user to separate work-related browsing from other browsing. Profiles can be tied to Tab Groups and Favourites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2080929/ios-17-default-search-engine-private-browsing.html\">iOS 17 lets you pick a different default search engine for private browsing</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Search in Safari will be more responsive, according to Apple, with “easier to read and more relevant suggestions”.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apple Music </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Collaborative Apple Music playlists are coming to Apple Music, but not until a later update. You’ll be able to share playlists with friends and they will be able to add, remove and reorder the songs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Coming in a later update.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Smaller features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are also <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1944314/ios-17-small-changes-features-notes-spotlight-medication-timers.html\">numerous smaller features</a> that Apple didn’t mention in the keynote that are worth knowing about, including improvements to Spotlight search, Notes, Autofill, and Apple Music, see: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1993764/how-to-ios17-set-adjust-crossfade-apple-music.html\">How to set and adjust crossfade in Apple Music</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apple ID passkey</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple announced <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/917751/how-to-use-passkeys.html\">passkey</a> support in iOS 16 but it’s going mainstream in iOS 17. In iOS 17, iPadOS 17, and macOS Sonoma, you’ll be able to log into your Apple ID with a passkey using Face ID or Touch ID on your iPhone instead of a password.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iOS 17: Third-party app stores and sideloading</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahead of WWDC, there were reports that Apple will start to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1434394/ios-17-third-party-app-stores-browsers-payment-systems-camera-nfc.html\">open up the iPhone in iOS 17</a>, allowing the distribution of apps outside of Apple’s own App Store, the use of NFC for touchless payments beyond Apple Pay, browsers that don’t have to use Apple’s Webkit rendering engine, and more. It’s all necessary to comply with the EU’s new Digital Markets Act, and the expectation is that it will only apply to those iPhones running iOS 17 in the regions covered by EU law. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple didn’t discuss the changes at WWDC, which isn’t very surprising. Furthermore, there are no references to sideloading or third-party app store on the iOS 17 website. However, that doesn’t mean those changes aren’t coming in iOS 17, either at launch or sometime in 2024.</p>\n\niOS, iPhone</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"b4698ce64ce7ea2ae399968a041b10b7e57eb6dac70c895aa71be624117e3e93","category":"Apple"}
