This way, if you have put an AirTag inside your bags, the airline can better help you find them if they are lost or delayed.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/11/apple-announces-airtag-location-sharing/\">previously announced other airlines</a> that will support the feature \"in the coming months,\" including British Airways, Virgin Atlantic, KLM, Lufthansa, Qantas, Singapore Airlines, Air New Zealand, Austrian Airlines, Aer Lingus, Brussels Airlines, Eurowings, Iberia, SWISS, Turkish Airlines, and Vueling. More airlines are \"coming soon.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\niPhone, iPad, and Mac users running iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and macOS Sequoia 15.2 can generate a \"Share Item Location\" link in the Find My app. Anyone they share the link with can then view a website with a location of the item on a map. The website will automatically update with the item's latest known location. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/Apple-Share-Item-Location-iPhone-iPad-Mac.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1960\" height=\"1102\" />\r<br />\nApple said it worked directly with airlines to put systems in place to \"privately and securely\" accept the \"Share Item Location\" links. Access to each link is \"limited to a small number of people,\" and recipients are required to \"authenticate\" to view the link through either their Apple Account or partner email address. The item's location stops being shared \"as soon as a user is reunited with their item,\" or at any time the item's owner decides. An item's shared location automatically expires after seven days.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and macOS 15.2 were released last week following beta testing.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airtag/\">AirTag</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/\">Find My</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/16/united-delta-air-canada-find-my-luggage/\">United, Delta, and Air Canada Will Begin Supporting Find My for Lost Luggage This Week</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/united-delta-and-air-canada-will-begin-supporting-find-my-for-lost-luggage-this-week.2445549/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"17168dd144c72cd692ac96abe720f9cac2892f65415829018bfb863f828c8367","category":"Apple"}
