The first Rugby World Cup is played, US President Ronald Reagan visits Berlin and calls to ‘tear down this wall’, and the Tour de France featured a time-trial up<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/mont-ventoux-cycling\" target=\"_blank\"> Mont Ventoux</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stage 18 of the 1987 Tour de France came after the only rest day, with riders facing a 26.5km individual time-trial from Carpentras to the summit of Mont Ventoux. It was the first time the climb was labelled as <em>hors categorie</em>, the previous nine features from 1951 to 1974 it was Category 1, though that was still the hardest categorisation at the time. It also marked 20 years since the death of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/remembering-tom-simpson-50-years-on\" target=\"_blank\">Tom Simpson</a> on the mountain in 1967.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/no-slowing-down-greg-lemond-profile\" target=\"_blank\">Greg LeMond</a>, who won the Tour in 1986, did not take to the start line to defend his title having been shot in a hunting accident a few months prior.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"646\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/GettyImages-161859063-646x970.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/GettyImages-161859063-646x970.jpg 646w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/GettyImages-161859063-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/GettyImages-161859063-768x1153.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/GettyImages-161859063-1023x1536.jpg 1023w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/GettyImages-161859063-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/GettyImages-161859063-750x1126.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/GettyImages-161859063-1140x1711.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/GettyImages-161859063-scaled.jpg 1706w\" /><figcaption>Jean-François Bernard wears the yellow jersey after winning Stage 18 of the 1987 Tour de France.</figcaption><figcaption>Pascal Pavani/AFP via Getty Images</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The Tour route was incredibly mountainous and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-roche\" target=\"_blank\">began in West Berlin</a>. At the start of Stage 18, Système U’s Charly Mottet wore the yellow jersey with Toshiba-Look-La Vie Claire’s Jean-François Bernard in second, 1min 11sec behind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-power-of-three-stephen-roche-profile\" target=\"_blank\">Stephen Roche</a> of Carrera Jeans-Vagabond sat third overall in the standings 1min 26sec back and was considered the favourite heading into the final week, with a climb-heavy schedule that headed over the the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/galibier-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">Col du Galibier</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As all riders had passed through the first intermediate checkpoint on Ventoux at around the 20km mark, Bernard had the fastest time of 27min 26sec, just ahead of Roland’s Jesper Skibby, who faded towards the end and finished 20th overall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Café de Colombia’s Fabio Parra, who had won a stage and the young rider’s jersey in 1985, was flying up the mountain and set a fastest time at the finish with 1hr 21min 48sec. Despite being the only man in the peloton to have won the Tour, Mottet’s yellow headband-donning teammate Laurent Fignon painted a picture of a man in pain as the next rider across the line, finishing seven minutes down on Parra.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/ventoux-sault-cycling\">Big Ride: A new view on Ventoux</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-roche\">Tour de France history: Stephen Roche does the Giro/Tour double in 1987</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/that-looks-like-stephen-roche-classic-cycling-commentary-gems\">‘That looks like Stephen Roche!’: classic cycling commentary gems</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-power-of-three-stephen-roche-profile\">The Power of Three: Stephen Roche profile</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>Parra’s teammate Luis Herrera would soon come through and dethrone his compatriot. Herrera arrived at the Tour having won the Vuelta a España and, comfortable in the mountains, he crossed the line wearing the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/history-of-the-tour-de-france-jerseys\" target=\"_blank\">polka dot jersey</a> to shave 25 seconds off the current best time. He would go on to win the classification at the end of the race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But along came Bernard. Resplendent in the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/combination-jersey\" target=\"_blank\">now defunct combination jersey</a> in all its glorious technicolour, crowd parting like the Red Sea as he passed through, he set the best time of 1hr 19min 44sec. It was his second Tour de France stage victory and wouldn’t be his last in this edition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was the opposite for Panasonic-Isostar’s Robert Millar. While he only dropped one place in the overall standings from fifth to sixth overall, Ventoux had proven his undoing and he lost a huge amount of time, now sitting almost ten minutes down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bernard’s time on the top spot wouldn’t last too long, however. Roche would ride his way into the lead the next day, a 185km stage from Valréas to Villard-de-Lans. As they continued through the Alps, it would be a real tussle between Roche and PDM-Ultimate-Concorde’s Pedro Delgado for the <em>maillot jaune</em> as the Spaniard enjoyed a four-day period in the jersey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1987, the race was one prologue and 25 stages in length. Bernard claimed another time-trial victory on Stage 24, a 38km ride around Dijon as Roche overhauled a 21sec deficit to Delgado, turning the standings into a 40sec advantage.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div><img /></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"650\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/GettyImages-120454217-970x650.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/GettyImages-120454217-970x650.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/GettyImages-120454217-300x201.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/GettyImages-120454217-768x515.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/GettyImages-120454217-1536x1029.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/GettyImages-120454217-2048x1373.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/GettyImages-120454217-750x503.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/GettyImages-120454217-1140x764.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption>Stephen Roche celebrates at the 1987 Tour de France.</figcaption><figcaption>NUTAN/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After Stage 25, a 192km day ending on the Champs-Élysées, Roche would become the first Irishman to win the Tour de France. He also added his name onto the short list of riders who had <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-roche\" target=\"_blank\">completed the Giro-Tour double</a>, having won in Italy in June. Later that year, he became World Champion and became only the second rider to complete the ‘Triple Crown’ in cycling, a feat replicated 37 years later in the men’s peloton by Tadej Pogačar in 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Delgado finished second overall as Bernard claimed the last spot on the podium, his best result in a Grand Tour, as well as the combination jersey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mont Ventoux would go on to be used a further seven times in the Tour with its next participation <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\" target=\"_blank\">scheduled for 2025</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/ventoux-sault-cycling\">Big Ride: A new view on Ventoux</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-roche\">Tour de France history: Stephen Roche does the Giro/Tour double in 1987</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/that-looks-like-stephen-roche-classic-cycling-commentary-gems\">‘That looks like Stephen Roche!’: classic cycling commentary gems</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/the-power-of-three-stephen-roche-profile\">The Power of Three: Stephen Roche profile</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/history-1987-mont-ventoux\">Pro race history: A time-trial up Mont Ventoux in 1987</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Robyn Davidson &#124; Editorial Assistant","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"4e8ed9236e516c6f31119f545b0c051c78cb22d899648af173f052c61e6ba6c1","category":"Cycling"}
