It’s 75% owned by the Ageas insurance group, which is Belgium’s largest insurer, operates in 14 countries and is listed on the Euronext Brussels exchange. Four of Ageas’ biggest shareholders are private equity firms Fosun (one of China’s biggest conglomerates, which owns Wolverhampton Wanderers among other things), SFPI-FPIM (Belgium’s sovereign wealth fund), Vanguard (the second biggest asset management firm in the world) and Schroder (a London-based firm operating since 1800). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other 25% is owned by BNP Paribas Fortis bank, which funnily enough used to be part of the same company as Ageas, but when BNP took over Fortis Bank Belgium there was a split. BNP Paribas, its parent bank, is one of the largest companies in the world, its largest shareholders being a multitude of investment firms including the biggest two, BlackRock and Vanguard, as well as the governments of Belgium and Luxembourg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.soudal.eu/soudalweb/page.aspx?w=9&amp;p=233\" target=\"_blank\">Soudal</a> is a Belgian building materials company founded in 1966 that specialises in producing silicone, caulks, polyurethane foams and adhesive for businesses, professionals and consumers – you’ll find its products in B&amp;Q and other DIY shops.
