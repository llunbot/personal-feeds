{"title":"Twitter Acquires Quill; Will Shut Down Service at the End of the Week","link":"https://quill.chat/updates/2021-12-07-quill-twitter/","date":1638984256000,"content":"\n<p>Quill, yesterday:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Together with Twitter, we will continue to pursue our original\ngoalâ€‰â€”â€‰to make online communication more thoughtful, and more\neffective, for everyone.</p>\n\n<p>Quill will be shutting down, but its spirit and ideas will\ncontinue on. Youâ€™ll be able to export your team message history\nuntil 1pm PST, Saturday, December 11th 2021, when we will be\nturning off our servers and deleting all data. For all active\nteams, weâ€™re issuing full refunds.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Most new endeavors donâ€™t succeed. Trust me, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2016/08/vesper_adieu\">I get it</a>. The end is never pretty. But four daysâ€™ notice is almost bizarrely hostileâ€‰â€”â€‰especially given that Quill was acquired, and didnâ€™t simply run out of money. This is a service that they asked teams to trust. To say itâ€™s disruptive to give people half a week to export their data and find a new collaboration platform is an understatement. What if someone is on vacation? What if itâ€™s crunch week for a team facing a deadline?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/sdw/status/1468289633964290049\">Sebastiaan de With</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Quill was a great product. We rely on it at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/luxdotcamera\">@luxdotcamera</a>. Iâ€™m\nhappy for the very talented team.</p>\n\n<p>However, this is a total service shutdown with a 4 day notice.\nWhat an abysmal way to treat your users. Angry and disappointed. ðŸ‘Ž</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Twitter, where <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/07/27/twitter-acquires-brief\">exciting new products</a> go to be shut down.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/12/08/twitter-quill-shutdown\">Â â˜…Â </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"3afa131b75cff3f8cfbaa3d28ade58be9e09e365a0281ca72d8dab1f3f7e8664","category":"Tech"}
