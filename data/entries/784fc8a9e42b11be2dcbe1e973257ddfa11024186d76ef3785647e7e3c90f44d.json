And at this price, it’s cheaper than the iPhone 16 Pro, which starts at $999.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2259608/15-inch-macbook-air-m3-review.html\">reviewed the MacBook Air</a> and were so impressed with its performance that we gave it a near-perfect score and our Editors’ Choice award. Our expert appreciated the excellent display and the awesome battery life, to name just a few of the things on his list. “Apple’s new MacBook Air isn’t a revelation, but it’s a nice upgrade over the previous model. The larger, brighter display with thinner bezels is a nice improvement, MagSafe charging is back, and it’s got frankly incredible performance for a 2.7-pound computer that can do well over a full day of real work on a single charge.” the review reads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This particular model features 8GB of unified memory and 256GB of storage space, which is enough for a lot of your apps and files. Since this is an Air model, the most impressive thing about it is how light and thin it is. We have already mentioned its 2.7-pound weight, but we also have to say it’s just 0.44 inches thick, which means it will easily slip into any of your bags.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All that plus it’s ready for macOS Sequoia and the Apple Intelligence update coming next month.
