The Korean automaker <a href=\"https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2023/RCLRPT-23V651-6950.PDF\">is recalling 1.6 million cars</a> in the US after 21 vehicle fires and 22 thermal incidents that have taken place since 2017.</p>\n<p>The past couple of years have seen a lot of scaremongering from the anti-electric vehicle crowd.
