Unless you’re able to stay within those\nChromebook-esque constraints, things get real chuggy real fast.\nWe’ve all been assuming that Apple’s much-vaunted prowess at\nmaking fast ARM chips for iPads will translate well to Macs, but\nthere’s no guarantee that’s true until we get to test them\nourselves.</p>\n\n<p>Another thing I’ve learned is that using a Windows computer with\nan ARM processor actually requires a higher level of technical\nexpertise, because you need to know what won’t work and why\ngoing in.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As with my <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/11/02/pa-semi-looking-back\">previous item</a> linking back to Rik Myslewski’s 2008 take on Apple’s acquisition of P.A. Semi, I am <em>not</em> trying to dunk on Dieter Bohn here. 18 months ago, these were all perfectly reasonable concerns.</p>\n\n<p>The gist of <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2020/12/m1_macs_truth_and_truthiness\">my M1 MacBook review a year ago</a> was that, until then, computers could run cool and slow, or, hot and fast. My thinking about Apple moving to its own ARM-based silicon was that their chips would run cool and “fast enough”. The idea that Apple’s chips would be both way faster <em>and</em> way cooler seemed too good to be true. Like, not just having your cake and eating it too, but having your cake and eating it twice.</p>\n\n<p>But, here we are. It turns out that Microsoft’s foray into ARM-based Windows machines was just an entirely different ballgame.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/11/02/bohn-windows-arm\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"428aa6ac3f3d9d210d8f6a2f066b2003fa374027468e6df51eb7caf6916b9358","category":"Tech"}
