Now, at least in the most populous state in the US, that dream has become a reality. So why isn’t Apple—a company that <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-apple-feud-over-privacy-internet-future/\">increasingly uses privacy as a selling point</a>—helping its customers take advantage of it?</p>\n<p>When California passed the <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/ccpa-guide-california-privacy-law-takes-effect/\">California Consumer Privacy Act</a> (CCPA) in 2018, the law came with a large asterisk. In theory, the CCPA gives California residents the right to tell websites not to sell their personal data. In practice, exercising that right means <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/avoid-cookie-popups-gdpr/\">clicking through an interminable number of privacy policies and cookie notices</a>, one by one, on every site you visit. Only a masochist or a die-hard privacy enthusiast would go to the trouble of clicking through to the cookie settings every time they’re looking up a menu or buying a vacuum. Privacy will remain, for most people, a right that exists only on paper until there’s a simple one-click way to opt out of tracking across the whole Internet.</p>\n<p></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1784258#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1784258&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5a007285337a7de3c3255ba6accbac6144bdda7001c931bafd43bfc4882564b2","category":"Tech"}
