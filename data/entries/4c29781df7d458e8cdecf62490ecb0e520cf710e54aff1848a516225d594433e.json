Such an update would apply to both primary series shots as well as boosters.</p>\n<p>The monovalent update means that the next COVID-19 vaccines will only target one version of pandemic coronaviruses. This is a switch from the current formula, which is bivalent, targeting both the spike protein from the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain and the previous leading omicron subvariants BA.4/5 (which share a spike protein).</p>\n<p>In Thursday's day-long meeting, advisers reviewed data suggesting that the current bivalent vaccine continues to protect from the most severe outcomes of COVID-19, but protection from infection and hospitalization wanes over time and wanes notably faster against the XBB variants. To date, <a href=\"https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-people-booster-percent-total\">only 17 percent</a> of Americans have received a bivalent booster, meaning their protection is significantly weakened since their last dose of the original vaccine formula, which only targeted the ancestral strain.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1948365#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1948365&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4c29781df7d458e8cdecf62490ecb0e520cf710e54aff1848a516225d594433e","category":"Tech"}
