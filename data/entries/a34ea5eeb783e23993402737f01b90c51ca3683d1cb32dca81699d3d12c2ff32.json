There is a little too much darkness in this world and not enough light, a little too much pseudoscience and not enough science. We'll let other publications offer you a daily horoscope. At Ars Technica, we're going to take a different route, finding inspiration from very real images of a universe that is filled with stars and wonder.</em></p>\n    \n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Good morning. It's January 15, and today's image comes to us from Playa Grande, Mexico.</p>\n<p>I realize that some readers may be tiring of seeing the Milky Way Galaxy, but not me! I love photos of our galaxy and so they are regularly featured in the Daily Telescope. However, this photo is truly special, as it highlights not just the heavens above, but one of the wonders here on Earth.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995815#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1995815&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a34ea5eeb783e23993402737f01b90c51ca3683d1cb32dca81699d3d12c2ff32","category":"Tech"}
