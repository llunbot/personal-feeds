Many new products paved the way for more fun on the bike and safer ways to explore the world on two wheels.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gear-of-the-year-Jordan-Villella-P2A.jpeg\"><img width=\"1144\" height=\"1220\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gear-of-the-year-Jordan-Villella-P2A.jpeg\" alt=\"Gear of the year Jordan Villella P2A\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gear-of-the-year-Jordan-Villella-P2A.jpeg 1144w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gear-of-the-year-Jordan-Villella-P2A-281x300.jpeg 281w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gear-of-the-year-Jordan-Villella-P2A-800x853.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gear-of-the-year-Jordan-Villella-P2A-113x120.jpeg 113w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gear-of-the-year-Jordan-Villella-P2A-768x819.jpeg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Nothing like a pop-up ‘cross feature in a gravel race</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, only a few products left a lasting impression on me, earning a spot on my Editor’s Choice list. These products continued to get me stoked well beyond the review period. My selection is a variety of items, including road gear, tires, shoes, and even a new (to me) race thrown in for good measure.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/KASK-Elemento-Helmet-jordan-Villella-smile-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/KASK-Elemento-Helmet-jordan-Villella-smile--800x600.jpeg\" alt=\"KASK Elemento Helmet jordan Villella smile\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/KASK-Elemento-Helmet-jordan-Villella-smile--800x600.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/KASK-Elemento-Helmet-jordan-Villella-smile--297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/KASK-Elemento-Helmet-jordan-Villella-smile--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/KASK-Elemento-Helmet-jordan-Villella-smile--768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/KASK-Elemento-Helmet-jordan-Villella-smile-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>About Jordan Villella</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As a bit of get-to-know-me, I’m the road, cross-country mountain, and cyclocross race guy here at BikeRumor. I like to race my bike, but I have as much fun cruising around with the family.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Ventum-NS1-review-jordan-villella-road-cows-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"521\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Ventum-NS1-review-jordan-villella-road-cows--800x521.jpeg\" alt=\"Ventum NS1 review jordan villella road cows\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Ventum-NS1-review-jordan-villella-road-cows--800x521.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Ventum-NS1-review-jordan-villella-road-cows--297x193.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Ventum-NS1-review-jordan-villella-road-cows--120x78.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Ventum-NS1-review-jordan-villella-road-cows--768x500.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Ventum-NS1-review-jordan-villella-road-cows-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo: Brett Rothmeyer</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I gravitate to the performance side of cycling gear; I love new ways to squeeze every watt out of an effort. For some reason, I’m slightly obsessed with tires (especially cyclocross ones) and love the smell of Mastik in the morning. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After years of racing and riding, I never get sick of the preseason shuffle. Checking out new training tools, dialing in schedules, and obsessing about small stuff. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Jordan-V-Ed-Choice-and-raphi--e1671125740885-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"978\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Jordan-V-Ed-Choice-and-raphi--e1671125740885-800x978.jpeg\" alt=\"Jordan V Ed Choice and raphi\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Jordan-V-Ed-Choice-and-raphi--e1671125740885-800x978.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Jordan-V-Ed-Choice-and-raphi--e1671125740885-245x300.jpeg 245w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Jordan-V-Ed-Choice-and-raphi--e1671125740885-98x120.jpeg 98w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Jordan-V-Ed-Choice-and-raphi--e1671125740885-768x939.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Jordan-V-Ed-Choice-and-raphi--e1671125740885.jpeg 960w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo: Evette Gabriel </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This year, I spent lots of time trying to get more butts on bikes, especially with kids in our community, and working with local organizations like <a href=\"https://www.communicycle.org/\">Communicycle</a>, hosting gear drives, or hosting cyclocross practices at our local course at <a href=\"https://hollowoak.org/\">Hollow Oak Land Trust</a>. It’s fantastic to see new riders of all ages get on two wheels and have fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gear-of-the-year-Jordan-Villella-racing-raphi-.jpeg\"><img width=\"640\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gear-of-the-year-Jordan-Villella-racing-raphi-.jpeg\" alt=\"Gear of the year Jordan Villella racing raphi\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gear-of-the-year-Jordan-Villella-racing-raphi-.jpeg 640w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gear-of-the-year-Jordan-Villella-racing-raphi--200x300.jpeg 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gear-of-the-year-Jordan-Villella-racing-raphi--80x120.jpeg 80w\" /></a><figcaption>Photos: Mike Briggs </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gear-of-the-year-Jordan-Villella-nino-dad.jpeg\"><img width=\"640\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gear-of-the-year-Jordan-Villella-nino-dad.jpeg\" alt=\"Gear of the year Jordan Villella nino dad\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gear-of-the-year-Jordan-Villella-nino-dad.jpeg 640w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gear-of-the-year-Jordan-Villella-nino-dad-200x300.jpeg 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gear-of-the-year-Jordan-Villella-nino-dad-80x120.jpeg 80w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2023, I was more excited for my kid’s races than my own. Feeling their nervous excitement and wonder of what’s to come was another level of stoke for me and the sport.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for reading, commenting, and contributing to our world here at Bike Rumor — now, on to my favorite gear of the year! </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Jordan Villella – Gear of the Year </h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Best Event: Paris to Ancaster </h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gear-of-the-year-Jordan-Villella-banner--scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1709\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gear-of-the-year-Jordan-Villella-banner--scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Gear of the year Jordan Villella banner\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gear-of-the-year-Jordan-Villella-banner--scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gear-of-the-year-Jordan-Villella-banner--297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gear-of-the-year-Jordan-Villella-banner--800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gear-of-the-year-Jordan-Villella-banner--120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gear-of-the-year-Jordan-Villella-banner--768x513.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gear-of-the-year-Jordan-Villella-banner--1536x1025.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gear-of-the-year-Jordan-Villella-banner--2048x1367.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gear-of-the-year-Jordan-Villella-banner--720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I kicked off my gravel season with a race I had earmarked for years. For 2023, the schedule stars finally aligned, and so did the classic weather. <a href=\"http://www.parisancaster.com/\">Paris to Ancaster </a>is Canada’s spring classic, and this year, it was host to the Canadian National Gravel Championships. The race is in its 30th year, but the cobbled and gravel paths are much older. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gear-of-the-year-Jordan-Villella-shoot--scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gear-of-the-year-Jordan-Villella-shoot--800x1200.jpeg\" alt=\"Gear of the year Jordan Villella shoot\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gear-of-the-year-Jordan-Villella-shoot--800x1200.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gear-of-the-year-Jordan-Villella-shoot--200x300.jpeg 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gear-of-the-year-Jordan-Villella-shoot--80x120.jpeg 80w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gear-of-the-year-Jordan-Villella-shoot--768x1152.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gear-of-the-year-Jordan-Villella-shoot--1024x1536.jpeg 1024w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gear-of-the-year-Jordan-Villella-shoot--1365x2048.jpeg 1365w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gear-of-the-year-Jordan-Villella-shoot--scaled.jpeg 1706w\" /></a><figcaption>When you need the glasses </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gear-of-the-year-Jordan-Villella-finish-p2a--scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"1001\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gear-of-the-year-Jordan-Villella-finish-p2a--800x1001.jpeg\" alt=\"Gear of the year Jordan Villella finish p2a\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gear-of-the-year-Jordan-Villella-finish-p2a--800x1001.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gear-of-the-year-Jordan-Villella-finish-p2a--240x300.jpeg 240w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gear-of-the-year-Jordan-Villella-finish-p2a--96x120.jpeg 96w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gear-of-the-year-Jordan-Villella-finish-p2a--768x961.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gear-of-the-year-Jordan-Villella-finish-p2a--1228x1536.jpeg 1228w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gear-of-the-year-Jordan-Villella-finish-p2a--1637x2048.jpeg 1637w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Gear-of-the-year-Jordan-Villella-finish-p2a--scaled.jpeg 2046w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The course is everything a rider like me wants in a gravel race. It starts like a full-on cyclocross race, going to the road and eventually to some gravel and cobbles. The gravel sectors are split with cyclocross-style field riding, some single-track, and end with world cup-worthy mud chutes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The event production was professional, and I felt supremely safe on the course, with traffic managed thoughtfully and fans lining the road. For 2023, the riders were treated to the complete classics experience. The weather was cold, with a slight rain, the fields were muddy and gears were grinding. I had such a blast last year, and I plan on attending in 2024 — hopefully, I’ll see you there! </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Best All-Road Bike: Mosaic RT-1 ITR</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mosaic-RT1-ITR-full-bike-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"499\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mosaic-RT1-ITR-full-bike--800x499.jpeg\" alt=\"Mosaic RT1 ITR full bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mosaic-RT1-ITR-full-bike--800x499.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mosaic-RT1-ITR-full-bike--297x185.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mosaic-RT1-ITR-full-bike--120x75.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mosaic-RT1-ITR-full-bike--768x479.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mosaic-RT1-ITR-full-bike-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Mosaic RT-1 ITR is a forever bike, and I rarely get them in my review stream. I call it a ‘forever bike’ because I can’t see needing more or this timeless frame losing its appeal. I was lucky to spend a lot of time on this machine during the spring, and the lively ride has me questioning my carbon commitments. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mosaic-RT1-ITR-logo-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"574\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mosaic-RT1-ITR-logo--800x574.jpeg\" alt=\"Mosaic RT1 ITR logo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mosaic-RT1-ITR-logo--800x574.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mosaic-RT1-ITR-logo--297x213.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mosaic-RT1-ITR-logo--120x86.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mosaic-RT1-ITR-logo--768x551.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mosaic-RT1-ITR-logo-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/mosaic-rt-1-itr-all-road-bike-first-look-review/\">Mosaic’s RT-1 ITR</a> is an all-road design made to order. The frame is crafted from custom T3A/2.5V double-butted titanium tube sets. The geometry is enough to dabble in everything road, but it’s more endurance than sharp steering.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mosaic-RT1-ITR-hunt-hubs-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mosaic-RT1-ITR-hunt-hubs--800x600.jpeg\" alt=\"Mosaic RT1 ITR hunt hubs\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mosaic-RT1-ITR-hunt-hubs--800x600.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mosaic-RT1-ITR-hunt-hubs--297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mosaic-RT1-ITR-hunt-hubs--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mosaic-RT1-ITR-hunt-hubs--768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Mosaic-RT1-ITR-hunt-hubs-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The 35mm max tire clearance is generous on the classic-looking frame, and on 32mm file treads, the RT-1 rolls like a dream. The RT-1 has entirely internal cable routing thanks to some Enve bits and thoughtful engineering. The updated routing accentuates the clean lines of the frame and allows the ti to come forward. I like the raw finish of our review model, coupled with the glossy Enve and Hunt wheel bling. The matching carbon fork with the titanium paint finish knocked it out of the park for me.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Best Gravel Bike: Ventum GS1 </h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Ventum-GS1-beauty-Rothmeyer.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Ventum-GS1-beauty-Rothmeyer-800x450.jpeg\" alt=\"Ventum GS1 beauty Rothmeyer\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Ventum-GS1-beauty-Rothmeyer-800x450.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Ventum-GS1-beauty-Rothmeyer-297x167.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Ventum-GS1-beauty-Rothmeyer-120x68.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Ventum-GS1-beauty-Rothmeyer-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Ventum-GS1-beauty-Rothmeyer-400x225.jpeg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Ventum-GS1-beauty-Rothmeyer.jpeg 1280w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo: Brett Rothmeyer</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/updated-ventum-gs1-review-gravel-race-bike/\">Ventum GS1</a> was my first reviewed bike for 2023, and the impressions stayed with me all year. Rarely do you get a bike that feels so dialed right off the bat, especially coming straight from ‘cross-season. The GS1, however, has an aggressive feel with a balanced geometry that walks the fine line in the need to carve corners and feel confident on descents. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Jordan-gravel-Ventum-GS1-Rothmeyer.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Jordan-gravel-Ventum-GS1-Rothmeyer-800x450.jpeg\" alt=\"Jordan gravel Ventum GS1 Rothmeyer\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Jordan-gravel-Ventum-GS1-Rothmeyer-800x450.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Jordan-gravel-Ventum-GS1-Rothmeyer-297x167.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Jordan-gravel-Ventum-GS1-Rothmeyer-120x68.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Jordan-gravel-Ventum-GS1-Rothmeyer-768x432.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Jordan-gravel-Ventum-GS1-Rothmeyer-400x225.jpeg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Jordan-gravel-Ventum-GS1-Rothmeyer.jpeg 1280w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo: Brett Rothmeyer</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The 40mm tire clearance seemed adequate for the roads and gravel I frequent. However, the new GS1 frame handles itself more like an endurance road design and less like a monster truck. Plus, the updated presentation of the bike is very mature. Ventum’s updated one-piece bar/stem combo is easy to adjust and has the right bit of compliance for weary hands. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Ventum-GS1-profile-open-left-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Ventum-GS1-profile-open-left--800x600.jpeg\" alt=\"Ventum GS1 profile open left\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Ventum-GS1-profile-open-left--800x600.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Ventum-GS1-profile-open-left--297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Ventum-GS1-profile-open-left--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Ventum-GS1-profile-open-left--768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Ventum-GS1-profile-open-left-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a rider looking for the best bang for your buck on a bike, the Ventum GS1 comes in builds from SRAM AXS Apex ($3,000) to SRAM AXS Red ($8,000). </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Best Cyclocross Bike: Canyon Inflite </h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Challenge-Tire-Red-SE-TLR-full-bike-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Challenge-Tire-Red-SE-TLR-full-bike--800x600.jpeg\" alt=\"Challenge Tire Red SE TLR full bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Challenge-Tire-Red-SE-TLR-full-bike--800x600.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Challenge-Tire-Red-SE-TLR-full-bike--297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Challenge-Tire-Red-SE-TLR-full-bike--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Challenge-Tire-Red-SE-TLR-full-bike--768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Challenge-Tire-Red-SE-TLR-full-bike-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I spent most (all) my time on the Canyon Inflite for cyclocross season and some gravel. Many companies are pushing their ‘cross bikes into double duty as gravel bikes and doing away with purebred cyclocross machines. Canyon is one of the few manufacturers to keep a full-on ‘cross bike, but it also has an assortment of gravel machines.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Challenge-Tire-38mm-tubular-trails-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Challenge-Tire-38mm-tubular-trails--800x600.jpeg\" alt=\"Challenge Tire 38mm tubular trails\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Challenge-Tire-38mm-tubular-trails--800x600.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Challenge-Tire-38mm-tubular-trails--297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Challenge-Tire-38mm-tubular-trails--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Challenge-Tire-38mm-tubular-trails--768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Challenge-Tire-38mm-tubular-trails-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo: Shawn Geiger</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Inflite is nothing short of awesome between the tape and anywhere unpaved. The build for my review model is the MVDP special edition. It comes with Shimano GRX shifters and an Ultegra Di2 2x setup. The build is well thought out and perfect for racing the World Cups or your local cross scene. I can’t imagine a better cyclocross bike (or build) for the demands of modern ‘cross. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Best Saddle: Cadex Amp </h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CADEX-Amp-saddle-review-mounted-on-Canyon-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CADEX-Amp-saddle-review-mounted-on-Canyon--800x600.jpeg\" alt=\"CADEX Amp saddle review mounted on Canyon\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CADEX-Amp-saddle-review-mounted-on-Canyon--800x600.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CADEX-Amp-saddle-review-mounted-on-Canyon--297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CADEX-Amp-saddle-review-mounted-on-Canyon--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CADEX-Amp-saddle-review-mounted-on-Canyon--768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CADEX-Amp-saddle-review-mounted-on-Canyon-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/cadex-amp-carbon-saddl/\">Cadex Amp </a>saddle is race-focused and a super comfortable piece of gear. Those two ideas rarely coincide; when they do, it’s magic. Now, all saddles are different, and even the “best saddle” can be problematic to some riders. But if you’re a short-nose, powerful position saddle rider, the AMP should be on your list. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CADEX-Amp-saddle-review.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"488\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CADEX-Amp-saddle-review-800x488.jpeg\" alt=\"CADEX Amp saddle review\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CADEX-Amp-saddle-review-800x488.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CADEX-Amp-saddle-review-297x181.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CADEX-Amp-saddle-review-120x73.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CADEX-Amp-saddle-review-768x468.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CADEX-Amp-saddle-review.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It has a similar feel to the Specialized Power but with a slightly wider nose and more hip freedom. The weight is a seriously light 129g, with a Cadex guarantee on the carbon and rails. The price reflects the performance, but this is your saddle if you value less weight and high comfort. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Best CX Tire: Challenge Flandrien  </h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Challenge-Team-Edition-Flandrien-tubular-knobs.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Challenge-Team-Edition-Flandrien-tubular-knobs-800x600.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Challenge-Team-Edition-Flandrien-tubular-knobs-800x600.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Challenge-Team-Edition-Flandrien-tubular-knobs-297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Challenge-Team-Edition-Flandrien-tubular-knobs-120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Challenge-Team-Edition-Flandrien-tubular-knobs-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Challenge-Team-Edition-Flandrien-tubular-knobs.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/challenges-baby-pidcock-tire-officially-becomes-the-flandrien/\">Flandrien</a> tire rounded out the mud tire offerings for Challenge in 2023 but also gave the cyclocross world a true rut performer. The new Flandrien tubular is a mix between the popular Baby Limus tread and reminiscent of popular mud designs. I love how the tire feels on a frozen course or with active rain. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Challenge-Team-Edition-Flandrien-tubular-rider-top-view.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"502\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Challenge-Team-Edition-Flandrien-tubular-rider-top-view-800x502.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Challenge-Team-Edition-Flandrien-tubular-rider-top-view-800x502.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Challenge-Team-Edition-Flandrien-tubular-rider-top-view-297x186.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Challenge-Team-Edition-Flandrien-tubular-rider-top-view-120x75.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Challenge-Team-Edition-Flandrien-tubular-rider-top-view-768x482.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Challenge-Team-Edition-Flandrien-tubular-rider-top-view.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The tread is open and sheds mud quickly but has a tightly spaced center line. The combination is fast and grippy, especially when diving into ruts. The round profile of the Flandrien offers traction throughout, especially in off-camber or falling sections of the trail. It is highly recommended for riders looking for a fast mud tire that has a wide condition performance range.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Best Road Tire: Vittoria Corsa Control </h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-Speed-control-Tires-wide-wall-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-Speed-control-Tires-wide-wall--800x600.jpeg\" alt=\"Vittoria Corsa Pro Speed control Tires wide wall\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-Speed-control-Tires-wide-wall--800x600.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-Speed-control-Tires-wide-wall--297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-Speed-control-Tires-wide-wall--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-Speed-control-Tires-wide-wall--768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-Speed-control-Tires-wide-wall-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/vittoria-corsa-pro-speed-and-control-tires/\">Corsa Control</a> is my favorite road tire, and it has been since its launch. Never has a tubeless tire felt so plush (like tubular) with all the benefits of a tubeless system. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-Speed-control-Tires-front-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-Speed-control-Tires-front--800x600.jpeg\" alt=\"Vittoria Corsa Pro Speed control Tires front\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-Speed-control-Tires-front--800x600.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-Speed-control-Tires-front--297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-Speed-control-Tires-front--120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-Speed-control-Tires-front--768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-Speed-control-Tires-front-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I prefer the Corsa Contol in a 28 or 30mm. It’s like getting the best of both worlds: fast rolling and suspension-like suppleness. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Best Trainer Upgrade: Zwift Play</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Zwift-Play-both-controlers-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Zwift-Play-both-controlers--800x450.jpeg\" alt=\"Zwift Play both controlers\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Zwift-Play-both-controlers--800x450.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Zwift-Play-both-controlers--297x167.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Zwift-Play-both-controlers--120x68.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Zwift-Play-both-controlers--768x432.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Zwift-Play-both-controlers--400x225.jpeg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Zwift-Play-both-controlers--1200x675.jpeg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Zwift-Play-both-controlers-.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I spend a lot of time on the trainer, especially in the winter. I was super excited when Zwift dropped the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/zwift-play-video-game-controllers-for-indoor-bike-trainer/\">Zwift Play</a> controllers. Like most, I run Zwift off my laptop, and the unit sits intentionally far away to combat sweat and the like. With the new Play controller, I could adjust my workouts without running to the laptop with sweaty hands and it’s easier than ever to give a ‘ride-on’. I also used it for turning, braking, and all-around navigation. It’s not a “must have,” but if you’re an indoor interval or early morning trainer kinda rider, I highly suggest it. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Best Off-Bike Accessory – Kane Revive Shoes </h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Kane-recovery-shoes-both--scaled.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"559\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Kane-recovery-shoes-both--800x559.jpeg\" alt=\"Kane recovery shoes both\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Kane-recovery-shoes-both--800x559.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Kane-recovery-shoes-both--297x208.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Kane-recovery-shoes-both--120x84.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Kane-recovery-shoes-both--768x537.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Kane-recovery-shoes-both--1536x1074.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Kane-recovery-shoes-both--2048x1431.jpeg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m a guy who likes an easy on/off shoe for race days and travel. I came across the<a href=\"https://kanefootwear.com/products/revive-choi\"> Kane Revive shoe</a>, and it’s been my dedicated race day/airplane shoe ever since.

Does it help with recovery… maybe? But it does help when you’re getting your shoes on/off for pre-rides or cleaning up after a muddy race. Plus, they come in many colors, enough to match any kit or what have you. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>I wish you all a fantastic 2024 filled with no rolled tubulars, an easy tubeless setup, no (or fewer) flats, and lots of fun on the bike!</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Jordan-V-Ed-Choice-press-camp-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Jordan-V-Ed-Choice-press-camp-800x600.jpeg\" alt=\"Jordan V Ed Choice press camp\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Jordan-V-Ed-Choice-press-camp-800x600.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Jordan-V-Ed-Choice-press-camp-297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Jordan-V-Ed-Choice-press-camp-120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Jordan-V-Ed-Choice-press-camp-768x576.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Jordan-V-Ed-Choice-press-camp.jpeg 1280w\" /></a><figcaption>Rides with the USA Cycling crew in Colorado Springs </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<hr />\n\n\n\n<p><em>These products were chosen purely on their technical merits and for the above reasons.
