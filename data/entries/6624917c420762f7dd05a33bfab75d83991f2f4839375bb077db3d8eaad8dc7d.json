Here's how to make your Lock Screen wallpaper shuffle through photos from a specific album in your photo library.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/shuffle-photos-lock-screen.jpg\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2500\" />\r<br />\nIn recent versions of iOS, Apple has made it possible for users to customize the Lock Screen in ways that were simply not possible in earlier versions of its mobile software, and one feature in particular that has proven popular is the ability to shuffle photos on your Lock Screen wallpaper at specific intervals or whenever you wake or tap the screen. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn iOS 17.1, Apple has extended this feature so that you can now shuffle pictures from a specific album from your photo library, rather than having to manually select individual photos or rely on Apple's preset options of People, Pets, Nature, and Cities. The following steps show you how it's done on iPhones running iOS 17.1.\r<br />\n<ol><li>Wake your <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and use <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mask-face-id/\">Face ID</a> to unlock it, but don't swipe up on the Lock Screen.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Press and hold on the Lock Screen until the wallpaper gallery appears, then tap the blue <strong>+</strong> button in the bottom-right corner of the screen.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Select <strong>Photo Shuffle</strong> from the wallpaper menu.\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/lock-screen-photo-shuffle.jpg\" alt=\"Lock Screen\" width=\"2738\" height=\"2716\" />\r<br />\n</li><li>Tap the new <strong>Album</strong> option, then choose the album of photos from your library that you'd like to shuffle between.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Next, choose a <strong>Shuffle Frequency</strong>: <strong>Daily</strong>, <strong>Hourly</strong>, <strong>On Lock</strong>, or <strong>On Tap</strong>.\r<br />\n</li><li>Tap <strong>Use Album</strong> to move on.\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/choose-shuffle-album.jpg\" alt=\"shuffle\" width=\"2738\" height=\"2716\" />\r<br />\n</li><li>Tap the screen to preview the photos in your chosen album as they will appear on your Lock Screen, and tap the clock to adjust the font style and color so that the time, date, and any widgets remain legible against all of your pictures.</li>\r<br />\n<li>Tap <strong>Done</strong> in the top-right corner to finish, then choose either <strong>Set as Wallpaper Pair</strong> to finish or <strong>Customize Home Screen</strong> to tweak its look separately, then tap <strong>Done</strong>.\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/10/photo-shuffle-preview.jpg\" alt=\"photo shuffle\" width=\"2738\" height=\"2716\" /></li></ol>Tap your new album-specific photo shuffle wallpaper in the gallery to make it live.
