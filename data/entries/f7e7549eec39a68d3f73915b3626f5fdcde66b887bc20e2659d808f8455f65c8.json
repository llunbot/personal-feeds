Nevertheless, the iPhone maker has managed to build solid tools that often come in handy when getting productive tasks done. While I don’t necessarily find them exceptionally exciting, they certainly complement my everyday workflows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some of the ways Apple Intelligence can be useful and increase your productivity in iOS/iPadOS 18.1 and coming soon in <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2499054/ios-18-2-apple-intelligence-siri-genmoji-install-release-beta.html\">iOS/iPadOS 18.2</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Articulate like a pro</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing I wish I had as a student majoring in English Language and Literature is the Writing Tools feature. Having written countless essays during my academic journey, I can’t imagine how simpler it would’ve been with access to Apple’s AI. While I advise you not to rely on the feature to compose assignments from scratch, the proofreading perk spares you the need to scan through thousands of words at a time. It’s essentially a free Grammarly clone that works offline, and I actively use it to uncover typos and errors in my articles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond composing text and proofreading, Writing Tools can also change the tone of your existing text. So, for example, if you’re emailing your professor or employer, it can ensure that your tone is professional. It similarly lets you make the text more concise, turn it into a list, make it friendlier, and more.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Writing-Tools-on-iPad.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple Intelligence writing tools\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Writing-Tools-on-iPad.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Writing-Tools-on-iPad.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Writing-Tools-on-iPad.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Writing-Tools-on-iPad.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Writing-Tools-on-iPad.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Writing-Tools-on-iPad.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Writing-Tools-on-iPad.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Writing-Tools-on-iPad.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>All you need to achieve inbox zero</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of emails, the built-in Mail app has got a serious Apple Intelligence boost with iOS 18. While the application has long been criticized for being too plain, it’s evolving into a solid client that handles my work and personal emails.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps my favorite feature in Apple Mail is the AI summaries. The app can now read my emails and generate a short paragraph encompassing their gist. It also splits my inbox into four sections—Primary, Transactions, Updates, and Promotions—which filters out the noise (coming in iOS 18.2). Unfortunately, though, categorization in Mail is currently exclusive to the iPhone, which makes it useless when working on macOS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, the Mail app can now compose smart replies based on the initial message. This makes it easier for those with cluttered inboxes to quickly respond and get emails out of the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Bring out the magic in your art</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a terrible illustrator, Image Wand is yet another iOS 18.2 Apple Intelligence perk I wish I had as a student. Back then, coming up with half-decent drawings for science class was a nightmare.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tool can scan a basic doodle and, with the help of your keyword(s), generate a decent version of it. So, for example, it could transform a rough sketch of a house I created in under 10 seconds into a vibrant masterpiece that would take me days to replicate manually. It’s excellent for visualizing your thoughts when taking notes or presenting an idea to someone.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Image-Wand-on-iPad.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Image Wand on iPad\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Image-Wand-on-iPad.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Image-Wand-on-iPad.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Image-Wand-on-iPad.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Image-Wand-on-iPad.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Image-Wand-on-iPad.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Image-Wand-on-iPad.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Image-Wand-on-iPad.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Image-Wand-on-iPad.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>OpenAI has entered the chat</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While Apple Intelligence primarily relies on first-party models, the company has also integrated OpenAI’s ChatGPT into Siri and Visual Intelligence in iOS 18.2. This lets me swiftly get proper answers to everyday questions or inquire about objects in front of me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming from an era where school research was conducted by reading physical books and resources, I especially appreciate how accessible knowledge has become. Sure, Google Search has been around for a while, but requesting information from ChatGPT using Siri is infinitely faster and more intuitive.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ChatGPT-via-Siri-on-iPad.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"ChatGPT via Siri on iPad\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ChatGPT-via-Siri-on-iPad.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ChatGPT-via-Siri-on-iPad.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ChatGPT-via-Siri-on-iPad.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ChatGPT-via-Siri-on-iPad.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ChatGPT-via-Siri-on-iPad.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ChatGPT-via-Siri-on-iPad.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ChatGPT-via-Siri-on-iPad.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ChatGPT-via-Siri-on-iPad.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Effortlessly summarized lectures</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Other AI features that could assist students during lectures are automatic audio transcriptions and summaries. When recording audio using Apple Notes or Voice Memos, the app shows the transcript in real time. Once the recording session concludes, you can view a summary of the transcript. These perks simplify skimming through long lectures, as one can immediately spot the keywords they’re interested in or get an idea of what a class is all about.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Audio-transcript-summary-on-iPad.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Audio transcription iPad\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Audio-transcript-summary-on-iPad.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Audio-transcript-summary-on-iPad.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Audio-transcript-summary-on-iPad.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Audio-transcript-summary-on-iPad.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Audio-transcript-summary-on-iPad.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Audio-transcript-summary-on-iPad.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Audio-transcript-summary-on-iPad.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Audio-transcript-summary-on-iPad.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>It’s an accessible, invaluable asset</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Third-party companies have long offered software with capabilities similar to these. What’s so special about Apple Intelligence is how well it is integrated into the firm’s operating systems. Those with eligible devices can rely on these perks without needing to pay for multiple subscription services or install a ton of apps. Apple’s AI is natively woven into these platforms, making its use frictionless and hassle-free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Writing Tools menu, for example, pops up automatically when selecting text. Similarly, the Image Wand works in multiple apps and appears where users expect it to be, and ChatGPT can analyze your text/voice queries and on-screen content anywhere across the OS. It all operates on a system level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Convenience plays a key role when it comes to user adoption of a new feature. Apple Intelligence may not be as thrilling as its rivals, but its front-and-center position will push many users to rely on its smarts when executing everyday productivity tasks.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"f7e7549eec39a68d3f73915b3626f5fdcde66b887bc20e2659d808f8455f65c8","category":"Apple"}
