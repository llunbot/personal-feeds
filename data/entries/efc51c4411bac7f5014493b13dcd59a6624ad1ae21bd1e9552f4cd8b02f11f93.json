{"title":"★ Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers Rules, in Excoriating Decision, That Apple Violated Her 2021 Court Order Regarding App Store Anti-Steering Provisions","link":"https://daringfireball.net/2025/04/gonzales_rogers_apple_app_store_ruling","date":1746067619000,"content":"\n<p>I’m linking <a href=\"https://www.techmeme.com/250430/p55#a250430p55\">here to Techmeme’s roundup of news coverage and commentary</a>, but I highly recommend you start by reading <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.1508.0_2.pdf\">Gonzalez Rogers’s 80-page decision</a>. It is excoriating. I’ve read few legal decisions quite like it. But it’s also incredibly cogent and plainly written.</p>\n\n<p>From the start:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>To summarize: <em>One</em>, after trial, the Court found that Apple’s 30\npercent commission “allowed it to reap supracompetitive operating\nmargins” and was not tied to the value of its intellectual\nproperty, and thus, was anticompetitive. Apple’s response: charge\na <em>27 percent commission</em> (again tied to nothing) on off-app\npurchases, where it had previously charged nothing, and extend the\ncommission for a period of seven days after the consumer\nlinked-out of the app. Apple’s goal: maintain its anticompetitive\nrevenue stream. <em>Two</em>, the Court had prohibited Apple from denying\ndevelopers the ability to communicate with, and direct consumers\nto, other purchasing mechanisms. Apple’s response: impose <em>new</em>\nbarriers and <em>new</em> requirements to increase friction and increase\nbreakage rates with full page “scare” screens, static URLs, and\ngeneric statements. Apple’s goal: to dissuade customer usage of\nalternative purchase opportunities and maintain its\nanticompetitive revenue stream. In the end, Apple sought to\nmaintain a revenue stream worth billions in direct defiance of\nthis Court’s Injunction.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There’s quite a bit of fury in those italics. Rule one when you’re in court, any court, is “Don’t piss off the judge.” Apple has absolutely infuriated Gonzales Rogers through actions that all of us saw as outrageous.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In stark contrast to Apple’s initial in-court testimony,\ncontemporaneous business documents reveal that Apple knew exactly\nwhat it was doing and at every turn chose the most\n<em>anti</em>competitive option. To hide the truth, Vice-President of\nFinance, Alex Roman, outright lied under oath. Internally, Phillip\nSchiller had advocated that Apple comply with the Injunction, but\nTim Cook ignored Schiller and instead allowed Chief Financial\nOfficer Luca Maestri and his finance team to convince him\notherwise. Cook chose poorly. The real evidence, detailed herein,\nmore than meets the clear and convincing standard to find a\nviolation. The Court refers the matter to the United States\nAttorney for the Northern District of California to investigate\nwhether criminal contempt proceedings are appropriate.</p>\n\n<p>This is an injunction, not a negotiation. There are no do-overs\nonce a party willfully disregards a court order. Time is of the\nessence. The Court will not tolerate further delays. As previously\nordered, Apple will not impede competition. The Court enjoins\nApple from implementing its new anticompetitive acts to avoid\ncompliance with the Injunction. <b><i>Effective immediately</i></b>\nApple will no longer impede developers’ ability to communicate with\nusers nor will they levy or impose a new commission on off-app purchases.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You know a judge is pissed when she busts out the bold italics. Later, on (page 21, citations omitted for readability):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Prior to the June 20 meeting, there were individuals within Apple\nwho were advocating for a commission, and others advocating for no\ncommission. Those advocating for a commission included Mr. Maestri\nand Mr. Roman. Mr. Schiller disagreed. In an email, Mr. Schiller\nrelayed that, with respect to the proposal for “a 27% commission\nfor 24 hours,” “I have already explained my many issues with the\ncommission concept,” and that “clearly I am not on team\ncommission/fee.” Mr. Schiller testified that, at the time, he “had\na question of whether we would be able to charge a commission”\nunder the Injunction, a concern which he communicated.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Schiller comes across as Apple’s sole voice of reason, fairness, and dare I say honesty in this entire ruling. The only people in the world who seemed to think Apple could or should comply with the 2021 injunction (that apps be permitted to steer users to the web to make purchases) by charging a commission — any commission, let alone a 27 percent commission — on those web transactions were Apple’s finance team members, led by Luca Maestri and Alex Roman, and Tim Cook.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Unlike Mr. Maestri and Mr. Roman, Mr. Schiller sat through the\nentire underlying trial and actually read the entire 180-page\ndecision. That Messrs. Maestri and Roman did neither, does not\nshield Apple of its knowledge (actual and constructive) of the\nCourt’s findings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I mean Jesus H. Christ, that’s scathing. </p>\n\n<p>It’s worth pointing out that Luca Maestri is no longer Apple’s CFO. (<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/leadership/kevan-parekh/\">Kevan Parekh is</a>.) Back in August, <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/08/apple-announces-chief-financial-officer-transition/\">Apple announced</a> that Maestri was, effectively, retiring as CFO “as part of a planned succession”. Apple’s statement didn’t use the word <em>retiring</em>, but rather the word <em>transitioning</em>. With this ruling and Maestri’s central role in Apple’s decision to forge ahead with a compliance plan where they “allowed” steering to the web by charging the same effective commissions on web transactions as they do for in-app transactions, I now have to wonder whether Maestri retired or “retired”. “Cook chose poorly” (by following Maestri’s recommendation) is not the sort of sentence from a judge that keeps CFOs in their jobs.</p>\n\n<p>As for Alex Roman, I think he’s in some serious trouble. Like doing-time-in-the-clink trouble:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Despite its own considerable evaluation, during the first May 2024\nhearing, Apple employees attempted to mislead the Court by\ntestifying that the decision to impose a commission was grounded\nin AG’s report. The testimony of Mr. Roman, Vice President of\nFinance, was replete with misdirection and outright lies. He even\nwent so far as to testify that Apple did not look at comparables\nto estimate the costs of alternative payment solutions that\ndevelopers would need to procure to facilitate linked-out\npurchases.</p>\n\n<p>The Court finds that Apple <em>did</em> consider the external\ncosts developers faced when utilizing alternative payment\nsolutions for linked out transactions, which conveniently exceeded\nthe 3% discount Apple ultimately decided to provide by a safe\nmargin. Apple <em>did not</em> rely on a substantiated bottoms-up analysis\nduring its months-long assessment of whether to impose a\ncommission, seemingly justifying its decision after the fact with\nthe AG’s report.</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Roman did not stop there, however. He also testified that up\nuntil January 16, 2024, Apple had no idea what fee it would impose\non linked-out purchases:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Q. And I take it that Apple decided to impose a 27 percent fee\n on linked purchases prior to January 16, 2024, correct?</p>\n\n<p>A. The decision was made that day.</p>\n\n<p>Q. It’s your testimony that up until January 16, 2024, Apple had\nno idea what — what fee it’s going to impose on linked purchases?</p>\n\n<p>A. That is correct.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Another lie under oath: contemporaneous business documents reveal\nthat on the contrary, the main components of Apple’s plan,\nincluding the 27% commission, were determined in July 2023.</p>\n\n<p>Neither Apple, nor its counsel, corrected the, now obvious, lies.\nThey did not seek to withdraw the testimony or to have it stricken\n(although Apple did request that the Court strike <em>other</em>\ntestimony). Thus, Apple will be held to have adopted the lies and\nmisrepresentations to this Court.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There’s so much more. <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.1508.0_2.pdf\">The whole ruling</a> is compelling — and damning — reading.</p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind this whole thing stems from an injunction from a lawsuit filed by Epic Games <em>that Apple largely won</em>. The result of that lawsuit was basically, “<em>OK, Apple wins, Epic loses, but this whole thing where apps in the App Store aren’t allowed to inform users of offers available outside the App Store, or send them to such offers on the web (outside the app) via easily tappable links, is bullshit and needs to stop. If the App Store is not anticompetitive it should be able to compete with links to the web and offers from outside the App Store.</em>”</p>\n\n<p>Are the results of this disastrous for Apple’s App Store business? I don’t think so at all. Gonzales Rogers is demanding that Apple ... do what Phil Schiller recommended they do all along, which is to compete fair and square with purchases available on the web. She’s not demanding they do what, say, Tim Sweeney wanted them to do. She’s basically saying Phil Schiller was right. Read her entire ruling and it’s hard to imagine anyone disagreeing with that.</p>\n\n<p>But are the results of this disastrous for Apple’s reputation and credibility? It sure seems like it. But it would be worse — much worse — for Apple’s reputation if Phil Schiller weren’t still there. Without him, this ruling makes it sound like they’d be lost, both ethically and legally.</p>\n\n<p>I’ll give the final words to Gonzales Rogers’s own closing:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple <em>willfully</em> chose not to comply with this Court’s\nInjunction. It did so with the express intent to create <em>new</em>\nanticompetitive barriers which would, by design and in effect,\nmaintain a valued revenue stream; a revenue stream previously\nfound to be anticompetitive. That it thought this Court would\ntolerate such insubordination was a gross miscalculation. As\nalways, the cover-up made it worse. For this Court, there is no\nsecond bite at the apple.</p>\n\n<p>It Is So Ordered.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n    ","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"efc51c4411bac7f5014493b13dcd59a6624ad1ae21bd1e9552f4cd8b02f11f93","category":"Tech"}
