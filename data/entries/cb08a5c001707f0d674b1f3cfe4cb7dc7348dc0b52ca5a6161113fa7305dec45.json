You may have also heard that <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2360280/ai-apple-intelligence-features-iphone-ipad-mac-hardware-requirements.html\">Apple Intelligence won’t run on just any Apple device</a>–for Macs, an M-series chip is required. If you’re still using an Intel MacBook and you want to use Apple Intelligence but can’t bring yourself to justify the investment into a new MacBook, you’re going to love this deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/321564/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-MacBook-Air-13-3-inch-Laptop-Space-Gray-M1-Chip-8GB-RAM-256GB-storage/609040889&amp;subid1=1-1-2388982-1-0-0\">Walmart is offering the 13-inch M1 MacBook Air for $649</a>, the lowest price we’ve ever seen. This model has an M1 chip with an 8-core CPU, a 7-core GPU, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD, and is available in gold, silver, or space gray. That’s $50 off the recent price cut to $699, but when this model was new, it sold for $999, so this is a $350 markdown. This sale is available only at Walmart.com and at select Walmart stores. Walmart+ subscribers have early access until 6 pm ET when it will open to everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, this Walmart sale is for an older machine (it was originally released in November 2020), but it’s the lowest price for a new M-series MacBook that we’ve ever seen. Apple’s Certified Refurbished Store offers the same model, but for $759, which is $110 more than the Walmart sale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re still using an Intel-based MacBook, your entry into the world of M-series Macs has now become more affordable, and you’ll be able to use the Apple Intelligence features when they are ready. This is also a great deal for back-to-school shoppers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234819/macbook-air-m1-review-an-absolutely-stunning-debut-for-apple-silicon-in-a-mac.html\">review of the 2020 M1 MacBook Air</a>, we said that “you’ll be astounded by the performance and battery life on display here,” especially if you’re upgrading from an Intel Mac. The one major drawback to this laptop is that it has a 720p FaceTime camera; Apple has since upgraded to a 1080p camera. Also, the M1 MacBook Air has the old “wedge” design that was replaced when Apple released the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/807892/m2-macbook-air-review.html\">M2 MacBook Air</a>–which some actually prefer. But design aside, you’re getting a fantastic Mac for a fantastically low price, so go grab one now.</p>\n\nMacBook</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"cb08a5c001707f0d674b1f3cfe4cb7dc7348dc0b52ca5a6161113fa7305dec45","category":"Apple"}
