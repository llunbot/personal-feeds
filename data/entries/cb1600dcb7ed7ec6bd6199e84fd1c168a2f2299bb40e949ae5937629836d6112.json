In 2020, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/10/nasa-makes-a-significant-investment-in-on-orbit-spacecraft-refueling/\">NASA announced agreements with four companies</a>—Lockheed Martin, United Launch Alliance, SpaceX, and a Florida-based startup named Eta Space—to prove capabilities in the area of refueling and propellant depots using cryogenic propellants.</p>\n<p>These cryogenic fluids—liquid hydrogen, methane, and liquid oxygen—must be kept at temperatures of several hundred degrees below zero, or they turn into a gas and boil off. Russian supply freighters regularly refuel the International Space Station with hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide, room-temperature rocket propellants that can be stored for years in orbit, but rockets using more efficient super-cold propellants have typically needed to complete their missions within hours.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1988814#p3\">Read 27 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1988814&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cb1600dcb7ed7ec6bd6199e84fd1c168a2f2299bb40e949ae5937629836d6112","category":"Tech"}
