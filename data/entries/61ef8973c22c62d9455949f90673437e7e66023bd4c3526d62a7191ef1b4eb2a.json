Macs don't often need to be turned off, and most people put them into a sleep mode rather than shutting them down on a regular basis.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe power button is located on the rear left of the ‌Mac mini‌ when looking at the front of the machine, below the three Thunderbolt ports.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPricing on the ‌Mac mini‌ starts at $599, and it can be pre-ordered today. It will launch on Friday, November 8.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini\">Mac Mini (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146\">Mac mini</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/29/m4-mac-mini-bottom-power-button/\">M4 Mac Mini's Power Button Has New Bottom Location</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m4-mac-minis-power-button-has-new-bottom-location.2441304/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"61ef8973c22c62d9455949f90673437e7e66023bd4c3526d62a7191ef1b4eb2a","category":"Apple"}
