John got to see a sample frame while visiting Matt and Cheech at <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/crust-bikes-stupid-tourist-break-away-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">Crust HQ in Australia</a> earlier this summer and it appears the cat is out of the bag.

As one might imagine, wind storms like this when there are no mountains, valleys, or dense tree lines to break them up can be quite harrowing when on a bike tour or ride.</p>\n<p>As such, the Derecho is adorned with talisman found throughout Anton’s bike rides, with nods to Nebraska and the American West. It is a lighter weight “mountain tourer,” built for doing the long and tall mountain rides Anton takes on. The chassis is a blend of the Bombora, Evasion, and Evasion Lite, with more vertical tire clearance to accommodate 29″ tires. It can be run with 26, 27.5, or 29″ wheels and clear up to a 2.3″ tire with a road (non-boost) drivetrain.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/Crust_Bikes_Derecho_04.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/Crust_Bikes_Derecho_04.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/Crust_Bikes_Derecho_04.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/Crust_Bikes_Derecho_04.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/Crust_Bikes_Derecho_02.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/Crust_Bikes_Derecho_02.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/Crust_Bikes_Derecho_02.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/Crust_Bikes_Derecho_02.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>It features segmented fork, inspired by the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/1991-team-fat-chance-yo-eddy/\" target=\"_blank\">Yo Eddy!</a>, a segmented seat stay, Reynolds 853 Tubeset with an OS Downtube for a bit more strength, while maintaining a lightweight and snappy responsiveness when unloaded. Anton wanted a bike that still rode well when it didn’t have bags strapped to it.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/Crust_Bikes_Derecho.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/Crust_Bikes_Derecho.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/Crust_Bikes_Derecho.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/Crust_Bikes_Derecho.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Crust is selling a 58cm sample of The Derecho, built with a desert dream-worthy parts kit.
