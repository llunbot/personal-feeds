Separately, the leaker known as <a href=\"https://x.com/Tech_Reve/status/1729824690951356893?s=20\">@Tech_Reve</a> today said they had heard similar reports from a Japanese supply chain source.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's too early to say if the latest reports are accurate, but according to a September <em>Wall Street Journal</em> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/21/apple-wsj-5gm-modem-project-challenges/\">report</a>, Apple's attempts to develop its own modem chip have been hampered by major issues related to unrealistic goals, an inadequate understanding of the challenges involved, and unusable prototypes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's plan to design its own in-house modem led to the hiring of thousands of engineers: Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/07/25/apple-intel-acquisition/\">acquired</a> the majority of Intel's smartphone modem business in 2019, and as it filled the project's ranks with Intel engineers and others hired from Qualcomm, company executives set a goal to have the modem chip ready for fall 2023.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEarlier this month, <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/16/apple-in-house-5g-modem-delays/\">reported</a> that Apple was continuing to run into troubles in its attempt to develop a 5G modem to replace Qualcomm's 5G modems in the iPhone and other products. The modem chip launch was said to have been postponed until the end of 2025 or early 2026, but Apple was reportedly still planning to introduce the technology in a version of the low-cost iPhone SE.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDevelopment on a modem chip was said to be in the early stages, and it \"may lag behind the competition by years.\" One version in development does not support faster mmWave technology, and Apple has also run into issues with the Intel code that it has been working with. Rewrites have been required, and adding new features has been causing existing features to break, plus Apple has to be careful not to infringe on Qualcomm patents while developing the chip.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDespite delays, the company was thought to be continuing development because it is eager to end its expensive deal with Qualcomm. In 2017, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/01/20/apple-qualcomm-1-billion-lawsuit/\">sued Qualcomm</a> over alleged anticompetitive practices and $1 billion in unpaid royalty rebates. The two companies <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/04/16/apple-qualcomm-settlement/\">settled the lawsuit in 2019</a>. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's first modem chip was expected to be a standalone chip, but the company hoped to eventually develop a system-on-a-chip that would also cut out suppliers like Broadcom and give it more control over component development.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-5g-modem/\">Apple 5G Modem</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/29/apple-5g-modem-discontinued-reports/\">Apple to Discontinue Custom 5G Modem Development, Claim Reports</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-discontinue-custom-5g-modem-development-claim-reports.2412350/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"43d3c0fd94b0ee46b5f4869158755d7d772bd90f58ff775c58bb3dab7b13aba4","category":"Apple"}
