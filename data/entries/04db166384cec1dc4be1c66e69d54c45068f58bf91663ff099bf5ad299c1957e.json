{"title":"Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in 2016, on Donald Trump as President: ‘This Is Not Going to End Well One Way or the Other’","link":"https://youtu.be/0J08atDFR2c?t=476","date":1741716379000,"content":"\n<p>A clip from this 2016 interview with Marco Rubio — then a candidate for the Republican presidential primary, today Trump’s secretary of state — by CNN’s Jake Tapper is making the <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@keithedwards/post/DHBlR9sh7q4\">rounds</a> on <a href=\"https://x.com/jason_kint/status/1898914327882551312\">social</a> media. It’s extraordinary. I’m linking here <a href=\"https://youtu.be/0J08atDFR2c?t=476\">to the full video</a>, hosted on Rubio’s own YouTube account (for now — watch for this to go down the memory hole) starting at the 7:54 mark:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Tapper:</strong> You compared Donald Trump to a third world dictator\nyesterday in an interview with The New York Times. How so?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rubio:</strong> Well, I don’t know about a dictator. I said a third\nworld strong man. You know, he’s running for president. So no\nmatter what, he won’t be a dictator unless our republic completely\ncrumbles, which I don’t anticipate it will. But, yeah, here’s what\nhappens in many countries around the world: You have a leader that\nemerges and basically says, <em>Don’t put your faith in yourselves.\nDon’t put your faith in society. Put your faith in me. I’m a\nstrong leader, and I’m going to make things better — all by\nmyself.</em> This is very typical. You see it in the third world. You\nsee it a lot in Latin America for decades. It’s basically the\nargument he’s making. That he, single-handedly, is going to turn\nthe country around. We’ve never been that kind of country.</p>\n\n<p>We have a president. The president is an American citizen who\nserves for a period of time, constrained by the constitution and\nthe powers vested in that office. The president works for the\npeople, not the people for the president. And if you listen to the\nway he describes himself and what he’s going to do, he’s going to\nsingle-handedly do this and do that without regard for whether\nit’s legal or not.</p>\n\n<p>Look, I think people are going to have to make up their mind. I\ncan tell you this. No matter what happens in this election, for\nyears to come, there are many people on the right, in the media,\nand voters at large that are going to be having to explain and\njustify how they fell into this trap of supporting Donald Trump,\nbecause this is not going to end well one way or the other. He’s\ngoing to be the nominee, and he’s going to lose. Or, he’ll have\nthrown this party into its most chaotic and divisive period ever.\nAnd that’s unfortunate because the Republican Party is the home of\nthe limited government free enterprise movement in America. And if\nit crumbles or divides or it splits apart, it’ll be very difficult\nto elect candidates that hold those views at any level of\ngovernment until we can bring the party back together.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Breathtakingly prescient and succinct.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/11/rubio-tapper-2016\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"04db166384cec1dc4be1c66e69d54c45068f58bf91663ff099bf5ad299c1957e","category":"Tech"}
