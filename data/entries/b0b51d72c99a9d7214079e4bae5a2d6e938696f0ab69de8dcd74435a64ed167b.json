{"title":"WSJ: ‘U.S. Threatens Ban if TikTok’s Chinese Owners Don’t Sell Stakes’","link":"https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-threatens-to-ban-tiktok-if-chinese-founder-doesnt-sell-ownership-stake-36d7295c?mod=djemalertNEWS","date":1678925626000,"content":"\n<p>John D. McKinnon, reporting for The Wall Street Journal (<a href=\"https://apple.news/AnIhrEWqiS5GyBrorl09rpA\">News+ link</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Biden administration is demanding that TikTok’s Chinese owners\nsell their stakes in the video-sharing app or face a possible U.S.\nban of the app, according to people familiar with the matter.</p>\n\n<p>The move represents a major shift in policy on the part of the\nadministration, which has been under fire from some Republicans\nwho say it hasn’t taken a tough enough stance to address the\nperceived security threat from TikTok, owned by Beijing-based\nByteDance Ltd.</p>\n\n<p>The Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or Cfius — a\nmultiagency federal task force that oversees national security\nrisks in cross-border investments — made the sale demand\nrecently, the people said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Trump was against TikTok too, but didn’t get this done. (And he tried, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-ellison-mcmillon-tiktok-deal-call-us-treasury-payment-2020-9\">corruptly</a>, to work a deal to hand TikTok over to Larry Ellison.) Banning TikTok or forcing the CCP to sell it makes sense both on national security grounds <em>and</em> as tit-for-tat trade policy. China effectively imposes an infinite tariff on U.S. social networks — none of them are available there. The U.S., to date, has imposed a 0 percent tariff on TikTok.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/15/tiktok-ban-if-not-sold\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b0b51d72c99a9d7214079e4bae5a2d6e938696f0ab69de8dcd74435a64ed167b","category":"Tech"}
