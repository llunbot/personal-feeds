Today, the game's developers at Guerrilla confirmed a major reason for that silence: The game isn't actually ready for its teased \"2021\" release window.</p>\n<p>The news of the game's delay—and a (possible) release date of February 18, 2022—came from its director, Mathijs de Jonge, as part of Wednesday's Gamescom 2021 Opening Night presentation. While de Jonge claimed that the sequel had reached a \"major milestone\" shortly after its May gameplay reveal, he then offered familiar-sounding caveats about the challenges of video game development during a pandemic—and didn't clarify whether the upcoming game was yet feature-complete.</p>\n<p>The Wednesday news came without new gameplay footage or any clarification of how <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>, launching on both the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 next year, will scale between two generations of consoles. Instead, de Jonge took the opportunity to announce that a patch is now live on the PS5 to bring the franchise's first PS4 game, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/02/horizon-zero-dawn-is-the-best-robot-safari-adventure-game-ever-made/\"><em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em></a>, up to a 60 fps refresh rate.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1789789#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1789789&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ed928b65b50f009ab864c036119af0d793b834cf105f9fdcdab7f6fae17c8fcb","category":"Tech"}
