This approach works differently than exhaustion DDoSes, which over-exert the computing resources of a server. Hypervolumetric attacks are volumetric DDoses that deliver staggering amounts of data, typically measured in the terabits per second.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/03/massive-botnet-that-appeared-overnight-is-delivering-record-size-ddoses/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/03/massive-botnet-that-appeared-overnight-is-delivering-record-size-ddoses/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fd45698d5f12fab589634ac2daf4be339df1fedfe8db4049f4517ea91b6d5240","category":"Tech"}
