The entry-level Lucid Air Pure, which starts at $69,900, can now travel 420 miles on a single charge of its 84 kWh battery. That equates to 5 miles/kWh (12.4 kWh/100 km), making the Air Pure the most efficient electric vehicle on sale today.</p>\n<p>The range bump is mostly thanks to Lucid making a heat pump standard across the range, after first adding one to the ultra-powerful, ultra-expensive Air Sapphire.</p>\n<p>Lucid has also upgraded the computer hardware that oversees the Air's various subsystems. The automaker says it has tripled processing power and doubled the system's memory, which should translate to faster and better infotainment. And Lucid has made its advanced driver assistance system standard across the lineup, too.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037267#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037267&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
