Most prominently, one user's notification summary from the BBC suggested that Luigi Mangione, the alleged killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, had died of suicide; this was not true. <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/geoffreyfowler.bsky.social/post/3lfsep7n4322l\">Other examples</a> have been cropping up since then.</p>\n<p>For the notification summaries that remain, Apple is instituting changes to make it clearer when users are reading summaries and to make it easier to turn those summaries off. Notification summaries in iOS 18.3 will be italicized to help further distinguish them from individual non-summarized notificationsâ€”before, there was a small icon next to the text to indicate you were looking at a summary. Apple is also making it possible to turn off summaries on a per-app basis directly from the lock screen without diving into the Settings app to do it.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/01/ios-18-3-beta-disables-news-notification-summaries-after-high-stakes-errors/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/apple/2025/01/ios-18-3-beta-disables-news-notification-summaries-after-high-stakes-errors/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"39f6f2b846bd252ed8c29976cb23829d6bda77becfb35d551a93f2339dc644a2","category":"Tech"}
