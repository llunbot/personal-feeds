{"title":"USB-IF Reveals New Branding in an Attempt to Clear Up USB-C Cable Confusion","link":"https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/30/usb-c-branding-cable-confusion/","date":1633051492000,"content":"\n<p>Chance Miller, writing for 9to5Mac:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As we’ve <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2018/08/22/how-to-choose-a-usb-c-cable/\">detailed in the past</a>, it can be quite confusing when\ntrying to find the correct USB-C cable for your devices. Even\nthough the connectors all look the same, USB-C cables all meet\ndifferent standards for power delivery speeds, data transfer, and\nmore. Here are the highlights of the USB-IF’s announcements today:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>USB-IF establishes new Certified USB Type-C Cable Logos to\ndisplay cable power capabilities in watts, clearly indicating\nsupport for 60W or 240W as defined by the USB Power Delivery 3.1\nSpecification.</p></li>\n<li><p>Certified USB4 Logos updated in parallel to unify branding\nacross the Certified USB Logo Program.</p></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/glennf/status/1443595778795008005\">These beautiful, totally professionally-designed new logos</a> will clear it all up, I’m sure. Perhaps with a little regulatory help from the product design savants on the European Commission.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/30/usb-c-the-c-is-for-confusion\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"85f7b0303efafe9595a2c279c558a71913e3a0944ceef25fcb95a30dab44fa6f","category":"Tech"}
