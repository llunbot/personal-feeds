Now, original <em>Fallout</em> producer Timothy Cain <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwoWRj0cfag\">is sharing some behind-the-scenes details</a> about how he contributed to the project's cancellation during a particularly difficult time for publisher Interplay.</p>\n<p>Cain famously <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGfaCXEu0tE&amp;t=0s\">left Interplay during <em>Fallout 2</em>'s development</a> in the late '90s to help form <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2005/02/games-20050219/\">short-lived</a> RPG house <a href=\"https://archive.arstechnica.com/reviews/01q3/arcanum/arcanum.html\">Troika Games</a>. After his departure, though, he was still in touch with some people from his former employer, including an unnamed Interplay vice president looking for some outside opinions on the troubled Van Buren project.</p>\n<p>\"Would you mind coming over and playing one of my game prototypes?\" Cain recalls this vice president asking him sometime in mid-2003. \"We're making a <em>Fallout</em> game and I'm going to have to cancel it. I don't think they can get it done... but if you could come over and look at it and give me an estimate, there's a chance I wouldn't cancel it.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032559#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2032559&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"00b6d51866d5ce743d4905aee5ef23333af5074c3470b4c894ed02e40085d2c2","category":"Tech"}
