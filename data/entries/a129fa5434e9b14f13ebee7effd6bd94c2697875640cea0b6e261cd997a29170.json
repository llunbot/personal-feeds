That includes if your account gets locked for legit security reasons, like too many failed login attempts. Apple has architected its system such that it <em>cannot</em> simply reset your password for you. There’s an <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204921&amp;xcust=1-1-353830-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">account recovery process</a>, and a system for using trusted phone numbers to reset your account, but your options are severely limited if you have <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/233818/two-factor-authentication-sms-email-authenticator-app-hardware-key-accounts.html\">two-factor authentication enabled</a> (which you absolutely should).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/3585186/apple-id-adds-recovery-key-option-but-it-s-not-yet-ready-for-you-to-use.html\">Recovery Key</a> is one way to get around this problem, but it severely limits you in other ways—you can’t reset your password unless you have the trusted device <em>and</em> the recovery key. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With iOS 15 and macOS Monterey, Apple is providing a simpler solution to the “what if I get locked out” problem: Recovery Contacts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is a Recovery Contact?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A Recovery Contact is a trusted person that you designate to get a one-time recovery code if you’re locked out of your account. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That person will need to talk to you on the phone (or in-person) to tell you the code, which you’ll then enter on your device to get regain access. You’ll then be asked to reset your password.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Naturally, your Recovery Contacts (you can have several) should be people you know well and trust, like close family members. It should also be someone you can easily get a hold of if you’re locked out of your account. They’ll also need to have at least one modern Apple device on which to get the code, and they have to be at least 13 years old.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to set up Recovery Contacts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Setting up a Recovery Contact is straightforward. The hardest part is making sure <em>all</em> your Apple devices are up to date. You need to be running iOS 15, iPad OS 15, or macOS Monterey on all your iPhones, iPads, or Macs. If you have iCloud software on a Windows PC, that needs to be up to date, too. If you have any old devices attached to your account that are running old software and can’t be updated (they’re lost or destroyed or whatever), you can open <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>Apple ID</em> (the big tile at the top with your name and image) to remove them from your list of authorized devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/ios15-recovery-contact-steps.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" /></figure><p>IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you’re up to date, add a Recovery Contact by following these steps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On your iPhone or iPad:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Open <em>Settings</em></li><li>Tap on your <em>Apple ID</em> (the large tile with your name at the top)</li><li>Open <em>Password &amp; Security</em></li><li>Open <em>Account Recovery</em></li><li>Tap <em>Add Recovery Contact</em> and follow the prompts</li></ul><div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/macos-recovery-contact.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" /></figure><p>IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>On your Mac:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Open <em>System Preferences</em></li><li>Click <em>Apple ID</em></li><li>Select <em>Password &amp; Security</em> in the sidebar</li><li>In the <em>Account Recovery</em> section, select <em>Manage</em></li><li>In the <em>Recovery Assistance</em> section, click the [+] button and follow the prompts</li></ul><p>The contact you designate will <em>not</em> have access to your iCloud account <em>at any time</em>. When you are locked out of your own devices and begin the password recovery procedure, you can choose one of your designated Recovery Contacts to get a short code that they will have to tell you, and you’ll enter it into your own device to prove you own it, after which you’ll be prompted to change the password. </p>\n</div>","author":"Jason Cross","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"a129fa5434e9b14f13ebee7effd6bd94c2697875640cea0b6e261cd997a29170","category":"Apple"}
