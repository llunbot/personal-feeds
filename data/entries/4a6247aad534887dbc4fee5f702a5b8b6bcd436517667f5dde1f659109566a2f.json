The \"Create with AI\" theme option is available under the Customize Chrome side panel.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen writing something on the web, such as on a forum, Chrome will be able to help users generate content. The feature will let users right-click in any text box or field to access a \"Help me write\" option.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Tab Organizer and theme creator will be coming to U.S. Chrome users over the next few days, while the writing assistant will be available in next month's Chrome update. The experimental features can be enabled in the Settings section of Chrome by clicking on the three-dot menu and navigating to the Experimental AI page.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/\">Google</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chrome/\">Chrome</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/23/chrome-mac-generative-ai/\">Google Chrome for Mac Gets Generative AI Features</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-chrome-for-mac-gets-generative-ai-features.2417210/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4a6247aad534887dbc4fee5f702a5b8b6bcd436517667f5dde1f659109566a2f","category":"Apple"}
