Joseph Tartaro got a license plate with the\nword “NULL” on it nearly 10 years ago. The 36-year-old security\nauditor thought it would be funny to drive around with the symbol\nfor an empty value. Maybe a police officer who tried to give him a\nticket would end up writing null into the system and not be able\nto process it, he joked to himself.</p>\n\n<p>In 2018 he paid a $35 parking ticket. Soon afterward, he said, his\nmailbox was flooded with hundreds of traffic tickets for incidents\nhe hadn’t been involved in. Tickets were from other counties and\ncities for vehicles of different colors, makes and models. A\ndatabase had associated the word “null” with his personal\ninformation and citations were sent to Tartaro, who lives in Los\nAngeles.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Brings to mind the classic “<a href=\"https://xkcd.com/327/\">Little Bobby Tables</a>” from XKCD.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/04/null\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"42fc6195cea699665ad82d3ec97acb6547f343d038be4079218a25900a6c49b7","category":"Tech"}
