Rows reinvented spreadsheets to let you build data-rich spreadsheets that look beautiful and modern. Rows uses the same logic as traditional spreadsheets like Google Sheets and Excel. It has row-and-column-based cells and all the functions you’re used to, like <code>SUM</code>, <code>VLOOKUP</code>, and <code>INDEX</code>.</p>\n\n<p>On top of that, Rows added powerful integrations with business tools and public databases. Your spreadsheet can talk to Google Analytics, Twitter, Stripe, and Salesforce; it can send emails and Slack alerts, and even connect to your custom APIs. And you can fetch public data from databases like Crunchbase, Hunter, and LinkedIn.</p>\n\n<p>Rows offers Live Sharing — a revolutionary new feature for spreadsheets. Users with live access can’t make changes like editors can. They only see the data you want them to see, and can only edit cells you mark as editable. No one can mess up your spreadsheets. Turn them into interactive dashboards, reports, and forms with buttons, input fields, and checkboxes.</p>\n\n<p>Join thousands of teams that have stepped up their spreadsheet game with Rows.
