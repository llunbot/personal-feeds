{"title":"★ iOS 17.3, Now in Beta, Includes New ‘Stolen Device Protection’ Feature","link":"https://daringfireball.net/2023/12/ios_17-3_stolen_device_protection","date":1702435505000,"content":"\n<p>Joanna Stern and Nicole Nguyen, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/apple-iphone-ios-update-stolen-device-protection-698d760e?mod=hp_lead_pos1\">reporting for The Wall Street Journal</a> (<a href=\"https://apple.news/AruixbQhXQJOXck5uZRdbyw\">News+ link</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If you enable the new Stolen Device Protection, your iPhone will \nrestrict certain settings when you are away from a location \nfamiliar to the iPhone, such as your home or work. Here’s the \nrundown: </p>\n\n<p>Apple ID password change: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><em>If you do nothing</em>: A thief can use the passcode to change \nyour Apple account password and lock you out. This move is the \nkey to thieves turning off Find My and wiping phones for resale. \nSince you, the iPhone’s owner, don’t have the changed Apple ID \npassword, you can’t immediately locate your iPhone or remotely \nwipe its data. </p></li>\n<li><p><em>With Stolen Device Protection</em>: If you want to change an Apple \nID password when away from a familiar location, the device will \nrequire your Face ID or Touch ID. It will then implement an \nhour-long delay before you can perform the action. After that hour \nhas passed, you will have to reconfirm with another Face ID or \nTouch ID scan. Only then can the password be changed. </p></li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This sounds like a very thoughtful solution to a devilishly tricky problem: a combination of biometrics, a time delay, with exceptions for when you’re in a known location like work or home.</p>\n\n<p>Stern and Nguyen reported a series of stories this year detailing how thieves — in some cases, organized crime rings — were taking advantage of the god-like powers of your device passcode, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-iphone-security-theft-passcode-data-privacya-basic-iphone-feature-helps-criminals-steal-your-digital-life-cbf14b1a?mod=article_inline\">the first in February</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-iphone-setting-thieves-use-to-lock-you-out-of-your-apple-account-716d350d?mod=article_inline\">the follow-up in April</a>. The gist of it is that your device passcode/passphrase controls the keys to your entire digital kingdom. With the phone <em>and</em> your passcode, you can reset your iCloud account password <em>and</em> access the passwords saved in your keychain. Thieves were scamming people to glean their passcodes, then stealing their phones. This granted thieves access not just to the phones’ contents, but to the victims’ banking accounts. And resetting the victims’ iCloud passwords prevented the victims from remotely wiping, locking, or finding the stolen devices. (One way the scam would run: Chat up the victim in a bar, and offer to use the target’s phone to snap a photo of the victim and their friends. Surreptitiously <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2022/06/require_a_passcode_to_unlock_your_iphone\">lock the phone out of Face ID</a> when handing it back to the victim. Then, when next the victim wants to do anything on their phone, they need to enter their passcode. Either the thief or a partner in a team gleans the passcode. Then they steal the phone, knowing the device passcode.)</p>\n\n<p>After Stern and Nguyen broke this story, a lot of people reasonably wondered why Apple allows you to reset your iCloud account password using only your device passcode. The reason is customer support: every single day, hundreds — maybe thousands? — of people are locked out of their iCloud account because they can’t remember the password. Android phones work the same way: you can reset your Google account password knowing only your device passcode. However many people are falling victim to thieves taking advantage of this, there are orders of magnitude more innocent users who <em>do</em> know their phone passcode, but have forgotten their iCloud/Google account password.</p>\n\n<p>Stolen Device Protection sounds like it solves the problem very well. No existing workaround is a true defense against a thief who knows your device passcode. (Locking your iPhone with Screen Time protections was suggested by many as a mitigation, but you can completely override Screen Time protections with the device passcode — it just adds a few extra steps.)</p>\n\n<p>Stolen Device Protection will be off by default, but Apple claims that users will be prompted about the feature after upgrading to 17.3. That’s a reasonable compromise. My only doubts about the feature are the “home” and “work” safe locations, where the protection is overridden. How are these locations determined? Why can’t one choose <em>not</em> to carve out any location-based exceptions? I can imagine scenarios like an untrustworthy work colleague or roommate (or, say, a fellow student in a dormitory), or embittered ex, who’d have the opportunity to observe your passcode being entered and have access to your work/home location.</p>\n\n<p>But overall, this new feature clearly seems like a win for security — and a triumph of Joanna Stern and Nicole Nguyen’s investigative reporting.</p>\n\n\n\n    ","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f9173e05b0bc8a755980a9f99faf3ba54bc8a13a2df304b2f4aa043a856b3aa6","category":"Tech"}
