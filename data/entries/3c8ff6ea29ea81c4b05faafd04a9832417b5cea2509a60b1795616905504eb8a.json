The city is famous for its cathedral, which, as the final destination of the world-renowned Way of St James, is the region’s most famous sight. Pilgrims come from all over the world to embark on this journey to where Spain’s patron, Saint James the Great, is said to have been buried, and over the years, its appeal has expanded beyond Christians to travellers of many different motives.  </span></p>\n<p><span>The closer you get to Compostela, the more stopping points you encounter, of which the small town of Padrón is one. It lies just 25 kilometres south of the city and, as such, is the last stop on the Portuguese Way pilgrimage route. In its own right, it’s also famous for the peppers grown here, which are characterised by being small and green and are popular all across Spain. Although often relatively mild, the ones grown during this time of year tend to be spicier than </span><span>normal</span><span>, with the hot weather resulting in more of the Capsaicin chemical that gives peppers their kick. </span></p>\n<p><span>While Padrón might mark the nearing </span><span>of the</span><span> end for those Christian pilgrims, the riders taking part in this year’s </span><a href=\"https://www.rouleur.cc/pages/vuelta-a-espana\" target=\"_blank\"><span>Vuelta a España</span></a><span> still have a long way to go upon arriving at the town and will only </span><span>just</span><span> cross the halfway point of the race today. It won’t feel as though they’re making much progress today, either, as after setting off from Padrón, they will undertake a circuitous route that will take on three loops to the north before arriving back into Padrón for the stage finish. On the first of those loops, they will take on Puerto San Xusto, at 10km, the longest climb of the day, but relatively shallow at only 4.2%. Then they will complete two shorter laps featuring a double ascent of Puerto Aguasantas (5.7km at 6.1%) before heading eastward to climb the day’s final climb, the Puerto Cruxeiras (2.9km at 8.9%), which they will crest just 8km before descending back to the finish at Padrón.</span></p>\n<p><span>None of these climbs are </span><span>especially hard</span><span>, with all </span><span>being designated</span><span> either category two or three status and none standing higher than 500 metres – but together, they will be enough to prevent any chance of a sprint victory and make this another day for the puncheurs. In particular, the proximity of Puerto Cruxeiras to the finish makes it especially important — both its uphill and subsequent 6km downhill, after which the riders have only a couple of kilometres of flat until arriving at the finish line. </span><span>Expect some of the same riders </span><span>who</span><span> featured in the break on stage 10 to </span><span>again</span><span> try</span><span> and escape up the road</span><span> in similar parcours that should suit them and see the breakaway succeed.</span><span> </span></p>\n<div><img alt=\"Vuelta a España 2024 stage 11 preview\" src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/vuelta_stage_11_22b79e67-d6b2-4102-a898-49f8c4f9e496.jpg?v=1723556076\" /></div>\n<p><span><i>Stage profile sourced via Vuelta website </i></span></p>\n<h3><strong>Contenders</strong></h3>\n<p><span>Stage 10 provided an action-packed start to the stage, with many riders wanting to get into the break, and we expect stage 11 to be no different, with another opportunity on the cards for the escapees of the bunch. </span></p>\n<p><span>From the flag,</span><strong><span> Marc Soler </span></strong><span>(UAE Team Emirates) was one of those riders attacking to go clear up the road, alongside </span><strong><span>Wout van Aert</span></strong><span> (Visma-Lease a Bike), </span><strong><span>William Junior Lecerf</span></strong><span> (Soudal–Quick-Step), </span><strong><span>Quentin Pacher</span></strong><span> (Groupama-FDJ), and </span><strong><span>Juri Hollman</span></strong><span> (Alpecin-Deceuninck). All the riders were keeping the pace extremely high to keep themselves in contention for a stage win, but only Van Aert and Pacher maintain it, with Van Aert winning the stage. After missing out on the stage, we expect many of the riders who were in action yesterday to try their luck again. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Brandon McNulty</span></strong><span> (UAE Team Emirates) could be another rider making some early attacks, as could his teammate </span><strong><span>Pavel Sivakov</span></strong><span>. Both ar</span><span>e in good form</span><span> and could take the stage win over this lumpy terrain. </span><strong><span>Mathias Vacek </span></strong><span>(Lidl-Trek) could try to get into the break, or<strong> Mattias Skjelmose</strong></span><span>, another strong climber for Lidl-Trek. <strong>Jesús Herrada</strong> could be a card to play for Cofidis, who are yet to take anything from this race. </span></p>\n<p><span>Looking to add a stage win to their team's Vuelta is also the Ineos Grenadiers, who missed out on the opening ITT victory with Josh Tarling – who is now out of the race. </span><strong><span>Jhonatan Narváez</span></strong><span> will be the British team's best shout or even </span><strong><span>Óscar Rodríguez</span></strong><span>. Movistar is another team looking to light up their race – Enric Mas, sitting fourth on the general classification, did</span><span> d</span><span>o this by attacking on stage nine, but the Spanish crowds will want a stage win from their home team. </span><strong><span>Einer Rubio</span></strong><span> showed some encouraging signs on stage 10 and could try to get into the breakaway again, but the team also has </span><strong><span>Oier Lazkano</span></strong><span>, who may be stronger over this type of parcours. </span></p>\n<p><span>Israel-Premier Tech have a few riders who could be contenders for this stage, including</span><span> Vuelta debutant </span><strong><span>Riley Sheehan</span></strong><span>, </span><strong><span>Dylan Teuns</span></strong><span>, and </span><strong><span>Michael Woods</span></strong><span>. However, Woods </span><span>was seen</span><span> being dropped on stage 10 after the fast pace being set by those at the front. </span></p>\n<p><span>Astana Qazaqstan's </span><strong><span>Harold Tejada </span></strong><span>could be another contender for the stage victory, as could </span><strong><span>Alessandro De Marchi</span></strong><span> (Jayco-Alula), <strong>Mathis Le Berre</strong> (Arkea-B&amp;B Hotels), and <strong>Lorenzo Rota</strong> (Intermarché-Wanty). </span></p>\n<h3><strong>Stage 11 winner prediction</strong></h3>\n<p>We think that today is another day for Wout van Aert to get in the breakaway and secure his fourth stage win of the race.</p>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Rouleur Media","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"3c8ff6ea29ea81c4b05faafd04a9832417b5cea2509a60b1795616905504eb8a","category":"Cycling"}
