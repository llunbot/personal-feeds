These included sleep data and daily activity monitoring, where exercise is presented as a percentage to help inform you of when you should rest.</p>\n<p>The watch is a good choice for more casual cyclists who don’t want to pay the price of a halo product or someone who’s looking for greater insight into fitness, body stress and sleep.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/gadgets/smartwatches/polar-ignite-gps-fitness-smartwatch-review/\">Read our full Polar Ignite GPS fitness smartwatch review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Polar Vantage V2</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Polar Ignite V2 can perform an FTP test so you can calculate your training zones.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£449 / $500 / AU$699 / €500 as tested</li>\n<li>Range of cycling tests</li>\n<li>Route visuals are limited</li>\n</ul><p>The Polar Vantage V2 is a multisport smartwatch with metrics for many different activities, but it has an array of cycling-specific functions and tests including <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/what-is-ftp-and-why-it-matters-for-cyclists/\">Functional Threshold Power (FTP)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/vo2-max/\">VO2 max</a>.</p>\n<p>The watch also has a function called Fuel Wise that tells you when to eat and drink.

These modes will present different data fields relevant to your selected sport.</p>\n<p>Many have specific cycling modes, with multiple profiles suited to road or mountain bike riding. Others will go as far as to provide <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/the-5-key-areas-of-training-for-road-cyclists/\">training</a> workouts and cycling performance tests to establish <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/training-zones/\">training zones</a>.</p>\n<p>While some provide lots of cycling-specific functions other will be weighted more towards running for example, so it’s worth thinking about what you want from the watch and whether it has the right functionality for you.</p>\n<h3>Connectivity</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Wahoo says its Elemnt Bolt computer works seamlessly with the Elemnt Rival smartwatch.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Wahoo Fitness</i></span></div>\n<p>If you use a heart rate strap, speed and cadence sensor, or power meter, you’re going to want a watch that will connect to them.</p>\n<p>For the most part, it seems Bluetooth is the protocol of choice for brands these days, though some high-end watches will also include ANT+ connectivity.</p>\n<p>If you connect your smartwatch to a power meter it can display data such as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/power-to-weight-ratio/\" target=\"_blank\">power-to-weight ratio</a>, one of the most important statistics for climbing.</p>\n<p>However, the ubiquity of Bluetooth in GPS watches can create some difficulty if you ride with a power meter because units from SRM and Quarq only broadcast an ANT+ signal. Most other power meters will broadcast over Bluetooth, though.</p>\n<p>Bluetooth connectivity also allows the watch to connect to a phone. Precisely what functionality this opens up varies from watch to watch, but most allow rides to be synced wirelessly, activities modes to be created and edited, and apps, watch faces and metrics to be downloaded if connected to your phone.</p>\n<p>The Bluetooth connection also allows the watch to display notifications from your phone. There’s some inconsistency as to what application notifications each watch shows, but they can all be limited to just calls and texts during an activity or turned off completely.</p>\n<p>Other smartwatches will work in tandem with a cycling computer or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-smart-trainer/\" target=\"_blank\">smart trainer</a>. Connecting to a cycling computer is particularly useful for triathletes transitioning from the swim leg to the cycle leg and then onto the run.</p>\n<p>Many of these watches also feature the ability to connect to your home WiFi network, so can sync your rides without a smartphone connection.</p>\n<h3>GPS watch for cycling</h3>\n<p>When looking for a smartwatch for cycling, it’s best to find one that has its own GPS chip because this will mean it can record rides without relying on a phone, as some lower-priced smartwatches do.</p>\n<p>Higher-end GPS watches offer some breadcrumb style routing, providing less detail than GPS cycling computers, although this is still enough to navigate simple terrain.</p>\n<p>Routes must be preloaded into the device, but some GPS smartwatches will integrate with apps such as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/guide-to-using-komoot/\">Komoot</a> to provide navigation, and the watch will buzz as you approach junctions.</p>\n<h3>Wrist-based heart rate monitor</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Smartwatches have heart rate monitors on the back of the watch case.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Many smartwatches come with wrist-based <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/how-to-choose-a-heart-rate-monitor/\">heart rate monitors</a> to provide insight into how hard you’re working when training, as well as other fitness metrics, such as sleep quality and recovery.</p>\n<p>Wrist-based heart rate monitors don’t tend to be as accurate as chest strap monitors because they use optical sensors that have to maintain contact with the skin for an accurate reading.</p>\n<p>Having said that, many do perform well and provide good insight into heart rate and, in particular, averages rather than peaks.</p>\n<h3>Accelerometers and altimeters</h3>\n<p>Some smartwatches come with built-in accelerometers and gyroscopes, which can be helpful when GPS is turned off or there is satellite dropout. They’re also useful for swimming and rep counting in gyms.</p>\n<p>A smartwatch might also have a barometric altimeter. GPS altitude data isn’t hugely accurate, so if you want precise altitude readings, this is the way to go.</p>\n<h3>Fitness tracking and other metrics</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A smartwatch can tell you if you are overtraining.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Colin Levitch / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>One of the main appeals of smartwatches over bike computers or phones is that they double as fitness trackers to provide insight into your health.</p>\n<p>Many will provide a breakdown of the quality of your sleep and others will give feedback on training intensity and tell you whether you’ve <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/overtraining-syndrome/\">overtrained</a>, as well as suggest workouts based on what exercise you have recently done.</p>\n<p>Some will also provide information on blood oxygen levels and tell you when you have acclimatised to the altitude.</p>\n<p>Alongside niche metrics, many smartwatches also record more basic stats such as step count and calories burned.</p>\n<p>It is worth noting that some of this insight is worth taking with a pinch of salt, but can act as a good guide to what your body is doing.</p>\n<h3>Apps</h3>\n<p>It’s becoming more common for smartwatches to support third-party apps, such as Komoot and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/brand/strava/\">Strava</a>, which help with route selection and navigation as well as direct uploads to ride-sharing platforms and can unlock features like Strava’s live segments.</p>\n<p>Some smartwatches also support Spotify for music streaming.</p>\n<h3>Screen size and straps</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Huawei Watch GT 2 Sport has a large 46mm screen.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Because they have to fit on your wrist, smartwatches have smaller screens than most modern bike computers. This doesn’t stop them from being big enough to display basic routing as well as multiple data fields, though.</p>\n<p>There can be lots of variety in screen size. For instance, the Garmin Forerunner 945’s screen measures 30.4mm while the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/gadgets/smartwatches/huawei-gt-2-sports-smartwatch-review/\">Huawei Watch GT 2 Sport</a> has a 46mm screen. So it’s a good idea to think about what screen size will fit on your wrist and be comfortable for you to wear.</p>\n<p>Another consideration for comfort is strap type.
