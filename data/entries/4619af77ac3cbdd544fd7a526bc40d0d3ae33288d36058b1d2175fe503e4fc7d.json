Computer buyers have more viable options than they have in many years, and in many ways the company’s Meteor Lake architecture was <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/intels-meteor-lake-cpus-bring-a-much-faster-gpu-radically-new-chip-design/\">more interesting as a technical achievement</a> than it was <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/12/intel-intros-first-meteor-lake-chips-with-faster-gpus-and-worse-single-core-speed/\">as an upgrade</a> for previous-generation Raptor Lake processors.</p>\n<p>But even given all of that, Intel still provides the vast majority of PC CPUs—nearly four-fifths of all computer CPUs sold are Intel’s, according to <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7173194948257808385/\">recent analyst estimates from Canalys</a>. The company still casts a long shadow, and what it does still helps set the pace for the rest of the industry.</p>\n\n<p>Enter its next-generation CPU architecture, codenamed Lunar Lake. We’ve known about Lunar Lake for a while—Intel reminded everyone it was coming when Qualcomm upstaged it during Microsoft’s Copilot+ PC reveal—but this month at Computex the company is going into more detail ahead of availability sometime in Q3 of 2024.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028454#p3\">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028454&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4619af77ac3cbdd544fd7a526bc40d0d3ae33288d36058b1d2175fe503e4fc7d","category":"Tech"}
