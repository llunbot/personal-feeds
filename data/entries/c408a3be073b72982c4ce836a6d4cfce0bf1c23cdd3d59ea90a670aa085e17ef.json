{"title":"A 32-bit processor made with an atomically thin semiconductor","link":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/researchers-build-a-risc-v-processor-using-a-2d-semiconductor/","date":1743612393000,"content":"<p>On Wednesday, a team of researchers from China used a paper published in Nature to describe a 32-bit RISC-V processor built using molybdenum disulfide instead of silicon as the semiconductor. For those not up on their chemistry, molybdenum disulfide is a bit like graphene: a single molecule of MoS<sub>2</sub> is a sheet that is only a bit over a single atom thick, due to the angles between its chemical bonds. But unlike graphene, molybdenum disulfide is a semiconductor.</p>\n<p>The material has been used in a variety of demonstration electronics, including <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2013/03/flash-memory-chip-built-out-of-single-atom-thick-components/\">flash storage</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/11/researchers-build-a-working-camera-out-of-atomically-thin-semiconductors/\">image sensors</a>. But we've recently figured out how to generate wafer-scale sheets of MoS<sub>2</sub> on a sapphire substrate, and the team took advantage of that to build the processor, which they call RV32-WUJI. It can only add single bits at a time and is limited to kilohertz clock speeds, but it is capable of executing the full RISC-V 32-bit instruction set thanks to nearly 6,000 individual transistors.</p>\n<h2>Going flat</h2>\n<p>We've identified a wide range of what are termed 2D materials. These all form repeated chemical bonds in more or less a single plane. In the case of graphene, which consists only of carbon, the bonds are all in the same plane, meaning the molecule is as thick as a carbon atom. Molybdenum disulfide is slightly different, as the angle of the chemical bonds is out of plane, resulting in a zig-zag pattern. This means the sheet is slightly thicker than its component atoms.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/researchers-build-a-risc-v-processor-using-a-2d-semiconductor/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/researchers-build-a-risc-v-processor-using-a-2d-semiconductor/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c408a3be073b72982c4ce836a6d4cfce0bf1c23cdd3d59ea90a670aa085e17ef","category":"Tech"}
