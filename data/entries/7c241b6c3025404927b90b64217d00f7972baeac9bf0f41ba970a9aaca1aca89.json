Grynbaum and Benjamin Mullin, reporting for The New York Times:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>CBS News entered a new period of turmoil on Tuesday after the\nexecutive producer of “60 Minutes,” Bill Owens, said he would\nresign from the long-running Sunday news program, citing\nencroachments on his journalistic independence. [...]</p>\n\n<p>“It’s clear the company is done with me,” Mr. Owens said,\naccording to a recording that was obtained by The Times. The\ncorrespondents Lesley Stahl and Scott Pelley were in attendance — Ms. Stahl choked up as she praised Mr. Owens, and noted that he\nhad “taken a hell of a beating” — and Anderson Cooper dialed in\nfrom Rome, where he was covering Pope Francis’ death for CNN.</p>\n\n<p>During the meeting, Mr. Owens alluded to his displeasure with\nadditional layers of oversight that CBS executives had placed on\nthe program. “In a million years, the corporation didn’t know what\nwas coming up — they trusted ‘60 Minutes’ to report the stories\nand program the broadcast the way ‘60 Minutes’ saw fit,” he said.\nAny change to that arrangement, he added, created “a really\nslippery slope.”</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Owens also discouraged his staff from quitting in protest. “I\ndo think this will be a moment for the corporation to take a hard\nlook at itself and its relationship with us,” he said.</p>\n\n<p>Paramount’s controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, is eager to\nsecure the Trump administration’s approval for a\nmultibillion-dollar sale of her company to Skydance, a company run\nby the son of the tech billionaire Larry Ellison. She has\nexpressed a desire to settle Mr. Trump’s case, which stems from\nwhat the president has called a deceptively edited interview in\nOctober with Vice President Kamala Harris that aired on “60\nMinutes.”</p>\n\n<p>Legal experts have dismissed that suit as baseless and\nfar-fetched. Many journalists at CBS News — the former home of\nWalter Cronkite and Mike Wallace — believe that a settlement\nwould amount to a capitulation to Mr. Trump over what they\nconsider standard-issue gripes about editorial judgment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Journalistic outlets <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/26/the-atlantic-has-an-owner-committed-to-the-cause\">need owners who are committed to the cause</a>.
