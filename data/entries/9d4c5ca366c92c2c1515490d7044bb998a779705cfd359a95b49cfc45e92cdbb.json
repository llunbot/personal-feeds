{"title":"On-Device AI: Building Smarter, Faster, And Private Applications","link":"https://smashingmagazine.com/2025/01/on-device-ai-building-smarter-faster-private-applications/","date":1737032400000,"content":"<p>It’s not too far-fetched to say AI is a pretty handy tool that we all rely on for everyday tasks. It handles tasks like recognizing faces, understanding or cloning speech, analyzing large data, and creating personalized app experiences, such as music playlists based on your listening habits or workout plans matched to your progress. </p>\n<p>But here’s the catch:</p>\n<blockquote>Where AI tool actually lives and does its work matters a lot.</blockquote>\n\n<p>Take self-driving cars, for example. These types of cars need AI to process data from cameras, sensors, and other inputs to make split-second decisions, such as detecting obstacles or adjusting speed for sharp turns. Now, if all that processing depends on the cloud, network latency connection issues could lead to delayed responses or system failures. That’s why the AI should operate directly within the car. This ensures the car responds instantly without needing direct access to the internet.</p>\n<p>This is what we call <strong>On-Device AI (ODAI)</strong>. Simply put, ODAI means AI does its job right where you are — on your phone, your car, or your wearable device, and so on — without a real need to connect to the cloud or internet in some cases. More precisely, this kind of setup is categorized as <strong>Embedded AI (EMAI)</strong>, where the intelligence is embedded into the device itself.</p>\n<p>Okay, I mentioned ODAI and then EMAI as a subset that falls under the umbrella of ODAI. However, EMAI is slightly different from other terms you might come across, such as Edge AI, Web AI, and Cloud AI. So, what’s the difference? Here’s a quick breakdown: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Edge AI</strong><br />It refers to running AI models directly on devices instead of relying on remote servers or the cloud. A simple example of this is a security camera that can analyze footage right where it is. It processes everything locally and is close to where the data is collected.</li>\n<li><strong>Embedded AI</strong><br />In this case, AI algorithms are built inside the device or hardware itself, so it functions as if the device has its own mini AI brain. I mentioned self-driving cars earlier — another example is AI-powered drones, which can monitor areas or map terrains. One of the main differences between the two is that EMAI uses dedicated chips integrated with AI models and algorithms to perform intelligent tasks locally.</li>\n<li><strong>Cloud AI</strong><br />This is when the AI lives and relies on the cloud or remote servers. When you use a language translation app, the app sends the text you want to be translated to a cloud-based server, where the AI processes it and the translation back. The entire operation happens in the cloud, so it requires an internet connection to work.</li>\n<li><strong>Web AI</strong><br />These are tools or apps that run in your browser or are part of websites or online platforms. You might see product suggestions that match your preferences based on what you’ve looked at or purchased before. However, these tools often rely on AI models hosted in the cloud to analyze data and generate recommendations.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The main difference? It’s about <em>where</em> the AI does the work: on your device, nearby, or somewhere far off in the cloud or web.</p>\nWhat Makes On-Device AI Useful\n<p>On-device AI is, first and foremost, about privacy — keeping your data secure and under your control. It processes everything directly on your device, avoiding the need to send personal data to external servers (cloud). So, what exactly makes this technology worth using?</p>\n<h3>Real-Time Processing</h3>\n<p>On-device AI processes data instantly because it doesn’t need to send anything to the cloud. For example, think of a smart doorbell — it recognizes a visitor’s face right away and notifies you. If it had to wait for cloud servers to analyze the image, there’d be a delay, which wouldn’t be practical for quick notifications.</p>\n<h3>Enhanced Privacy and Security</h3>\n<p>Picture this: You are opening an app using voice commands or calling a friend and receiving a summary of the conversation afterward. Your phone processes the audio data locally, and the AI system handles everything directly on your device without the help of external servers. This way, your data stays private, secure, and under your control.</p>\n<h3>Offline Functionality</h3>\n<p>A big win of ODAI is that it doesn’t need the internet to work, which means it can function even in areas with poor or no connectivity. You can take modern GPS navigation systems in a car as an example; they give you turn-by-turn directions with no signal, making sure you still get where you need to go.</p>\n<h3>Reduced Latency</h3>\n<p>ODAI AI skips out the round trip of sending data to the cloud and waiting for a response. This means that when you make a change, like adjusting a setting, the device processes the input immediately, making your experience smoother and more responsive. </p>\nThe Technical Pieces Of The On-Device AI Puzzle\n<p>At its core, ODAI uses special hardware and efficient model designs to carry out tasks directly on devices like smartphones, smartwatches, and Internet of Things (IoT) gadgets. Thanks to the advances in hardware technology, AI can now work locally, especially for tasks requiring AI-specific computer processing, such as the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Neural Processing Units (NPUs)</strong><br />These chips are specifically designed for AI and optimized for neural nets, deep learning, and machine learning applications. They can handle large-scale AI training efficiently while consuming minimal power.</li>\n<li><strong>Graphics Processing Units (GPUs)</strong><br />Known for processing multiple tasks simultaneously, GPUs excel in speeding up AI operations, particularly with massive datasets.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here’s a look at some innovative AI chips in the industry:</p>\n<table>\n    <thead>\n        <tr>\n            <th>Product</th>\n            <th>Organization</th>\n      <th>Key Features</th>\n        </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td><a href=\"https://medium.com/@ansuman_72498/the-promise-of-a-new-dawn-with-neuromorphic-computing-indian-institute-of-sciences-656da6426c2c\">Spiking Neural Network Chip</a></td>\n            <td>Indian Institute of Technology</td>\n      <td>Ultra-low power consumption</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td><a href=\"https://ceremorphic.com/ceremorphic-exits-stealth-mode-unveils-technology-plans-to-deliver-a-new-architecture-specifically-designed-for-reliable-performance-computing/\">Hierarchical Learning Processor</a></td>\n            <td>Ceromorphic</td>\n      <td>Alternative transistor structure</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td><a href=\"https://www.graphcore.ai/products/ipu\">Intelligent Processing Units (IPUs)</a></td>\n            <td>Graphcore</td>\n      <td>Multiple products targeting end devices and cloud</td>\n        </tr>\n    <tr>\n            <td><a href=\"https://www.synaptics.com/company/news/synaptics-katana-evk-accelerate-development-ai-sensor-fusion\">Katana Edge AI</a></td>\n            <td>Synaptics</td>\n      <td>Combines vision, motion, and sound detection</td>\n        </tr>\n    <tr>\n            <td><a href=\"https://www.esperanto.ai\">ET-SoC-1 Chip</a></td>\n            <td>Esperanto Technology</td>\n      <td>Built on RISC-V for AI and non-AI workloads</td>\n        </tr>\n    <tr>\n            <td><a href=\"https://www.leti-cea.com/cea-tech/leti/english/Pages/Leti/Projects%20supported/NEURAM3.aspx\">NeuRRAM</a></td>\n            <td>CEA–Leti</td>\n      <td>Biologically inspired neuromorphic processor based on resistive RAM (RRAM)</td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>These chips or AI accelerators show different ways to make devices more efficient, use less power, and run advanced AI tasks.</p>\nTechniques For Optimizing AI Models\n<p>Creating AI models that fit resource-constrained devices often requires combining clever hardware utilization with techniques to make models smaller and more efficient. I’d like to cover a few choice examples of how teams are optimizing AI for increased performance using less energy.</p>\n<h3>Meta’s MobileLLM</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14905\">Meta’s approach</a> to ODAI introduced a model built specifically for smartphones. Instead of scaling traditional models, they designed MobileLLM from scratch to balance efficiency and performance. One key innovation was increasing the number of smaller layers rather than having fewer large ones. This design choice improved the model’s accuracy and speed while keeping it lightweight. You can try out the model either on Hugging Face or using vLLM, a library for LLM inference and serving.</p>\n<h3>Quantization</h3>\n<p>This simplifies a model’s internal calculations by using lower-precision numbers, such as 8-bit integers, instead of 32-bit floating-point numbers. Quantization significantly reduces memory requirements and computation costs, often with minimal impact on model accuracy.</p>\n<h3>Pruning</h3>\n<p>Neural networks contain many weights (connections between neurons), but not all are crucial. Pruning identifies and removes less important weights, resulting in a smaller, faster model without significant accuracy loss.</p>\n<h3>Matrix Decomposition</h3>\n<p>Large matrices are a core component of AI models. Matrix decomposition splits these into smaller matrices, reducing computational complexity while approximating the original model’s behavior.</p>\n<h3>Knowledge Distillation</h3>\n<p>This technique involves training a smaller model (the “student”) to mimic the outputs of a larger, pre-trained model (the “teacher”). The smaller model learns to replicate the teacher’s behavior, achieving similar accuracy while being more efficient. For instance, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108\"><strong>DistilBERT</strong> successfully reduced BERT’s size by 40% while retaining 97% of its performance</a>.</p>\nTechnologies Used For On-Device AI\n<p>Well, all the model compression techniques and specialized chips are cool because they’re what make ODAI possible. But what’s even more interesting for us as developers is actually putting these tools to work.

While you may get a lightweight, private solution for your app, there are a few compromises along the way. Here’s a look at some of them: </p>\n<h3>Limited Resources</h3>\n<p>Phones, wearables, and similar devices don’t have the same computing power as larger machines. This means AI models must fit within limited storage and memory while running efficiently. Additionally, running AI can drain the battery, so the models need to be optimized to balance power usage and performance.</p>\n<h3>Data and Updates</h3>\n<p>AI in devices like drones, self-driving cars, and other similar devices process data quickly, using sensors or lidar to make decisions. However, these models or the system itself don’t usually get real-time updates or additional training unless they are connected to the cloud. Without these updates and regular model training, the system may struggle with new situations.  </p>\n<h3>Biases</h3>\n<p>Biases in training data are a common challenge in AI, and ODAI models are no exception. These biases can lead to unfair decisions or errors, like misidentifying people. For ODAI, keeping these models fair and reliable means not only addressing these biases during training but also ensuring the solutions work efficiently within the device’s constraints.</p>\n<p>These aren't the only challenges of on-device AI. It's still a new and growing technology, and the small number of professionals in the field makes it harder to implement.</p>\nConclusion\n<p>Choosing between on-device and cloud-based AI comes down to what your application needs most. Here’s a quick comparison to make things clear:</p>\n<table>\n    <thead>\n        <tr>\n            <th>Aspect</th>\n            <th>On-Device AI</th>\n      <th>Cloud-Based AI</th>\n        </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td><strong>Privacy</strong></td>\n            <td>Data stays on the device, ensuring privacy.</td>\n      <td>Data is sent to the cloud, raising potential privacy concerns.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td><strong>Latency</strong></td>\n            <td>Processes instantly with no delay.</td>\n      <td>Relies on internet speed, which can introduce delays.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td><strong>Connectivity</strong></td>\n            <td>Works offline, making it reliable in any setting.</td>\n      <td>Requires a stable internet connection.</td>\n        </tr>\n    <tr>\n            <td><strong>Processing Power</strong></td>\n            <td>Limited by device hardware.</td>\n      <td>Leverages the power of cloud servers for complex tasks.</td>\n        </tr>\n    <tr>\n            <td><strong>Cost</strong></td>\n            <td>No ongoing server expenses.</td>\n      <td>Can incur continuous cloud infrastructure costs.</td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>For apps that need <strong>fast processing</strong> and <strong>strong privacy</strong>, ODAI is the way to go. On the other hand, cloud-based AI is better when you need <strong>more computing power</strong> and <strong>frequent updates</strong>. The choice depends on your project’s needs and what matters most to you. </p>","author":"","siteTitle":"Articles on Smashing Magazine — For Web Designers And Developers","siteHash":"ab069ca35bf300e9db0da36f49701f66485a5b0d2db0471dfeee07cef6204939","entryHash":"9d4c5ca366c92c2c1515490d7044bb998a779705cfd359a95b49cfc45e92cdbb","category":"Tech"}
