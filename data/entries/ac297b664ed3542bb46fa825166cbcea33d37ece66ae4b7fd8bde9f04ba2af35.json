While the review period will not end until December 25, Apple is preemptively taking steps to comply should the ruling stand.

Apple strongly disagrees with the order and is pursuing a range of legal and technical options to ensure that Apple Watch is available to customers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nShould the order stand, Apple will continue to take all measures to return Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 to customers in the U.S. as soon as possible.</blockquote>More details to follow…<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 9</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra\">Apple Watch Ultra (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/apple-pausing-series-9-ultra-2-sales-in-us/\">Apple Pausing Sales of Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 in U.S. Due to Patent Dispute</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pausing-sales-of-apple-watch-series-9-and-ultra-2-in-u-s-due-to-patent-dispute.2414047/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ac297b664ed3542bb46fa825166cbcea33d37ece66ae4b7fd8bde9f04ba2af35","category":"Apple"}
