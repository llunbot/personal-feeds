The public beta comes a week after Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/17/apple-releases-second-public-beta-of-ios-17-5/\">released the second public beta</a> and a day after Apple seeded the beta to developers. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/macos-sonoma-4.jpg\" width=\"2336\" height=\"1314\" />\r<br />\nBeta testers can opt-in through the Software Update section of the System Settings app. Under Beta updates, simply toggle on the Sonoma Public Beta. Note that you must sign up to participate on Apple's <a href=\"https://beta.apple.com\">beta testing website</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere have been no new features found in the ‌macOS Sonoma‌ 14.5 developer betas so far, and Apple listed no additions in its release notes. It is likely that the update focuses on bug fixes and other small under-the-hood improvements. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sonoma/\">macOS Sonoma</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sonoma.243\">macOS Sonoma</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/24/apple-seeds-third-public-beta-of-macos-14-5/\">Apple Seeds Third Public Beta of macOS 14.5</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-third-public-beta-of-macos-14-5.2424831/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9807e6e5cda6f03c07758a282548295e7c27e50ad44717ddbf0ee3a09408990d","category":"Apple"}
