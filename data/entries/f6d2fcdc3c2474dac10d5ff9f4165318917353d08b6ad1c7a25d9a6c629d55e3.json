Specialized also says it will introduce young riders who may not have a high level of fitness to the world of mountain biking.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-kids-bikes-a-buyers-guide/\">kids’ bike</a> features Specialized’s SL 1.2 motor, which you’ll find on the brand’s adult bikes. The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/electric-bike-motors/\">electric bike motor</a> can be tuned through the Specialized Mission Control app to set power levels depending on the rider’s ability.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Specialized Turbo Levo SL Kids motor\" title=\"Specialized Turbo Levo SL Kids motor\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> 155mm cranks are used for smaller legs.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Specialized</i></span></div>\n<p>The motor can also be programmed with presets, enabling different riders to use the bike without having to alter it each time.</p>\n<p>A 350Wh battery hidden in the down tube provides power to the motor, which Specialized says provides up to five hours of pedalling. This is much longer than on adult electric bikes due to the reduced weight of the rider.</p>\n<p>Specialized claims the Turbo Levo SL Kids weighs 16.6kg, making it lighter than the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/electric-bikes/specialized-s-works-turbo-levo-sl-ii-review/\">Specialized S-Works Turbo Levo SL II</a> adults bike, which comes in at 17.69kg for a size S4.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Specialized Turbo Levo SL Kids top tube display\" title=\"Specialized Turbo Levo SL Kids top tube display\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The power button is located below the Turbo display.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Specialized</i></span></div>\n<p>The top tube of the bike features a display that indicates which mode the bike is in while displaying information about battery levels and speed.</p>\n<p>The Turbo Operating System also features a lock designed to immobilise the bike should it fall into the wrong hands.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Specialized Turbo Levo SL Kids with SRAM NX drivetrain\" title=\"Specialized Turbo Levo SL Kids with SRAM NX drivetrain\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The bike features an 11-42t cassette.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Specialized</i></span></div>\n<p>Besides the full-size internals, the bike uses serious components such as SRAM’s NX 11-speed groupset and Level T brakes.</p>\n<p>The front of the bike is supported by a 100mm RockShox Reba Air fork, which should enable fine-tuning for lighter riders.</p>\n<p>The bike has a reach measurement of 365mm and a head angle measurement of 66 degrees, with Specialized saying it has delved deep into children’s sizing to produce a bike that’s not only versatile but inspiring to ride.</p>\n<p>It’s important to note that many countries have <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/electric-bike-laws/\">electric bike legislation</a> in place that prohibits children from riding ebikes on public roads and land. Children under 14 years of age are only allowed to ride on private land in the UK.</p>\n<h2>Specialized Turbo Levo SL Kids spec and pricing details</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Specialized Turbo Levo SL Kids pack shot\" title=\"Specialized Turbo Levo SL Kids pack shot\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The bike comes specced with a TranzX Dropper post.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Specialized</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Fork:</strong> RockShox Reba Air, 100mm</li>\n<li><strong>Drivetrain:</strong> SRAM NX</li>\n<li><strong>Brakes:</strong> SRAM Level T</li>\n<li><strong>Wheels:</strong> Specialized, tubeless-ready, 25mm internal rim</li>\n<li><strong>Tyres:</strong> Ground Control 24×2.35in</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £3,500</li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>","author":"Nick Clark","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"f6d2fcdc3c2474dac10d5ff9f4165318917353d08b6ad1c7a25d9a6c629d55e3","category":"Cycling"}
