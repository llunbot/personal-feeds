Canyon sells a small bracket separately that mounts securely to the single bolt, where you can strap on a spare tube &amp; tool. Plenty of options available from other manufacturers will fit too (I use a customizable one made by <a href=\"https://www.syncros.com/global/en/product/syncros-is-accessory-mount\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Syncros</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/25193748/2022-Canyon-Spectral-trail-all-mountain-bike-family-expands-to-include-275-Mullet-29er_carbon-or-alloy_photo-by-Roo-Fowler_chainstay-QR-thru-axle-details.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/25193748/2022-Canyon-Spectral-trail-all-mountain-bike-family-expands-to-include-275-Mullet-29er_carbon-or-alloy_photo-by-Roo-Fowler_chainstay-QR-thru-axle-details.jpg\" alt=\"2022 Canyon Spectral all-mountain bike family, new Alloy, Kids, CFR &amp; Mullet trail bikes,&nbsp;photo by Roo Fowler, rear end details\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1000\" srcset=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/25193748/2022-Canyon-Spectral-trail-all-mountain-bike-family-expands-to-include-275-Mullet-29er_carbon-or-alloy_photo-by-Roo-Fowler_chainstay-QR-thru-axle-details.jpg 1800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/25193748/2022-Canyon-Spectral-trail-all-mountain-bike-family-expands-to-include-275-Mullet-29er_carbon-or-alloy_photo-by-Roo-Fowler_chainstay-QR-thru-axle-details-297x165.jpg 297w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/25193748/2022-Canyon-Spectral-trail-all-mountain-bike-family-expands-to-include-275-Mullet-29er_carbon-or-alloy_photo-by-Roo-Fowler_chainstay-QR-thru-axle-details-800x444.jpg 800w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/25193748/2022-Canyon-Spectral-trail-all-mountain-bike-family-expands-to-include-275-Mullet-29er_carbon-or-alloy_photo-by-Roo-Fowler_chainstay-QR-thru-axle-details-120x67.jpg 120w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/25193748/2022-Canyon-Spectral-trail-all-mountain-bike-family-expands-to-include-275-Mullet-29er_carbon-or-alloy_photo-by-Roo-Fowler_chainstay-QR-thru-axle-details-768x427.jpg 768w, https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/25193748/2022-Canyon-Spectral-trail-all-mountain-bike-family-expands-to-include-275-Mullet-29er_carbon-or-alloy_photo-by-Roo-Fowler_chainstay-QR-thru-axle-details-1536x853.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px\"></a></p><p>The chunky integrated chainstay protector is still there to quiet the drivetrain on any of the new Spectrals.
