This Eufy SmartTrack Card solves that issue with a design that actually fits into your wallet, allowing you always to keep track of its location. Even better, thanks to a 44 percent discount at Amazon, you can <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BKJZ5BVF?th=1\">get one for just $16.88</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So not only are these SmartTrack cards a better fit for your wallet, but they’re also more affordable. These slim trackers will pair well with your iPhone, and you’ll be able to track their location via the Find My network.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you would with an AirTag, you can make this Eufy model ring a super loud alarm so you can easily locate the wallet when it’s fallen between the couch cushions. That’s going to also come in handy in the mornings when you want to leave sooner rather than later and you can’t locate all your belongings. Just note, this Eufy SmartTrack Card only works with iOS devices, so you’ll need an iPhone to connect it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The card has its own battery that will last you for up to three years, but you won’t be able to replace it once it’s out of juice. However, given its price, that won’t be a tragedy. So go ahead and order your very own <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BKJZ5BVF?th=1\">Eufy SmartTrack card for $16.88 at Amazon</a> and slip it into your wallet.</p>\n\n\n<span>Slim enough for your wallet</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BKJZ5BVF?th=1\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"c7be072198af456c98c6e68ccfc19e42b8f2d7444d51f0c7c461455191527535","category":"Apple"}
