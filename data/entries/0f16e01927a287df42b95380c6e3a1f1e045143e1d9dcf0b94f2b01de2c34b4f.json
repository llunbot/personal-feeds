An AI model is a computer program (often using a neural network) trained on data to perform specific tasks or make predictions. The platform, which started as a chatbot app in 2016 before pivoting to become an open source hub for AI models in 2020, now hosts a wide array of tools for developers and researchers.</p>\n\n<p>The machine-learning field represents a far bigger world than just large language models (LLMs) like the kind that power ChatGPT. In a post on X, Hugging Face CEO Cl√©ment Delangue <a href=\"https://x.com/ClementDelangue/status/1839375655688884305\">wrote</a> about how his company hosts many high-profile AI models, like \"Llama, Gemma, Phi, Flux, Mistral, Starcoder, Qwen, Stable diffusion, Grok, Whisper, Olmo, Command, Zephyr, OpenELM, Jamba, Yi,\" but also \"999,984 others.\"</p>\n<p>The reason why, Delangue says, stems from customization. \"Contrary to the '1 model to rule them all' fallacy,\" he wrote, \"smaller specialized customized optimized models for your use-case, your domain, your language, your hardware and generally your constraints are better. As a matter of fact, something that few people realize is that there are almost as many models on Hugging Face that are private only to one organization - for companies to build AI privately, specifically for their use-cases.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052715#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2052715&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0f16e01927a287df42b95380c6e3a1f1e045143e1d9dcf0b94f2b01de2c34b4f","category":"Tech"}
