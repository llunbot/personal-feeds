The studies, which share several co-authors, suggest that our torrid history with Neanderthals may have been shorter than we thought.</p>\n<h2><b>Pinpointing exactly when Neanderthals met <em>H. sapiens</em>  </b></h2>\n<p>Max Planck Institute of Evolutionary Anthropology scientist Leonardo Iasi and his colleagues examined the genomes of 59 people who lived in Europe between 45,000 and 2,200 years ago, plus those of 275 modern people whose ancestors hailed from all over the world. The researchers cataloged the segments of Neanderthal DNA in each person’s genome, then compared them to see where those segments appeared and how that changed over time and distance. This revealed how Neanderthal ancestry got passed around as people spread around the world and provided an estimate of when it all started.</p>\n<p>“We tried to compare where in the genomes these [Neanderthal segments] occur and if the positions are shared among individuals or if there are many unique segments that you find [in people from different places],” said University of California Berkeley geneticist Priya Moorjani in a recent press conference. “We find the majority of the segments are shared, and that would be consistent with the fact that there was a single gene flow event.”</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/studies-pin-down-exactly-when-humans-and-neanderthals-swapped-dna/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/12/studies-pin-down-exactly-when-humans-and-neanderthals-swapped-dna/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kiona N.
