Teams began integrating the replacement engine with the rocket last Friday and are in the process of firmly securing it in the Engine 4 position on the core stage, the NASA spokesperson said.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/nasa-just-swapped-a-10-year-old-artemis-ii-engine-with-one-nearly-twice-its-age/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/nasa-just-swapped-a-10-year-old-artemis-ii-engine-with-one-nearly-twice-its-age/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"63ae94dc467c418358e6f08c9138d2932ef58ce14dd1d8152088a7d46d497488","category":"Tech"}
