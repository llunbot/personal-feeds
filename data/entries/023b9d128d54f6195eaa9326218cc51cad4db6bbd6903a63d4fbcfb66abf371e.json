And as we get closer to that date, Nvidia's partners and some of the PC makers have begun to inadvertently leak details of the cards.</p>\n<p>According to recent leaks from both Zotac and Acer, it looks like Nvidia is planning to announce four new GPUs next month, all at the high end of its lineup: The RTX 5090, RTX 5080, RTX 5070 Ti, and RTX 5070 were all briefly listed on Zotac's website, <a href=\"https://videocardz.com/newz/zotac-confirms-geforce-rtx-5090-with-32gb-gddr7-memory-5080-and-5070-series-listed-as-well\">as spotted by VideoCardz</a>. There's also an RTX 5090D variant for the Chinese market, which will presumably have its specs tweaked to conform with current US export restrictions on high-performance GPUs.</p>\n<p>Though the website leak didn't confirm many specs, it did list the RTX 5090 as including 32GB of GDDR7, an upgrade from the 4090's 24GB of GDDR6X. An Acer spec sheet for new Predator Orion desktops also lists 32GB of GDDR7 for the 4090, as well as 16GB of GDDR7 for the RTX 5080. This is the same amount of RAM included with the RTX 4080 and 4080 Super.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/nvidia-partners-leak-next-gen-rtx-50-series-gpus-including-a-32gb-5090/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/nvidia-partners-leak-next-gen-rtx-50-series-gpus-including-a-32gb-5090/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"023b9d128d54f6195eaa9326218cc51cad4db6bbd6903a63d4fbcfb66abf371e","category":"Tech"}
