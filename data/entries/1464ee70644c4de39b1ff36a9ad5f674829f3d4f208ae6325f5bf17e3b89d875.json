It drew inspiration from George Orwell's dystopian novel <em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em>, with Apple positioning itself as a liberator from the homogenized control represented by the fictional \"Big Brother,\" a veiled allegory for IBM.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ad concludes with the voiceover stating, \"On January 24th, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh. And you'll see why 1984 won't be like '1984.'\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDespite its eventual acclaim, the commercial faced skepticism within Apple. The board of directors expressed concerns about its unconventional approach, and John Sculley, Apple's CEO at the time, even attempted to sell the purchased Super Bowl ad slots.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile the commercial aired nationally only once, the Macintosh reportedly achieved $3.5 million in sales within months of its launch.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/macintosh/\">Macintosh</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/22/1984-commercial-aired-41-years-ago/\">Apple's Famous '1984' Commercial Aired 41 Years Ago Today</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-famous-1984-commercial-aired-41-years-ago-today.2447893/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1464ee70644c4de39b1ff36a9ad5f674829f3d4f208ae6325f5bf17e3b89d875","category":"Apple"}
