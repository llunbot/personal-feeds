The company reportedly met with Tamil Nadu's chief minister recently, although construction of the new facility has yet to start. Jabil aims to finalize its expansion plans by July.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe development is another step in Apple's ongoing strategy to diversify its supply chain beyond China amid increasing trade tensions and tariff uncertainties. The current process involves shipping AirPods casings made in India to assembly plants in China and Vietnam.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple currently produces approximately 20% of its iPhones in India and plans to import most U.S.-bound iPhones from India <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/25/apple-source-us-bound-iphones-india-2026/\">by the end of next year</a>.
