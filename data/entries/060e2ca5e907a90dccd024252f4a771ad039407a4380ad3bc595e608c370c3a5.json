Since March, average sea surface temperatures have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RARohde/status/1650648421458477061\">been climbing to record highs</a>, as shown in the dark line in the graph below.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/temp-change.png\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/temp-change-640x407.png\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/temp-change.png 2x\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/temp-change.png\"></a> (credit: Sean Birkel/University of Maine)</p></div>\n<p>Since this record-keeping began in the early 1980s—the other squiggly lines are previous years—the global average for the world’s ocean surfaces has oscillated seasonally between 19.7° and 21° Celsius (67.5° and 69.8° Fahrenheit). Toward the end of March, the average shot above the 21° mark and stayed there for a month. (The most recent reading, for April 26, was just a hair under 21°.) This temperature spike is not just unprecedented, but extreme.</p>\n<p>“It’s surprising to me that we’re this far off the trajectory,” says Robert Rohde, lead scientist at Berkeley Earth, a nonprofit that gathers climate data. “Usually when you have a particular warming event, we’re beating the previous record by a little bit. Right now we’re sitting well above the past records for this time of year, for a considerable period of time.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1935397#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1935397&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"060e2ca5e907a90dccd024252f4a771ad039407a4380ad3bc595e608c370c3a5","category":"Tech"}
