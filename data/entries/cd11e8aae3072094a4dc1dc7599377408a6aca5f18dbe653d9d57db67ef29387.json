Scott, <a href=\"https://oig.nasa.gov/office-of-inspector-general-oig/audit-reports/nasas-readiness-for-the-artemis-ii-crewed-mission-to-lunar-orbit/\">released a report</a>Â Wednesday that provided an assessment of NASA's readiness to launch the Artemis II mission next year. This is an important flight for the space agency because, while the crew of four will not land on the Moon, it will be the first time humans have flown into deep space in more than half a century.</p>\n<p>The report did not contain any huge surprises. In recent months the biggest hurdle for the Artemis II mission has been the performance of the heat shield that protects the Orion spacecraft during its fiery reentry at more than 25,000 mph from the Moon.</p>\n<p>Although NASA downplayed the heat shield issue in the immediate aftermath of the uncrewed Artemis I flight in late 2022, it is clear that the unexpected damage and charring during that uncrewed mission is a significant concern. As recently as last week, Amit Kshatriya, who oversees development for the Artemis missions in NASA's exploration division, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/04/nasa-still-doesnt-understand-root-cause-of-orion-heat-shield-issue/\">said the agency is still looking for the root cause</a> of the problem.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021239#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2021239&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cd11e8aae3072094a4dc1dc7599377408a6aca5f18dbe653d9d57db67ef29387","category":"Tech"}
