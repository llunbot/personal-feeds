Aside from the differences in remotes, the old model sold here has a slower processor (A10X versus A12) and HDMI 2.1 for 120Hz support (though the feature isn’t active yet). It’s also missing support for high-frame-rate HDR and Thread functionality for smart-home devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But honestly, none of those features are truly must-haves and this deal will still get you one of the best streaming boxes for an excellent price. So go grab one before they’re all gone.</p>\n</div>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"7dac3963169386a53aae42ac7e9f7231059d0f514fb7ed63f951d0d27ce6d5a5","category":"Apple"}
