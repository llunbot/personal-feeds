The information was provided as part of a statement on certain new ‌iOS 18‌, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/\">macOS Sequoia</a> features that will be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/21/apple-intelligence-europe-delay/\">delayed in the European Union</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/Generic-iOS-18-Feature-Real-Mock.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nTwo of the features that will not be coming to the EU this fall are set to debut in next week's ‌iOS 18‌ developer beta, with Apple introducing support for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> Mirroring in ‌macOS Sequoia‌ and expanded SharePlay screen sharing across ‌iOS 18‌, ‌iPadOS 18‌, and ‌macOS Sequoia‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌iPhone‌ Mirroring allows an ‌iPhone‌ to be controlled via a Mac, with full functionality for accessing apps, interacting with notifications, and more. SharePlay screen sharing will let Apple users take over the screen of another Apple user to provide technical support and other help.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNeither of these options are available in the current ‌iOS 18‌, ‌iPadOS 18‌, and ‌macOS Sequoia‌ betas, as Apple is rolling out features during the beta testing period. Apple Intelligence, which also won't be coming in the European Union, is set to come out later this summer. Apple will likely time it to the public beta, which is coming in July.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple says that it needs to delay some features in the European Union because of the complexities of making sure they adhere to the regulations mandated in the Digital Markets Act.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/21/ios-18-beta-2-coming-monday/\">Second iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia Betas Coming Monday With iPhone Mirroring and SharePlay Screen Sharing</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/second-ios-18-ipados-18-and-macos-sequoia-betas-coming-monday-with-iphone-mirroring-and-shareplay-screen-sharing.2429777/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"fac98436e14a6195490501c3532ac22bfe4f0863b2c69da8cf66b4b788e52857","category":"Apple"}
