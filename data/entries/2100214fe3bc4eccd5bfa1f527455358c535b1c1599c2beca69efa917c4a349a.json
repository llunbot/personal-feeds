Today, Kuo has revised his prediction, saying that will not be the case since Apple has canceled those plans due to costs and performance not meeting the company's expectations. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nKuo had previously stated that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/09/kuo-2022-11-inch-ipad-pro-mini-led/\">11-inch iPad Pro would be receiving a mini-LED display</a> next year, and Kuo today doubled down on that claim by saying it will be the \"focus of [the] <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> line in 2022.\" Currently, only the 12.9-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> includes the newer mini-LED technology. One reason Kuo states that Apple had canceled its OLED ‌iPad Air‌ is that it may have been detrimental to the sales of the forthcoming 11-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ with a mini-LED display. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhile Apple plans to stick with an OLED display for the ‌iPad Air‌, Kuo says the company continues to research and develop newer display technologies for the ‌iPad‌ line. A report last week suggested that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/29/oled-ipad-air-samsung-will-not-supply-display/\">Apple and Samsung had abandoned their joint plans</a> to develop an OLED display for a forthcoming updated 10.9-inch ‌iPad Air‌. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air </a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air\">iPad Air (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/02/kuo-apple-cancels-ipad-air-plans-2022/\">Kuo: Apple Cancels Plans to Release iPad Air With OLED Display in 2022, Plans to Stick With LCD Technology</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/kuo-apple-cancels-plans-to-release-ipad-air-with-oled-display-in-2022-plans-to-stick-with-lcd-technology.2315008/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=o-3PCjWaOWQ:hsw7eAIa620:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=o-3PCjWaOWQ:hsw7eAIa620:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/o-3PCjWaOWQ\" />","author":"Sami Fathi","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2100214fe3bc4eccd5bfa1f527455358c535b1c1599c2beca69efa917c4a349a","category":"Apple"}
