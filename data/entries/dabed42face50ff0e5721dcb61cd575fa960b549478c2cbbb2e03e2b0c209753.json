Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>\n<p>DAYTONA BEACH—Last week, ahead of the annual Rolex 24 at Daytona and the start of the North American road racing season, IMSA (the sport's organizers) held a tech symposium across the road from the vast speedway at Embry-Riddle University. Last year, panelists, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/02/the-2024-rolex-24-at-daytona-put-on-very-close-racing-for-a-record-crowd/\">including Crowdstrike's CSO</a>, explained the draw of racing to their employers; this time, organizations represented included NASA, Michelin, AMD, and Microsoft. And while they were all there to talk about racing, it seems everyone was also there to talk about simulation and AI.</p>\n<p>I've <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2018/11/the-golden-age-tech-speeds-from-racetrack-to-road-faster-than-ever/\">long maintained</a> that endurance racing, where grids of prototypes and road car-based racers compete over long durations—24 hours, for example—is the most relevant form of motorsport, the one that makes road cars better. Formula 1 has budgets and an audience to dwarf all others, and there's no doubt about the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/05/here-are-all-the-f1-cars-designed-by-the-legendary-adrian-newey/\">level of talent and commitment</a> required to triumph in that arena. The Indy 500 <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2016/05/the-greatest-spectacle-in-racing-turns-100-the-2016-indy-500/\">might have more history</a>. And rallying looks like the hardest challenge for both humans and machines.</p>\n<p>But your car owes its disc brakes to endurance racing, plus <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/10/10-ways-that-porsches-race-cars-made-road-cars-better/\">its dual-clutch transmission</a>, if it's one of the increasing number of cars fitted with such. But let's not overblow it. Over the years, budgets have had to be reined in for the health of the sport. That—plus a desire for parity among the teams so that no one clever idea runs away with the series—means there are plenty of spec or controlled components on a current endurance racer. Direct technology transfer, then, happens less and less often—at least in terms of new mechanical bits or bobs you might find inside your next car.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/how-car-racing-data-could-help-nasa-build-ai-caretaker-for-mars-mission/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/how-car-racing-data-could-help-nasa-build-ai-caretaker-for-mars-mission/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
