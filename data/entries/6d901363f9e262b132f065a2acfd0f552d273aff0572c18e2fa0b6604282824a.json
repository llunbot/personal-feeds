This turned out to be the standard ‌iPhone 14‌ model built for \"other countries and regions.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNow, <em><a href=\"https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/apple-a3094-bis-certification-iphone-15-series/\">MySmartPrice</a></em> has spotted an Apple device with the model number A3094 in the BIS database. The ‌iPhone 14‌ has the model numbers A2649, A2881, A2884, A2883, and A2882. No Apple device with the model number A3094 currently exists and with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> model numbers roughly increasing with each successive generation, this is likely the ‌iPhone 15‌. If so, this would be the first time that the ‌iPhone 15‌ has been officially seen.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEarlier today, <em>Bloomberg</em> reported that production of the ‌iPhone 15‌ has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/16/new-iphone-starts-production-outside-china/\">started in India</a> – the first time that a new ‌iPhone‌ model has started production outside china prior to the device's announcement. It seems likely that the device filed in the BIS is the same model being mass produced in India.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNew Apple devices being spotted in regulatory databases often indicates that launch is imminent. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a>, Apple is planning to announce the ‌iPhone 15‌ lineup at an event on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/08/iphone-15-september-12-event/\">Tuesday, September 12</a>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/india/\">India</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/16/iphone-15-spotted-in-database/\">iPhone 15 Seemingly Spotted in Regulatory Database as Launch Nears</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-seemingly-spotted-in-regulatory-database-as-launch-nears.2398800/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6d901363f9e262b132f065a2acfd0f552d273aff0572c18e2fa0b6604282824a","category":"Apple"}
