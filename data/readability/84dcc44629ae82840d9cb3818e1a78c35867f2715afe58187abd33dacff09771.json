It will quickly suction air out of the cups, pulling them down onto the surface. The pump then monitors suction and maintains it.

to a system like this, other than just being super small, light, and easy to install, is that it opens up possibilities on more cars. Some are too small to fit a traditional roof rack, or don’t have the necessary rails or channels…or the option to add a hitch mount (like some Audis). Or it’s just much cheaper than a full roof rail system, or maybe you just don’t want all that up there when you don’t need it.</p><p>The entire rack system weighs in at 4.3kg and MSRP is TBD. The kit comes with its own carrying case, letting you safely store it in the boot.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.fovno.com/4/detail/2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Fovno.com</em></a></p></section></article></div></div>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"84dcc44629ae82840d9cb3818e1a78c35867f2715afe58187abd33dacff09771","category":"Cycling"}
