Illegal use appears to be what drives the e-MTB market here in the Western U.S.–as e-MTBs are illegal on National Forest trails, as well as many State Park trails, a fact that manufacturers and retailers have largely chosen to ignore. But also, this article is not a thesis on how to solve that problem, or any of the may other problems presented by increasing number and power of e-bikes on non-motorized trails. I feel like there will be plenty of that in the comments. All I’m hoping to do here is convey information about one specific important development in the e-MTB market.</p>\n<p>At times, I may even do it with some enthusiasm. Though, not <i>a lot</i> of enthusiasm. Powertrain, SRAM’s first e-bike motor, isn’t ushering in the same <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/sram-gx-transmission-first-ride-review/\">fundamental changes Transmission did</a> just a few months ago. But I’m not sure what I was expecting. Something like <a href=\"https://www.tq-ebike.com/en/technology/\">TQ’s Harmonic Pin Ring reduction</a>? Or <a href=\"https://www.fazua.com/en/products/ride-50-evation/\">Fazua’s ultralight, removable system</a>? Or even <a href=\"https://pinion.eu/en/e-drive/\">Pinion’s motorized gearbox</a>? Maybe that wouldn’t be realistic. And there is something interesting going on here. The Transmission drivetrain does open the door for some potentially cool stuff in an e-MTB setting. But there I go, almost getting enthusiastic. Let’s cover the facts.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/POWERTRAIN-V20-NO-WIRES-V1.png?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/POWERTRAIN-V20-NO-WIRES-V1.png?w=3840&amp;quality=75 3840w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/POWERTRAIN-V20-NO-WIRES-V1.png?resize=1024,576&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/POWERTRAIN-V20-NO-WIRES-V1.png?resize=2000,1125&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/POWERTRAIN-V20-NO-WIRES-V1.png?resize=768,432&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/POWERTRAIN-V20-NO-WIRES-V1.png?resize=1800,1013&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/POWERTRAIN-V20-NO-WIRES-V1.png?resize=1335,751&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/POWERTRAIN-V20-NO-WIRES-V1.png?resize=700,394&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/POWERTRAIN-V20-NO-WIRES-V1.png?resize=1536,864&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/POWERTRAIN-V20-NO-WIRES-V1.png?resize=2048,1152&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>The motor itself is manufactured by a German company called Brose. If you’re not already familiar, they equip some Rotwild and BH bikes, but they’re best known for making the full-powered motors on Specialized Levo bikes. Or rather, they’re largely <i>not</i> known for it. Most folks (including Specialized themselves) just call the Brose-made Levo motors “Specialized” motors. And that’s actually pretty normal. Specialized, like most bike brands, contracts with third-party manufacturers to produce house-name equipment like saddles and wheels and even frames.</p>\n<p>But to varying extents, they’re all made to their respective brand’s specifications. It’s the same thing with the Powertrain motor. As far as we were able to uncover, although the Powertrain motor may not be <em>identical</em> to other Brose motors, we were not told that SRAM’s motor is fundamentally different. SRAM did design the features, software, and interface, which are new and novel, but we’ll get the numbers out of the way first.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"3000\" height=\"3000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/003018329000-BT-ETP-BATTERY-630WH-c-3q.png?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/003018329000-BT-ETP-BATTERY-630WH-c-3q.png?w=3000&amp;quality=75 3000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/003018329000-BT-ETP-BATTERY-630WH-c-3q.png?resize=1024,1024&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/003018329000-BT-ETP-BATTERY-630WH-c-3q.png?resize=2000,2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/003018329000-BT-ETP-BATTERY-630WH-c-3q.png?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75 150w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/003018329000-BT-ETP-BATTERY-630WH-c-3q.png?resize=768,768&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/003018329000-BT-ETP-BATTERY-630WH-c-3q.png?resize=1800,1800&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/003018329000-BT-ETP-BATTERY-630WH-c-3q.png?resize=1335,1335&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/003018329000-BT-ETP-BATTERY-630WH-c-3q.png?resize=700,700&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/003018329000-BT-ETP-BATTERY-630WH-c-3q.png?resize=1536,1536&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/003018329000-BT-ETP-BATTERY-630WH-c-3q.png?resize=2048,2048&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"3000\" height=\"3000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/003018389000-BT-ETP-REX-HOLDER-SYSTEM-W-320MM-CABLE-c-3q-batteryVIEW.png?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/003018389000-BT-ETP-REX-HOLDER-SYSTEM-W-320MM-CABLE-c-3q-batteryVIEW.png?w=3000&amp;quality=75 3000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/003018389000-BT-ETP-REX-HOLDER-SYSTEM-W-320MM-CABLE-c-3q-batteryVIEW.png?resize=1024,1024&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/003018389000-BT-ETP-REX-HOLDER-SYSTEM-W-320MM-CABLE-c-3q-batteryVIEW.png?resize=2000,2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/003018389000-BT-ETP-REX-HOLDER-SYSTEM-W-320MM-CABLE-c-3q-batteryVIEW.png?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75 150w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/003018389000-BT-ETP-REX-HOLDER-SYSTEM-W-320MM-CABLE-c-3q-batteryVIEW.png?resize=768,768&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/003018389000-BT-ETP-REX-HOLDER-SYSTEM-W-320MM-CABLE-c-3q-batteryVIEW.png?resize=1800,1800&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/003018389000-BT-ETP-REX-HOLDER-SYSTEM-W-320MM-CABLE-c-3q-batteryVIEW.png?resize=1335,1335&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/003018389000-BT-ETP-REX-HOLDER-SYSTEM-W-320MM-CABLE-c-3q-batteryVIEW.png?resize=700,700&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/003018389000-BT-ETP-REX-HOLDER-SYSTEM-W-320MM-CABLE-c-3q-batteryVIEW.png?resize=1536,1536&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/003018389000-BT-ETP-REX-HOLDER-SYSTEM-W-320MM-CABLE-c-3q-batteryVIEW.png?resize=2048,2048&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>Powertrain provides 90 nm of torque (which is the same as the Specialized) and nominal peak power of 680 watts (which is 115 watts more than Specialized [claims]).

And in each of those two modes, you have just two power adjustments, done through the AXS app. You can limit the max wattage output, which is simple enough. But you can also micro-adjust the assist from “Dynamic,” (being tied closely to your personal power output), to “Supportive,” (going full-tilt as soon as you push on the pedals) and anywhere in between.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"375\" height=\"812\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/SM_AXSapp_AutoShift.png?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" alt /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"375\" height=\"812\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/SM_AXSapp_ConfigureControls02.jpg?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" alt /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"375\" height=\"812\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/SM_AXSapp_RideModes_Rally.png?resize=150,150&amp;quality=75\" alt /></p>\n<p>The simplicity in available modes makes Powertrain a bit of an outlier. Bosch offers bike manufacturers ten modes to choose from. Shimano offers the end-user control over things like how much or little assist is given immediately after you start pedaling. Specialized offers a mode with on-the-fly adjustment of power assist, acting almost like a second shifter. Apparently, that’s not the experience SRAM was trying to offer.</p>\n<p>That may be why they’re putting so much emphasis on the Autoshift mode. It probably sounds like a bad idea to most of us. At first, it sure sounded like a bad idea to me. But I’ve heard from riders I trust who have used Shimano e-MTBs’ new auto-shift setting, and they’ve been surprised how much they like it. But it should work even better on a Powertrain bike. You can reliably shift under load when running a Transmission drivetrain, which is a mandatory spec on Powertrain bikes.</p>\n<p>This is not the sort of thing that would get me to buy an e-MTB, but it’s kinda fun to imagine what it’d be like to approach a climb, where the motor naturally assists based on my torque, and the derailleur naturally shifts based on my cadence. Not gonna lie, it gets me curious about what that would feel like.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/SM_230728_PowertrainWaterfall_PickUps_AS-4132_L-scaled.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/SM_230728_PowertrainWaterfall_PickUps_AS-4132_L-scaled.jpg?w=2560&amp;quality=75 2560w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/SM_230728_PowertrainWaterfall_PickUps_AS-4132_L-scaled.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/SM_230728_PowertrainWaterfall_PickUps_AS-4132_L-scaled.jpg?resize=2000,1333&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/SM_230728_PowertrainWaterfall_PickUps_AS-4132_L-scaled.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/SM_230728_PowertrainWaterfall_PickUps_AS-4132_L-scaled.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/SM_230728_PowertrainWaterfall_PickUps_AS-4132_L-scaled.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/SM_230728_PowertrainWaterfall_PickUps_AS-4132_L-scaled.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/SM_230728_PowertrainWaterfall_PickUps_AS-4132_L-scaled.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/SM_230728_PowertrainWaterfall_PickUps_AS-4132_L-scaled.jpg?resize=2048,1365&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Another thing unique to SRAM’s system is its controllers. The move to a button-style “shifter” introduced alongside Transmission allowed them to go from the on-bar, grip-side buttons used by most e-bikes to a more familiar below-bar setup. Theory being, it’d be more intuitive for people to make on-the-fly tweaks to their settings. For instance, a long press of the top button on the right controller takes you in and out of Autoshift mode.</p>\n<p>Once you’re in it, the right controller essentially adjusts that mode. An “easier” setting would execute its downshifts under lower torque, whereas a “harder” setting would keep you in higher gears for longer. As for the left trigger, the top button switches between the motor’s two assist modes, the bottom button would actuate the dropper. On that note, an AXS dropper isn’t <em>technically</em> mandatory like the Transmission drivetrain.  You can use a cable-actuated dropper, but you’ll be forced to put its lever somewhere else.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/SRAM_Schweinfurt_Dez21_AS6I9221.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/SRAM_Schweinfurt_Dez21_AS6I9221.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/SRAM_Schweinfurt_Dez21_AS6I9221.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/SRAM_Schweinfurt_Dez21_AS6I9221.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/SRAM_Schweinfurt_Dez21_AS6I9221.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/SRAM_Schweinfurt_Dez21_AS6I9221.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/SRAM_Schweinfurt_Dez21_AS6I9221.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/09/SRAM_Schweinfurt_Dez21_AS6I9221.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>That dropper post sparked some nagging doubt about this new system. First, SRAM wouldn’t comment on whether or when they’re going to make a 200mm AXS dropper. So, tall folks may be stuck with a 170 for a while. But my other seatpost nitpick relates to price point. A lot of otherwise full-AXS bikes spec a traditional dropper post because an AXS dropper would bump the complete cost clear into the next bracket.</p>\n<p>But as far as we’ve learned, all Powertrain bikes will spec AXS droppers <em>and</em> Transmission AXS drivetrains. That means that SRAM, a huge potentially influential player in the e-MTB market, has decided they only want serve the ultra-high end. And yes, I know e-MTBs are already exclusively high-end. Canyon, YT, and Fezzari, arguably the highest-value bikes out there, don’t even bother making an affordability-focused aluminum full-suspension e-bike.</p>\n<p>They’re carbon-only, and start at $5,000. But at launch, the only Powertrain bikes on the market will be starting at twice that price. Without the option to drop electronic shifting or electronic dropper posts, it’s unlikely Powertrain-equipped bikes will ever go (meaningfully) lower than five-figures.</p>\n<p>I doubt most of our domestic audience would consider it a tragedy that the SRAM motor isn’t priced to reach a huge audience. Some might say, the fewer e-bikes on the trail, the further we can kick the inevitable reckoning down the road. Again, I’m not here to comment on that. I’d love to end this piece in a way that’d reveal my personal position on the issue.</p>\n<p>But I’ll save that for a Dust-Up…</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/sram-powertrain-emtb-motor/\">SRAM Introduces Powertrain E-MTB Motor System</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"Travis Engel","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"28668844e02869f311ad4bf50a1e63eedffbe78571ca83d8503c110f008225c2","category":"Cycling"}
