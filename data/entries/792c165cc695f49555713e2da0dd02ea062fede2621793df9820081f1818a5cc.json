Now it's applying some of that know-how to the electric Mustang Mach-E with a new version that goes on sale early next year, the Mustang Mach-E Rally.</p>\n<p>Until now, the Mustang Mach-E to purchase if you were looking for some fun has been the Mach-E GT, particularly if you opted for the $64,900 Performance Edition, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/10/the-ford-mustang-mach-e-gt-this-time-more-power-does-equal-more-fun/\">which comes with magnetorheological dampers and better tires</a>. Ford reckons the Mach-E Rally will cost about the same as that version, and it, too, rides on those magnetic fluid-filled dampers, together with new springs that give it a 20 mm higher ride height than the Mach-E GT.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/All-Electric-Mustang-Mach-E-Rally_10-scaled.jpg\"><img alt=\"The rear wing is inspired by the Ford Focus RS, and all Mach-E Rallys will have a black-painted roof. \" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/All-Electric-Mustang-Mach-E-Rally_10-980x654.jpg\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/All-Electric-Mustang-Mach-E-Rally_10-scaled.jpg\">The rear wing is inspired by the Ford Focus RS, and all Mach-E Rallys will have a black-painted roof. </a> (credit: Ford)</p></div>\n<p>There are big front brake discs and 19-inch wheels shod in Michelin CrossClimate2 tires that have bigger sidewalls (and therefore absorb more bumps) than the 20-inch wheels and tires fitted to the GT. Ford has also added some underbody shielding to protect the front and rear motors from rocks, and there's protective film to help prevent stone chips on the doors and wheel arches.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1965854#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1965854&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
