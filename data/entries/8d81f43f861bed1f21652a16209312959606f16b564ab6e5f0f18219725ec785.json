There is a little too much darkness in this world and not enough light, a little too much pseudoscience and not enough science. We'll let other publications offer you a daily horoscope. At Ars Technica, we're going to take a different route, finding inspiration from very real images of a universe that is filled with stars and wonder.</em></p>\n    \n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>Good morning. It's March 1, and today's image showcases two nebulae within the Orion constellation.</p>\n<p>On the left of the image you can see the Flame Nebula, named as such because it's an emoticon often used in gaming chatsâ€”just kidding. Rather, it's an emission nebula about 1,000 light-years from Earth. To the right of the image is the rather iconic Horsehead Nebula, which really does resemble the head of a horse. It's a little less than 1,400 light-years from Earth. The darkness in the nebula is mostly due to thick dust blocking the light of the stars behind it.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2007191#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2007191&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8d81f43f861bed1f21652a16209312959606f16b564ab6e5f0f18219725ec785","category":"Tech"}
