Amazon Alexa will now practice a bit more patience with users, thanks to a Tuesday update that makes the service wait longer for a person to finish speaking commands before it stops listening.\n<p>As reported by <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenaquino/2021/10/05/exclusive-amazon-adds-new-speech-setting-to-alexa-app-to-help-stutterers-finish-commands-queries/?sh=11c5997f2b34\">Forbes</a>, the feature is optional. It could certainly come in handy for those who speak slowly or just need more time to process their thoughts. But it’s really intended as an accessibility feature that makes it easier for people with speech impairments to use Amazon’s virtual assistant. Amazon added the new behavior after some customers told the company that “they just need a bit more time before Alexa responds to their requests,” Shehzad Mevawalla, head of Alexa Speech Recognition at Amazon, told Forbes.</p>\n<p>Giving people more time to speak with Alexa could make the product more appealing to millions. The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders <a href=\"https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/statistics/quick-statistics-voice-speech-language\">reports</a> that more than 3 million Americans stutter, and almost 7% of Americans have a language impairment of some sort, <a href=\"https://www.asha.org/about/press-room/quick-facts/\">according to</a> the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801573#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1801573&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"15709e688963cad827db7d591af882e11bcf4794948b0d686f98cc865a2c056a","category":"Tech"}
