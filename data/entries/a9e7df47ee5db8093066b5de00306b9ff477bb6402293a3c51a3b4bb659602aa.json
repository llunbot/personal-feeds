Some SD cards crash and can't be accessed, while some have unusually slow transfer speeds. <em>MacRumors</em> reader <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/14-and-16-m1-pro-sd-card-slot-problems.2320399/post-30546782\">Wildc<sup>t</sup></a> explains the issue:<blockquote>Same issues with 14\" M1 Pro. Just seems to be super flakey and inconsistent. Half the time it'll recognize the card successfully (though it takes anywhere from 30s to 1m) and half the time it'll throw an error. These are all Sandisk Ultra cards, both XC and HC, that were formatted in my camera. I tried reformatting them w/ the MBP and that didn't seem to make a difference. All my cards work as expected in my 3 other USB card readers.</blockquote>In some situations, there's just an error message when attempting to use the SD card, sometimes Finder crashes, and sometimes the SD card takes many minutes to be accesible. From <em>MacRumors</em> reader <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/14-and-16-m1-pro-sd-card-slot-problems.2320399/post-30544903\">2Stepfan</a>:<blockquote>It's very frustrating. I was hoping that import from SD card including preview of images would be quick on my new 14\" MBP. I have a fairly new 64GB SD card which had been working fine. But Photos on the MBP using the internal SD card slot takes minutes to show photos and sometimes crashes half way through. Sometimes the Finder crashes too.</blockquote>Based on the thread, formatting does not appear to be the issue, though it could be a factor. There also does not seem to be a common thread between which cards work and which do not, but multiple users have reported that using an SD card reader over USB-C works when the SD card slot does not. From <em>MacRumors</em> reader <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/14-and-16-m1-pro-sd-card-slot-problems.2320399/post-30619975\">wilberforce</a>:<blockquote>I tried many cards, and could find no pattern of brand, size, type, format, age. Seems to be completely random. The only thing that is consistent is that if a card works, it always works, and if a card does not work properly it never works properly. Reformatting, even to all other possible formats, makes no difference. Sandisk, Sony, Samsung, 16GB, 32GB, 64GB, 128GB, 256GB, UHS-I, UHS-II, micro-SD, FAT32, exFAT, makes no difference. 100% of my cards work perfectly via a dongle.</blockquote>Some readers who have contacted Apple have been told that the company is aware of the issue and that a fix is <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/14-and-16-m1-pro-sd-card-slot-problems.2320399/post-30654676\">coming in a future software update</a>, but it is not clear if this is a hardware issue or a software issue. Some users who had problems <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/14-and-16-m1-pro-sd-card-slot-problems.2320399/post-30609313\">replaced their MacBook Pro</a> and did not continue to have issues, so it's not known exactly what might be going on.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMany of the reports are about older SD cards and there may be a particular issue with some 128GB cards, but for the most part, complaints are all over the place in terms of SD card brand, speed, and capacity.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOne user reported that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/01/apple-seeds-macos-monterey-12-1-beta-4/\">macOS Monterey 12.1 beta</a> had fixed the issue, but <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/macbookpro/comments/r7aja6/sd_card_slot_14_m1_pro/hn68b0u/?context=3\">another person on Reddit</a> said that the most recent beta did not address it, so we also don't know if <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">macOS Monterey</a> 12.1 might have a fix.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThose affected who are unable to use their SD cards with the SD card slot can access their cards by using an SD card reader dongle, which is not an ideal solution but at least provides a way to get SD card content onto an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-pro/\">M1 Pro</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1-max/\">M1 Max</a> Mac.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">14 &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">14\" &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/06/macbook-pro-sd-card-issue/\">Some SD Cards Not Working Properly With 2021 14 and 16-Inch MacBook Pros</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/some-sd-cards-not-working-properly-with-2021-14-and-16-inch-macbook-pros.2326451/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=vQtO2beQln0:JJ2wy9AODfY:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=vQtO2beQln0:JJ2wy9AODfY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a9e7df47ee5db8093066b5de00306b9ff477bb6402293a3c51a3b4bb659602aa","category":"Apple"}
