The analogy is imperfect, but it represents the idea that, similar to how USB-C unified various cables and ports (with admittedly a <a href=\"https://learn.adafruit.com/understanding-usb-type-c-cable-types-pitfalls-and-more/cable-types-and-differences\">debatable level</a> of success), MCP aims to standardize how AI models connect to the infoscape around them.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/04/mcp-the-new-usb-c-for-ai-thats-bringing-fierce-rivals-together/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/04/mcp-the-new-usb-c-for-ai-thats-bringing-fierce-rivals-together/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7cf44c3c39a8c85472e31945c8fe0cc3c595ab915be308e583ec21e512b432c4","category":"Tech"}
