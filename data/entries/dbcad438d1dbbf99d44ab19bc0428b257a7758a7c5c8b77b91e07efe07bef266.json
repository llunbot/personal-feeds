The publication claims that Auñón-Chancellor had an emotional breakdown in space, then damaged a Russian spacecraft in order to return early. This, of course, is a complete fabrication.</p>\n<p>The context for the article is the recent, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/07/russian-module-suddenly-fires-thrusters-after-docking-with-space-station/\">near-disastrous docking</a> of the Russian Nauka science module with the International Space Station. <a href=\"https://tass.ru/kosmos/12113969\">The TASS article</a> attempts to rebut criticism in US publications (<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/08/nauka-modules-near-miss-raises-concerns-about-future-of-space-station/\">including Ars Technica</a>) that covered the incident and raised questions about the future of the Roscosmos-NASA partnership in space.</p>\n<p>One of a dozen rebuttals in the TASS article concerns a 2018 incident—a 2 mm breach in the orbital module of the Soyuz MS-09 vehicle docked with the International Space Station. Russian cosmonaut Sergey Prokopyev, European Space Agency astronaut Alexander Gerst, and NASA's Auñón-Chancellor had flown to the station inside this Soyuz in June. The leak was discovered in late August.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1786777#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1786777&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"dbcad438d1dbbf99d44ab19bc0428b257a7758a7c5c8b77b91e07efe07bef266","category":"Tech"}
