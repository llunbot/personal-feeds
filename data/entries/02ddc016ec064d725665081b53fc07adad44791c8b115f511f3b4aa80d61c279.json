Josef Aschbacher, a scientist who took over as director general of ESA in 2021, has argued that Europe is in an \"acute launcher crisis\" now that the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/07/europes-euclid-telescope-launched-to-study-the-dark-universe/\">continent lacks independent launch capability</a> for most of its space missions.</p>\n<p>Officials from ESA's 22 member states met Monday for a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/11/ariane-6-cost-and-delays-bring-european-launch-industry-to-a-breaking-point/\">Space Summit in Seville, Spain</a>, to decide on several priorities for the space agency. The rocket question was perhaps the most pressing among the topics up for discussion.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1981825#p3\">Read 45 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1981825&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"02ddc016ec064d725665081b53fc07adad44791c8b115f511f3b4aa80d61c279","category":"Tech"}
