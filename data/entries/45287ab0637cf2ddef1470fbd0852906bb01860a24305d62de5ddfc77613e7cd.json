But a modern lightweight bike has to prove itself not solely through a lack of grams on the scales, but also by having the aerodynamics to up your ride speed.</p>\n<p>In fact, for most riding conditions, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/aero-bike-test-notes/\">aerodynamics is more important than weight</a>, although there’s a definite buzz in riding a fast, flyweight machine.</p>\n<p>Even if a lack of grams helps you get to the top of a hill quicker, you’ve still usually got to get down the other side, where those watts saved will come into their own. Aerodynamics will help you on the flat too.</p>\n<h2>Best climbing bikes: what to look for</h2>\n<h3>Weight</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Rebecca Richardson's Specialized S-Works Aethos at the British Hill Climb National Championships\" title=\"Rebecca Richardson's Specialized S-Works Aethos at the British Hill Climb National Championships\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> How low can you go? 4.5kg in this case.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>It perhaps goes without saying, but when you’re riding uphill, gravity is always trying to pull you back down.</p>\n<p>Reducing the total rider plus bike system weight means less energy (or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/power-vs-heart-rate/\">power</a>, in cycling parlance) is required to maintain a given speed while climbing.</p>\n<p>Therefore, if you want to ride uphill faster, or simply make the hills a little easier, a lightweight bike helps a lot.</p>\n<p>It’s for this reason we see <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/2022-hill-climb-bikes/\">hill-climb obsessives</a> chopping and changing practically every component to bring their overall bike weight down to its lowest possible limit.</p>\n<p>The only issues are that <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/top-5-ultralight-road-bike-tech/\">high-end, lightweight bikes and parts</a> can be eye-wateringly expensive, and the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/weight-weenie-heres-why-its-not-your-fault/\">weight-weenie</a> bug can be hard to shake once you get started. However, some of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bike-under-3000/\">best road bikes under £3,000</a> are good for climbing.</p>\n<p>Cheaper still is improving your <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/power-to-weight-ratio/\">power-to-weight ratio</a>. You can do this by becoming more powerful at the same weight or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/nutrition/how-to-lose-weight-cycling/\">losing weight through cycling</a> and maintaining power.</p>\n<h3>Aerodynamics</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Canyon Ultimate CFR Di2\" title=\"Canyon Ultimate CFR - 02\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Modern classic climbing bikes have moved with the aero times.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Until fairly recently, climbing bikes made no concessions to aerodynamics, leaving drag-reduction to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-aero-road-bike/\">best aero road bikes</a>. But with the rise of computer modelling, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/notio-konect-provides-all-your-aero-data-without-a-wind-tunnel/\">on-bike aero sensors</a> and other advanced testing techniques, this has all changed.</p>\n<p>Even dedicated climbing bikes are now launching, with brands touting their aerodynamic efficiency.</p>\n<p>Take the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2021-trek-emonda/\">Trek Emonda</a>, for example. Trek says it has been designed specifically for the rigours of iconic <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/events/tour-de-france/\">Tour de France</a> climbs such as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/alpe-dhuez-the-hollywood-climb-video/\">Alpe d’Huez</a> (a 13.85km monster in the French Alps), yet still features extensive aero treatment.</p>\n<p>We won’t deny there’s usually a minor weight penalty associated with such aero features, but clearly brands have deduced that, on balance, it’s worth it.</p>\n<p>We’ll discuss this particular issue in more detail in our buyer’s guide at the end of the article, so keep reading once you’ve considered all the reviews.</p>\n<p>Now, onto our recommendations.</p>\n<h2>The best climbing bikes 2023, as rated by our expert testers</h2>\n<h3>Giant TCR Advanced SL 0 Disc</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>5.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Black Giant TCR Advanced SL0 Disc road bike\" title=\"Giant TCR Advanced SL0 Disc\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The latest version of the TCR only enhances the model’s reputation as a race-bike leader.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>Light, stiff and responsive race bike</li>\n<li>Top spec with SRAM Red AXS and Cadex carbon wheels</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £9,699 / $11,000 / AU$13,499 (as tested)</li>\n</ul><p>The Giant TCR has long been a benchmark for race bikes and the ninth generation of the bike remains a top performer.</p>\n<p>While the TCR comes in many variants to suit different budgets, the Advanced SL 0 model is unapologetically high-end and its frameset sports an integrated seatpost with a topper rather than a conventional one.</p>\n<p>With a full SRAM Red eTap AXS wireless groupset and carbon wheels from Giant’s in-house brand Cadex, it’s ready to race out of the box and is properly light.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Weight:</strong> 6.7kg (L)</li>\n<li><strong>Gearing: </strong>48/35, 10-28</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/2021-giant-tcr-advanced-sl-0-disc-review/\">Read our full Giant TCR Advanced SL 0 Disc </a><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/2021-giant-tcr-advanced-sl-0-disc-review/\">review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Bianchi Specialissima</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Bianchi Specialissima Dura Ace di2 road bike\" title=\"Bianchi Specialissima Dura Ace di2 - 01\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Stunning ride quality in a lightweight bike with aero tube profiles.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Dave Caudery / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>Great mix of speed, handling, control and smoothness</li>\n<li>Top spec, but the wheels are a bit of a disappointment</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £11,206 / $11,626 / €11,449 (as tested)</li>\n</ul><p>The Bianchi Specialissima is a bike that’s gone from round tubes to aero profiles in its latest iteration, also gaining disc brakes and hiding the hoses, while still ticking the lightweight boxes with a 750g frame and 370g fork.

The Vision SC 40 carbon tubeless wheels feel a little low-value compared to the rest of the spec though (even at £11,000).</p>\n<p>The ride is a mix of responsiveness with great handling, while also composed, smooth and more comfortable than some bikes with tyres wider than the Specialissima’s 26mm Pirellis.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Weight:</strong> 7.2kg (59cm)</li>\n<li><strong>Gearing:</strong> 50/34, 11-30</li>\n</ul><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/bianchi-specialissima-dura-ace-di2-review/\">Read our full Bianchi Specialissima review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Cannondale SuperSix Evo Hi-Mod 2</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Cannondale SuperSix Evo Hi-Mod 2 road bike\" title=\"Cannondale SuperSix EVO Hi-Mod 2 - 01\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The latest incarnation of the SuperSix Evo remains one of the very best all-round race bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudrey / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>Excellent handling combined with compliance and stiffness</li>\n<li>The Vision Trimax handlebar may not suit those with smaller hands and the bike comes with 25mm tyres</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £8,250 / $8,300 / €8,999 / AU$11,999 (as tested)</li>\n</ul><p>Now in its fourth generation, the SuperSix Evo continues to cement itself as one of the best climbing bikes. The new bike takes much of what made the previous versions so well regarded, but removes the often-maligned PF30a press-fit bottom bracket and replaces it with a 68mm BSA threaded model. The front-end design and down tube have also been refined and there’s a new proprietary seatpost, too.</p>\n<p>Out on the road, the SuperSix Evo balances its inspired handling with compliance and stiffness. It’s a particularly adept climber, feeling assured and firm when under the rider and when you want to put the power down, it rockets forward. The new aero seatpost isn’t as stiff as you might expect, offering a good amount of buzz-reducing compliance.</p>\n<p>The Shimano Ultegra R8100 groupset on this build is BikeRadar’s pick of the Japanese brand’s latest groupsets and we were impressed by the newly updated flagship HollowGram R-SL 50 wheels, too. Although Cannondale specs Continental Grand Prix 5000 tyres, they’re in a 25mm width and we’d be keen to run wider rubber. We also suspect the Vision Trimax won’t suit those with smaller hands because the tops are very deep.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Weight:</strong> 7.57kg (56cm)</li>\n<li><strong>Gearing:</strong> 52/36, 11-30</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/cannondale-supersix-evo-hi-mod-2-review/\">Read our full Cannondale SuperSix Evo Hi-Mod 2 review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>ENVE Melee (Ultegra Di2 build)</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"ENVE Melee (Ultegra Di2 build) road bike\" title=\"ENVE Melee (Ultegra Di2 build) - 01\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The ability to mould the Melee to your needs makes it a real winner.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>Outstanding handling balanced with great comfort and geometry</li>\n<li>Expensive and you can’t buy a full build off the peg</li>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £5,500 / $5,500 / €5,500 for frame ‘chassis’ / £10,400 / $12,834 / AU$19,220 (as tested)</li>\n</ul><p>The ENVE Melee took our 2023 Performance Bike of the Year crown, thanks to its outstanding handling and balanced comfort. The brand’s second bike after the Custom Road has been aerodynamically optimised, albeit with a slightly taller ride position than you’ll find on longer and lower bikes. The Melee also fully integrates its cables and hoses and uses a D-shaped seatpost.</p>\n<p>We found the Melee to be one of the easiest-handling race bikes on the market and we were struck by how stable and composed it is in every scenario. It deals with everything with real calmness.</p>\n<p>A stable and composed ride can sometimes be a little boring, but there’s none of that here. The Melee’s reaction to inputs is quick and it’s unperturbed by crosswinds.</p>\n<p>Unlike the other bikes on this list, the Melee is sold as a ‘chassis’ – a frame, fork, stem, handlebar, seatpost and thru-axles.

That said, in testing we found the Diamante to balance its tactile handling with satisfying stiffness. It’s surprisingly comfortable, too, thanks to the slim seatstays and carbon seatpost.</p>\n<p>There’s little to criticise with the Ultegra Di2 specced. The second-tier groupset delivers identical shifting and braking performance to Dura-Ace with a compelling cost saving.

You have to be very careful about sticking to recommended weight, torque and clamping specs, or else it’s very easy to break these feathery items.</p>\n<h3>Aero vs. weight for climbing</h3>\n<p>It would be easy to think when you’re <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/how-to-become-a-hill-climbing-star/\">going uphill</a>, weight is the only thing that matters. It is, of course, important. After all, a 5kg reduction in total rider plus bike weight will shave around 39 seconds off a 2km, 10 per cent climb, all other things being equal.</p>\n<p>But with our many years of collective experience, we’ve found <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/losing-weight-from-your-bike-or-your-body-which-makes-you-faster/\">body weight matters much more than bike weight</a>. Besides, unless you can get your hands on something like <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/lightweight-berk-road-bike/\">Berk’s 3.9kg bike</a>, you’re going to struggle to shave anywhere near 5kg off your bike’s overall weight, no matter how deep your pockets.</p>\n<p>On top of that, more and more brands are discovering that aerodynamics is still important when riding uphill, and for saving energy on the way to the bottom.</p>\n<p>Even a brand such as Cannondale, which used to make <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/andrew-feathers-cannondale-supersix-evo-hill-climb-bike/\">the definitive, ultra-lightweight hill climb bike</a>, believes its full-on aero bike, the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/cannondale-systemsix-carbon-ultegra-review/\">SystemSix</a>, is <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/cannondale-claims-its-systemsix-to-be-the-fastest-uci-approved-road-bike-in-the-world/\">faster on gradients up to 6 per cent</a> than its own lightweight bike (the SuperSix) – even at the typically slower speeds mere mortals such as us ride at.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Cannondale SystemSix Hi-Mod Dura-Ace Di2; 'the fastest bike in the world'\" title=\"br_01788-1534851224961-16i5iyd0gv46l-a5937da\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Cannondale says its burly SystemSix aero bike is its fastest bike on gradients of up to 6 per cent, regardless of the weight penalty.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Aoife Glass / Immediate Media co</i></span></div>\n<p>True hill climb aficionados will no doubt be tearing their hair out at this point, exclaiming ‘anything under 10 per cent isn’t even a proper hill anyway!’, but if you want to go fast, aero always matters, regardless of the gradient.</p>\n<p>It’s true that aerodynamic drag becomes a smaller part of the equation as gradients increase in severity, but the absolute amount of air resistance you experience remains the same for any given speed.</p>\n<p>On top of that, the power to overcome any increase in air resistance is proportional to the cube of speed. So, if you want to ride your bicycle twice as fast, you’ll need eight times more power to overcome the extra drag force, unless you can reduce your aerodynamic drag.</p>\n<p>In an ideal world, then, you want a bike that’s both lightweight and aero for smashing hills.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Computational fluid dynamics modeling of the Kamm Tail tube shaping on Trek's new Madone 7-Series frame\" title=\"1340764107115-1kquhghyzxbl4-3e6fb0c\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> One of the first brands to use Kammtail tubes was Trek.

Chung is perhaps most famous for devising the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/aerodynamics-made-easy/\">‘Chung Method’</a> of calculating aerodynamic drag, but he also reminds us of the importance of not ignoring rolling resistance.</p>\n<p>Using a power equation for wheeled vehicles (such as the one found at <a href=\"http://www.kreuzotter.de/english/espeed.htm#bmi\" target=\"_blank\">www.kreuzotter.de</a>), he showed that even a relatively small difference in rolling resistance (Crr stands for ‘coefficient of rolling resistance’) can be worth as much as large changes in weight, even on steep gradients.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Weight weenies should be Crr weenies. We can convert differences in Crr to \"equivalent\" differences in mass. Even small differences in Crr are equivalent to 100's of grams of mass difference on steep hills. <a href=\"https://t.co/YSASEisid0\">pic.twitter.com/YSASEisid0</a></p>— @rchung@mstdn.social (@therealrchung) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/therealrchung/status/1122525676295217152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 28, 2019</a></blockquote><p>Chung’s graph plots the difference in Crr between Continental’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/tyres/continental-grand-prix-4000-sii-review/\">GP4000S II</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/continental-has-finally-developed-a-tubeless-road-tyre-gp-5000-tl-first-look/\">GP5000</a> tyres in terms of the equivalent efficiency found through weight loss on different gradients.</p>\n<p>On a flat road, it’s clear that even a relatively small decrease in rolling resistance is worth more than practically any increase in weight. What’s really interesting to note though, is that changing from a GP4000 to a GP5000 is still worth more than 500g of extra mass even on a 10 per cent slope.</p>\n<p>Yes, that’s right; the small difference in rolling resistance between two of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bike-tyres/\">best road bikes tyres</a> can have a greater effect on your efficiency than 500g of extra weight even on a 10 per cent slope, and that equivalent mass penalty only increases as the gradient gets shallower. On a 6 per cent slope, the difference is equivalent to a kilogram of extra mass.</p>\n<p>The key takeaway is that you shouldn’t just look at weight figures when shopping for tyres. The differences in rolling resistance between tyres will be worth far more to your climbing speed than any minor weight variations.</p>\n<h3>Gearing and cadence when climbing</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Jack’s Canyon Ultimate CF SLX Haute Route Davos Horse for the Course\" title=\"@OpenProd - HR DAVOS - Canyon RP-11\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> An 11-30t cassette is increasingly the norm for climbing bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Olivier Penpenic / Haute Route </i></span></div>\n<p>Some riders apparently enjoy using singlespeed or even <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/can-one-gear-really-work-for-hill-climbs/\">fixed-gear bikes for climbing hills</a>. But most people are going to want <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-gears/\">bike gears</a>.</p>\n<p>For a long time though, back in the days when riders only had five or so cogs on their cassette to choose from, gears such as 42×21 were considered adequate for climbing mountains.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, though, things have moved on and we now have access to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/what-is-a-compact-crank/\">compact/sub-compact chainsets</a>, long-cage <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/a-complete-guide-to-rear-derailleurs/\">rear derailleurs</a> and much larger <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/bike-cassettes/\">bike cassettes</a>.</p>\n<p>Used together, these can allow practically anyone to spin up steep climbs at a comfortable <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/skills/what-is-cycling-cadence/\">cycling cadence</a>, rather than turning them into a series of leg presses.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Shimano 105 R7000 crankset\" title=\"20200622_SB_5DSR_MG_1781\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Smaller gear ratios, like this sub-compact 52/36t Shimano 105 R7000 chainset, allow for higher cadences on steep hills.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Muscling up a steep hill in a massive gear might feel heroic, but it’s probably slower and it’s costing you more energy too, as anyone with a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/power-meters/\">power meter</a> will be able to attest to.

In our opinion, there are two answers to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-brakes/\">bike brakes</a> debates – a simple one and a nuanced one.</p>\n<p>The simple answer is that <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/horse-for-the-course-the-ultimate-climbing-bike-for-the-three-day-haute-route-davos/\">rim brakes are, generally, lighter, and therefore are better for climbing bikes</a>.</p>\n<p>There’s a more nuanced answer, however. While disc-brake equipped bikes generally come with a weight penalty (though this is becoming harder to measure because, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/settle-down-your-rim-brakes-are-here-to-stay/\">despite what we wrote in 2017</a>, new high-end <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/rim-brake-road-bikes/\">rim brake road bikes</a> are uncommon), the advantage of better braking will be keenly felt on the way down the hills.</p>\n<p>If the only thing you care about is going uphill as fast as possible, then rim brakes could still be the right choice. Otherwise, the advantages of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/road-disc-brakes-everything-you-need-to-know/\">road disc brakes</a> might tip the balance.</p>","author":"Simon von Bromley","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"45287ab0637cf2ddef1470fbd0852906bb01860a24305d62de5ddfc77613e7cd","category":"Cycling"}
