Apple discontinued the charger around 2016 and the Magic accessories now have built-in batteries that can be recharged via Lightning.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe third-generation Apple TV was released in March 2012 and many third-party apps have already phased out support for the device. The third-generation model is also the last Apple TV that does not run tvOS, and thus lacks access to the App Store.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn the past, vintage Apple products were no longer eligible for repairs at the Genius Bar or at Apple Authorized Service Providers, but Apple now provides service for up to seven years on vintage products, subject to parts availability.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe original Apple Watch was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/30/apple-watch-vintage-products/\">added to Apple's vintage products list</a> last week.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/vintage-and-obsolete/\">vintage and obsolete</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100\">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/04/apple-tv-3-and-apple-battery-charger-vintage/\">Remember Apple's AA Battery Charger?
