Scientists in Switzerland conducted experiments with fermented coffee in hopes of identifying the specific chemical compounds behind the beverage's unusual flavor profile.</p>\n<p>\"There are now flavors that people are creating that no one would have ever associated with coffee in the past,” <a href=\"https://www.acs.org/pressroom/newsreleases/2023/march/fermented-coffees-fruity-aromas-demystified.html\">said Chahan Yeretzian</a>, a scientist at the Coffee Excellence Center at Zurich University of Applied Sciences, who <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYvxJcR79PA&amp;list=PL-qHxGvFeZV1z1m5cYt9Wky8ai4fv7R-p&amp;index=10\">presented the research</a> during a recent American Chemical Society meeting in Indianapolis. \"The flavors in fermented coffee, for example, are often more akin to fruit juices.”</p>\n<p>Most coffee is a little fermented since it happens naturally as wet-processed beans soak, breaking down enzymes and producing sugars. It also makes it easier to remove the husk and pulp. In this case, we're talking about green coffee beans that have already been through that initial processing. The beans are then soaked in water spiked with carefully selected strains of yeasts and bacteria and left to ferment for a couple of days. Often fruit or other flavors are added during this stage or the beans are fermented in barrels previously used to store whiskey, rum, or other liquors. Then the beans are washed and dried, and roasted as usual.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1938516#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1938516&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cce7211173837bc83a62f44e37151f186839997797a0e50bf4354d1f34939609","category":"Tech"}
