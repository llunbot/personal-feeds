And if you want up to 25% faster performance than the M2 Ultra, the 16-inch MacBook Pro with the 16-core M4 Max starts at the same $3,999 price as the Mac Studio.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/benchmarks/\">Benchmarks</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/geekbench/\">Geekbench</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">14\" &amp; 16\" MacBook Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/01/m4-max-chip-geekbench-benchmark-results/\">M4 Max Chip Up to 25% Faster Than M2 Ultra in First Benchmark Results</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m4-max-chip-up-to-25-faster-than-m2-ultra-in-first-benchmark-results.2441693/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3a37889d2f244cff4da54c4cbc95470f741f9d2d953a6fd129c72bba981ac2be","category":"Apple"}
