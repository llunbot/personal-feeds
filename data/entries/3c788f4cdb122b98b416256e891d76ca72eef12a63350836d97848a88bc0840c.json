The 120mm travel bike isn’t quite a trail bike in the contemporary sense as its name might suggest. But it is a quick modern XC bike that’s built to take on the toughest cross-country courses. Can keep you pushing on long-distance marathon MTB races. And is a blast to shred on fast singletrack for the mountain bike rider who likes to feel connected to the trail…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2024 Lee Cougan Crossfire Trail light 120mm carbon XC bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After their unique <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/lee-cougan-rampage-innova-reshapes-xc-rear-suspension-with-short-travel-oil-damped-softail/\" target=\"_blank\">Rampage Innova</a> ultra-short travel XC bike a couple years ago, Lee Cougan are back with another interesting 29er mountain bike at the other extreme of cross-country racing. This one is a 120/120mm full-suspension XC bike that leans more towards the trail perspective with slacker geometry and 4x as much travel.

They call it a ‘Structural Crossbar System’ where the downtube opens up around the upside-down rear shock, and the trunnion mount keeps everything rigid. Plus, a special noodle for the complicated shock lock routing, and another air noodle to adjust shock pressure in that tight space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, the chainstays connect in front of the seattube &amp; main pivot for added stiffness, while keeping the rear end short.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hollow alloy axles and oversized bearings keep everything rotating smoothly for the long term.

Like seriously testing the limits of sliding out of control on XC tires, conditions. But really, the bike handled really well. Quite predictable and confidence-inspiring for a light bike that isn’t ashamed of its racer roots.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lee-Cougan-Crossfire-Trail-lightweight-120mm-carbon-XC-cross-country-marathon-mountain-bike_Bike-Connection-Agency-photo-by-Rupert-Fowler_climbing.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lee-Cougan-Crossfire-Trail-lightweight-120mm-carbon-XC-cross-country-marathon-mountain-bike_Bike-Connection-Agency-photo-by-Rupert-Fowler_climbing.jpg\" alt=\"New Lee Cougan Crossfire Trail light 120mm carbon cross-country marathon MTB, Bike Connection Agency photo by Rupert Fowler, climbing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lee-Cougan-Crossfire-Trail-lightweight-120mm-carbon-XC-cross-country-marathon-mountain-bike_Bike-Connection-Agency-photo-by-Rupert-Fowler_climbing.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lee-Cougan-Crossfire-Trail-lightweight-120mm-carbon-XC-cross-country-marathon-mountain-bike_Bike-Connection-Agency-photo-by-Rupert-Fowler_climbing-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lee-Cougan-Crossfire-Trail-lightweight-120mm-carbon-XC-cross-country-marathon-mountain-bike_Bike-Connection-Agency-photo-by-Rupert-Fowler_climbing-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lee-Cougan-Crossfire-Trail-lightweight-120mm-carbon-XC-cross-country-marathon-mountain-bike_Bike-Connection-Agency-photo-by-Rupert-Fowler_climbing-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lee-Cougan-Crossfire-Trail-lightweight-120mm-carbon-XC-cross-country-marathon-mountain-bike_Bike-Connection-Agency-photo-by-Rupert-Fowler_climbing-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lee-Cougan-Crossfire-Trail-lightweight-120mm-carbon-XC-cross-country-marathon-mountain-bike_Bike-Connection-Agency-photo-by-Rupert-Fowler_climbing-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lee-Cougan-Crossfire-Trail-lightweight-120mm-carbon-XC-cross-country-marathon-mountain-bike_Bike-Connection-Agency-photo-by-Rupert-Fowler_climbing-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo MTBCA/Rupert Fowler)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p> It climbs like proper lightweight XC bike with a nice forward position.
