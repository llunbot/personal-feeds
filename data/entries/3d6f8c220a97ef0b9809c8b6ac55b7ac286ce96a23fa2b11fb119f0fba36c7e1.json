{"title":"Surgeons Are Wearing Vision Pro to Perform Laparoscopic Procedures","link":"https://time.com/7093536/surgeons-apple-vision-pro/","date":1729876349000,"content":"\n<p>Andrew R. Chow, reporting for Time:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Twenty-four years ago, the surgeon Santiago Horgan performed the\n<a href=\"http://archive.news.uic.edu/releases-2000/robotsurgery_release.html\">first robotically assisted gastric-bypass</a> surgery in the\nworld, a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10890254/#:~:text=Robotic%20surgery%2C%20while%20requiring%20more,for%20conversion%20to%20open%20surgery.\">major</a> medical breakthrough. Now Horgan is working\nwith a new tool that he argues could be even more transformative\nin operating rooms: the Apple Vision Pro.</p>\n\n<p>Over the last month, Horgan and other surgeons at the University\nof California, San Diego have performed more than 20 minimally\ninvasive operations while wearing Apple’s mixed-reality headsets.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The details of this particular use case are largely about ergonomics, and the advantage Vision Pro provides seems profound:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In laparoscopic surgery, doctors send a tiny camera through a\nsmall incision in a patient’s body, and the camera’s view is\nprojected onto a monitor. Doctors must then operate on a patient\nwhile looking up at the screen, a tricky feat of hand-eye\ncoordination, while processing other visual variables in a\npressurized environment. “I’m usually turning around and stopping\nthe operation to see a CT scan; looking to see what happened with\nthe endoscopy [another small camera that provides a closer look at\norgans]; looking at the monitor for the heart rate,” Horgan says.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, most surgeons report experiencing discomfort while\nperforming minimal-access surgery, a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9606063/\">2022 study found</a>.\nAbout one-fifth of surgeons polled said they would consider\nretiring early because their pain was so frequent and\nuncomfortable. A good mixed-reality headset, then, might allow a\nsurgeon to look at a patient’s surgical area and, without looking\nup, virtual screens that show them the laparoscopy camera and a\npatient’s vitals.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>20 percent of surgeons saying they’re considering retiring early because of the discomfort from this is a high number! And the $3,500–4,000 price for Vision Pro isn’t merely acceptable in this context, it’s a downright bargain:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Christopher Longhurst, chief clinical and innovation officer at UC\nSan Diego Health, says that while the Vision Pro’s price tag of\n$3,499 might seem daunting to a regular consumer, it’s inexpensive\ncompared to most medical equipment. “The monitors in the operating\nroom are probably $20,000 to $30,000, ” he says. “So $3,500 for a\nheadset is like budget dust in the healthcare setting.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Makes me wonder if these high-end professional and industrial use cases are to the Vision platform this decade what desktop publishing was to the Mac in the 80s? Years ahead of mass market appeal, but a revolutionary breakthrough for a longstanding industry. Such a clear value to those in the industry that they’re not just merely ambivalently accepting the new platform, but champing at the bit to switch to them. Something for the platform to build from until boom, there’s a tipping point where it expands into the mass market. I got into graphic design and desktop publishing my sophomore year of college, in 1992, and by that time the industries of graphic design and professional printing were entirely Macintosh-based, yet the platform (counting the LaserWriter) was only 6 or 7 years old.</p>\n\n<p>But in the fall of 1984, the Macintosh was considered a flop.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/25/vision-pro-surgeons\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"3d6f8c220a97ef0b9809c8b6ac55b7ac286ce96a23fa2b11fb119f0fba36c7e1","category":"Tech"}
