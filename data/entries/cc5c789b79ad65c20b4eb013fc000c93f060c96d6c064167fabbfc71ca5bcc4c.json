The Air 13's speakers are good; the Air 15's are stupendous. Bass came through in a way it doesn't on pretty much any other computer; I was so stunned when I first turned on a bass-heavy song that I thought it must've been coming from a Bluetooth speaker somewhere else.</blockquote><a href=\"https://www.thestreet.com/deals/apple-15-inch-macbook-air-m2-review\"><em>TheStreet</em>'s Jacob Krol</a> said the 15-inch MacBook Air offers considerable value:<blockquote>At its core, the 15-inch MacBook Air is an impressively robust, ultra-portable laptop and a crazily thin one at just 11.5-millimeters. When you consider the price point, though, the $1,299 starting MSRP significantly undercuts the 14-inch MacBook Pro with M2 Pro by $700 and doesn't compromise a ton on performance.</blockquote><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/12/apple-15-inch-m2-macbook-air-review/\"><em>TechCrunch</em>'s Brian Heater</a> said he managed 19 hours of video playback on a single charge:<blockquote>The battery is rated at 18 hours – same as the 13-inch. In TechCrunch's testing, we got around 19 hours of video playback. While the screen is larger and therefore draws more power, that’s counteracted by an enlarged footprint, creating more space for battery.</blockquote><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/12/apple-macbook-air-15-inch-wins-on-battery-life-portability-price.html\"><em>CNBC</em>'s Kif Leswing</a> said the 15-inch MacBook Air \"hits the sweet spot for most people in terms of price, capability, and portability.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/06/15-inch-macbook-air-review-sometimes-bigger-is-better/\"><em>Six Colors</em>' Jason Snell</a> said the 15-inch MacBook Air fills a void:<blockquote>If you've hesitated to consider buying a MacBook Air because its screens always seemed a bit too cramped, you now have another option. If you've always wanted a bigger display but didn't want to pay more than $1000 for the privilege, your time is now.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis laptop has literally everything that made the M2 MacBook Air great. It's just bigger. Sometimes, bigger is better.</blockquote><h3>Video Reviews</h3>\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\n<div></div><div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">13\" MacBook Air (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/review/15-inch-macbook-air/\">15-Inch MacBook Air Reviews: The Sweet Spot for Performance, Size, and Value</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/15-inch-macbook-air-reviews-the-sweet-spot-for-performance-size-and-value.2392635/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"cc5c789b79ad65c20b4eb013fc000c93f060c96d6c064167fabbfc71ca5bcc4c","category":"Apple"}
