That's especially true in America, where bigger is always better and the vehicles in the current crop of \"compact\" crossovers are now nearly as large as full-size SUVs from a decade ago. <span>Don’t ask about curb weights, either, as more powerful drivetrains, including widespread adoption of hybrid-electric components, add significant mass, as highlighted by </span><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/03/the-2025-bmw-m5-touring-review-way-more-power-way-too-much-weight/\" target=\"_blank\">the new BMW M5 \"sport sedan.\"</a><span> </span></p>\n<p>Within that fray, however, the new Volkswagen Tiguan stands apart. VW purposefully refined the third-gen Tiguan to cater better to American consumer needs, which meant dropping the third row to create more interior volume for the front and rear seats. The wheelbase still measures the same length at 109.9 inches (2,791 mm), but shorter overhangs mean the overall length actually shrinks by nearly two inches. Yet more efficient packaging on the inside also results in a marginal passenger volume increase of about two percent.</p>\n<p>To help keep pricing attractive at below $30,000 to start, VW also decided to skip out on a hybrid variant, but the new EA888evo5 2.0 L turbocharged-four nonetheless delivers more power and improved fuel economy. And all of the above actually contributes to the Tiguan losing weight while evolving from the second to third generation, shaving about 160 lbs (72.5 kg), depending on trim.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/the-2025-vw-tiguan-caters-to-us-tastes-at-an-affordable-price/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/the-2025-vw-tiguan-caters-to-us-tastes-at-an-affordable-price/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Michael Teo Van Runkle","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"cce4eff6f9b006dc7aa85e2273a8ce69e9285e1124fae360e9093bc3fbdb584b","category":"Tech"}
