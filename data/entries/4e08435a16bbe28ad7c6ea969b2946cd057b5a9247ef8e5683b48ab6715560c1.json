Videos are essentially turned into searchable transcripts with specific words and phrases able to be matched for quicker video editing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAutomatic Tone Mapping and log color detection functionality lets editors mix and match HDR footage from different sources into the same SDR project without the need to use LUTs or manually balance footage to get consistent color.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOther new features include Sequence Locking for collaborative editing, presence indicators to see who is online, and Work While Offline to allow editors to work on collaborative projects offline and later publish changes without overwriting others' work.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs for After Effects, there's a new Properties Panel that provides quicker access to key animation settings. The panel is context-sensitive, and will automatically show users the most important controls based on selections. Adobe has also included performance optimizations such as a faster timeline layer selection and multi-frame rendering of shapes, along with new keyboard shortcuts for Selectable Track Mattes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe latest versions of Premiere Pro and After effects, including beta versions of the Text-Based Editing and Automatic Tone Mapping, will be available starting in May 2023.
