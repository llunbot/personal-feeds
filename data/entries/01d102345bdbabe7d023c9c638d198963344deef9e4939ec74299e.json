As we <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/02/starlink-verizon-and-t-mobile-made-shaky-claims-on-fcc-coverage-map/\">previously reported</a>, SpaceX removed some homes from the FCC database when residents filed challenges because they were unable to order Starlink at addresses listed as served on the FCC map.</p>\n<p>SpaceX tried to clear up the confusion in an <a href=\"https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/1030190139433/1\">FCC filing</a> last week. The company says it followed FCC rules when submitting data and blamed the FCC system for not allowing it to report data more precisely. Under the map system rules, SpaceX argues that it is allowed to report an address as \"served\" even if the resident can only order Starlink's RV service.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1922701#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1922701&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"23e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"01d102345bdbabe7d023c9c638d198963344deef9e4939ec74299e","category":"Tech"}
