The label of \"super\" or \"ultra\" telephoto is usually afforded to cameras with a focal length over 300mm, drastically magnifying and pulling in distant subjects. The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a> Pro and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14-pro/\">iPhone 14 Pro</a> models' telephoto camera has a focal length of equivalent to 77mm, so a focal length in excess of 300mm on the ‌iPhone 16‌ Pro Max would be a very large increase.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSuper telephoto cameras are often used for sports and wild animal photography, but the extremely soft backgrounds they create also make them useful for portrait photography, providing there is enough distance between the subject and the photographer.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe change is seemingly facilitated by Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/14/periscope-lens-iphone-15-pro-max-kuo/\">upgrade to a periscope telephoto camera</a> system, starting with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max later this year. With next year's ‌iPhone 16‌ Pro models, Apple is reportedly planning to bring the telephoto camera to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/16/iphone-16-pro-models-larger-periscope/\">both of the \"Pro\" models</a>, apparently <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/28/gurman-corroborates-iphone-16-pro-size-increase/\">enabled</a> by increasing the smaller model's size. As such, giving the ‌iPhone 16‌ Pro Max a super telephoto periscope would enable Apple to maintain differentiation between the two \"Pro\" devices next year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Weibo user also reiterated their previous claim that the ‌iPhone 16‌ Pro Max will feature a 12% larger camera sensor that is 1/1.14-inches in size. The ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ and ‌iPhone 14 Pro‌ Max currently feature a 1/1.28-inch sensor and no sensor size increase is expected for this year's ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ Max. A larger sensor could improve the main <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> camera's dynamic range and background blur. It could also substantially enhance low-light photography capabilities since a bigger surface area can capture more light with the same shutter speed and aperture. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn their latest post on the matter, the Weibo user did not explicitly state which devices the rumor relates to in the ‌iPhone 16‌ lineup, it is believed to relate specifically to the ‌iPhone 16‌ Pro Max due to their previous remarks. The same user shared <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/28/iphone-16-pro-size-increase-camera-upgrades/\">similar camera information</a> earlier this year, claiming that they had obtained industry insider information.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/digital-chat-station/\">Digital Chat Station</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/18/iphone-16-pro-max-super-telephoto-camera/\">iPhone 16 Pro Max Rumored to Feature Super Telephoto Camera</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-pro-max-rumored-to-feature-super-telephoto-camera.2396226/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c33f66bb77f3928508b47ddde4f13a3d3e47c96f05a4c812337d5ff3c8641eee","category":"Apple"}
