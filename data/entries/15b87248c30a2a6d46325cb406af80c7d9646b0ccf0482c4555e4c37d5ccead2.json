While users still post there,\nfor many it has become something of a second-tier platform — a place\nthat they dump content out of habit, not because they’re having\nreal conversations or finding meaningful engagement.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://birchtree.me/blog/meta-has-squandered-threads/\">Matt Birchler</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I believe Meta that there are hundreds of millions of people\nsigning on every month, but they seem to be doing absolutely\nnothing there. More interesting stuff is on Bluesky and Mastodon,\nand better conversation happens on those platforms as well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I feel the same way. Threads has dropped to a decided #3 for me after Mastodon and Bluesky, and (a) I don’t really have room in my head or time in my day for 3 of these platforms, and (b) I’m more than OK with Meta’s entry falling by the wayside.</p>\n\n<p>Like, if the answer at the moment for Twitter-style social media is Bluesky (general audience) and Mastodon (nerds), that’s ... the best outcome? Even X (chaos and Musk sycophancy) seems to have a better, more defined vision for what it’s supposed to be than Threads.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/25/threads-is-losing-to-bluesky\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"15b87248c30a2a6d46325cb406af80c7d9646b0ccf0482c4555e4c37d5ccead2","category":"Tech"}
