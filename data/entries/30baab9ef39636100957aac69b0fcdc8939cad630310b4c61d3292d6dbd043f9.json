{"title":"9to5Mac: ‘Apple Elaborates on iOS 17.5 Bug That Resurfaced Deleted Photos’","link":"https://9to5mac.com/2024/05/23/apple-deleted-photos-resurfacing-explanation/","date":1716591738000,"content":"\n<p>Chance Miller, reporting for 9to5Mac:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Earlier this week, Apple <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2024/05/20/apple-releases-ios-17-5-1-with-fix-for-bug-that-caused-deleted-photos-to-return/\">released iOS 17.5.1 to address</a> a\nrare problem where deleted photos would <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2024/05/17/ios-17-5-deleted-photos-app-bug/\">reappear on a user’s\ndevice</a> after installing iOS 17.5. In the release notes,\nApple said this was caused by “database corruption.” The company\nhas now confirmed a few additional details to 9to5Mac to further\nclarify the situation.</p>\n\n<p>One question many people had is how images from dates as far back\nas 2010 resurfaced because of this problem. After all, most people\naren’t still using the same devices now as they were in 2010.\nApple confirmed to me that iCloud Photos is not to be blamed for\nthis. Instead, it all boils to the corrupt database entry that\nexisted on the device’s file system itself.</p>\n\n<p>According to Apple, the photos that did not fully delete from a\nuser’s device were not synced to iCloud Photos. Those files were\nonly on the device itself. However, the files could have persisted\nfrom one device to another when restoring from a backup,\nperforming a device-to-device transfer, or when restoring from an\niCloud Backup but not using iCloud Photos.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/05/24/ios-17-5-photos-bug\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"30baab9ef39636100957aac69b0fcdc8939cad630310b4c61d3292d6dbd043f9","category":"Tech"}
