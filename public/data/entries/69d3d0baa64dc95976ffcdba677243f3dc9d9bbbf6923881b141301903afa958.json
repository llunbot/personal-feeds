{"title":"CPAC Speaker Michael Knowles Calls for Transgender People to Be ‘Eradicated From Public Life Entirely’","link":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/cpac-speaker-transgender-people-eradicated-1234690924/","date":1678131804000,"content":"\n<p>Peter Wade and Patrick Reis, reporting for Rolling Stone:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The right’s war on queer and trans people took center stage at the\nConservative Political Action Conference as Daily Wire host\nMichael Knowles on Saturday called for the eradication of\n“transgenderism.”</p>\n\n<p>During his speech on Saturday, Knowles told the crowd, “For the\ngood of society … transgenderism must be eradicated from public\nlife entirely — the whole preposterous ideology, at every level.”</p>\n\n<p>Knowles subsequently claimed that “eradicating”\n“transgenderism” is not a call for eradicating transgender\npeople <a href=\"https://twitter.com/michaeljknowles/status/1632168780628471813\">and demanded retractions from numerous\npublications</a>, including Rolling Stone.</p>\n\n<p>Erin Reed, a transgender rights activist and writer, tells Rolling\nStone that it’s an absurd distinction. There is no difference\nbetween a ban on “transgenderism” and an attack on transgender\npeople, she says: “They are one and the same, and there’s no\nseparation between them.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The tweet linked above is from Knowles, pointing to an earlier version of the same Rolling Stone story, and reads, “This headline is libelous, and I demand a retraction.”</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/KeithOlbermann/status/1632180157170561029\">Keith Olbermann, in a reply to Knowles’s tweet</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You should get the fuck off the stage and apologize, asshole. This\nstatement is your life from here on in.</p>\n\n<p>Shove your hatred and bias and Nazi dreams up your ass,\nMotherfucker.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Olbermann took the words right out of my mouth. It’s sophistry to argue that transgender<em>ism</em> can be “eradicated from public life entirely” without eradicating transgender people. <a href=\"http://www.outsmartmagazine.com/2012/11/illuminating-the-darkness/\"><em>Eradicate</em> is a Nazi word</a> — one step away from <em>exterminate</em> — and <em>totally</em> means completely, absolutely, entirely. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RightWingWatch/status/1632057198577606657\">Watch the video</a>. This is Nazism, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKICKcMU3MU\">the only proper response to Nazis is to punch them</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/06/cpan-knowles-nazi\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"69d3d0baa64dc95976ffcdba677243f3dc9d9bbbf6923881b141301903afa958","category":"Tech"}
