The system is compatible with any 8-12-speed bicycle, as well as fully compatible with other gear in the Zwift ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>So, What is Zwift Cog and Click?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The virtual shifting system is designed to “simplify and elevate your Zwift experience.” When you use the Zwift Cog and Click upgrade, the Cog replaces your existing cassette – no more swapping your cassette from your bike to your trainer, or purchasing an additional cassette <em>just</em> for the trainer. The Cog is compatible with any 8-12-speed and offers optimal chain alignment, so it also makes it easier to mount bikes with different drivetrains to the same trainer. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Zwift-Cog-and-Click-Upgrade-Kit-click-jpeg-e1734114622795.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"460\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Zwift-Cog-and-Click-Upgrade-Kit-click-jpeg-e1734114622795.webp\" alt=\"Zwift Cog and Click Upgrade Kit click\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Zwift-Cog-and-Click-Upgrade-Kit-click-jpeg-e1734114622795.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Zwift-Cog-and-Click-Upgrade-Kit-click-jpeg-e1734114622795-297x107.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Zwift-Cog-and-Click-Upgrade-Kit-click-jpeg-e1734114622795-120x43.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Zwift-Cog-and-Click-Upgrade-Kit-click-jpeg-e1734114622795-768x276.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Cog is paired with the wireless Zwift Click controller and can be mounted anywhere on your current setup. The system gives you the instant ability to run a wide range of 24 virtual gears.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why Upgrade? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Access to virtual shifting can change the way you interact with your trainer. When you eliminate physical gear changes, you eliminate drivetrain wear. You will have a smoother, quieter experience while enjoying uninterrupted resistance transitions. This means more immersive Zwift sessions that will allow you to focus on your ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Zwift-Cog-and-Click-Upgrade-Kit-flt-bar-mount-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Zwift-Cog-and-Click-Upgrade-Kit-flt-bar-mount-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Zwift Cog and Click Upgrade Kit flt bar mount\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Zwift-Cog-and-Click-Upgrade-Kit-flt-bar-mount-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Zwift-Cog-and-Click-Upgrade-Kit-flt-bar-mount-297x297.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Zwift-Cog-and-Click-Upgrade-Kit-flt-bar-mount-120x120.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Zwift-Cog-and-Click-Upgrade-Kit-flt-bar-mount-768x768.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, upgrading to the Zwift Cog and Click system will make your trainer compatible with the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/zwift-ride-smart-bike-hsa-eligible-truemed/\" target=\"_blank\">Zwift Ride Smart Frame</a>.
