Like I said, you’ll have \nto move your palm closer and further to your chest to select the \nright cards to enter your passcode. It’s a bit like dialing a \nrotary phone, with cards for individual digits from 0 to 9. Go \nfurther away to get to the higher numbers and the backspace \nbutton, and come back for the smaller ones. </p>\n\n<p>This gesture is smart in theory but it’s very sensitive. There’s a \nvery small range of usable space since there is only so far your \nhand can go, so the distance between each digit is fairly small. \nOne wrong move and you’ll accidentally select something you didn’t \nwant and have to go all the way out to delete it. To top it all \noff, moving my arm around while doing that causes the Pin to flop \nabout, meaning the screen shakes on my palm, too. On average, \nunlocking my Pin, which involves entering a four-digit passcode, \ntook me about five seconds. </p>\n\n<p>On its own, this doesn’t sound so bad, but bear in mind that \nyou’ll have to re-enter this each time you disconnect the Pin from \nthe booster, latch or clip. It’s currently springtime in New York, \nwhich means I’m putting on and taking off my jacket over and over \nagain. Every time I go inside or out, I move the Pin to a \ndifferent layer and have to look like a confused long-sighted \ntourist reading my palm at various distances. It’s not fun. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One thing all the reviewers seem to agree upon is that the AI Pin feels like an impressive piece of kit: small, lightweight, sturdy, well-made. And it packs a lot into a small form factor: camera, laser projector, speaker/microphone. But it’s also seemingly bursting at the seams, battery-life and heat-dissipation-wise. So I get it, me suggesting they should have added something else to the hardware — anything else — would pose a design and engineering challenge.</p>\n\n<p>But with that throat-clearing out of the way: it seems obvious that the AI Pin should have a fingerprint scanner for authentication. You have to touch it for all interactions anyway — it doesn’t listen for a trigger word — so why <em>not</em> add the equivalent of Touch ID? Every single review notes the same thing Low complains about above: authenticating with your passcode takes too long, is error-prone, and you need to do it periodically throughout the day.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/12/low-humane-pin\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"2c6a43e1f6cb6532ad397ce91b87c19806c0e6251ca75077241e4d2d2abee08c","category":"Tech"}
