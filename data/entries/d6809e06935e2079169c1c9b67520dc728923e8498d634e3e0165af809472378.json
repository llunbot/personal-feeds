You can have multiple email addresses associated with your Apple ID, but only one <em>primary</em> address—the core address you’ll use to log in and to which important Apple Account-related emails would be delivered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It used to be a pain to change this, involving a multi-step process that you can only do on the web. With iOS 18.1, Apple has made it a lot easier to change your primary Apple ID address, and you can do it right from your iPhone or iPad. (The web still works, too.) Here’s how you do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Change your Apple Account primary email on your iPhone or iPad</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>First, ensure your devices are running iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, or a later version.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Open Settings, then tap your name at the top to access your Apple account settings</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap <em>Sign-In &amp; Security</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap the email address marked “Primary email”</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Turn off the <em>Primary Email</em> switch to remove this as your main email. You’ll be prompted to select a new primary email address, either from another email associated with your Apple Account or by adding a new one</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Follow the onscreen steps to enter and verify your new primary email address</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a third-party email address (not an @icloud.com or @me.com address) associated with your Apple Account and you want to remove it, just select it and tap <em>Remove from Account</em>. If it’s your Primary address you’ll be prompted to choose or create a new primary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Apple-supplied email address (@icloud.com or @me.com) you’ll instead see an option to <em>Change Email Address</em>, which lets you pick a different email address but not remove it from your account.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Change your Apple Account primary email on the web</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don’t have an iPhone or iPad (you only use a Mac, or maybe an Apple TV or something) you can change your primary email on the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Go to <a href=\"https://account.apple.com/\">account.apple.com</a> and sign in</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Select <em>Sign-In and Security</em> on the left menu, and then <em>Email &amp; Phone Numbers</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click the Remove button (-) next to your primary email</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Follow the onscreen steps to enter and verify your new primary email address</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"d6809e06935e2079169c1c9b67520dc728923e8498d634e3e0165af809472378","category":"Apple"}
