This is accomplished by getting rid of the aluminum cup traditionally used to hold the bearing. Instead, Maxhit products use a high-grade 440C stainless steel cup that is machined to house the ball bearings directly, eliminating redundancy and providing more room for bigger balls. According to Enduro, “Maxhit balls have eight times the volume of standard bearings to dramatically improve spinning characteristics and durability.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our personal experience with the Maxhit seems to confirm Enduro’s claims. I installed one of their Maxhit BSA bottom brackets for a friend who was chewing through bottom brackets on his fat bike. Nearly a year later, the Maxhit BB is as smooth as the day we installed it, already outlasting his originals. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Enduro-Maxhit_T47_Asymetric.jpeg\"><img width=\"640\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Enduro-Maxhit_T47_Asymetric.jpeg\" alt=\"Enduro Maxhit_T47_Asymetric\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Enduro-Maxhit_T47_Asymetric.jpeg 640w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Enduro-Maxhit_T47_Asymetric-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Enduro-Maxhit_T47_Asymetric-120x80.jpeg 120w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Enduro-Maxhit_T47_External.jpeg\"><img width=\"640\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Enduro-Maxhit_T47_External.jpeg\" alt=\"Enduro Maxhit_T47_External\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Enduro-Maxhit_T47_External.jpeg 640w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Enduro-Maxhit_T47_External-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Enduro-Maxhit_T47_External-120x80.jpeg 120w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Enduro-Maxhit_T47_Internal.jpeg\"><img width=\"640\" height=\"427\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Enduro-Maxhit_T47_Internal.jpeg\" alt=\"Enduro Maxhit_T47_Internal\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Enduro-Maxhit_T47_Internal.jpeg 640w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Enduro-Maxhit_T47_Internal-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Enduro-Maxhit_T47_Internal-120x80.jpeg 120w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021, Enduro added the technology to <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/enduro-maxhit-bb-may-boost-bsa30-durability-plus-new-shimano-grx-pulleys-tools/\" target=\"_blank\">select bottom bracket standards</a>. Now, that same tech is making its way to T47 bottom brackets with nine different permutations. Those nine options include three frame configurations for Internal, External, and Asymmetric bottom bracket shells. Then, each of those three configurations has bearings options for three spindle sizes with 24mm (Shimano), DUB (SRAM), and 30mm. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The T47 bottom bracket standard was already supposed to offer larger bearings with better durability, so with the addition of a Maxhit bearing, these should be nearly indestructible. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Models:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Maxhit, External T47 BB for 24mm, DUB, and 30mm spindles. SRP: $179</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Maxhit Internal T47 BB for 24mm, DUB, and 30mm spindles. SPR: $179</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Maxhit Asymmetric T47 BB for 24mm, DUB, and 30mm spindles. SRP: $179</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Each option will sell for $179, and include a lifetime warranty including against corrosion. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Details:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Lifetime warranty, including against corrosion</li>\n\n\n\n<li>80% fill with high-pressure, waterproof grease</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Proprietary double-lip labyrinth seals</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Include a spare set of seals should one get damaged during annual service</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The new T47 Maxhit bottom brackets will be available in March 2024. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://cycling.endurobearings.com\" target=\"_blank\">endurobearings.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/enduro-bearing-t47-maxhit-bottom-bracket/\">T47 Bottom Brackets Get The Maxhit Treatment, Enduro Adds 9 New BB Options</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"2335f1bab24a024de0c5daba2df98c13c8145bcb3a6dfb4b2f78ae8e623e5608","category":"Cycling"}
