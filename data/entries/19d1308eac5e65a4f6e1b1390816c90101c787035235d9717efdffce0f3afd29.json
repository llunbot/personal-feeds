Just a few weeks after launching their updated <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/2024-new-look-keo-blade-road-pedal/\">Keo Blade carbon sprung pedal</a>, LOOK introduces new mountain and road power meter options. Both pedals feature a q-factor and stack height similar to the power-free versions of these pedals. The new power pedals also boast plug-and-play installation and a fairly lightweight build. Plus – they are manufactured in France by LOOK.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/look-road-power-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/look-road-power--800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"look road power\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/look-road-power--800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/look-road-power--297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/look-road-power--120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/look-road-power--768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/look-road-power--1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/look-road-power--720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/look-road-power-.jpeg 2000w\" /></a><figcaption>(All photos: LOOK)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is it — LOOK Power Pedals.  </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The new LOOK power pedals add a power meter to popular Keo Blade and X-Track off-road pedals.

The weight is around the same as the <a href=\"https://www.lookcycle.com/fr-fr/produits/pedales/vtt/cross-country/x-track-race-carbon\">LOOK X-Track Carbon Race </a>(400g with shims) but with more contact surface. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Look-Power-X-Track-pedals.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Look-Power-X-Track-pedals-800x534.jpeg\" alt=\"Look Power X Track pedals\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Look-Power-X-Track-pedals-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Look-Power-X-Track-pedals-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Look-Power-X-Track-pedals-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Look-Power-X-Track-pedals-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Look-Power-X-Track-pedals-1536x1025.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Look-Power-X-Track-pedals-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Look-Power-X-Track-pedals.jpeg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>LOOK claims the new X-Track Power offers the best power-to-weight ratio on the market, and the numbers sound promising.

LOOK will offer an extended warranty and a graduated three-year crash replacement program for registered products.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Look-Power-pedals-keo-dual-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Look-Power-pedals-keo-dual--800x400.jpeg\" alt=\"Look Power pedals keo dual\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Look-Power-pedals-keo-dual--800x400.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Look-Power-pedals-keo-dual--297x149.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Look-Power-pedals-keo-dual--120x60.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Look-Power-pedals-keo-dual--768x384.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Look-Power-pedals-keo-dual--1536x768.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Look-Power-pedals-keo-dual-.jpeg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Choose Your Power </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Keo Blade Power and X-Track Power are available in either single or dual power reading. For those into power analysis, the pedals offer total power, cadence, left/right balance, and pretty much everything you’re accustomed to for output. The single power measurement option offers a left-side power sensor, estimating total power output by doubling the left-side measurement at a more economical price.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Look-Power-X-Track-with-cleats-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Look-Power-X-Track-with-cleats--800x800.jpeg\" alt=\"Look Power X Track with cleats\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Look-Power-X-Track-with-cleats--800x800.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Look-Power-X-Track-with-cleats--297x297.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Look-Power-X-Track-with-cleats--120x120.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Look-Power-X-Track-with-cleats--768x768.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Look-Power-X-Track-with-cleats--1536x1536.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Look-Power-X-Track-with-cleats-.jpeg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The LOOK Research &amp; Development team has developed a proprietary auto-calibration algorithm to introduce a quick and easy set-up of the pedals, installing them in 30 seconds (give or take) with a 15mm standard pedal wrench. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Look-Power-X-Track-single-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"756\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Look-Power-X-Track-single--800x756.jpeg\" alt=\"Look Power X Track single\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Look-Power-X-Track-single--800x756.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Look-Power-X-Track-single--297x281.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Look-Power-X-Track-single--120x113.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Look-Power-X-Track-single--768x726.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Look-Power-X-Track-single--1536x1452.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Look-Power-X-Track-single-.jpeg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Standard Q-Factor </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The most significant pain for me when using power meter pedals (I’ve only used a few, but they all have a common thread) is the stack height, which is very tall. If that isn’t it, the stance width is off. I’m picky, but a few millimeters here and there can add up to a bad day from a saddle sore. LOOK claims both new pedal designs share the non-power versions’ Q Factor and stack height. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bluetooth and ANT+</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new LOOK Power pedals offer Bluetooth and ANT+ compatibility. Offering both allows the pedals to better connect to the LOOK (and other) Apps and data synchronization, </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Look-Power-X-Track-on-bike-.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Look-Power-X-Track-on-bike--800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Look Power X Track on bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Look-Power-X-Track-on-bike--800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Look-Power-X-Track-on-bike--297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Look-Power-X-Track-on-bike--120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Look-Power-X-Track-on-bike--768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Look-Power-X-Track-on-bike--1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Look-Power-X-Track-on-bike--720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Look-Power-X-Track-on-bike-.jpeg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>All New LOOK App</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Like all power meter manufacturers, the new LOOK pedals will connect and be diagnosable through an app. The all-new LOOK App will offer riders a complete breakdown of statistics, including normalized power, intensity factor, power zones, training stress score, functional threshold power, pedaling smoothness, and torque effectiveness. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t be scared if you’re new to installing pedals or don’t wrench on your bike.
