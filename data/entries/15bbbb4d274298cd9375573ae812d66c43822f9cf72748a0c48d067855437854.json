Here, in our best Mac for students guide, we take a look at Apple’s current line-up to evaluate which Mac is best for students. We’ll compare the MacBook Air vs MacBook Pro for college and examine whether another Mac might actually be a better choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Choosing the best Mac for college or university depends on what you are going to be studying as well as how much you have to spend. Luckily registered students can save money on a new Mac by shopping at Apple’s Education Store, or with one of Apple’s partners. We discuss <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670705/how-to-get-an-apple-student-discount-at-apples-education-store.html\">How to get an Apple student discount at Apple’s Education Store</a> separately, although we also talk about the different ways you can save money as a student below.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can save hundreds on a MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, iMac, Mac mini, Mac Studio and even a Mac Pro at Apple’s Education Store all year round.

The model we are recommending here is not the cheapest MacBook Air, but it offers the best value for money and the price difference between this and the older M1 model is so small that it is one of those cases where spending a little more gets you a lot more. This is even more true since Apple reduced the price of this June 2022 MacBook Air in June 2023. </p>\n\n<p>This MacBook Air offers 18 hours of battery life, according to Apple. This is less than the 13-inch MacBook Pro’s 20 hours, but it is bound to be more than enough to get you through a day and an all-nighter at university.</p>\n\n<p>There are no USB-A ports on the MacBook Air or MacBook Pro, just two USB-C and a headphone jack. However, the M2 MacBook Air does offer a MagSafe port (which isn’t found on the cheaper M1-powered MacBook Air) so you can charge your laptop and still have two USB ports free. </p>\n\n<p>You may feel that you need more storage than the entry-level model offers (in which case the MacBook Air will cost a little more). There are benefits to choosing the 512GB version, in fact, we’ve found that Apple’s smaller SSDs aren’t as fast as the larger ones, but the speed of the SSD is likely to only matter if the kind of apps you are using access the SSD frequently, which is unlikely if you are just typing essays or researching on the internet. Rather than fork out for extra storage built-in you may find external storage, or even iCloud storage, works out cheaper. (If you have a big Music library, for example, pay for iTunes Match so you can keep your music in the cloud. If you have a big photo library turn on iCloud Photos and get additional <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672409/how-much-does-icloud-cost.html\">iCloud storage</a>).</p>\n\n<p><strong>How much can students save on the 13-inch MacBook Air, M2? </strong></p>\n\n<p>MSRP: $1,099 / £1,149 / AU$1,799 / CA$1,449<br />Student: $999 / £1,049 / AU$1,649 / CA$1,299</p>\n\n<p><em>Students save: $100 / £100 / AU$150 / CA$150</em></p>\n\n<p>You’ll see the best prices right now in the block above, which may be even better than Apple’s education pricing. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/807892/m2-macbook-air-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tApple 13-inch MacBook Air (M2, 2022) review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2.

It’s furnished with the M3 chip, which is a generation ahead of the M2 chip in the MacBook Air, but when the MacBook Air is refreshed with the same chip the difference will be less tangible. </p>\n\n<p>There is still a reason to buy the MacBook Pro rather than the MacBook Air though and that’s basically if the MacBook Air won’t be powerful enough for your needs. The thing about the MacBook Air is that it lacks a fan, which means that if you really push it then the Mac might slow down to avoid overheating. For this reason, if you want to use your Mac for heavy processing then you might be better off with a MacBook Pro. In which case, if you have the budget, you might actually want to consider the M3 Pro option (discussed next).  </p>\n\n<p>One other benefit the MacBook Pro is the wider selection of ports than on the MacBook Air, including HDMI and an SDXC card reader. But if you aren’t doing anything too demanding then the MacBook Air is going to be more than powerful enough for your needs and we’d suggest that you save the money you’d be spending on the MacBook Pro and buy an external display to plug into when you are back in your dorm room, or something equally as useful (like food). </p>\n\n<p><strong>How much can students save on the 14-inch MacBook Pro, M3? </strong></p>\n\n<p>MSRP: $1,599 / £1,699 / AU$2,699 / CA$2,099<br />Student: $1,499 / £1,589 / AU$2,529 / CA$1,969</p>\n\n<p><em>Students save: $100 / £110 / AU$170 / CA$130</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t4.

That’s $100/£150 less than the newer M2 MacBook Air ($999/£1,049 for students).</p>\n\n<p>That’s not a huge saving, so, if it’s all you have to spend, we suggest you shop around a bit before you buy: you may find a discount on the M2 13-inch MacBook Air that beats Apple’s Student discount on the older model. </p>\n\n<p>We recommend spending that extra $100 because the M2 MacBook Air is the better purchase. The M1 MacBook Air, which launched in November 2020, will be three years old before the end of 2023, it doesn’t offer the bigger screen or the superior FaceTime camera of the M2 MacBook Air, and the newer M2-chip is superior to the M1 inside this MacBook Air. The M2 model also benefited from a redesign. </p>\n\n<p>That said, the M1 MacBook Air will be more than adequate for a student, especially those predominantly writing essays and conducting research. </p>\n\n<p>If upgrading to the M2 MacBook Air isn’t possible, this will still be a good purchase that will stand you in good stead for a few years. </p>\n\n<p><strong>How much can students save on the 13-inch MacBook Air, M1? </strong></p>\n\n<p>MSRP: $999 / £999 / AU$1,499 / CA$1,299<br />Student: $899 / £899 /AU$1,349 / CA$1,169</p>\n\n<p><em>Students save: $100 / £100 / AU$150 / CA$1</em>3<em>0</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/667907/macbook-air-vs-imac.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tApple MacBook Air (2020) M1 review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t6.

Or, if you also have an iPad, you might be able to link your iPad to your MacBook and use the iPad screen too (here’s <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671945/how-to-use-an-ipad-as-a-second-monitor.html\">how to use your iPad as a second screen for your Mac</a>). You could also use that iPad for taking notes when you are at lectures (read our guide to the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668914/best-ipad-for-students.html\">best iPad for students</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there are some benefits to buying a Mac desktop. Generally, it is the case that you pay more for a Mac laptop, compared to the same specs on a desktop. The Mac mini, for example, is Apple’s cheapest Mac despite having some pretty impressive specs. However, if you compare the 24-inch iMac with a similarly speced Mac laptop the iMac is considerably more expensive. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iMac vs Mac mini vs Mac Studio for students</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While we appreciate that there are plenty of benefits associated with choosing a laptop for university, you may be better off with a desktop. </p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1.

We weren’t recommending the iMac for students then and we aren’t fully recommending it now. But the iMac does have a few qualities that might appeal to you.  </p>\n\n<p>Thanks to its design it’s certainly a Mac that will make a statement to anyone entering your dorm room. That 24-inch display could also be a great screen for streaming your favorite shows and movies. </p>\n\n<p>The iMac is a non-portable Mac though, which might deter many students from purchasing one. You won’t be able to take it with you to lectures–or cart it home on a train for the holidays–but you will be able to work more efficiently thanks to its 24-inch screen.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How much can students save on the iMac? </strong></p>\n\n<p>MSRP: $1,299 / £1,399 / AU$2,199 / CA$1,699<br />Student discount: $1,249 / £1,349 / AU$2,109 / CA$1,629</p>\n\n<p><em>Students save: $50 / £210 / AU$330 / CA$270</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2126614/24-inch-imac-m3-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tApple 24-inch iMac (M3, 2023) review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<h2>Which Mac should you get for university?</h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3449417/apple_macbook_air_m1_2020_review_65_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"MacBook Air\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Our pick of the entire Mac range, if you’re a student, is the M2 MacBook Air. It will give you a better screen, better webcam and an attractive new design to show off in lectures. It’s light, fast, and with student pricing starting at $999/£999 it’s very good value. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could save by opting for the older M1 MacBook Air, but, if you are looking for the cheapest Mac you can get, the M2 Mac mini is a very good option. It’s powerful and with Apple’s education discount, it’s just $499/£539. You just need a monitor, mouse and keyboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only reason to delay buying is the fact that a new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2000691/13-15-inch-macbook-air-m3-release-date-specs-rumors-html.html\">M3 MacBook Air</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2109165/m3-mac-mini-design-processor-specs-release-rumors.html\">Mac mini</a> may be coming soon.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to get a discount on a Mac for university or school</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can get a student discount at Apple’s education stores, but you have to qualify as a student in higher education, be a teacher, someone buying for an education institution, or a home educator. School-age children can only take advantage if the equipment is being purchased by their school or if their parent is home-educating them. If you are a registered student you’ll be able to get a discount on a new Mac if you shop in Apple’s various Education Stores (below). You can find out all about it in more detail in our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670705/how-to-get-an-apple-student-discount-at-apples-education-store.html\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Education Store explainer</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-670477-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/us-edu/store\" target=\"_blank\">Apple’s U.S. Education Store</a> </li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-670477-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/campaigns/education-pricing\" target=\"_blank\">Apple’s U.K. Education Store</a> (in the UK you will need to verify your student status via UNiDAYS). </li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-670477-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/ca_edu_93120/store\" target=\"_blank\">Apple’s Canada Education Store</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-670477-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/au-hed/store\">Apple’s Australian Education Store</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting a student discount from Apple’s education store isn’t the only way to get a cheaper Mac as a student though. There are various ways to get a bargain:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Look out for reseller discounts</strong>: Another way to get a bargain is to look out for deals at Apple resellers and Amazon, where we have see Macs with as much as $500 off the price. Take a look at our round ups of the best Mac deals to get the best prices right now:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673333/best-macbook-air-deals.html\">Best MacBook Air deals this month</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678533/mac-studio-deals.html\">Best Mac Studio deals available now</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672811/best-macbook-pro-deals.html\">Best MacBook Pro deals this month</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672803/best-imac-deals.html\">Best iMac deals this month</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673695/best-mac-mini-deals.html\">Best Mac mini deals this month</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Buy a refurbished Mac</strong>: Take advantage of <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-670477-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished\" target=\"_blank\">Apple’s refurbished store</a> where the company sells ex-display, returned, and previous-generation Macs at a discount. The benefit of buying refurbished from Apple is that the products are fully checked and come with a one-year warranty. You can also get <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670463/where-to-buy-a-refurbished-macbook-or-mac.html\">a refurbished Mac</a> elsewhere with many resellers offering the same service, but beware that not all refurbished Macs are equal. Usually refurbished means that the Mac is guaranteed to be in full working order, but do check with the reseller. Here’s a guide to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670463/where-to-buy-a-refurbished-macbook-or-mac.html\">how to buy a refurbished Mac.</a> We also look at <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673929/why-you-should-buy-a-refurbished-mac.html\">why you should buy a refurbished Mac.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Buy second hand/used</strong>: One advantage of buying refurbished is that it should be guaranteed to work and you should have no problem returning it if there is a problem. These are reasons why we don’t recommend buying <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678277/why-you-shouldnt-buy-a-second-hand-mac.html\">a second hand Mac</a>. If you do see a deal on a second hand or used Mac just be especially cautious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best Mac bargains are usually on older models, although we do see discounts on current Macs as well. If you see a good discount on an older Mac it’s important to be aware of what the newer models offers so that you know what you are missing out on and can judge whether the deal is as good as it appears to be. For one thing, older Macs are likely to feature Intel processors rather than Apple’s M1, M2, M3 or their variants, which could put you at a disadvantage in the future (and will certainly mean your Mac depreciates in value very quickly). If you are picking an Intel Mac then make sure that it is a relatively recent Intel chip to ensure that Apple will at least support that Mac until the end of your course.
