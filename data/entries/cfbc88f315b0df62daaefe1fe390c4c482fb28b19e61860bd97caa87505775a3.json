{"title":"Find My Gains Option to Share Lost Item Location With an 'Airline or Trusted Person' in iOS 18.2","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/04/find-my-share-lost-item-location/","date":1730748824000,"content":"Apple in iOS 18.2 beta 2 added a new feature to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/\">Find My</a> app, which is designed to allow you to share a lost item's location with a trusted person. Apple says that the feature is meant to help you locate an item through a third-party, like an airline employee. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/ios-18-2-share-item-location.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nIn the ‌Find My‌ app, there's now an option to \"Share Item Location\" and \"Show Contact Info.\" Choosing the Share Item Location option creates a link that allows someone to see the location of a lost item when they open the link. The link can be opened on a non-Apple device, so people without an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> or Mac can help you find something that's lost. ‌Find My‌ links that you share expire after a week and you can see how many people visited the link. Shared links stop working when an item is returned to you or when the link sharing date expires. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nChoosing Show Contact Info lets any phone or tablet connect to a lost item to open a website with more information about it, including the phone number and email address of the person who owns it.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌Find My‌ already allowed you to share an item with a person in your Contacts list, but now it also lets you temporarily provide an item's location to someone else who might be able to help you find it. The new feature for sharing a lost item works with AirTags and other devices that connect to Apple's ‌Find My‌ network.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/04/find-my-share-lost-item-location/\">Find My Gains Option to Share Lost Item Location With an 'Airline or Trusted Person' in iOS 18.2</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/find-my-gains-option-to-share-lost-item-location-with-an-airline-or-trusted-person-in-ios-18-2.2441987/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"cfbc88f315b0df62daaefe1fe390c4c482fb28b19e61860bd97caa87505775a3","category":"Apple"}
