Over the past 18 months, threat actors—mainly backed by the Chinese government—have turned this security paradigm on its head in attacks that exploit previously unknown vulnerabilities in security appliances from the likes of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/01/mass-exploitation-of-ivanti-vpns-is-infecting-networks-around-the-globe/\">Ivanti</a>,<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/11/critical-vulnerability-in-atlassian-confluence-server-is-under-mass-exploitation/\"> Atlassian</a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/10/critical-citrix-bleed-vulnerability-allowing-mfa-bypass-comes-under-mass-exploitation/\">Citrix</a>, and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/06/mass-exploitation-of-critical-moveit-flaw-is-ransacking-orgs-big-and-small/\">Progress</a>. These devices are ideal targets because they sit at the edge of a network, provide a direct pipeline to its most sensitive resources, and interact with virtually all incoming communications.</p>\n<h2>Cisco ASA likely one of several targets</h2>\n<p>On Wednesday, it was Cisco’s turn to warn that its ASA products have received such treatment. Since November, a previously unknown actor tracked as UAT4356 by Cisco and STORM-1849 by Microsoft has been exploiting two zero-days in attacks that go on to install two pieces of never-before-seen malware, researchers with Cisco’s Talos security team <a href=\"https://blog.talosintelligence.com/arcanedoor-new-espionage-focused-campaign-found-targeting-perimeter-network-devices/\">said</a>.
