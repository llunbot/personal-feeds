Someone later <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42936723\">announced WikiTok on Y Combinator’s Hacker\nNews</a>, where it topped the site’s list of daily news items.</p>\n\n<p>“The entire thing is only several hundred lines of code, and\nClaude wrote the vast majority of it,” Gemal told Ars. “AI helped\nme ship really really fast and just capitalize on the initial\nviral tweet asking for Wikipedia with scrolling.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At first I read that as the project taking from noon until 2am to launch, and I was impressed. Then I re-read that and realized it was just 90 minutes. Jiminy. Programming with AI assistance is just gobsmacking.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/12/how-wikitok-was-created\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"fb07bbef0ddaae97b06f5a6af1f02e983f60179453f02797892129257a0dd62c","category":"Tech"}
