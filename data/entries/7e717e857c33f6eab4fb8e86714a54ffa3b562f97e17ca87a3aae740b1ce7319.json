Bassano del Grappa’s bloody history isn’t hidden from view. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just walking around the town you’ll notice the bullet holes from two World Wars that still cover the buildings next to the Ponte Vecchio, and when you look up you’ll see the hulking mass that serves as a reminder of battles past and, if you’re in town for a ride, of suffering to come: Monte Grappa.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/monte-zoncolan-italy-cycling\">Big Ride: The secret road up Monte Zoncolan</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/carnic-alps-cycling\">Big Ride: Borderline crazy in the Carnic Alps</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/monte-civetta-dolomites-cycling\">Big Ride: Monte Civetta in the Dolomites</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>I don’t need the mountain to remind me of what I’ve signed up for. Starting today’s ride at the headquarters of Basso Bikes, just outside of Bassano, I’m told by several members of the team that I’m in for a tough day in the saddle. Perhaps the most telling revelation is that, despite living and working at the foot of one of the world’s most famous climbs, they each only ride up it fewer than a handful of times a year.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-02-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Monte Grappa\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-02-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-02-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-02-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-02-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-02-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-02-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-02.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Monte Grappa is the gateway to both the Alps and the Dolomites, but the land is pretty much all flat until you hit it.</figcaption><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>My ride partner for today is Asja Paladin, a former pro road racer and current Basso employee. Her sister is Canyon-Sram’s Soraya Paladin and her boyfriend is Jacopo Lahbi, the man who during Covid took on all ten road routes up Monte Grappa in one ride – that’s 455km, 16,500m of elevation and 41 hours on the bike. So it’s safe to say I’ve got the perfect guide for my own attempt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our plan is to replicate the ascent of Monte Grappa that will feature in the penultimate stage of this year’s Giro d’Italia, starting from Semonzo at the southern foot of the mountain and returning to Bassano del Grappa where the race will end. The pros will have to do the climb twice on the stage. For us, I’m sure once will be more than enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The easy part</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-03-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Monte Grappa\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-03-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-03-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-03-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-03-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-03-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-03-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-03-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-03.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Ponte degli Alpini, also known as Bassano del Grappa’s Ponte Vecchio, was designed in 1569 but has been destroyed, rebuilt and fixed many times. In the Second World War it was blown up by resistance fighters riding bikes. If you’re here for cycling, make sure to walk across.</figcaption><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The first part of the ride is gentle and flat, giving Asja and I just enough time to get our legs spinning before we reach our first stop after 11km in the cobbled square of Asolo for coffees and <em>cornettos</em>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the Giro comes to town the peloton will head to Semonzo straight down the main road, which isn’t the nicest ride when you don’t have the luxury of closed roads, so Asja takes us slightly off-piste, including a short gravel road and a tight brook-side footpath. I’ll take that over a close pass any day.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-04-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Monte Grappa\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-04-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-04-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-04-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-04-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-04-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-04-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-04.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>San Severo church marks the start of the climb via Semonzo. You’ll see – or hear – the bell tower just before you reach it.</figcaption><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Our next quick stop comes just 10km from Asolo in the town of Possagno, where a brief detour takes us to the Tempio Canoviano, a massive temple on a hill just above the town, though it’s dwarfed by the mountains behind. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s an impressive sight, designed by sculptor Antonio Canova at the beginning of the 19th century and based on Rome’s Pantheon. Apparently Canova paid for most of it himself because he wanted to be buried there after his request to be buried at the Pantheon was turned down.</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>With my culture levels and bidons topped up, thoughts turn to Semonzo. The mountain is staring us down, and the clear day means there are a bunch of paragliders hovering above the road we’ll soon be riding up. It takes about another 10km to get to the right turn that marks the beginning of the climb, and as we arrive the bell in the local church begins to toll rather ominously.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-05-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Monte Grappa\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-05-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-05-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-05-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-05-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-05-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-05-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-05.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Tempio Canoviano features a set of enormous columns at the front that support the roof over the marble floor</figcaption><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>This route up the mountain is 19km long with an average gradient of 8.1%, but I’ve been told it starts hard, has an easier middle section, and ends hard. The first hard part is enclosed by trees and heads upwards steeply via a long set of 16 hairpins. My legs are relatively fresh, so while it’s not easy, I’m not suffering yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to the trees, there isn’t much of a view, but a pair of paragliders who’ve managed to tangle themselves in the branches – and the rescue team trying to help them out – provide a welcome distraction from the increasing burn. The gradient hovers around the 8-9% mark for the first 10km of the climb, and by the time it levels out briefly my legs are throbbing with the effort, so I use the flatter ground as an excuse for a breather and a handful of Haribo.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The relentless mountain</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-06-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Monte Grappa\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-06-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-06-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-06-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-06-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-06-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-06-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-06.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>On the restart I take the opportunity to lower the pace. Asja adapts seamlessly to the slower speed, doing a good job of reining in her natural inclination to sprint off up the slope like a gazelle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The road emerges onto an open green space with rolling hills covered in luscious trees and a large pond to our left. This is Campo Croce, a popular spot to stop for hikers, gliders, mountain bikers and any other tourists who find themselves on the mountain. For me, however, it’s <em>crampo</em> Croce – as the road starts to tilt upwards again I can feel the tell-tale tightening in the back of my thigh. It’s not great timing, but I’ve got no choice but to fight on.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-07-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Monte Grappa\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-07-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-07-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-07-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-07-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-07-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-07-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-07-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-07.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>The end of the hardest section hides the remaining climb from view until you pass the house on the left. It’s probably for the best</figcaption><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The climb just keeps getting steeper, flirting with the mid-teens, and for some reason I’ve convinced myself it can’t last long. But it can. It goes on and on and on and on, to the point that I decide to slow it down further with some weaving back and forth across the road. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We emerge onto another open section on the edge of farmland that looks gently rolling, but the gradient remains unrelenting. It’s hard to get a sense of the height we’ve gained as we have lost the views down to the valley and are now surrounded by the sea of greenery that is the Grappa Massif.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually I see what must surely now be the end of the struggle. The road crests next to a house and the view I’ve been waiting for reveals itself in all its glory. Below us, stretching into the distance is a huge, flat expanse. This mountain is the gateway to all the others; it’s the first true elevation northwards of San Marino and we can basically see to Venice. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-08-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Monte Grappa\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-08-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-08-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-08-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-08-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-08-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-08-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-08-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-08.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Looking the other way, we can see the refuge at the mountaintop.

It’s enormous, spanning the 300 metre-plus length of the mountain’s peak. Taking off my cycling shoes, I walk up its snow-lined steps and read the inscription on the stone: ‘Monte Grappa you are my homeland’. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The line is a lyric from ‘La Canzone del Grappa’, a song written in 1918 celebrating Italy’s victory over Austria-Hungary at the Battles of Monte Grappa, when the Italians used the mountain to hold off an advance on Venice. The remains in the memorial belong to both Italian and Austro-Hungarian soldiers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The memorial is the resting place of more than 20,000 soldiers who died in the First World War, mostly unidentified. Before it was built in 1935 they were spread between more than a hundred different cemeteries across the mountain.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-11-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Monte Grappa\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-11-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-11-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-11-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-11-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-11-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-11-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-11-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-11.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Save time and legs for climbing the steps to the monument at the summit of Monte Grappa</figcaption><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>It may only be First World War soldiers remembered here, but the mountain has an important place in the history of the Second World War too. Members of the Italian resistance used Monte Grappa as a refuge from the Fascists, but the Nazis found and killed most of them, and the ones not killed in the conflict were hanged in Bassano.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The big come-down</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The descent lasts nearly 30km down what is the easiest way up the mountain.

With just a processional stage to come, that will be the final battle of the three-week war, and the peloton’s double ascent will result in a lot of men suffering on the slopes of the Grappa, just like I did today. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But with the memories that the climb and this area hold, perspective will be easy to come by.

More importantly, Room is renowned for its Americano, a cocktail of Campari, vermouth and soda water.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving to the next course, this part of Italy is prime Prosecco country, and the hills of Conegliano and Valdobbiadene where it originated are visible from Monte Grappa. While the official Prosecco region has been expanded to meet demand, the highest standard DOCG Prosecco area reaches into Asolo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally we turn to the <em>digestivo</em> grappa, a form of brandy made from the leftovers of grapes during winemaking and which can be as strong as 60%. It doesn’t actually get its name from the local area – legend has it that grappa was invented by a Roman soldier who stole distillation equipment from Egypt and was rewarded with land to cultivate for his part in a war – but the Poli distillery in Bassano is an important grappa distillery and has a museum where you can see the process of making grappa and have a taste or two.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How we did it</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-15-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride Monte Grappa\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-15-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-15-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-15-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-15-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-15-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-15-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-15-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/05/monte-grappa-15.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Bassano del Grappa is achingly stylish.

Direct flights are also available from Birmingham, Bristol, Edinburgh and Manchester. From there we took a taxi to Bassano del Grappa, which takes just under an hour via the toll road. You can also get the train from Venice Mestre, and there’s a shuttle bus from the airport to the train station.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Accommodation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We stayed at the T-Rooms guest house, which is ideally located by the river just a short walk from the Ponte Vecchio and the main <em>piazza</em>, and cost €110 per night. It’s bike-friendly and, thankfully, person-friendly too.

And further thanks to Alessandro and Leonardo Basso for letting them all skip work to help us out.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/monte-zoncolan-italy-cycling\">Big Ride: The secret road up Monte Zoncolan</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/carnic-alps-cycling\">Big Ride: Borderline crazy in the Carnic Alps</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/monte-civetta-dolomites-cycling\">Big Ride: Monte Civetta in the Dolomites</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/monte-grappa-italy-cycling\">Big Ride: Monte Grappa, the giant of the Giro</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"7e717e857c33f6eab4fb8e86714a54ffa3b562f97e17ca87a3aae740b1ce7319","category":"Cycling"}
