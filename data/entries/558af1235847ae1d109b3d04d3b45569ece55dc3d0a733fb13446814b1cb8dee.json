The bottom tab bar has been redesigned to appear below page content, and Apple has also added a toggle to show the address bar at the top of the ‌iPhone‌ rather than the bottom.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/original-safari-design-ios-15.jpg\" /><em><div>The original design in ‌iOS 15‌ beta 5</div></em>\r\n<br />\r\nThe addition of a toggle to show the address bar at the top of the Safari interface returns Safari to a more iOS 14-like experience, walking back many of the ‌iOS 15‌ changes.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/full-safari-changes-ios-15-b-6.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nWith the bottom view option toggled on, Safari offers a dedicated toolbar with buttons at the bottom of the interface, which is also an improvement over the prior floating design.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has also introduced new setting options to remove the website tinting and to enable a Tab Bar while in landscape mode. There was previously a \"Show Color in Tab Bar\" accessibility setting, which appears to be the same as the new \"Allow Website Tinting\" toggle.  \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple previously added similar toggles in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-15/\">iPadOS 15</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">macOS Monterey</a> to offer either a separate tab bar (which was the original default when the betas launched) or a merged tab bar, which is more similar to the previous design.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-15/\">iOS 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-15/\">iPadOS 15</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-15.233\">iOS 15</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/17/apple-safari-design-changes-ios-15-beta-6/\">Apple Reverses iOS 15 Safari Changes With New Toggle for Top Address Bar</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reverses-ios-15-safari-changes-with-new-toggle-for-top-address-bar.2307836/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=lkRmd9q-DHQ:DDwQt8ag4so:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=lkRmd9q-DHQ:DDwQt8ag4so:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/lkRmd9q-DHQ\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"558af1235847ae1d109b3d04d3b45569ece55dc3d0a733fb13446814b1cb8dee","category":"Apple"}
