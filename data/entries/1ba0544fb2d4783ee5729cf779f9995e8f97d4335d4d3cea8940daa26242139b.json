The <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/classics\" target=\"_blank\">Ardennes Classics</a> are underway with the Amstel Gold Race producing two familiar winning sights. Both Lotte Kopecky (SD Worx) and Tadej Pogaƒçar (UAE Team Emirates) reached the finish line solo, where a draught Amstel awaited them.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><p><em>Results powered by <a href=\"https://firstcycling.com/race.php?r=9&amp;y=2023\" target=\"_blank\">FirstCycling.com</a></em></p></div>\n\n\n\n<div><p><em>Results powered by <a href=\"https://firstcycling.com/race.php?r=9050&amp;y=2023\" target=\"_blank\">FirstCycling.com</a></em></p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of drafting‚Ä¶</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. Amstel Gold Race draft controversy</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"652\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Pogacar-Amstel-Gold-970x652.png\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Pogacar-Amstel-Gold-970x652.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Pogacar-Amstel-Gold-300x202.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Pogacar-Amstel-Gold-768x516.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Pogacar-Amstel-Gold-750x504.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Pogacar-Amstel-Gold-1140x766.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/Pogacar-Amstel-Gold.png 1231w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There‚Äôs a grey area and sporadic enforcement of UCI rules regarding drafting. It‚Äôs widely accepted when a rider is returning to the peloton after a crash, and the rider doesn‚Äôt even have to draft behind their own team car when doing so. However, under UCI rules, ‚Äòsheltering behind‚Äô or ‚Äòtaking advantage of a vehicle‚Äôs slipstream‚Äô, results in the rider, driver and sports director for the vehicle being fined 200-500CHF. This is due to the aerodynamic advantage that is provided while sitting in the draft of a car or motorbike. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But from 10km to go in the men‚Äôs Amstel Gold Race, the organiser‚Äôs lead car appeared very close to Pogaƒçar for 300m. The Slovenian had already attacked by that point and was ahead of Ben Healy (EF Education-EasyPost) and Tom Pidcock (Ineos Grenadiers). It also caught the attention of Healy‚Äôs team manager Jonathan Vaughters.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>I mean. COME ON. <a href=\"https://t.co/hJVQ54ULOI\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/hJVQ54ULOI</a></p>‚Äî Jonathan Vaughters (@Vaughters) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Vaughters/status/1647613983980158976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">April 16, 2023</a></blockquote> \n\n\n\n<p>Pat McQuaid and Brian Cookson ‚Äì former UCI presidents ‚Äì agreed the car was too close. On the <em>In Het Wiel</em> podcast, race director Leo van Vliet said the car had to drive past Pogaƒçar due to the roads narrowing up ahead and Healy getting closer to the UAE Team Emirates rider after distancing Pidcock. Pogaƒçar himself said after the race that he ‚Äòdidn‚Äôt like‚Äô the organiser‚Äôs car being ‚Äòtoo close‚Äô in that moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Lizzie Deignan returns to racing earlier than planned</h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Where did that 6 months go?! <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f92f.png\" alt=\"ü§Ø\" /> I actually can‚Äôt put it all in to words, Fl√®che Wallone here I come <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f605.png\" alt=\"üòÖ\" /> <a href=\"https://t.co/4G2powKvqb\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/4G2powKvqb</a></p>‚Äî Lizzie Deignan (@lizziedeignan) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lizziedeignan/status/1647953186882289664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">April 17, 2023</a></blockquote> \n\n\n\n<p>Trek-Segafredo‚Äôs Lizzie Deignan, who has been on maternity leave after welcoming her second child in September 2022, announced on Instagram that she would be back in the peloton earlier than originally planned. Deignan was looking to return in May for La Vuelta Femenina, but will now be at the start line of La Fl√®che Wallonne on Wednesday 19th April.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During her pregnancy, Trek-Segafredo signed the Brit to a two-year contract extension that runs to the end of 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3.
