{"title":"★ Pebble Founder Eric Migicovsky Is Bringing It Back","link":"https://daringfireball.net/2025/01/repebble","date":1738187843000,"content":"\n<p>David Pierce, writing at The Verge, “<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/27/24352968/pebble-smartwatch-open-source-google-comeback\">The Pebble Smartwatch Is Making a Comeback</a>”:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rather than buy another smartwatch, Migicovsky decided to try and\nget Pebble going again. He <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/9/24124179/beeper-app-automattic-acquisition-matrix-messaging\">sold his most recent startup</a>, a\nmessaging app <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23998294/beeper-imessage-apple-app-security\">called Beeper</a>, to Automattic last year and\nleft the company in the fall. Since then, he’d thought about\nstarting a Pebble-like product from scratch, figuring it’d be\neasier to do the same thing again a second time. “But then I was\nlike, <em>what if I just asked Google to open-source the operating\nsystem</em>?” he says. It felt like a long shot, but he knew the code\nwas just sitting dormant inside Mountain View somewhere. So he\nasked. A few times.</p>\n\n<p>To Migicovsky’s surprise, Google agreed to release Pebble OS to\nthe public. As of Monday, <a href=\"https://opensource.googleblog.com/2025/01/see-code-that-powered-pebble-smartwatches.html\">all the Pebble firmware is available on\nGitHub</a>, and Migicovsky is starting a company to pick up\nwhere he left off.</p>\n\n<p>The company — which can’t be named Pebble because Google still\nowns that — doesn’t have a name yet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My first idea for a new name: Rebble — a rebellious return of Pebble. My second idea: Quixote — because this isn’t going to be a hit this time either. (Quixote also would have been a good name for <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2023/12/beeper_i_hardly_knew_her\">Beeper Mini’s attempt to backwards engineer</a> access <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2023/12/beeper_mini_is_back\">as an unsanctioned iMessage client for Android</a>.) But, thankfully, it doesn’t sound to me like Migicovsky’s goal is to boil the ocean. (<strong>Update:</strong> Turns out, <a href=\"https://rebble.io/2025/01/27/the-future-of-rebble.html\">Rebble is the name of a community project</a> to write new firmware to keep old Pebble watches running.)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://ericmigi.com/blog/why-were-bringing-pebble-back\">Migicovsky, on his blog</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You’d <em>imagine</em> that smartwatches have evolved considerably since\n2012. I’ve tried every single smart watch out there, but none do\nit for me. No one makes a smartwatch with the core set of\nfeatures I want:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Always-on e-paper screen</em> (it’s reflective rather than\nemissive. Sunlight readable. Glanceable. Not distracting to\nothers like a bright wrist)</li>\n<li><em>Long battery life</em> (one less thing to charge. It’s annoying to\nneed extra cables when traveling)</li>\n<li><em>Simple and beautiful user experience</em> around a core set of\nfeatures I use regularly (telling time, notifications, music\ncontrol, alarms, weather, calendar, sleep/step tracking)</li>\n<li><em>Buttons!</em> (to play/pause/skip music on my phone without looking\nat the screen)</li>\n<li><em>Hackable</em> (apparently you can’t even write your own watchfaces\nfor Apple Watch? That is wild. There were &gt;16k watchfaces on the\nPebble appstore!)</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If their goal is to be to smartwatches what <a href=\"https://play.date/\">Playdate</a> is to handheld gaming, that’s definitely achievable, and if they succeed, will by definition be a lot of fun.</p>\n\n<p>The whole tech world needs more projects that aren’t trying to become billion- (let alone trillion-) dollar ideas, but are happily shooting for success as million-dollar ideas (or less!). Many of the best and most beloved movies ever made weren’t big-budget Hollywood blockbusters. If your list of all-time favorite movies doesn’t include a bunch that were made on shoestring budgets, your whole list probably sucks, because you have no taste. The same is of course true for music, games, and everything else. Indie art is often <em>great</em> art, imbued by the souls and obsessions of its creators, and blockbuster art is often garbage art, imbued only by soulless corporate bureaucracies.</p>\n\n<p>Computer hardware and software can be — <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/04/11/make-something-wonderful\">ought to be</a> — attempts at creating art.</p>\n\n\n\n    ","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"3f7945a08262001f18972b42f73c1abd2bb1e7de3a40f538406b5e4628022754","category":"Tech"}
