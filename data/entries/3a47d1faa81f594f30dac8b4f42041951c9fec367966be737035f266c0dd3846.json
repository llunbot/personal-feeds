Pay attention to these key parts and your bike will work better and be more pleasant to ride. You’re also far less likely to suffer an unexpected failure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These tips come courtesy of pro bike mechanic Matt Dawson.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Recommended Shimano tools and Muc-Off cleaning products</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>TL-BT03S Disc Brake Bleed Kit: <a href=\"https://fave.co/40pvhAn\" target=\"_blank\">RRP £30.99 – Buy now from Condor Cycles for £29.99</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>TL-CT12 Cable Cutter: <a href=\"https://fave.co/3u3B4iV\" target=\"_blank\">RRP £59.99 – Buy now from Merlin Cycles for £36.95</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>TL-CN10 Quick Link Pliers: <a href=\"https://fave.co/3SvO3Ea\" target=\"_blank\">RRP £46.99 – Buy now from Merlin Cycles for £46.99</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Muc-Off Bio Dry Lube 120ml: <a href=\"https://tidd.ly/3MzbAQW\" target=\"_blank\">RRP 11.99 – Buy now from Tredz for £8.99</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Muc-Off Bio Wet Lube 120ml: <a href=\"https://tidd.ly/3sd8lI0\" target=\"_blank\">RRP £11.99 – Buy now from Tredz for £8.99</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Muc-Off Miracle Shine Bike Polish 500ml: <a href=\"https://tidd.ly/477OqJK\" target=\"_blank\">RRP £27.99 – Buy now from Tredz for £21.99</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Muc-Off Bio Degreaser: <a href=\"https://tidd.ly/3MUVAJh\" target=\"_blank\">RRP £11.99 – Buy now from Tredz for £9.99</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Five bike maintenance checks </h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>1. Adjust your gears</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/02174031/5_bike_maintenance_tips_01-970x647.jpg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt says: ‘Make sure parts are all compatible – for example, a Shimano chain on a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-cassette\" target=\"_blank\">Shimano cassette</a> with a Shimano derailleur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Secondly, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-check-your-bikes-chain-for-wear-and-stretch\">are they worn</a>? If so, it’s time to replace them because you can’t expect worn parts to work properly. As for gear setup, the most essential thing is a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-straighten-your-bikes-bent-derailleur-hanger\" target=\"_blank\">straight derailleur hanger</a> – the whole system fundamentally relies on this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Most home mechanics won’t have a derailleur alignment gauge but you can get this checked at your local bike shop. Cable condition is very important too – you should <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-replace-shifter-cables\" target=\"_blank\">change your cables</a>, both inners and outers, once a year, or every six months for high-end polymer-coated cables like <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/shimano-dura-ace-vs-sram-red-etap-axs\" target=\"_blank\">Shimano Dura-Ace</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Always use <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-gear-cable-upgrades-for-slicker-shifting\" target=\"_blank\">stainless steel cables</a>, which perform more consistently. When changing cables, always use good-quality cutters to ensure smooth cuts with no crushing of outers or fraying of inners.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>2. Keep it clean</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/02174034/5_bike_maintenance_tips_02-970x647.jpg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt says: ‘We have some pretty cool cleaning equipment in the workshop. For the home mechanic, I’d go for a decent <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-clean-bike-chain\" target=\"_blank\">degreaser</a> on the chain and use an old towel to dry it thoroughly, then re-lube.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Generally, I use <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/the-cyclist-guide-to-chain-lubricants\" target=\"_blank\">dry lube</a> because wet lube tends to attract more dirt, but it’s partly down to personal preference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The most important thing is to wipe off all of the excess to make sure it doesn’t splatter onto your braking surfaces. Give your frame a polish after cleaning to keep it in showroom condition.’</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Related: <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/watch-how-to-clean-a-road-bike-in-the-time-it-takes-to-make-a-cup-of-tea\" target=\"_blank\">How to clean your bike in the time it takes to make a cup of tea</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h4>3. Bleed disc brakes</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/02174036/5_bike_maintenance_tips_03-970x647.jpg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt says: ‘If your hydraulic disc brakes feel in any way “spongy” when you pump the lever, it’s a sign that there’s air in the system and you should get them fully bled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It’s also a good idea to change the fluid at a regular service interval because you can get a build-up of contaminants which can reduce the brakes’ performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Once a year is fine for <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-bleed-shimano-hydraulic-road-disc-brakes\" target=\"_blank\">servicing Shimano disc brakes</a>, which use mineral oil, but if your brakes use <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-bleed-sram-road-disc-brakes\" target=\"_blank\">DOT fluid</a>, this attracts moisture so it will need more frequent replacing.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>4. Check your chain</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/02174039/5_bike_maintenance_tips_04-970x647.jpg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt says: ‘<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-check-your-bikes-chain-for-wear-and-stretch\" target=\"_blank\">Check your chain for wear</a> every three months, or every 1,000 miles. The Shimano TL-CN42 measures wear on the pins in the chain in percentage points – 25%-50% is fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘At 75% you should <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-bike-chain\" target=\"_blank\">replace the chain</a>. If it reaches 100% you should also replace the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-cassette\" target=\"_blank\">cassette</a> because the chain wears in sync with the cassette, so especially with the smaller sprockets, you can end up with slipping.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘With a Shimano <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-use-chain-quick-links\" target=\"_blank\">Quick Link</a>, it’s easy to break and join a chain using the TL-CN10 Quick Link Pliers.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>5. Check your tyres</h4>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2018/10/02174041/5_bike_maintenance_tips_05-970x647.jpg\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt says: ‘Some tyre manufacturers will have a wear indication mark – for example, Continental tyres have two small dimples.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Otherwise, look for a flat “squared off” shape rather than a nice round profile to your tyre, especially on the rear, which gets more wear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Also look out for wear to the sidewalls, where a (rim) brake may have rubbed if not set up correctly, or any large cuts through to the casing, or cracking of the rubber where it has perished over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘These are all signs that your tyres need replacing.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Need help choosing new tyres?
