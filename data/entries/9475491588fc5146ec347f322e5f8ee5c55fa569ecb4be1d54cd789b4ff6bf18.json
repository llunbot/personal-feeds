It brings semi-affordability with a carbon frame sporting sleek carbon looks. The revamped ebike still gets 150mm of “reactive” rear travel paired to 160mm forks and capable all-rounder geometry.  And there are options for either a lighter &amp; slimmer 600Wh battery or a bigger range 800Wh alternative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Focus says, “<em>If there was only one e-mountain bike in the world, the JAM² would be the one for you. It’s the manifestation of a trail bike, supercharging your confidence on any trail – up or down.</em>“</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Focus JAM² alloy all-mountain eMTB</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That one ebike for all types of mountain riding feels about right. This is big enough travel to smooth out almost any type of rough &amp; rocky terrain. But with powerful pedal-assist, it’s also gonna be efficient enough for less-demanding singletrack trail riding. So, yeah, the Jam² seems like a solid middle ground for mountain bikers looking to buy just one ebike to ride it all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But frankly, the Jam² family had gotten a bit confusing for me. Until now, the top 8-series was a conventional Horst-link 150/160mm 4-bar in carbon with a Bosch motor. Its 6-series was just an alloy iteration with the same Bosch motor. And then there was an alloy 7-series with an altogether different short-link 4-bar, shorter 150mm forks, and with a Shimano motor. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Focus Jam² eMTB alloy all-mountain Bosch CX eBike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Focus)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But now, Focus has gone back to the drawing board to simplify the Jam² eMTB family, and to separate it a bit more clearly from their lighter Sam² trail &amp; burlier Thron² enduro ebikes.

On paper it still looks essentially the same. It’s still nominally 250W, a peak short-term power output up to 600W, delivering up to 340% of what you put in at the pedals, and puts out the same 85Nm of torque. But Bosch says this new generation motor is “more responsive than ever to your input” thanks to improved inertia, cadence &amp; torque sensors inside. The result is a ‘more natural’ riding feel, while still delivering full-power pedal-assist support. And it’s even said to be quieter running, and about 100g lighter at a claimed 2.8kg now.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_600Wh-battery-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_600Wh-battery-1536x1152.webp\" alt=\"Focus Jam² eMTB alloy all-mountain Bosch CX eBike, small battery\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_600Wh-battery-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_600Wh-battery-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_600Wh-battery-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_600Wh-battery-768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_600Wh-battery-jpg.webp 2000w\" /></a><figcaption>600Wh</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_800Wh-battery-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1152\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_800Wh-battery-1536x1152.webp\" alt=\"Focus Jam² eMTB alloy all-mountain Bosch CX eBike, big battery\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_800Wh-battery-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_800Wh-battery-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_800Wh-battery-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_800Wh-battery-768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_800Wh-battery-jpg.webp 2000w\" /></a><figcaption>800Wh</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Battery-wise, the new CX update also brings two new modular internal batteries from Bosch, too. The PowerTube now comes in 600Wh or 800Wh variants that snap right into the new alloy Jam² downtube. The smaller battery lines up perfectly with the frame, while the larger hangs down a bit lower to make room for those extra electrons to carry you on 1/3 longer adventures. Then, Focus puts their own 2 different downtube covers over to make sure the battery is safe. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, all frame sizes of the Jam² are compatible with Bosch’s 250Wh range extender external battery, so you could end with either 850Wh or 1050Wh if you chose longer ebike rides.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Geometry tweaks</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_updated-geometry-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_updated-geometry-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Focus Jam² eMTB alloy all-mountain Bosch CX eBike, geometry\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_updated-geometry-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_updated-geometry-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_updated-geometry-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_updated-geometry-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_updated-geometry-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_updated-geometry-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Focus Jam² geometry is quite similar to the outgoing ebike, but there are a few tweaks. The 4 frame sizes (S-XL) get a half-degree slacker headtube to 65°. Reach actually shrinks 5mm across the board, while Stack gets a tad higher together with a bit taller fork heights (more so on the smaller bikes). Chainstays and effective seat angles are unchanged. But standover height actually comes down, making these eMTBs more manageable over challenging terrain, coupled with longer travel dropper seatposts (up to 150mm S, 180mm M &amp; L, 210mm XL).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_riding-NDS-detail-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1700\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_riding-NDS-detail-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Focus Jam² eMTB alloy all-mountain Bosch CX eBike, NDS detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_riding-NDS-detail-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_riding-NDS-detail-297x252.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_riding-NDS-detail-1536x1306.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_riding-NDS-detail-120x102.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_riding-NDS-detail-768x653.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>7005 hydroformed aluminum frameset with 150mm of rear wheel travel</li>\n\n\n\n<li>classic 4-bar suspension design with FOLD kinematics</li>\n\n\n\n<li>latest Bosch Performance Line CX ebike powertrain</li>\n\n\n\n<li>new Kiox &amp; Purion displays on all eMTB models</li>\n\n\n\n<li>fully integrated internal cable routing through the upper headset bearing</li>\n\n\n\n<li>UDH, wired T-Type electronic or conventional mechanical derailleur compatibility</li>\n\n\n\n<li>29 x 2.6″ tire clearance</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Boost 148x12mm thru-axle</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Post Mount 180mm brake, with 200mm rotors</li>\n\n\n\n<li>34.9mm oversized seatpost for long travel droppers</li>\n\n\n\n<li>integrated Airtag or Chipolo tracker mounting</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_ghost-ride-the-whip-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_ghost-ride-the-whip-jpg.webp\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_ghost-ride-the-whip-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_ghost-ride-the-whip-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_ghost-ride-the-whip-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_ghost-ride-the-whip-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_ghost-ride-the-whip-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_ghost-ride-the-whip-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_ghost-ride-the-whip-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new and improved Jam² is available now from <a href=\"https://ride.focus.bike/JAM2\" target=\"_blank\">your local Focus dealer</a>.

The Focus Jam² 6.9 also gets alloy DT HX 1900 wheels with those Albert Radial tires.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_6-8-rendering-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_6-8-rendering-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Focus Jam² eMTB alloy all-mountain Bosch CX eBike, 6-8 rendering\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_6-8-rendering-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_6-8-rendering-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_6-8-rendering-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_6-8-rendering-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_6-8-rendering-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>2025 Focus Jam² 6.8</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Focus Jam² 6.8 lowers even more to 6000€ with a 600Wh battery (6400€ with 800Wh) and a unique claim in the spec sheet of a “New SRAM Eagle 70 Transmission” derailleur at a price that could only be mechanical. That means a direct mount T-type mechanical Eagle derailleur is <em>coming soon</em> from SRAM, but Focus hasn’t yet teased us with an actual photo. Their PR pics for this model are essentially frame-only with just a schematic outline of the ebike build. The 6.8 also down-specs to RockShox Lyrik &amp; Deluxe Select suspension, a lower Bosch Purion 200 display, and house brand wheels on Formula hubs, but apparently still the Albert Radial tires.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_6-7-complete-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_6-7-complete-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Focus Jam² eMTB alloy all-mountain Bosch CX eBike, 6.7\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_6-7-complete-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_6-7-complete-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_6-7-complete-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_6-7-complete-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_6-7-complete-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>Focus Jam² 6.7</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, a 5000€ Jam² 6.7 600Wh build (5400€ with 800Wh) is the most affordable with a Shimano Cues 1×10 drivetrain, RockShox Psylo Silver RC &amp; Deluxe Select suspension, and house brand alloy wheels on Shimano hubs with EXO casing Maxxis Minion tires.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_group-ride-jpg.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_group-ride-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Focus Jam² eMTB alloy all-mountain Bosch CX eBike, group ride\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_group-ride-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_group-ride-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_group-ride-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_group-ride-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_group-ride-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_group-ride-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.focus-bikes.com/int/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Focus-bikes.com</em></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/new-alloy-focus-jam%c2%b2-emtb-updates-all-rounder-all-mountain-ebike/\">New Alloy Focus JAM² eMTB Updates All-Rounder All-Mountain eBike</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"9475491588fc5146ec347f322e5f8ee5c55fa569ecb4be1d54cd789b4ff6bf18","category":"Cycling"}
