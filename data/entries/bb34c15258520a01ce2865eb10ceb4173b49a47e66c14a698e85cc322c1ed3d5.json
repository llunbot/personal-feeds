Here are a few of the most useful ways to use the two tools together.</span></p>\n<h3>Testing and setting zones</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Jack Evans' pained expression during sodium bicarbonate lab trial\" title=\"CZ1_9801\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Average power and heart rate from maximal efforts is used to set training zones.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Chris Teagles</i></span></div>\n<p><span>By performing a simple </span><span>maximum heart rate or functional threshold heart rate test</span><span>, as well as using power profile or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/critical-power/\">Critical Power</a></span><span> testing</span><span> protocols, you’re able to set benchmarks for comparison against later down the line. </span></p>\n<p><span>You can also establish your training intensity zones for each respective tool.</span></p>\n<p><span>These heart rate and power intensity zones don’t need to line up perfectly, since each is measuring a different thing. What’s most important is to know how the two relate to each other for you as an individual.</span></p>\n<h3>Monitoring fitness progression</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Screenshot of Training Peaks HR and power graph\" title=\"aerobicdecoupling\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> On long rides, ideally heart rate (in red) shouldn’t drift upwards if power (in pink) remains steady.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Training Peaks</i></span></div>\n<p><span>There are numerous ways that having both heart rate and power data at your disposal can help you assess how well your fitness is progressing, and whether your training plan is producing the desired results.</span></p>\n<p><span>One such way is by looking at the ‘rate of decoupling’ within a workout. This is a measure of how much divergence there is between your heart rate and power during the course of a steady ride. </span></p>\n<p><span>If heart rate goes up for a steady power output, we can say that some ‘level decoupling’ has occurred, meaning your efficiency has reduced over the course of the ride. </span></p>\n<p><span>While this could be related to a number of the influencing factors mentioned earlier, it can help you to understand how aerobically fit you are and whether your endurance is sufficient for the duration and demands of what you’re preparing for.</span></p>\n<p><span>Of course, it’s still possible to assess fitness progression if you only have access to either heart rate or power data.</span></p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Merida Scultura Limited Road bike\" title=\"Merida Scultura Limited - 10\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Timing yourself on a familiar stretch of road is another method of testing fitness.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>Where only heart rate data is available, try riding a real-world or virtual segment such as a climb at a steady heart rate and see if your time for the segment improves. </span></p>\n<p><span>Just ensure the conditions and other factors are kept as similar as possible as you perform repeat tests.</span></p>\n<p><span>With power, you can repeat the power profile test or FTP test (you can also complete an <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/how-to-take-ftp-test-zwift/\">FTP test on Zwift</a>) to get a good gauge on whether you’re seeing improvements in the right areas of your fitness, by comparing the results to the original benchmark testing.</span></p>\n<h3>Knowing your limits</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Amazfit GTR 4 smartwatch\" title=\"Amazfit GTR 4 smartwatch - 08\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Atypical heart rate readings can be a sign of fatigue.</span></figcaption><span> <i>James Costley-White / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>Is <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/overtraining-syndrome/\">overtraining</a> still possible when using heart rate and power together?</span><span> </span></p>\n<p><span>The short answer is yes, but if you build up an understanding of your data over time, and pay attention to the numbers, it can easily be avoided. </span></p>\n<p><span>By training with both heart rate and power data together in most of your workouts, you’ll very quickly establish a picture of a normal heart rate to see for a given power output, or vice versa. </span></p>\n<p><span>When you see the relationship between these numbers change dramatically, you can make decisions about what may have caused it and whether the change is a positive or a negative one.</span></p>\n<p><span>Having an awareness of your limits can also help you pace efforts, both within training sessions and in competition. </span></p>\n<p><span>Power is ideal as a pacing tool with its instant feedback, but you can also pace yourself during steadier hard efforts like a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/10-steps-to-your-best-ever-time-trial/\">time trial </a>or longer road or MTB race with heart rate.</span></p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Sheet showing RPE scores from 1 to 20\" title=\"CZ1_9602\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Although subjective, your own rating of perceived exertion is a valuable metric.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Chris Teagles </i></span></div>\n<p><span>Use your own <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/rating-of-perceived-exertion/\">rating of perceived exertion</a> in combination with the heart rate data, to help judge shorter efforts where heart rate data alone is less reliable. </span></p>\n<p><span>You can combine this with your knowledge of previous training sessions and races to inform how hard to push and for how long.</span></p>","author":"Tom Bell","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"bb34c15258520a01ce2865eb10ceb4173b49a47e66c14a698e85cc322c1ed3d5","category":"Cycling"}
