Companies big and small felt the effects, including K-EDGE. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Brand Manager Tim Kelly, “we stopped making 35mm mounts during Covid to focus production on our core products, as demand was far outpacing supply for K-EDGE.  The 35mm mounts were dropped from our offering and those riders with these larger handlebars were frustratedly calling us ever since.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/35mm-K-EDGE-MAX-XL-Mount-3.-jpg-scaled.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/35mm-K-EDGE-MAX-XL-Mount-3.-jpg-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"K-EDGE 35mm computer mount\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/35mm-K-EDGE-MAX-XL-Mount-3.-jpg-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/35mm-K-EDGE-MAX-XL-Mount-3.-jpg-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/35mm-K-EDGE-MAX-XL-Mount-3.-jpg-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/35mm-K-EDGE-MAX-XL-Mount-3.-jpg-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/35mm-K-EDGE-MAX-XL-Mount-3.-jpg-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/35mm-K-EDGE-MAX-XL-Mount-3.-jpg-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/35mm-K-EDGE-MAX-XL-Mount-3.-jpg-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/35mm-K-EDGE-MAX-XL-Mount-2-scaled.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"573\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/35mm-K-EDGE-MAX-XL-Mount-2-800x573.jpg\" alt=\"K-EDGE 35mm computer mount\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/35mm-K-EDGE-MAX-XL-Mount-2-800x573.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/35mm-K-EDGE-MAX-XL-Mount-2-297x213.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/35mm-K-EDGE-MAX-XL-Mount-2-120x86.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/35mm-K-EDGE-MAX-XL-Mount-2-768x550.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/35mm-K-EDGE-MAX-XL-Mount-2-1536x1100.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/35mm-K-EDGE-MAX-XL-Mount-2-2048x1467.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that they’ve had a chance to catch up to demand, K-EDGE is relaunching their 35mm mounts – only better. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tim continues, “we decided to refine our MAX XL Mount when making this new 35mm size – so the 35mm mount sees an overhaul in design from top to bottom with a sleek upper clamp and updated XL (extra-long) lower out front arm. This mount is at the top of the K-EDGE mount list for strength and holds the largest sizes of Garmin, Wahoo, and <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/adapt-your-existing-k-edge-mount-for-karoo-2-with-new-hammerhead-mounting-system/\" target=\"_blank\">now Hammerhead computers</a>. The MAX XL Combo will hold the bulkiest cycling cameras and lights securely underneath, hidden out of sight. Riders will appreciate the new upper clamp that borrows from K-EDGE’s Tour de France-proven Race Mounts. This mount will truly live up to the “Jewelry for the bike” reputation of K-EDGE’s top end mounts.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Available now, you can buy the 35mm MAX XL as a standalone computer mount, or as the Combo mount to hold a computer and a light/camera/accessory. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Compatible with ALL Garmin, Wahoo, and Hammerhead computers with the correct K-EDGE insert kit.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Weight:  48grams for the 35mm MAX XL and 61grams for the 35.0mm MAX XL Combo</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Available now on <a href=\"http://k-edge.com/\">K-EDGE.com</a> or top retailers and distributors worldwide</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Price: 35mm MAX XL $59.99 USD.  35mm MAX XL Combo $74.99 USD</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/k-edge-35mm-computer-mounts-max-xl/\">K-EDGE 35mm Computer Mounts are Back w/ Sleek New Design, Still Just as Strong</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"3c2a7c98c0ab7f034ed9dc1ca5bcd7fe4d2d7819ab3598664ced42f3670dad3d","category":"Cycling"}
