Now, those efforts to transform PCs at a software level is extending to the hardware: Microsoft is <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/?p=178614\">adding a dedicated Copilot key</a> to PC keyboards, adjusting the standard Windows keyboard layout for the first time since the Windows key first appeared on its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_ergonomic_keyboards#/media/File:MicrosoftNaturalKeyboardGen1.jpg\">Natural Keyboard in 1994</a>.</p>\n<p>The Copilot key will, predictably, open up the Copilot generative AI assistant within Windows 10 and Windows 11. On an up-to-date Windows PC with Copilot enabled, you can currently do the same thing by pressing Windows + C. For PCs without Copilot enabled, including those that aren't signed into Microsoft accounts, the Copilot key will open Windows Search instead (though this is sort of redundant, since pressing the Windows key and then typing directly into the Start menu also activates the Search function).</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1R08Qx6Fvs\">quick Microsoft demo video</a> shows the Copilot key in between the cluster of arrow keys and the right Alt button, a place where many keyboards usually put a menu button, a right Ctrl key, another Windows key, or something similar. The exact positioning, and the key being replaced, may vary depending on the size and layout of the keyboard.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1993416#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1993416&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a6925da36c7e200d25f08ddef0f125c84ee459613ed35febc0beb1c53e0c4c41","category":"Tech"}
