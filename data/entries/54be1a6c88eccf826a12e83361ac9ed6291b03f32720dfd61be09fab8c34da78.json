While some are more like beefed-up <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/top-5-2021-cross-country-bikes/\">cross-country mountain bikes</a>, others are closer to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-trail-bikes/\">best trail mountain bikes</a> – pared-back and adrenaline-seeking.</p>\n<p>We’ve put together a buyer’s guide at the end of this article to help you choose the best downcountry bike for you and to help explain this new category of bike.</p>\n<section><div>\n        <h2>The best downcountry mountain bikes in 2021, as tested by our expert reviewers</h2>\n<ul><li><strong>Transition Spur X01: </strong>£6,000 / $6,499 / AU$10,499 </li>\n<li><strong>Juliana Wilder CC X01 AXS TR Reserve: </strong>£8,299 / $9,449</li>\n<li><strong>Specialized Epic EVO Expert:</strong> £6,750 / $6,300 / AU$10,100 / €6,699</li>\n<li><strong>Trek Top Fuel 8: </strong>£3,850 / $3,830 / €4,099 / AU$5,300</li>\n<li><strong>YT Izzo Pro Race:</strong> £4,599 / $5,299 / AU$83,99 / €5,299</li>\n<li><strong>Nukeproof Reactor Carbon 290 ST:</strong> £4,700 / $4,700 / AU$6,600</li>\n<li><strong>Scott Spark 900 Tuned AXS: </strong>£8,199 (international pricing TBC)</li>\n</ul><p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section><h2>Transition Spur X01</h2>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>5.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Transition’s Spur is its all-country bike that’s been designed from the ground up to “effortlessly explore, seek and pursue the mountain in ways you never imagined”.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Behr / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>Great geometry</li>\n<li>Smooth downhill, sprightly uphill</li>\n<li>£6,000 / $6,499 / AU$10,499 as tested</li>\n</ul><p>Unlike some downcountry bikes, the full-carbon frame Transition Spur is neither a beefed-up XC machine or a pared-back trail bike.

It also ramps up nicely for bigger hits, even though there is just 115mm of travel in the rear.</p>\n<p>The geometry of the Yeti is fairly similar to the SB100, which contributes to its speed, but the reach is short and it could do with a bit more length to remain stable and less skittish on loose rocks and steep chutes.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/yeti-sb115-t1-review/\">Read the Yeti SB115 T1 first ride review</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<hr /><h2>Buyer’s guide to downcountry mountain bikes</h2>\n<p>Mountain biking often feels like a broad umbrella for many different disciplines; from trail to high-flying downhill, there are myriad riding styles and, of course, the bikes to match.</p>\n<p>Downcountry bikes are one of the latest mountain biking phenomena, sitting at the intersection of cross-country, trail and all-mountain bikes.</p>\n<p>Having existed in one form or another for a number of years, downcountry bikes have recently hit the mainstream. As demand for this type of bike began to balloon, the bike industry responded, and downcountry is now a burgeoning category.</p>\n<p>Different brands approach downcountry bikes in slightly different ways, but this buyer’s guide will take you through everything you need to know.</p>\n<h3>What is a downcountry mountain bike?</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The best downcountry bikes cover ground extremely quickly, but still have enough stability and travel to tackle descents.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Behr / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>In short, downcountry bikes are lightweight XC-style frames with added travel, trail-friendly geometry and wider, nobbly tyres.</p>\n<p>The result? Bikes that will cover ground extremely fast but still let you charge down descents.</p>\n<p>The term “downcountry” was coined by Mike Levy at PinkBike three years ago, and is a mash-up of “downhill” and “cross country”. So, a pretty neat encapsulation of what the bikes are for, and consequently a term that has stuck around.</p>\n<p>The origin of downcountry bikes is a bit hazy. Some say it extends back to cross-country racing, where gnarlier courses demanded more technical, gravity-capable machines. Others say it comes from engineers making small tweaks to thoroughbred XC race bikes to make them more fun to ride.</p>\n<p>Arguably, they could stem from manufacturers doing their market research and seeing consumers riding more extreme terrain on their cross-country bikes and making corresponding upgrades to existing bikes.</p>\n<p>However they came to be, some of the biggest bikes brands now offer off-the-shelf downcountry bikes that deliver a refined balance of short travel, minimal mass and progressive geometry.</p>\n<h3>What to look for in a downcountry mountain bike</h3>\n<p>Alongside trail-friendly geometry, wide nobbly tyres and extended travel, downcountry bikes have a few other features that help them balance their fast and agile ride with their downhill performance and more relaxed feel.</p>\n<p>Much of what makes a downcountry bike is what it is specced with, and here we run through the key things to look out for.</p>\n<h4>A lightweight frame with a relaxed geometry</h4>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Long, low and lean, downcountry geometry is tailored to strike the balance between efficient climbing and fast descending.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Behr / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Go back 10 years and tell a cross-country rider they’d one day be riding a bike with a 66-degree head tube angle and they’d probably look at you as if you’d had one too many caffeine gels. But in 2021, this is exactly what is happening with downcountry bikes.</p>\n<p>This angle is slacker than traditional <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/top-5-2021-cross-country-bikes/\">cross-country bikes</a> and helps give downcountry bikes their gravity riding potential. This is because a slacker angle means the front fork sticks our further, creating a more stable ride at high speeds.</p>\n<p>Reach figures have also increased as head angles have decreased. A longer reach number makes the bike feel more stable when you’re stood on the pedals descending.</p>\n<p>Descending stability was going to be an inevitable outcome when combining the slack head angle, long reach and the consequential longer wheelbases created by those two figures.</p>\n<p>Even though downcountry bikes have more gravity-friendly geometry, they remain relatively light so riders aren’t pushing too much mass, helping the bikes stay fast.</p>\n<h4>Short-travel</h4>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> 120mm of travel is pretty standard for a downcountry rear shock.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Although downcountry bikes have a short-travel design, they still offer a bit more travel than cross-country race machines to help them on more technical downhill sections.</p>\n<p>As a general rule, downcountry bikes have between 120mm and 130mm travel in the forks and a variation of between 110mm and 125mm at the back, depending on brand and model.</p>\n<p>Some downcountry bikes do offer more travel, but this is testament to how downcountry is a rather woolly category that is more about different factors coming together than travel defining what the bike is.</p>\n<h4>Large wheels and burly tyres</h4>\n<p>29in wheels are standard on downcountry bikes. Compared to 27.5in wheels, they require less effort to keep their momentum and are consequently more efficient, making them the right choice for the sorts of longer, more pedalling-intensive rides you’ll be doing on these bikes.</p>\n<p>Downcountry bikes pair <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/what-is-a-29er/\">29in wheels</a> with wider and burlier tyres than you would expect to find on 29er cross-country bikes.</p>\n<p>These <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-tyres/\">mountain bike tyres</a> sit between fast-rolling, lightweight XC tyres and chunkier downhill treads, making them fast and less of a drag when climbing, yet more durable and capable on the rough stuff.</p>\n<h4>Wide bars and short stems</h4>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Downcountry bikes tend to have wider bars and shorter stems than XC bikes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Max Wilman / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Wide bars and short stems are the go-to for downcountry bikes.</p>\n<p>The wide bars give you more leverage and help make downcountry bikes super-stable, agile and less skittish than bikes with more XC-focused components.</p>\n<p>A shorter stem also improves handling. It gives the bike quicker handling characteristics by making steering more direct and makes the bike feel more responsive.</p>\n<h4>Dropper seatposts</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-dropper-posts/\">Dropper posts</a> are a common feature on downcountry bikes because they give riders a bit more space for moving around and shifting weight on technical descents.</p>\n<p>It’s possible to raise the saddle for efficient pedalling and to make the most of downcountry bikes’ cross-country-style speed, combining the best of both worlds.</p>\n<p>It might not be a surprise that downcountry bikes come with dropper posts considering their versatility, and dropper posts are even making their way onto <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bikes/\">gravel bikes</a>.</p>\n<h4>Gearing</h4>\n<p>Gearing on downcountry bikes is slanted towards the cross-country end of the spectrum. Front rings tend to have between 32 and 38 teeth compared to the 30- to 34-tooth rings on trail bikes.</p>\n<p>This allows for more speed, which is always appreciated on the smoother trails and fire roads that a downcountry bike is at home bombing along, and for long days in the saddle.</p>\n<h4>Brakes</h4>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A mix of rotor sizes and two-pot brakes help fulfil downcountry bikes’ “only what is needed” mantra.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>When it comes to brakes on downcountry bikes there is a mix, but they tend to use two-pot rather than four-pot <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-disc-brakes/\">mountain bike disc brakes</a>, where there are only two pistons rather than four.</p>\n<p>This is because downcountry bikes don’t need the braking power of four pistons because they aren’t descending at the fast, white-knuckle speeds of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-downhill-mountain-bikes/\">downhill mountain bikes</a>.</p>\n<p>Two pistons rather than four also saves weight, helping downcountry bikes achieve their svelte builds.</p>\n<p>In keeping with this, downcountry bikes also tend to have a mix of rotor sizes; 180mm on the front for better braking and heat dispersion and 160mm on the rear, where braking isn’t so strenuous on the disc and a few grams can be saved.</p>","author":"Stan Portus","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"54be1a6c88eccf826a12e83361ac9ed6291b03f32720dfd61be09fab8c34da78","category":"Cycling"}
