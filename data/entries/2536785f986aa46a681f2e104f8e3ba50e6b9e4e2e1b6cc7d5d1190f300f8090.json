Thirty-three Raptor engines propelled the 404-foot-tall (123.1-meter) rocket through a clear afternoon sky with more than twice the power of NASA's Saturn V rocket, the workhorse of the Apollo lunar program.</p>\n<p>Repeating a feat SpaceX accomplished with Starship twice before, the rocket's Super Heavy booster separated from the Starship upper stage roughly two-and-a-half minutes into the flight, then guided itself back to the Texas coastline for a catch by mechanical arms on the launch pad's tower. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/10/after-seeing-hundreds-of-launches-spacexs-rocket-catch-was-a-new-thrill/\">SpaceX is now 3-for-3</a> with attempts to catch a Super Heavy booster back at the launch site, a sign that engineers are well on their way to mastering how to recover and reuse boosters in a similar way as they do with the smaller workhorse Falcon 9 rocket.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/the-starship-program-hits-another-speed-bump-with-second-consecutive-failure/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/the-starship-program-hits-another-speed-bump-with-second-consecutive-failure/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2536785f986aa46a681f2e104f8e3ba50e6b9e4e2e1b6cc7d5d1190f300f8090","category":"Tech"}
