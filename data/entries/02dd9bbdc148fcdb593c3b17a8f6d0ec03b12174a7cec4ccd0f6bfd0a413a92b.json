Apple's original order of ten million panels was split between LG Display, with six million units, and Samsung, with four million units. The cut is expected to hit LG's order specifically, reducing to three or four million units, while Samsung's order remains unchanged. This also suggests that it is primarily the 13-inch ‌iPad Pro‌ that is affected by Apple's expectation of reduced sales, since Samsung is exclusively supplying panels for the 11.1-inch model.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/18/2024-ipad-pro-what-to-expect/\">2024 iPad Pro: 12 Rumors About What to Expect</a></li></ul>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe scaling back of the order suggests that Apple is now planning to sell fewer new ‌iPad Pro‌ models than it initially expected. Some reports have suggested that OLED display technology will make the ‌‌iPad Pro‌‌ models <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/09/2024-oled-ipad-pro-starting-prices/\">much more expensive</a>. The 11-inch OLED ‌‌iPad Pro‌‌ could be priced starting at $1,500, while the 13-inch model could be priced starting at $1,800. Currently, the 11-inch ‌‌iPad Pro‌‌ is priced starting at $799, while the 12.9-inch model with a mini-LED display is priced starting at $1,099. This could be one reason behind Apple's expectation of lower sales.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe latest indications suggest that the new ‌iPad Pro‌ models will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/21/new-ipads-and-macbook-airs-spring-2024-rumor/\">launch in March or April</a>, offering <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/29/oled-ipads-2024/\">larger screens</a>, the M3 chip, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/18/ipad-pro-magsafe-charging/\">MagSafe charging</a>, and support for a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/27/new-ipad-pro-and-redesigned-magic-keyboard/\">redesigned Magic Keyboard accessory</a>.  <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lg-display/\">LG Display</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled-ipad-pro/\">OLED iPad Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/apple-planning-to-sell-fewer-oled-ipad-pros/\">Apple Expects to Sell Fewer OLED iPad Pros Than Planned</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-expects-to-sell-fewer-oled-ipad-pros-than-planned.2417377/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"02dd9bbdc148fcdb593c3b17a8f6d0ec03b12174a7cec4ccd0f6bfd0a413a92b","category":"Apple"}
