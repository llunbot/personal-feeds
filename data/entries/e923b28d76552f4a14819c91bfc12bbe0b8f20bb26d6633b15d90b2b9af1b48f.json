In contrast, superintelligence surpasses AGI, and it could be seen as a hypothetical level of machine intelligence that can dramatically outperform humans at any intellectual task, perhaps even to an unfathomable degree.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051754#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051754&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e923b28d76552f4a14819c91bfc12bbe0b8f20bb26d6633b15d90b2b9af1b48f","category":"Tech"}
