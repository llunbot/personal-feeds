And it was allegedly all due to one guy who didn't copy a stolen formula correctly.</p>\n<p>The \"capacitor plague\" of the early 2000s was real and fairly widespread among devices, even if the majority of those devices didn't go bad at the same time or even in the same year. The story of this widespread failure, passing between industry insider stories and media reports, had a specific culprit, but also a broad narrative about the shift from Japanese to Taiwanese manufacturers and about outsourcing generally.</p>\n<p>The Asianometry channel on YouTube recently dug into the \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacitor_plague\">capacitor plague</a>\" in a video that asks, \"<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSpzAVpnXo4\">What happened to the capacitors in 2002</a>?\" and comes to some informed, broad, and layered answers. It explains the specifics of what's happening inside both a working capacitor and the faulty models, relays the reporting on the companies blamed and affected, and, crucially, puts the plague in the wider context of hotter chips, complex supply chains, counterfeits, and, sure, some industrial sabotage.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/was-the-early-2000s-capacitor-plague-corporate-espionage-or-just-industry-woes/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/was-the-early-2000s-capacitor-plague-corporate-espionage-or-just-industry-woes/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ec8509e1236a58b842e9533e666590609f6e3b1eb75c9ff162889debc1312c7e","category":"Tech"}
