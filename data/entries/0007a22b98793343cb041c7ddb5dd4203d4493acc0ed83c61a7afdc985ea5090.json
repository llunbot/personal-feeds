I said 'Tim, we are treating you really good, we put up with all the plants you built in China for years. We are not interested in you building in India. India can take care of themselves'.\"</blockquote>Trump claimed that following their discussion, Apple will be \"upping their production in the United States.\" \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn the fiscal year ending March, Apple's iPhone production in India reached $22 billion, a nearly 60% increase compared to the previous year. However, Trump's comments complicate Apple's strategy to import most US-bound iPhones from India by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/25/apple-source-us-bound-iphones-india-2026/\">the end of next year</a>. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple and its manufacturing partners have accelerated their movement away from China in recent months. The trend began after COVID restrictions disrupted operations, and has only accelerated amid ongoing US-China tensions, particularly in the wake of Trump's on-again, off-again tariffs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMost India-manufactured iPhones are assembled at Foxconn's factory in the southern part of the country. Tata Group's electronics manufacturing arm, which acquired Wistron's local business and manages Pegatron's operations in India, is another major supplier.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen asked about the supply chain's future during the company's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/01/apple-2q-2025-earnings/\">recent earnings call</a>, Cook said: \"What we learned some time ago, having everything in one location had too much risk with it. We have, over time, with certain parts of the supply chain, opened up new sources of supply. You could see that kind of thing continuing in the future.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDuring the same earnings call, Cook highlighted Apple's impact in the United States, including plans to spend $500 billion over the next four years and expanding facilities in several states. A new factory for advanced server manufacturing in Texas is scheduled to open later this year.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/india/\">India</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/15/trump-tells-apple-stop-building-iphones-india/\">Trump Tells Tim Cook to Stop Building iPhones in India</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/trump-tells-tim-cook-to-stop-building-iphones-in-india.2457117/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0007a22b98793343cb041c7ddb5dd4203d4493acc0ed83c61a7afdc985ea5090","category":"Apple"}
