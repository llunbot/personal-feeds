Apple released iOS 18.4 on Monday.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe behavior doesn't seem to be related to Apple's Automatic Downloads option either. The setting enables automatic downloads of apps purchased on other Apple devices. However, many affected users say they do not own another Apple device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLikewise, the bug is impacting users with devices that have never been jailbroken and have never used an alternative marketplace outside of the App Store.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's not clear how prevalent the glitch is, but not everyone is affected, suggesting it could be related to location or device model. As it stands, the current solution for affected users is just to re-delete the reappearing app while we await further details around the issue. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>(Thanks, Tanner!)</em><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/02/ios-18-4-update-deleted-apps-returning/\">iOS 18.4 Bug Seemingly Resurrects Previously Deleted iPhone Apps</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-18-4-bug-seemingly-resurrects-previously-deleted-iphone-apps.2454506/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9f6cfb0b3f8788a5eaade513349179a6c856fae31f4e29cbe6f823d6753347fd","category":"Apple"}
