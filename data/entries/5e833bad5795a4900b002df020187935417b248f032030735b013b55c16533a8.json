Based on an image <a href=\"https://www.ces.tech/Innovation-Awards/Honorees/2022/Honorees/C/Cypress-Hero-Backpack-with-Find-My-Capabilities.aspx\">shown on the CES website</a>, it appears the backpack will support Precision Finding, which allows users with an iPhone 11 or newer to see the exact distance and direction to the backpack with audible, visual, and haptic feedback. Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/08/apple-shares-nearby-interaction-accessory-details/\">opened up the U1 chip to third-party accessories</a> earlier this year.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIf the backpack is separated from its owner but outside of Bluetooth range, there is still a chance that the crowdsourced Find My network can help track it down. If another iPhone user happens to walk by the backpack, for example, their iPhone can detect Bluetooth signals from the backpack and relay the location back to its owner anonymously.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nTargus said the backpack has a padded compartment that can hold up to a 16-inch MacBook Pro, and several other compartments and pockets for additional devices and personal items. The \"equivalent of 26 plastic water bottles in recycled materials\" were used in producing each backpack, the company added.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe backpack is slated for retail availability in spring 2022, but pricing has yet to be disclosed.
