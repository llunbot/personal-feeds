Well, Wheels Manufacturing (Mfg) has released a new subscription club – the Random Derailleur Hanger of the Month Club. It works like this: you sign up to receive one random derailleur hanger every month. That way, if you ever need one, you may or may not receive the one you need in the mail. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cool, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><em>But wait, there’s more!</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wheels-Mfg-Random-Hanger-of-the-Month-man.webp\"><img width=\"853\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wheels-Mfg-Random-Hanger-of-the-Month-man.webp\" alt=\"Wheels Mfg Random Hanger of the Month man\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wheels-Mfg-Random-Hanger-of-the-Month-man.webp 853w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wheels-Mfg-Random-Hanger-of-the-Month-man-200x300.webp 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wheels-Mfg-Random-Hanger-of-the-Month-man-80x120.webp 80w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wheels-Mfg-Random-Hanger-of-the-Month-man-768x1152.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos / Wheels Mfg)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t know about you guys, but I have a bin that has so many random derailleur hangers that I’ve collected over the past decades, that I’m probably going to pass on joining this club. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it’s not just about shifting your bike properly. Over the many years, bike manufacturers have come up with so many different shapes and sizes of hangers that there is a never-ending sea of hangers. Wheels Mfg. thought, why not make them collectible!?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Wheels Mfg Random Derailleur Hanger of the Month Club</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Wheels Mfg says that the Random Derailleur Hanger of the Month Club is a “<em>completely unnecessary, oddly satisfying subscription service</em>“. The service promises to deliver a shiny new random derailleur hanger right to your door every month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It may not fit your bike, but that’s ok. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s in the Box?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wheels-Mfg-Random-Hanger-of-the-Month-girl-e1743458902280.webp\"><img width=\"850\" height=\"932\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wheels-Mfg-Random-Hanger-of-the-Month-girl-e1743458902280.webp\" alt=\"Wheels Mfg Random Hanger of the Month girl\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wheels-Mfg-Random-Hanger-of-the-Month-girl-e1743458902280.webp 850w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wheels-Mfg-Random-Hanger-of-the-Month-girl-e1743458902280-274x300.webp 274w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wheels-Mfg-Random-Hanger-of-the-Month-girl-e1743458902280-109x120.webp 109w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wheels-Mfg-Random-Hanger-of-the-Month-girl-e1743458902280-768x842.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>One completely<strong> random rear derailleur hanger</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li>A collectible spec card with facts like: “Allegedly fits a brand we couldn’t verify, possibly made during a lunar eclipse in the late 1900s.”</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A monthly opportunity to say, “What the heck is this one for?”</li>\n\n\n\n<li>And absolutely no guarantee it fits anything you own</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wheels-Mfg-Random-Hanger-of-the-Month-trade-with-friends.webp\"><img width=\"853\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wheels-Mfg-Random-Hanger-of-the-Month-trade-with-friends.webp\" alt=\"Wheels Mfg Random Hanger of the Month trade with friends\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wheels-Mfg-Random-Hanger-of-the-Month-trade-with-friends.webp 853w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wheels-Mfg-Random-Hanger-of-the-Month-trade-with-friends-200x300.webp 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wheels-Mfg-Random-Hanger-of-the-Month-trade-with-friends-80x120.webp 80w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wheels-Mfg-Random-Hanger-of-the-Month-trade-with-friends-768x1152.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Trade with your friends! </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Start Your Collection</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wheels-Mfg-Random-Hanger-of-the-Month-display.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wheels-Mfg-Random-Hanger-of-the-Month-display.webp\" alt=\"Wheels Mfg Random Hanger of the Month display\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wheels-Mfg-Random-Hanger-of-the-Month-display.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wheels-Mfg-Random-Hanger-of-the-Month-display-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wheels-Mfg-Random-Hanger-of-the-Month-display-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wheels-Mfg-Random-Hanger-of-the-Month-display-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wheels-Mfg-Random-Hanger-of-the-Month-display-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Wheels-Mfg-Random-Hanger-of-the-Month-display-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After a few months of receiving the random hangers, you’ll start to need a way to display them.
