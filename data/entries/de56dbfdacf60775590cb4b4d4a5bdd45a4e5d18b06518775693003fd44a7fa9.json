Health officials are investigating 161 others who may have been exposed.</p>\n<p>The outbreak is linked to cosmetic surgeries involving epidural anesthesia at two clinics in Matamoros, Mexico, just across the border from Brownsville, Texas. Mexican and US officials suspect that a component of the anesthetic was contaminated, resulting in the pathogenic fungus <em>Fusarium solani</em> being injected directly into people's spinal cords. The tainted surgeries are thought to have occurred between January 1, 2023, to May 13, 2023, around when the clinics were shut down by local health officials.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1951425#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1951425&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"de56dbfdacf60775590cb4b4d4a5bdd45a4e5d18b06518775693003fd44a7fa9","category":"Tech"}
