{"title":"Bikes of the Bunch: Surly Midnight Special","link":"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/10/bikes-of-the-bunch-surly-midnight-special/","date":1635469787000,"content":"<div><div><p><em>In this edition of Bikes of the Bunch, Lachlan Harrison-Smith (aka Lockyhs aka Lefthandside) shares his steel Surly Midnight Special. This article was initially published as a <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/signup/\" target=\"_blank\">VeloClub exclusive</a>.</em></p><hr><p>In the UK this bike took me over several days up to Harrogate to watch the 2019 Road World Champs (riding through drenching rains) and I also made it as far as Tuscany and Strade Bianche.</p><p>I’ve tweaked it further since returning to Melbourne just before the pandemic began. It’s now much squishier with 650b wheels and a bit slower, but in turn, it’s a capable all-day and all-night overland adventurer. I just love riding it.</p><p>I rode it up to New South Wales earlier in the year before blowing my knee to smithereens – I was planning to ride all the way to Canberra. Once lockdown ends you can be sure to find me on some trails around Melbourne’s perimeter. Stop and say hello!</p><h2>The details</h2><p>I am 185 cm with long femurs. This is a size 54 cm – deliberately small with lots of saddle setback to match my road bike setup (but with a higher front end and shorter stem). The Surly Midnight Special is touted as more of a road bike with mega tyre clearance and while it’s not light, the quality of the ride is brilliant. I am happy with it on road and off (though out of my depth in terms of skill!)</p><p>One of the reasons I set this up as a 1x drivetrain is so I could re-use existing parts from a single-speed alloy gravel bike I rode for years around Cambridgeshire (which is the flattest part of the UK). I use a Dura-Ace 11-speed TT shifter and it works brilliantly, with a satisfying ‘clunk’ as you drop it into gear. The setup is sensitive to cable tension and maintenance of gear inners/housings but I love the simplicity and I love mechanical drivetrains. My road bike (BMC SLR01) also features mechanical shifting and I’m currently hoarding Dura Ace 9000 parts like canned food for the end of days. </p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Surly-Midnight-Special-Bikes-of-the-Bunch-Lachlan-Harrison-Smith-15-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>Dura-Ace in the bar end.</figcaption></figure><p>I used to ride a Hope 700c wheelset that matched the bottom bracket and seatpost collar as a bit of a nod to one of my favourite UK brands. However, recently I had a set of beautiful 650b wheels built by Commuter Cycles in Brunswick (Melbourne) with a dynamo setup aimed squarely at epic bikepacking. The 650b wheelset did help a lot with toe overlap on the smaller frame size, so the bike is now way better off-road and on bike paths (<a href=\"https://www.google.com.au/maps/@-37.8109636,145.0098265,3a,70.8y,5.15h,93.68t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1s6IvOUhYME8onIEwSx4i-qQ!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fpanoid%3D6IvOUhYME8onIEwSx4i-qQ%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D159.92287%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Walmer Street bridge</a>, I’m looking at you).</p><p>The dynamo setup is a bit of a special one. The Schmidt SON hub is super efficient and I run both an ultra-bright Edelux II front light <em>and</em> a Sinewave Reactor USB charger in the top cap. That piece of tech is simply awesome. On an overnight adventure I can use it to charge a battery pack and once that’s full, I keep my Garmin (and anything else) topped up.</p><p>Also on the dynamo setup, in the depths of lockdown I did some further online shopping and installed the ‘dyna-snap’ magnetic connectors you can see above the front wheel. These make removing the wheel an absolute doddle.</p><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Surly-Midnight-Special-Bikes-of-the-Bunch-Lachlan-Harrison-Smith-8-1340x754.jpg\"><figcaption>Universal Surly Bicycle or Universal Serial Bus (USB)?</figcaption></figure><p>The DT Swiss rear hub has been absolutely rock solid, though I must say I miss the quick engagement of the old Hope Pro 4s. I might soon upgrade the DT internals from 18t to 36t.</p><p>Whatever you want to call them, I’m a fan of fenders/mudguards. Riding in the UK on salted, muddy roads it’s an absolute must to have a set of full-length mudguards. Back in Australia, even moving to 650b wheels I’ve kept them. I think they complete the look and you wouldn’t believe how much difference they make to keeping the drivetrain clean (plus I commute on this thing). The front strut is a custom addition and highly recommended if you’re riding on rough surfaces.</p><p>I commute on this bike and while I would prefer not to have the rack (or put a removable one on) I honestly forget about it once I’m riding it. Panniers are ugly but practical.</p><p>Finally the King Cage Iris grips bottles like an absolute champion. On a long adventure, I can add the Blackburn Outpost carrier to the front forks for additional storage, which works well generally but on extremely rutted roads you should check they are tightened properly. I did lose one bottle at the top of a long, steep, gravel descent, leading to a 40-minute retrieval hike back up, but that’s another story …</p><h2>Build</h2><p><strong>Frame and fork</strong>: Surly Midnight Special 2019<br><strong>Brakes</strong>: TRP Hylex levers and hydraulic calipers (with post-mount adapter)<br><strong>Shifter</strong>: Shimano Dura Ace TT<br><strong>Rear derailleur:</strong> GRX 812 rear mech, 11-speed<br><strong>Crankset:</strong> Shimano 105<br><strong>Bottom bracket</strong>: Hope with 24 mm stainless steel bearings<br><strong>Chainring</strong>: Wolf Tooth Drop-Stop Oval, 40T<br><strong>Cassette</strong>: Shimano XT 11-46T<br><strong>Wheels</strong>: DT Swiss 350 rear hub, Schmidt SON dynamo front hub, DT Swiss XM-421 rims (25 mm internal width), DT Swiss Competition spokes<br><strong>Tyres</strong>: Panaracer Gravelking SK 650×48<br><strong>Handlebars</strong>: Easton EA70 AX 16º flare<br><strong>Stem:</strong> Ritchey Comp 100 mm<br><strong>Seatpost:</strong> Alloy, 40 mm setback<br><strong>Saddle</strong>: Specialized Power Expert 155<br><strong>Mudguards</strong>: Velo Orange Wavy Noir 650b<br><strong>Dynamo</strong> <strong>kit</strong>: Schmidt Son Edelux II front light, Sinewave Reactor II USB charger, Dyna Snap connector kit<br><strong>Cages: </strong>King Cage Iris stainless steel mounts<br><strong>Mounts and racks</strong>: Zefal Gizmo universal mounting kit, Blackburn Outpost carrier (not shown in closeup), Tortec Ultralite rack<br></p><h2>Gallery</h2><figure><ul><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Surly-Midnight-Special-Bikes-of-the-Bunch-Lachlan-Harrison-Smith-3-1340x754.jpg\"></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Surly-Midnight-Special-Bikes-of-the-Bunch-Lachlan-Harrison-Smith-17-1340x754.jpg\"></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Surly-Midnight-Special-Bikes-of-the-Bunch-Lachlan-Harrison-Smith-16-1340x754.jpg\"></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Surly-Midnight-Special-Bikes-of-the-Bunch-Lachlan-Harrison-Smith-14-1340x754.jpg\"></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Surly-Midnight-Special-Bikes-of-the-Bunch-Lachlan-Harrison-Smith-13-1340x754.jpg\"></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Surly-Midnight-Special-Bikes-of-the-Bunch-Lachlan-Harrison-Smith-12-1340x754.jpg\"></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Surly-Midnight-Special-Bikes-of-the-Bunch-Lachlan-Harrison-Smith-11-1340x754.jpg\"></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Surly-Midnight-Special-Bikes-of-the-Bunch-Lachlan-Harrison-Smith-10-1340x754.jpg\"></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Surly-Midnight-Special-Bikes-of-the-Bunch-Lachlan-Harrison-Smith-9-1340x754.jpg\"></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Surly-Midnight-Special-Bikes-of-the-Bunch-Lachlan-Harrison-Smith-7.jpg\"></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Surly-Midnight-Special-Bikes-of-the-Bunch-Lachlan-Harrison-Smith-6-1340x754.jpg\"></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Surly-Midnight-Special-Bikes-of-the-Bunch-Lachlan-Harrison-Smith-5-1340x754.jpg\"></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Surly-Midnight-Special-Bikes-of-the-Bunch-Lachlan-Harrison-Smith-4-1340x754.jpg\"></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cdn-ctstaging.pressidium.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Surly-Midnight-Special-Bikes-of-the-Bunch-Lachlan-Harrison-Smith-1-1340x754.jpg\"></figure></li></ul></figure></div></div>","author":"Lachlan Harrison-Smith","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"6612dc5acf0667ad2414ec42f29bd345dd809d8682ecf9c7755ee0e989679408","category":"Cycling"}
