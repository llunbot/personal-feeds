Both will only be permitted to have \"read only\" access as needed to perform DOGE duties.</p>\n<p>US District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly approved the order Thursday, which was expected. She recommended this compromise in the lawsuit <a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/DOGE-Treasury-Lawsuit-Motion-for-Temporary-Restraining-Order-2-5-25.pdf\">seeking a temporary restraining order</a> to stop Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) from <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/musks-doge-clashes-with-treasury-over-access-to-payment-system-report-says/\">accessing Americans' sensitive Treasury Department data</a>.</p>\n<p>The order allows the two \"special government employees\" hired by the Treasury to continue accessing payments data to further DOGE's mission of eliminating government waste. But until the lawsuit is settled, DOGE and anyone outside the Treasury Department would be prohibited from reviewing that data directly, ensuring that nobody's government financial data is shared with any third parties without consent or proper notice.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/judge-suggests-temporary-order-blocking-doge-from-treasury-records/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/judge-suggests-temporary-order-blocking-doge-from-treasury-records/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"acf7c02b9d18e7a493c755c97a3927aae5b05ed75b037eb7d4329914e91d9c5f","category":"Tech"}
