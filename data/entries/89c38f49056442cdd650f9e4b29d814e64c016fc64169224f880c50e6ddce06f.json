The rules also mandate faster data transfers and easier device pairing for non-Apple hardware.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple argues the requirements force it to share sensitive user data with competitors, creating security risks. The company specifically highlighted requests from rivals seeking access to notification content and complete WiFi network histories â€“ data that \"even Apple doesn't see.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"At Apple, we design our technology to work seamlessly together,\" a company spokesperson said. \"The EU's interoperability requirements threaten that foundation, while creating a process that is unreasonable, costly, and stifles innovation.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe tech giant claims some companies are exploiting the DMA to bypass EU data protection standards. Apple has dedicated 500 engineers to DMA compliance efforts and launched a developer portal for interoperability requests. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nCompanies violating DMA rules face fines up to 10% of worldwide annual revenue. The Commission can also order business breakups in extreme cases.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/antitrust/\">Apple Antitrust</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/\">European Union</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/02/apple-appeals-eu-dma-interoperability-rules/\">Apple Appeals EU Digital Markets Act Interoperability Rules</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-appeals-eu-digital-markets-act-interoperability-rules.2458056/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"89c38f49056442cdd650f9e4b29d814e64c016fc64169224f880c50e6ddce06f","category":"Apple"}
