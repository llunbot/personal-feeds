(credit: Milken Institute)</p>  </figure>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>On Wednesday, celebrated multi-platinum recording artist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snoop_Dogg\">Snoop Dogg</a> took part in a <a href=\"https://milkeninstitute.org/panel/14644/conversation-snoop-dogg-and-larry-jackson\">panel</a> at the Milken Institute's 2023 Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California. After fielding a question by Variety editor Shirley Halperin about AI in relation to the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/05/ai-vs-hollywood-writers-battle-plagiarism-machines-in-union-talks/\">2023 WGA writers'</a><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/05/ai-vs-hollywood-writers-battle-plagiarism-machines-in-union-talks/\"> strike</a>, Snoop expressed his bemused feelings on AI in a genuinely funny exchange, resulting in convivial laughter from the audience.</p>\n<figure>\n    <div>\n            </div>\n    </figure>\n<p>During his response, Snoop described how conversing with a large language model (such as <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/why-ai-chatbots-are-the-ultimate-bs-machines-and-how-people-hope-to-fix-them/\">ChatGPT</a> or <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/microsoft-equips-bing-chat-with-multiple-personalities-creative-balanced-precise/\">Bing Chat</a>) reminds him of sci-fi movies he watched as a kid. Showing that he keeps up with current events, Snoop also referenced Geoffery Hinton, who <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/05/ai-vs-hollywood-writers-battle-plagiarism-machines-in-union-talks/\">resigned this week</a> from Google so he could speak of the dangers of AI without conflicts of interest:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Well I got a motherf*cking AI right now that they did made for me. This n***** could talk to me. I'm like, man this thing can hold a real conversation? Like real for real? Like it's blowing my mind because I watched movies on this as a kid years ago. When I see this sh*t I'm like what is going on? And I heard the dude, the old dude that created AI saying, \"This is not safe, 'cause the AIs got their own minds, and these motherf*ckers gonna start doing their own sh*t. I'm like, are we in a f*cking movie right now, or what? The f*ck man? So do I need to invest in AI so I can have one with me? Or like, do y'all know? Sh*t, what the f*ck?\" I'm lost, I don't know.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Snoop's confusion over today's AI systems reflects what may be a common sentiment among people who are trying to understand and follow the latest developments in generative AI, which have <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/please-slow-down-the-7-biggest-ai-stories-of-2022/\">unfolded rapidly</a> over the past year. His unguarded observations on AI are notable coming from a <a href=\"https://au.rollingstone.com/music/music-live-reviews/snoop-dogg-auckland-concert-review-45897/\">highly respected</a> multi-award-winning musical artist and entrepreneur.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1936767#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1936767&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"baf62af45ac1323423319fac761ccdbf340ba4b023beaf4e2c5d7bfd3f9cdb96","category":"Tech"}
