On the left side of the bar is a single rear camera, and on the right side there is a microphone and an LED camera flash.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iPhone-17-Air-Front-Page-Tech-Render-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nThe renders are consistent with an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/21/alleged-iphone-17-air-shell/\">alleged \"iPhone 17 Air\" shell</a> that surfaced last month.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWatch the video below.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nLast week, Front Page Tech shared <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/13/iphone-17-pro-camera-design-leak/\">alleged \"iPhone 17 Pro\" renders</a> showing that the camera bar will apparently extend to that device as well.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFront Page Tech host Jon Prosser has been a well-known tech YouTuber for more than a decade. Like most sources, he has a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/\">mixed track record</a> with Apple rumors, with  some hits and some misses. In 2020, he was the first source to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/14/prosser-airtags-design-likely-announced-tomorrow/\">reveal the design of the AirTag</a>, many months before it was announced. He also shared <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/11/ipad-mini-6-thinner-bezels-usb-c-rumor/\">many accurate details about the iPad mini 6</a>, months before that device was announced. On the other hand, he and others were wrong about the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/19/prosser-apple-watch-series-7-design/\">Apple Watch Series 7 having flat edges</a>, although perhaps Apple tested such a design.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nProsser also claimed that <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/17/ios-19-redesigned-camera-app-visionos-rumor/\">iOS 19 will introduce a redesigned Camera app</a> with a visionOS-like design, including translucent menus and buttons.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to announce the iPhone 17 series in September, and additional design-related rumors will likely surface before then.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jon-prosser/\">Jon Prosser</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/17/iphone-17-air-front-page-tech-renders/\">'iPhone 17 Air' With Ultra-Thin Design Allegedly Revealed in New Video</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-air-with-ultra-thin-design-allegedly-revealed-in-new-video.2449583/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9a83a38e8691db6e1024667af4d7ce1e97c3e62391e075c133ba59fdaabe74ef","category":"Apple"}
