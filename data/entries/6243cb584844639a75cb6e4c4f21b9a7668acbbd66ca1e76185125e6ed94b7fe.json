The third-generation model is also the last Apple TV that does not run tvOS, and thus lacks access to the App Store.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIntroduced <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2010/07/27/apples-battery-charger-sets-new-standby-usage-benchmark/\">in July 2010</a>, the Apple Battery Charger was priced at $29 and included six rechargeable AA batteries for use with the original Apple Wireless Keyboard, Magic Trackpad, and Magic Mouse for the Mac. Apple discontinued the charger around 2016 and the Magic accessories now have built-in batteries that can be recharged via Lightning.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn the past, vintage Apple products were no longer eligible for repairs at the Genius Bar or at Apple Authorized Service Providers, but Apple now provides service for up to seven years on vintage products, subject to parts availability.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe original Apple Watch was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/30/apple-watch-vintage-products/\">added to Apple's vintage products list</a> last week.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/vintage-and-obsolete/\">vintage and obsolete</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100\">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/04/apple-tv-3-and-apple-battery-charger-vintage/\">Apple Adding Its AA Battery Charger and Third-Generation Apple TV to Vintage Products List</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-adding-its-aa-battery-charger-and-third-generation-apple-tv-to-vintage-products-list.2315371/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=HUxfxOnC77Q:Nv-unC2tDPE:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=HUxfxOnC77Q:Nv-unC2tDPE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/HUxfxOnC77Q\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6243cb584844639a75cb6e4c4f21b9a7668acbbd66ca1e76185125e6ed94b7fe","category":"Apple"}
