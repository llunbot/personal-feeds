So Apple doesn’t have to do everything themselves. Developers, in particular, love <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/22/google-translate-default-ios-18\">modularity</a> and choices. But whatever they do, once-a-year updates to “Apple Intelligence” aren’t going to cut it. Since last WWDC there have been dozens of AI code generation advances across the industry. Just last week <a href=\"https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/16/openai-codex/#atom-everything\">OpenAI announced Codex</a>, their “cloud-based software engineering agent”. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://mjtsai.com/blog/2025/03/12/whither-swift-assist/\">Apple’s Swift Assist still hasn’t shipped</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/22/claude-4\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"c75dccf18aa7aed3911669763e911869da9903faec83409a97f533481fbb1b4b","category":"Tech"}
