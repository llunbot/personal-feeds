The U300 lever lock is one of the first smart locks created for these types of doors.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe U300 replaces a traditional lever or knob, offering smart functionality and the ability to keep an eye on who is coming or going.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe U300 is built with the latest Thread protocol and it is Matter-enabled, so it can be added to an Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/\">HomeKit</a> setup. It can be used alongside other smart home products in the Home app, or it can be used with additional features in the Aqara app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLike Aqara's U100 and U200 smart locks, the U300 is compatible with Apple Home Keys, so a digital key can be stored in the Wallet app on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> or Apple Watch for unlocking the door over NFC with a tap.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/aqara-u300-2.jpg\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1151\" />\r<br />\nAlong with Apple Home Keys and the Home app, the U300 can be unlocked using a fingerprint reader or a PIN with the included number pad. Aqara also offers NFC cards that can be used to unlock the door, and mechanical keys are provided in case of emergency like a power outage.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDigital keys can be provided for guests, and the U300 has a built-in feature that automatically locks the door behind you after a short period of time. Available in black or silver, the Aqara U300 has an IPX4 water resistance rating and is suitable for use indoors and outdoors.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe battery in the U300 lasts for up to 10 months before it needs to be swapped out, and it takes 4AA batteries. There's also a USB-C Emergency Port. While no hub is required to use the U300, the Aqara M3 Hub is recommended because it enables automations and remote access.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Aqara Smart Lock U300 can be <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D496H9YV\">purchased from Amazon</a> and other Aqara retailers.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/aqara/\">Aqara</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/homekit/\">HomeKit</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/03/aqara-u300-smart-lock/\">Aqara Debuts U300 Lever Smart Lock</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/aqara-debuts-u300-lever-smart-lock.2439005/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"caec636407bc9b191f573d89a8503fedc2926a52d3cd5f0bb0a6aa29f5afe9da","category":"Apple"}
