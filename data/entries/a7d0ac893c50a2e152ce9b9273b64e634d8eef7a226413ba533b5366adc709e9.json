However, Gurman claims Apple shifted resources to developing a cheaper model even before the Vision Pro was released, and he has now offered some more details on how Apple plans to build a more affordable spatial computing unit.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWriting in his <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-23/apple-vision-plans-cheaper-model-in-late-2025-vision-pro-2-in-2026-ar-glasses-lxrjk6wu\">latest Power On newsletter</a>, Gurman says that a prototype lower-cost headset, codenamed N107, has a narrower field of view compared to Vision Pro. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is also considering making this version more reliant on a tethered Mac or iPhone. \"That would let Apple save money on the processing power and components needed to make the Vision Pro a fully standalone product,\" he argues.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman says that Apple is still struggling to bring the cost down while retaining key features. But if it can, Apple plans to launch the cheaper headset as early as the end of 2025. Indeed, this has been the plan \"since before the Vision Pro was unveiled last year,\" he adds.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman doubled down on his reaction to last week's report by noting that Apple has no plans to abandon the high end of the headset market, and while it's \"less of a priority,\" Apple is still working on a second-generation Vision Pro, codenamed N109.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis model is said to look similar to the current Vision Pro, but has a faster processor and improvements to the external cameras. The company reportedly plans to release the Apple Vision Pro 2 by the end of 2026 at the earliest.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro\">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/24/cheaper-apple-vision-pro-tethered-iphone-mac/\">Cheaper Apple Vision Headset Might Require a Tethered iPhone or Mac</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/cheaper-apple-vision-headset-might-require-a-tethered-iphone-or-mac.2429938/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a7d0ac893c50a2e152ce9b9273b64e634d8eef7a226413ba533b5366adc709e9","category":"Apple"}
