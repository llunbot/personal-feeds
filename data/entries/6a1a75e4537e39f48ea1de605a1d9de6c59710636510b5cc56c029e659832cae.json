Shallower, narrower rims will be lighter than wide, deep-sections. And carbon weighs less than alloy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Hunt’s wheel range, for example, the alloy 4-Season All-Road Disc Wheelset weighs a claimed 1,680g. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A change to the brand’s 32 Aerodynamicist UD Carbon Spoke Disc Wheelset will lighten your bike by 463g. At a cost of £1,499, it’s not a cheap weight saving though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, you could drop £7,560 on the 1230g Lightweight Obermayer Evo Disc Wheelset. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only a handful of brands still make lightweight rim brake wheels but Lightweight still does, as does Partington. Meanwhile Hunt and Parcours offer more affordable options. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second-hand marketplaces are also a good place to search for rim brake wheels. Many will be tubular and pretty impractical, but lightweight clincher wheelsets like the Roval Rapide CLX occasionally pop up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without changing your rim, you can shed grams from your wheels by upgrading to lighter hubs, skewers or thru-axles, and spokes. For example, a pair of Extralite rim brake hubs weighs about 180g, 114g less than a set of DT Swiss 240 EXP Classic Hubs. </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n

brakes from range-topping groupsets are already very light. A boutique’s brand rim brake callipers can save additional weight, albeit at substantial cost. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, a set of SRAM Red Aero Link callipers weighs 230g. THM’s Carbones Fibula Road rim brakes weigh just 120g… and cost €1,350.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with rim brake groupsets, brands’ disc brakes get lighter as you move up the range. A 140mm Shimano Dura-Ace rotor weighs 31g less than a 105 rotor in the same size (90g versus 121g). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weight Weenies running disc brakes may be tempted by the 50g titanium disc rotors from Carver Bikes costing $119.95 each. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"327\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Subs-flash-for-web-1-970x327.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Subs-flash-for-web-1-970x327.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Subs-flash-for-web-1-300x101.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Subs-flash-for-web-1-768x259.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Subs-flash-for-web-1-1536x517.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Subs-flash-for-web-1-2048x689.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Subs-flash-for-web-1-750x252.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Subs-flash-for-web-1-1140x384.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tyres and tubes </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-tyres-1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"tan wall tyres\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-tyres-1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-tyres-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-tyres-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-tyres-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-tyres-1-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-tyres-1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-tyres-1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-tyres-1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-tyres-1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Vittoria-Corsa-Pro-tyres-1-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>James Spender</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Tyres and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-inner-tubes\" target=\"_blank\">inner tubes</a> are a very cost-effective way to make your bike lighter. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>TPU inner tubes can weigh as little as 40g each, saving you up to 100g per wheel over standard butyl inner tubes. For a cost of £15 to £30 per tube, that’s a good return. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s unwise to use less sealant in your tubeless setup to save weight. Instead upgrade to the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-road-cycling-tyres\" target=\"_blank\">best road bike tyres</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, the Panaracer Agilest TLR and Vittoria Corsa N.Ext tip the scales at about 250g in a 700x28c size. Lower quality road bike tyres typically weigh 100g more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you’re running tubeless or inner tubes, a time-trial tyre will be lightest of all. The 700x25c Michelin Power Time Trial weighs a scant 190g, but will be too fragile for everyday riding. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Groupsets </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/cannondale_hill_climb_nationals_2023-3-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"National Hill Climb Championship bike 2023\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/cannondale_hill_climb_nationals_2023-3-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/cannondale_hill_climb_nationals_2023-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/cannondale_hill_climb_nationals_2023-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/cannondale_hill_climb_nationals_2023-3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/cannondale_hill_climb_nationals_2023-3-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/cannondale_hill_climb_nationals_2023-3-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/cannondale_hill_climb_nationals_2023-3-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/cannondale_hill_climb_nationals_2023-3-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/cannondale_hill_climb_nationals_2023-3-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/cannondale_hill_climb_nationals_2023-3-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Charlotte Head</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A change of groupset components can save you about half a kilo without necessarily costing you more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The advent of electronic shifting and disc brakes has made groupsets heavier. Therefore, some older groupsets are lighter than contemporary versions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>SRAM Red 22, the 11-speed, mechanical version of the brand’s top-end groupset released in 2013, weighs 1,721g. It’s very hard to find these days, even second hand, but remains a hill climber’s favourite for good reason. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eleven years on, the latest <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/sram-red-axs-groupset-review-2024\" target=\"_blank\">SRAM Red AXS</a> is the world’s lightest electronic disc groupset at about 2,500g. The weight of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/shimano-dura-ace-r9200-groupset-review\" target=\"_blank\">Shimano Dura-Ace Di2 R9200</a> is almost identical. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With disc brake groupsets, more expensive generally equals lighter. For example, Shimano Ultegra Di2 will save you 373g over <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/shimano-105-di2-groupset-review\" target=\"_blank\">105 Di2</a> while costing about £600 more at full price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, 12-speed, mechanical 105 weighs less than both electronic groupsets. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don’t have to replace your whole groupset to make your bike lighter. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cross compatibility between brands’ different components enables you to fit lighter parts to your existing groupset. Upgrading from a<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/best-power-meters-cycling\" target=\"_blank\"> power meter</a>-equipped SRAM Rival AXS crankset to the Red AXS equivalent will save you about 200g. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aftermarket brands also offer slimmed down drivetrain parts. For example, Rotor says its Aldhu Carbon Crankset weighs 549g with 50/34t chainrings and 170mm cranks, rivalling SRAM Red and Dura-Ace in the weight stakes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If reducing weight to ride uphill is your primary objective, you could follow the example of hill climbers, who often use <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/power-of-one-the-rise-of-the-1x-groupset\" target=\"_blank\">1x drivetrains</a>. Removing the front derailleur and outer chainring can cut 400g from your bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A hill-climbing trend we don’t suggest you follow is <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/trek-emonda-drillium-hill-climb-championship-2023\" target=\"_blank\">drillium</a>. This weight-saving technique involves drilling holes into components, like the rear derailleur, to make them lighter. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Finishing kit</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/cervelo_chris_hall_hill_climb_national_2023-15-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"National Hill Climb Championship bike 2023\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/cervelo_chris_hall_hill_climb_national_2023-15-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/cervelo_chris_hall_hill_climb_national_2023-15-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/cervelo_chris_hall_hill_climb_national_2023-15-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/cervelo_chris_hall_hill_climb_national_2023-15-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/cervelo_chris_hall_hill_climb_national_2023-15-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/cervelo_chris_hall_hill_climb_national_2023-15-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/cervelo_chris_hall_hill_climb_national_2023-15-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/cervelo_chris_hall_hill_climb_national_2023-15-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/cervelo_chris_hall_hill_climb_national_2023-15-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/cervelo_chris_hall_hill_climb_national_2023-15-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Charlotte Head</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Finishing kit is another area where you can make your bike and wallet much lighter. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The €299 Darimo T1 Loop seatpost weighs a startling 90g in a 27.2mm diameter and 350mm length. One of the lightest stems available is the €199 Extralite HyperStem at 79g in a 100mm length. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for saddles, weighing 77g, Berk Composites’ £245 Lupina 3K Carbon Saddle is among the lightest out there. If you want more cushioning, the 123g Cadex Amp is extremely light for a padded saddle. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>More mainstream brands also make lighter and more expensive carbon versions of their handlebars, seatposts and saddles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, the Pro Vibe Superlight Carbon handlebar is up to 90g lighter than the Pro Vibe Alloy and £280 pricier. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When choosing a stem, bear in mind that alloy can sometimes be made lighter than carbon. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A narrower, compact handlebar may also weigh less than a wider bar with more reach and drop. That is if you decide to<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/focus-izalco-max-national-hill-climb-championships-2023\" target=\"_blank\"> leave the drops intact</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A cheaper way to reduce the weight of your seatpost is to cut excess length within the frame once you’ve set your saddle height correctly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cutting any steerer tube left above the stem after you’ve established your preferred handlebar height and removing the spacers will also make your bike lighter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’re unlikely to want to dispense with bar tape entirely like some hill climbers do. But using thinner tape and not wrapping over the handlebar tops will save a few grams. Plastic bar end plugs can weigh slightly less than metal ones.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Shoes and clothing </h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/10/aero_vs_lightweight_12-647x970.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/10/aero_vs_lightweight_12-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/10/aero_vs_lightweight_12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/10/aero_vs_lightweight_12-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/10/aero_vs_lightweight_12-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/10/aero_vs_lightweight_12-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/10/aero_vs_lightweight_12-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/10/aero_vs_lightweight_12.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>While not strictly part of your bike, shoes and clothing contribute to your system weight: the total mass of you and the bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lightweight summer kit is clearly lighter than warmer, winter clobber if temperatures allow. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-cycling-shoes\" target=\"_blank\">Cycling shoes </a>with laces, ventilated uppers and carbon soles are usually much lighter than standard shoes. For example, the Specialized S-Works Torch Lace weigh 465g in size EU45, up to 200g less than other premium models.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Accessories </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On rides where you can do without them, taking off accessories like mudguards, racks, bottle cages, bells and saddle bags saves hundreds of grams. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you do leave them on, lightweight alternatives exist. Elite’s 51g Flex Tex water bottle carried in a carbon <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-bottle-cage\" target=\"_blank\">bottle cage</a> will bring a modest weight saving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, Tailfin’s Carbon Pannier Rack will save weight-obsessed commuters and bikepackers about 700g over a traditional metal rack. </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-road-bike-wheels\">Best road bike wheels 2024: Aero, light and budget wheels reviewed</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/national-hill-climb-championship-2023-tech-gallery\">Super glue, sawn-offs and the dodgiest bodges: National Hill Climb Championship 2023 gallery</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/trek-emonda-drillium-hill-climb-championship-2023\">‘The saddle’s failed three times so far’: Weight-weenie Trek Émonda’s bonded seatpost and drillium brake pads</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-gravel-bike-upgrades\">Best gravel bike upgrades for every budget</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-road-bike-upgrades\">Best road bike upgrades for every budget</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/how-to-make-your-bike-lighter\">How to make your bike lighter</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Will Strickson &#124; Website Editor","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"6a1a75e4537e39f48ea1de605a1d9de6c59710636510b5cc56c029e659832cae","category":"Cycling"}
