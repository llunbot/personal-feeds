{"title":"Apple Pausing Advertising on X Following Latest Elon Musk Controversy","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/17/apple-pauses-ads-on-x/","date":1700252055000,"content":"Apple is pausing all of its advertising on social network X, formerly known as Twitter, reports <em><a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2023/11/17/apple-twitter-x-advertising-elon-musk-antisemitism-ads\">Axios</a></em>. The decision comes following antisemitic remarks that Musk <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1724908287471272299\">made on Wednesday</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/X-twitter-logo.jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nAfter advertisers fled from X after Musk's takeover of the social network, Apple continued to pay for ad spots, and has been one of the Twitter's largest ad partners. Back in March, Musk <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2023/03/elon-musk-thanks-apple-disney-advertising-on-twitter-whic-would-have-gone-bankrupt-without-him-1235282055/\">thanked Apple</a> for its support, calling the company one of Twitter's \"biggest advertisers.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple did <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/28/elon-musk-apple-stopped-twitter-ads/\">temporarily pause ads</a> on Twitter back in November 2022, which spurred Musk to lash out and ask if Apple hated \"free speech.\" Musk also said that Apple had threatened to remove Twitter from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, and said that he would \"make an alternative phone\" if the social network was ultimately pulled.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/30/elon-musk-tim-cook-meeting-apple-park/\">dispute was resolved</a> after Musk met with Cook at <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-park/\">Apple Park</a> later that year, after which Musk claimed that Apple had in fact never threatened to remove Twitter from the ‌App Store‌ and that it was a \"misunderstanding.\" Musk ultimately called it a \"good conversation,\" and after that point, Apple \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/12/03/apple-resumes-twitter-advertising/\">fully resumed</a>\" advertising. Reports in 2022 suggested Apple was spending more than <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-28/musk-says-that-apple-has-mostly-stopped-advertising-on-twitter\">$100 million per year</a> on Twitter ads.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith Musk's latest comments, and evidence that X is <a href=\"https://www.mediamatters.org/twitter/musk-endorses-antisemitic-conspiracy-theory-x-has-been-placing-ads-apple-bravo-ibm-oracle\">showing Apple ads</a> alongside pro-Hitler content, it is unclear if Apple will be convinced to resume advertising again sometime in the future. Apple CEO <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a> <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/18/tim-cook-says-apple-constantly-weighing-advertising-on-elon-musks-x.html\">in September said</a> that Apple is \"constantly\" evaluating whether Apple should be buying ads on the social network.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is not the only company pulling out of Twitter ads. IBM <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/elon-musk-x-antisemitism-twitter-ads-83e68f03e9bf1d261c1a8c55066c4e59\">said this week</a> that it is pulling ads, and the European Union also no longer plans to advertise on the social network. The White House earlier today <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/17/white-house-blasts-elon-musk-for-promoting-antisemitic-racist-hate.html\">condemned Musk's comments</a>, and X employees told <em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/16/technology/elon-musk-endorses-antisemitic-post-ibm.html\">The New York Times</a></em> that it has been fielding calls from other companies upset with Musk.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/twitter/\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/elon-musk/\">Elon Musk</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/17/apple-pauses-ads-on-x/\">Apple Pausing Advertising on X Following Latest Elon Musk Controversy</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pausing-advertising-on-x-following-latest-elon-musk-controversy.2411296/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"60297f6c74f9064482a88c347d97aa99428727ab1a7ab5a2cb41db6c5112c132","category":"Apple"}
