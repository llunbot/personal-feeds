As of this article's publication, it appears the problem has yet to be resolved.</p>\n<p>Users took to social media throughout the morning to complain that their phones were showing \"SOS\" mode, which allows emergency calls but nothing else. This is what phones sometimes offer when the user has no SIM registered on the device. Resetting the device and other common solutions do not resolve the issue. For much of the morning, Verizon offered no response to the reports.</p>\n<p>Within hours, more than 100,000 users reported problems on the website <a href=\"https://downdetector.com/status/verizon/map/\">Downdetector</a>. The problem does not appear isolated to any particular part of the country; users in California reported problems, and so did users on the East Coast and in Chicago, among other places.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053390#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053390&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ff9471cc59d4b023de4c90e14f1dc0157f16206e58ee5182788916e137d3d8e1","category":"Tech"}
