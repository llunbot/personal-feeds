{"title":"How to disable and replace the iPhone Camera app to avoid accidental triggers","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/1972509/how-to-disable-replace-iphone-camera-app.html","date":1689930000000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has made it simple to take a picture quickly with your iPhone: swipe left on the lock screen and the Camera app appears. (You can also set the Camera icon to appear on the lock screen in <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>Siri &amp;  Search</em> &gt; <em>Camera</em>, and then flip the switch for <em>Show on Home Screen</em>. And you can also swipe to reveal the Control Center and tap the Camera icon if you’ve enabled that in <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>Control Center</em>.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what if you want to make it more difficult to trigger the camera, especially after you’ve wound up taking too many photos of your pocket lining? I recently captured an amazing series of lint action shots during a visit to the Palace of Versailles in France, for instance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple doesn’t offer an option (yet) to disable using the Camera only at the lock screen. Instead, it’s an all-or-nothing proposition: you can either make it entirely impossible to use the Camera app on your iPhone, or you have to have it available everywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you find the lock-screen-swipe scenario unbearable, you could use a set of Apple tools to disable the Camera app and then trigger the launch of a third-party camera app instead. Here’s how to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, disable the Camera app using Screen Time:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Go to <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>Screen Time</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If it’s not yet enabled, follow prompts to enable it for yourself (not for a child using the phone).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>In Screen Time, go to <em>Content &amp; Privacy Restrictions</em>, enable <em>Content &amp; Privacy Restrictions</em>, tap <em>Allowed Apps</em>, and disable <em>Camera</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap the <em>Back</em> link at the top to make the change take effect.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mac911-shortcut-triple-tap-sbs-1.png?w=1200\" alt=\"Shortcut Triple Tap\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mac911-shortcut-triple-tap-sbs-1.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2427w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mac911-shortcut-triple-tap-sbs-1.png?resize=300%2C128&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mac911-shortcut-triple-tap-sbs-1.png?resize=768%2C328&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mac911-shortcut-triple-tap-sbs-1.png?resize=1200%2C513&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mac911-shortcut-triple-tap-sbs-1.png?resize=1536%2C657&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mac911-shortcut-triple-tap-sbs-1.png?resize=2048%2C876&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"513\" /><figcaption><p>Set up a shortcut for a third-party camera app, and then use accessibility to trigger it via back taps.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, after installing your camera app of choice, such as <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/halide-mark-ii-pro-camera/id885697368&amp;xcust=1-1-1972509-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Halide</a>, follow these steps:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Open the Shortcuts app.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap the plus (+) icon in the upper-right corner to create a new Shortcut.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>In the action window, tap <em>Open App</em>. (If it doesn’t appear, enter “Open App” in the search field at the bottom.)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap the blue-on-gray App link in the Open App action.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Select Halide (or another app).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap the dropdown arrow next to the name Open App at the top of the screen, tap <em>Rename</em>, and give the shortcut a recognizable name, like “Open Halide”.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap <em>Done</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Go to <em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>Accessibility</em> &gt; <em>Touch</em> &gt; <em>Back Tap</em> &gt; <em>Double Tap</em> or <em>Triple Tap</em>. This accessibility trigger lets you tap the back of your phone twice or three times to trigger an action, which includes shortcuts.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Select “Open Halide” from the shortcuts list.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, when you want to take a photo, you’ll need to either wake your phone by tapping the screen or unlock your phone, and then double- or triple-tap, depending on which shortcut you have assigned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This Mac 911 article is in response to a question submitted by Macworld reader Paul.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ask Mac 911</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve compiled a list of the questions we get asked most frequently, along with answers and links to columns: <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/3077986/os-x/your-top-questions-to-mac-911-and-some-answers.html\">read our super FAQ</a> to see if your question is covered.
