It entered the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bike-tyres/\">road bike tyre</a> market in 2018 with its ‘High-Performance’ and ‘Ultra High-Performance’ categories.</p>\n<p>The brand continues this categorisation with its latest tyres, but it has released updated compounds that use the ‘High-Performance’ and ‘Ultra-high Performance’ names.</p>\n<p>The Eagle F1 R and Eagle F1 SuperSport R sit in the Ultra-High Performance bracket. The Eagle and Vector Sport belong to the High-Performance category.</p>\n<p>The new models will complement Goodyear’s existing road tyres, including the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/tyres/road-bike-tyres/goodyear-vector-4seasons-tyre-review/\">Vector 4Seasons tyre</a>.</p>\n<h2>Compound advancements for faster tyres</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Goodyear Eagle F1 R tyre uses Goodyear’s new Dynamic: UHP compound.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Goodyear</i></span></div>\n<p>The four tyres, manufactured at Goodyear’s recently expanded factory in Taiwan, use the brand’s new Dynamic: High-Performance and Dynamic: Ultra-High Performance compounds.</p>\n<p>The new Dynamic: UHP compound is found on the Eagle F1 R and Eagle F1 SuperSport R tyres.</p>\n<p>Goodyear says data from third-party testing shows the tubeless Eagle F1 R and Eagle F1 SuperSport R tyre models outperform the first-generation Eagle F1 tyre.</p>\n<p>Compared to the previous Eagle F1, Goodyear claims the new Eagle SuperSport R’s rolling resistance has decreased by up to 35 per cent and grip has increased by up to 19 per cent, depending on tyre pressure.</p>\n<p>The Dynamic: HP compound, used on the Eagle and Vector Sport tyres, is said to improve puncture resistance while “maintaining dependable grip and low rolling resistance”.</p>\n<h2>Updated Tubeless Complete</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The new Tubeless Complete features a Dual Angle Bead said to make installing the tyre easier.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Goodyear</i></span></div>\n<p>When Goodyear expanded its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/goodyear-tubeless-complete/\">Ultra High-Performance range in 2020</a>, it introduced its Tubeless Complete technology.

This is said to make installing the tyres easier, reduce weight and help retain air.</p>\n<p>This technology appears on the Eagle F1 R and F1 SuperSport R, but Goodyear refers to the tubeless Eagle and Vector Sport simply as “tubeless ready”.</p>\n<h2>New casing</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The short-ply casing is said to create more supple and lighter tyres.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Goodyear</i></span></div>\n<p>The Eagle F1 R and Eagle F1 SuperSport R tyres feature Goodyear’s new short-ply casing.

It is said to result in a more supple and lighter tyre.</p>\n<p>Goodyear says the 700x25mm Eagle F1 SuperSport R is one of the lightest tubeless road tyres available, weighing a claimed 235g.</p>\n<p>The 700x25mm Eagle F1 R tubeless tyre weighs a claimed 280g and is said to offer an 8 per cent reduction in weight compared to the previous <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/tyres/road-bike-tyres/goodyear-eagle-f1-tubeless-review/\">Eagle F1 tubeless tyre</a>.</p>\n<p>The Eagle and Vector Sport use a 60 TPI casing.</p>\n<h2>R:Shield puncture protection</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Vector Sport tyre has two layers of R:Shield protection.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Goodyear</i></span></div>\n<p>Apart from the Eagle SuperSport F1, all the tyres feature Goodyear’s R:Shield.</p>\n<p>Goodyear describes this technology as a tightly-woven breaker belt.
