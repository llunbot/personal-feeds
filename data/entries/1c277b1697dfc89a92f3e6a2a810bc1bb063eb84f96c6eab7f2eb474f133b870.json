There I was in the gutter, trading spit and\nflinging sewage. Well, yes, but it was fun. And if you came\ncorrect, we could argue, perhaps even laugh, as many new friends\ncame to understand. But if you came to play, we played. I’m from\nBaltimore, where The Dozens are an American cultural artform like\nany other.</p>\n\n<p>An aggrieved bystander once called the act graceless. I\nreadily agreed:</p>\n\n<p>“This is Twitter. There is no grace. None. Here in an orgy of\norganized disinformation and trollery, our republic has come to\ndie. There is no teaching the fuckmooks and deplorati. Go down\nswinging. Use every cruel word. Invoke their mothers. Lather them\nwith contempt. Enjoy.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In need of an outlet while the WGA strike continues, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aodespair\">he’s back</a>.
