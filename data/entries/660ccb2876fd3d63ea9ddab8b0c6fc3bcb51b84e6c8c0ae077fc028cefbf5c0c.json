{"title":"Apple Watch Could Get visionOS-Like Redesign, Apple Intelligence Support","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/09/apple-watch-visionos-design/","date":1744237674000,"content":"The an upcoming version of watchOS will bring a visionOS-like redesign to the Apple Watch, much like the design updates coming in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/\">iOS 19</a> and macOS 16, claims Israeli site <em><a href=\"https://theverifier.co.il/71516/exclusive-watchos-apple-intelligence-hi-visionos/\">The Verifier</a></em>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/apple-watch-ultra-2-new-black.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nwatchOS will eventually have \"elements\" of visionOS, including a look that is bolder, slightly transparent, and with a floating aesthetic. Buttons, menus, icons, and other user interface elements will reportedly be refreshed, with Apple \"working on several ideas\" for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-screen/\">Home Screen</a>. <em>The Verifier</em> does not know when these design changes will come, as the features are allegedly still being developed.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe site also claims that Apple is working on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a> features for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> and the Apple Watch Ultra. The Apple Watch Ultra will allegedly get a new, exclusive chip that will allow it to run ‌Apple Intelligence‌, though this is a questionable claim because Apple has been bringing ‌Apple Intelligence‌ features to as many devices as possible, not restricting the functionality to its higher-end products.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOf all the devices announced since WWDC 2024, only the most recent low-cost <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> does not support ‌Apple Intelligence‌. Everything else, including the mid-budget <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/\">iPhone 16e</a>, features ‌Apple Intelligence‌. Allegedly, the Apple Watch Ultra will get ‌Apple Intelligence‌ first, with the feature set to come to other Apple Watch models \"a year later.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs of right now, the Apple Watch models only have 1GB RAM, and ‌Apple Intelligence‌ requires 8GB RAM at a minimum, so that is another red flag with <em>The Verifier</em>'s claims. The site says that ‌Apple Intelligence‌ features on Apple Watch will include notification summaries, the ability to create <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/genmoji/\">Genmoji</a>, and a \"new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>\" that understands user behavior and garners information from \"sports activity, AI medical monitoring, sleep tracking, heart rate activity, and more.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is worth noting that <em>The Verifier</em> doesn't have the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theverifier-co-il/\">best track record</a> when it comes to rumors. Last year, the site said <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a> would get a visionOS redesign, which didn't happen. Other rumors that have not panned out have included <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a> for the Apple Watch, a kids mode for the ‌Apple TV‌, the launch date for a new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a>, and several incorrect predictions about different versions of iOS dropping support for older devices.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch 10</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra\">Apple Watch Ultra (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/09/apple-watch-visionos-design/\">Apple Watch Could Get visionOS-Like Redesign, Apple Intelligence Support</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-watch-could-get-visionos-like-redesign-apple-intelligence-support.2455029/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"660ccb2876fd3d63ea9ddab8b0c6fc3bcb51b84e6c8c0ae077fc028cefbf5c0c","category":"Apple"}
