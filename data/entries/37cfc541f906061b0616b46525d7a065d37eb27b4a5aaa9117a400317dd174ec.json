Today, the company is finally filling in that gap with the new Radeon RX 7800 XT and RX 7700 XT, both advertised as 1440p graphics cards and available starting at $449 and $499, respectively. Both cards will be available on September 6. And most Radeon RX 6000 and RX 7000 GPUs sold between now and September 30 will come with a free copy of Bethesda's upcoming \"<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/06/bethesdas-starfield-direct-shows-off-a-massive-galactic-scale-space-rpg/\"><em>Skyrim</em> in space</a>\" title, <em>Starfield.</em></p>\n<p>AMD kept the prices of both cards under wraps while pre-briefing members of the press about the announcement, which is unusual but not hard to explain. AMD's RX 7600 launch was spoiled a bit by Nvidia, which preempted the 7600's announcement by offering a more powerful GeForce RTX 4060 at <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/nvidias-399-4060-ti-comes-with-no-price-hike-but-mild-performance-improvements/\">the same $299 price</a> that AMD had planned for the 7600. This prompted AMD to cut the 7600's price to $269 before it was even announced; we'll have to wait and see if Nvidia chooses to change its prices in response to the new Radeon cards' launch.</p>\n<div><img alt=\"The full lineup of RX 7000-series graphics cards.

(credit: AMD)</p></div>\n<p>The RX 7700 XT and 7800 XT are based on the same RDNA 3 graphics architecture as the other 7000-series GPUs, which means a more efficient manufacturing process than the RX 6000 series, DisplayPort 2.1 support, and hardware acceleration for encoding with the AV1 video codec, which promises game streamers either higher-quality video at the same bitrate as older codecs or the same quality with a lower bitrate. AMD compared the 7800 XT and 7700 XT favorably to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/nvidias-599-geforce-rtx-4070-is-a-more-reasonably-priced-and-sized-ada-gpu/\">Nvidia's $600 upper-midrange RTX 4070</a> and the $500 16GB version of the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/review-nvidias-399-rtx-4060-ti-is-mostly-a-step-forward-but-only-a-small-one/\">RTX 4060 Ti</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1962496#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1962496&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"37cfc541f906061b0616b46525d7a065d37eb27b4a5aaa9117a400317dd174ec","category":"Tech"}
