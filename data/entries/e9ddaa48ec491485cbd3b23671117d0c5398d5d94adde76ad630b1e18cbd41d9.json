That could mean Apple is on a yearly cycle with the MacBook Pro and the next generation could be released in the fall of 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article will keep track of the rumors and offer a perspective based on Apple’s Mac lineup throughout 2025. Here’s everything we know so far.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Update March  31, 2025</strong>: The M5 MacBook Pro is on schedule for a release in the October/November timeframe.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New M5 MacBook Pro: Release date</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The release of the M5 MacBook Pro depends on the availability of the M5 series of chips. A <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2545266/the-ipad-pro-is-tapped-to-get-the-m5-chip-before-the-mac-again.html\">report in December 2024</a> stated that the M5 iPad Pro could be available in the second half of 2025. That suggests Apple could release the M5 iPad Pro at the same time as the iPhone 17 in September or early October, and then the M5 MacBook Pro could be revealed in late October or early November.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-03-30/apple-readies-biggest-push-into-health-yet-with-revamped-app-ai-doctor-service-m8vl97k2\">reported</a> on March 30 that Apple is on schedule to ship the M5 MacBook Pro “around the same time of year” as when the M4 and M3 MacBook Pro shipped. That means an October/November timeframe.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New M5 MacBook Pro: Design and Features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple updated the design of the MacBook Pro in 2021 and it seems like Apple will stick with it for a while. It’s always possible that a new color makes an appearance—like Space Black in 2023—but for the most part, the MacBook Pro design is set for a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, with the launch of the M4 MacBook Pro, Apple made a series of upgrades that replaced outdated components, including upping the base RAM to 16GB, adding a 12MP FaceTime camera, bringing Thunderbolt 5 to the M4 Pro and Max models, and offering a Nano-texture glass option.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/14inch-m4-macbook-pro-right-angle.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"14inch M4 MacBook Pro\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/14inch-m4-macbook-pro-right-angle.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/14inch-m4-macbook-pro-right-angle.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/14inch-m4-macbook-pro-right-angle.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/14inch-m4-macbook-pro-right-angle.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/14inch-m4-macbook-pro-right-angle.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/14inch-m4-macbook-pro-right-angle.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/14inch-m4-macbook-pro-right-angle.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/14inch-m4-macbook-pro-right-angle.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Apple could be saving any drastic changes to the MacBook Pro for 2026.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple appears to be saving the next major design upgrade for the MacBook Pro for 2026. These upgrades include <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2348163/ipad-pro-oled-display-macbook-2026.html\">OLED screens</a>, a camera “hole” that <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2550737/report-the-oled-macbook-pro-will-dump-the-notch-for-a-camera-hole.html\">replaces the notch</a>, and a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2508939/major-changes-are-coming-to-the-macbook-pro-but-not-until-2026.html\">thinner design</a> to go along with the M6 chip. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On February 11, 2025, The Elec <a href=\"https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=32837\">reported</a> that OLED displays for the MacBook Pro are going into production, but they won’t be featured in the laptop until 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New M5 MacBook Pro: Processor and specs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With its third straight annual update, it’s possible that the M5 MacBook Pro is little more than a chip refresh. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2508939/major-changes-are-coming-to-the-macbook-pro-but-not-until-2026.html\">Reports</a> say to expect the typical performance boost from one chip generation to another–between 15 and 25 percent over the M4.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elsewhere, it’s possible that the M5 MacBook Pros get WiFi 7 and the entry-level model gets Thunderbolt 5. There are reports that Apple is working on a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2550395/the-macbook-with-a-modem-dream-may-finally-come-true.html\">5G modem for the Mac</a>, but it’s unlikely to arrive before 2026.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New M5 MacBook Pro: Price</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the prices for the current standard configurations of the M4 MacBook Pro, for reference.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>14-inch MacBook Pro</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>$1,599/£1,599: M4 with a 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 16GB unified memory, 512GB SSD, Thunderbolt 4</li>\n\n\n\n<li>$1,799/£1,799: M4 with a 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 16GB unified memory, 1TB SSD, Thunderbolt 4</li>\n\n\n\n<li>$1,999/£1,999: M4 with a 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 24GB unified memory, 1GB SSD, Thunderbolt 4</li>\n\n\n\n<li>$1,999/£1,999: M4 Pro with a 12-core CPU, 16-core GPU, 24GB unified memory, 512GB SSD, Thunderbolt 5</li>\n\n\n\n<li>$2,399/£2,399: M4 Pro with a 14-core CPU, 20-core GPU, 24GB unified memory, 512TB SSD, Thunderbolt 5</li>\n\n\n\n<li>$3,199/£3,199: M4 Max with a 14-core CPU, 32-core GPU, 36GB unified memory, 1TB SSD, Thunderbolt 5</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>16-inch MacBook Pro</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>$2,499/£2,499: M4 Pro with a 14-core CPU, 20-core GPU, 24GB unified memory, 512GB SSD, Thunderbolt 5</li>\n\n\n\n<li>$2,899/£2,899: M4 Pro with a 14-core CPU, 20-core GPU, 48GB unified memory, 512TB SSD, Thunderbolt 5</li>\n\n\n\n<li>$3,499/£3,499: M4 Max with a 14-core CPU, 32-core GPU, 36GB unified memory, 1TB SSD, Thunderbolt 5</li>\n\n\n\n<li>$3,999/£3,999: M4 Max with a 16-core CPU, 40-core GPU, 48GB unified memory, 1TB SSD, Thunderbolt 5</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple will likely offer similar configurations, and based on recent history, prices will remain the same with one caveat: In the U.S., the government could pass <a href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2521477/trump-tariffs-could-cost-tech-consumers-bigly.html\">new import tariffs,</a> which could increase prices.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"e9ddaa48ec491485cbd3b23671117d0c5398d5d94adde76ad630b1e18cbd41d9","category":"Apple"}
