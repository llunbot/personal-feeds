Your choice in monitor shape and size can make virtual worlds seem more real, and responsive peripherals that eliminate lag make your movements more fluid. Audio also has a dramatic effect. Gaming hardware company Razer claims it has upped the ante by applying haptic feedback to gaming headsets, just like you would find in a controller. But do vibrations on your head make your experience more fun?</p>\n<p>Razer announced three new headsets today: the <a href=\"https://www.razer.com/gaming-headsets/razer-kraken-v3\" target=\"_blank\">Razer Kraken V3</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.razer.com/gaming-headsets/razer-kraken-v3-hypersense\" target=\"_blank\">Razer Kraken V3 HyperSense</a>, and the wireless <a href=\"https://www.razer.com/gaming-headsets/razer-kraken-v3-pro\" target=\"_blank\">Razer Kraken V3 Pro</a>. As you might guess by the “V3” nomenclature, these are updates to the Razer Kraken line, which currently also includes the vibration-free <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3nj5E0K\" target=\"_blank\">Razer Kraken V3 X</a>, among other sets.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Razer-Kraken-V3-HyperSense.jpg\"><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Razer-Kraken-V3-HyperSense-640x360.jpg\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Razer-Kraken-V3-HyperSense.jpg\">Razer Kraken V3 HyperSense.</a> (credit: Razer)</p></div>\n<p>The Kraken V3 HyperSense and Kraken V3 Pro both use haptic feedback. Razer calls the feature <a href=\"https://www.razer.com/technology/razer-hypersense\" target=\"_blank\">HyperSense</a>, and it employs haptic drivers in each earcup. The drivers take “the shape and frequencies of game audio,” as Razer puts it, processes them in under 5 ms, and turns them into vibrations. Digital signal processing covers a frequency range of 20–200 Hz.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1806355#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1806355&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b25f4ebc6996278971621f303b0d6fd706731edc41731784dc1e75a0087070da","category":"Tech"}
