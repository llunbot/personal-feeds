The action plays content at double speed, similar to a feature already available on TikTok.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/Instagram-Feature-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" />\r<br />\nThe Meta-owned platform initially limited Reels to 15-second clips but has since expanded the maximum duration to three minutes, making playback controls increasingly necessary for users who want to quickly navigate through longer content.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo use the new feature, simply press and hold on the right or left side of their screen while watching a Reel. The video will then play at 2x speed, enabling you to skip to the parts that interest you most.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nInstagram users have become accustomed to consuming quick, bite-sized content, so the ability to fast-forward increases the likelihood that they will watch Reels through to completion rather than scrolling past longer videos.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/2x-Speed_Still_2.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1440\" height=\"1440\" />\r<br />\nIt's the latest in a series of TikTok-inspired features that Instagram has added in its ongoing effort to compete in the short-form video market. Previously, Instagram introduced Remix, a direct copy of TikTok's Duet functionality, which allows users to create content alongside existing videos.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>(Via <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/27/instagram-now-lets-you-speed-up-videos-just-like-on-tiktok\">TechCrunch</a>.)</em><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instagram/\">Instagram</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/28/instagram-new-fast-forward-feature/\">Instagram's New Fast-Forward Feature Lets You Skip Ahead in Reels</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/instagrams-new-fast-forward-feature-lets-you-skip-ahead-in-reels.2454223/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7c9ad62fe9a07983dc27c78bc21c654a80b1e255b8527b7a93102a742051a680","category":"Apple"}
