Apple will give people topics to write about such as a workout or a meeting, and there will be an \"All Day People Discovery\" feature that determines when a user is in close proximity to other people. The app will know when users receive text messages, phone calls, and other notifications, but privacy will be a focus and everything will be done on-device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe journaling app appears to be a health-related initiative that will analyze what each user's typical day is like, and it could integrate <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/25/ios-17-health-app-updates/\">with a mood tracking feature</a> that Apple also has planned for ‌iOS 17‌. The emotion tracking app will let users keep track of their mood, answer questions about their day, and view the results over time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith the journaling app and the mood tracking functionality, Apple plans to bring the Health app to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> for the first time, allowing ‌iPad‌ owners to view their health-related data even when an ‌iPhone‌ is unavailable.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThird-party app developers like Day One have long offered journaling platforms for the ‌iPhone‌ and the ‌iPad‌, and based on early reports, it sounds like Apple's offering could be similar to what's possible with Day One.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBack in April when news of <a href=\"https://dayoneapp.com/blog/apple-journaling-app/\">Apple's journaling app</a> came out, Day One said that it is \"excited\" Apple will bring journaling to a wider audience, and that it plans to ensure that the Day One app \"remains the very best option\" for those interested in journaling.
