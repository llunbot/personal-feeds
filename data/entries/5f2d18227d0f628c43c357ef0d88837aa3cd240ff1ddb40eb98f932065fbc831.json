Mike Varley from Black Mountain Cycles shelved the Road model in 2020 and for 2025, he’s brought it back. A simple rim brake road bike like this very model is how Mike started his life of bicycles in 1984. It’s the type of bike he seems to always fall back on to.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://theradavist.com/riding-as-ceremony-a-vintage-road-bike-is-all-you-need/\" target=\"_blank\">The zen-like quality of riding on the road</a>, just pedaling, hearing the tires sing on the tarmac, and feeling the wind on one’s face is what it’s all about. Since shelving the model, Mike always said that if there were enough demand, he would bring the Road frame back. And here it is. Could be a limited run or… let’s just say, never say never.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sizes: 50cm, 53cm, 56cm, 59cm – sorry, tall riders, the minimum quantity per frame size is simply too high to justify ordering what would be a 5-year supply.</li>\n<li>Light-weight 4130 cr-mo double-butted tubeset</li>\n<li>Flat plate style crown</li>\n<li>Mounts for front and rear fenders</li>\n<li>Two sets of water bottle mounts</li>\n<li>Investment cast rear dropout</li>\n<li>Designed to fit 700c x 32 tires, 35mm max</li>\n<li>Orange RAL 2011</li>\n<li>Includes seat post clamp</li>\n<li>130mm rear spacing</li>\n<li>Add a headset with your frame.  Installation is free with frame/headset purchase.</li>\n<li>More info on the <a href=\"https://blackmtncycles.com/road-25-tech-info/\">Road ’25 Tech page</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Road model is available as a frame for $875 or complete builds featuring Shimano 105 or Ultegra.
