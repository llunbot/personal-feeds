Samsung is a major supplier of display panels used in Apple devices, and is known to have <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/09/10/apple-orders-samsung-foldable-display-samples/\">provided foldable display samples to Apple</a> in the past. A recent report also claimed that Samsung has been attempting to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/11/apple-foldable-panels-samsung-display/\">strengthen its operational efficiency</a> in anticipation of Apple's first foldable products by integrating the expertise it has gained making foldable devices since 2019. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nHowever, the source of today's rumor claims that Samsung's latest folding panels \"broke down after a few days\" under Apple's rigorous internal testing, which has caused Apple to put the entire project on ice for the foreseeable future, or at least until a display that can meet its high standards can be developed.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/07/apple-continuing-work-on-folding-iphones/\">report</a> from <em>The Information</em> earlier this month, Apple has been actively building prototypes of at least two foldable iPhones following over five years of research and development. The two iPhone prototypes are said to fold widthwise like a clamshell, but do not feature in Apple's product roadmap for 2024 or 2025. The report noted that the foldable iPhones could still be canceled if they do not meet Apple's standards.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Weibo account purporting to have received information about the foldable project's suspension at Apple is a largely unknown quantity, having no previous track record for Apple rumors to our knowledge, therefore skepticism about its accuracy is warranted. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's also unclear whether the claim impacts Apple's continuing work on a foldable iPad. Apple is rumored to be more interested in such a device, which could be thicker than a foldable ‌iPhone‌ since users would not expect to carry it in their pocket and it would not need to pass the high durability requirements of an ‌iPhone‌. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nEarlier this month, Korean outlet <em>The Elec</em> <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/02/apple-foldable-2026-could-replace-ipad-mini/\">reported</a> that Apple is considering launching its first foldable in the next few years in the form of a 7- to 8-inch device that could ultimately replace the 8.3-inch iPad mini.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/\">Foldable iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-ipad/\">Foldable iPad</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fixed-focus-digital/\">Fixed Focus Digital</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/16/foldable-iphone-paused-failing-screens/\">Foldable iPhone Development Allegedly Paused Due to Failing Screens</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/foldable-iphone-development-allegedly-paused-due-to-failing-screens.2419605/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d250c8d273dd0f3429c2573fed955c2500c1ade5aa5686cdf65202345db0a0da","category":"Apple"}
