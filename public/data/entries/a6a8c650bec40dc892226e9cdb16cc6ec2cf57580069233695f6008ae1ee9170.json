We’ve put together a macOS compatibility checker that will show you what Macs the different versions of macOS and Mac OS X support so you can tell what version you should be running on your Mac.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Mac operating systems can my Mac run?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple releases a new version of the Mac operating system almost every year—but the new version of the Mac operating system will not support every Mac. Each year more and more Macs fall off the compatibility list and are unable to be updated to take advantage of the latest features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With macOS Ventura now available to download on compatible Macs, it’s likely that many Mac users will be wondering if their Mac can support the newest version of macOS. Read on to find out which Macs are supported by each version of the Mac operating system. For advice about installing Ventura read:<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671172/how-to-update-macos.html\"> How to install Ventura on your Mac.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Officially, the operating system that was available on your Mac at the time that you bought it is the oldest version of macOS that can run on that Mac. It’s likely that an older OS won’t include the necessary drivers for the hardware on your newer Mac. For this reason, it is unlikely that you will be able to install an older version of macOS on a new Mac—but you can take a look at <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673171/how-to-install-older-versions-of-macos-or-os-x.html\">how to install old versions of macOS or OS X</a> for other Macs. Owners of M1 Macs also won’t be able to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676359/can-m1-macs-run-older-versions-of-macos.html\">run older versions of macOS on M1 Macs</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it may not just be a case of wanting to know if your Mac can run the newest operating system. Some people will want to know if it is possible to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671318/how-to-downgrade-macos-revert-back.html\">downgrade their Mac to an older version of macOS</a> and need to know the oldest version of macOS. You’ll also find that below. You can also see a complete <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672681/list-of-all-macos-versions-including-the-latest-macos.html\">list of all the different versions of macOS and Mac OS X</a>.
