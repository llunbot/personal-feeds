{"title":"Bigfoot, Orca, Distorted Smiley Face and Treasure Chest Among New Emoji Coming to iOS","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/14/unicode-17-emoji-characters/","date":1731616311000,"content":"Every year, the Unicode Consortium decides on new emoji characters that will be coming to smartphones and other devices in the future, and this week, the Unicode 17 emoji recommendations came out [<a href=\"https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2024/24226r-esr-report-q4-2024.pdf\">PDF</a>].\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/unicode-17-characters.jpg\" width=\"1765\" height=\"993\" />\r<br />\nEight new emoji characters have been proposed, including hairy creature (like Bigfoot), distorted face, fight cloud, apple core, orca, trombone, landslide, and treasure chest. There are also skin tone variations for a number of existing emoji like ballet dancer, people with bunny ears, and people wrestling.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Unicode consortium created mockups of what the emoji might look like, with the images <a href=\"https://blog.emojipedia.org/draft-emoji-list-for-2025-2026-revealed/\">shared by <em>Emojipedia</em></a>. It is important to note that the Unicode Consortium only comes up with the underlying emoji code, and Apple designers will create their own version of each character in the Apple style when the Unicode 17 standard is finalized.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUnicode 17 will likely be approved sometime next fall, though it will take Apple time to implement the new characters. We could see them around spring 2026 if Apple sticks with its typical emoji release timeline.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn 2025, Apple will introduce the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/21/ios-18-emoji-characters/\">Unicode 16 characters</a>, which were approved in September 2024. Unicode 16 emoji include face with bags under eyes, fingerprint, leafless tree, root vegetable, harp, shovel, and splatter.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple last introduced new emoji <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-17-4-features/\">with the iOS 17.4 update</a> that was released in March 2024. Characters added in iOS 17.4 include lime, an edible brown mushroom, a phoenix, a broken chain, shaking head vertically (as in a \"yes\" nod), and shaking head horizontally (a \"no\" head shake).\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/\">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.2, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/genmoji/\">will debut Genmoji</a> for devices that support <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a>. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/genmoji/\">Genmoji</a> are a customizable version of emoji that are generated based on a phrase supplied by the user. ‌Genmoji‌ behave like emoji on Apple devices, but are not cross-platform and don't display like emoji characters on Android devices.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/emoji/\">Emoji</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/14/unicode-17-emoji-characters/\">Bigfoot, Orca, Distorted Smiley Face and Treasure Chest Among New Emoji Coming to iOS</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/bigfoot-orca-distorted-smiley-face-and-treasure-chest-among-new-emoji-coming-to-ios.2443003/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"cbcb898c8de401c369b1bfdf5fe6726c609e1f8462d345376cb6674c515b0f79","category":"Apple"}
