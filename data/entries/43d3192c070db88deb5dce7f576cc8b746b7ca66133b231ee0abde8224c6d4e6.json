It used to occupy a lot of attention. But it still crops up whenever you’re trying to put files on a USB thumb drive to hand off to someone else. If you’re both Mac users, swell; with Mac and Windows in the mix, you might be tempted to pick FAT32 when formatting that thumb drive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But FAT32 is distinctly out of date. Designed for an earlier time, it can’t handle files larger than 4GB. Instead, pick ExFAT, its replacement (and still quite old), best used on drives of 32GB or larger capacity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While first ensuring you have a copy of any data on a drive you want to format as ExFAT, as formatting will erase the drive’s contents, follow these steps:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Attach the drive to your Mac.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Launch Disk Utility (from <em>Applications &gt; Utilities &gt; Disk Utility</em>).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Select the drive in the left-hand sidebar.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click <em>Erase</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>From the Format menu, select <em>ExFAT</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>From the Scheme menu, select <em>Master Boot Record</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click <em>Erase</em> and follow prompts to confirm.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/disk-utility-format-drive.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Disk Utility format drive\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/disk-utility-format-drive.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1600w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/disk-utility-format-drive.jpg?resize=300%2C155&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/disk-utility-format-drive.jpg?resize=768%2C397&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/disk-utility-format-drive.jpg?resize=1200%2C620&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/disk-utility-format-drive.jpg?resize=1536%2C794&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"620\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This Mac 911 article is in response to a question submitted by Macworld reader Robin.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have more advice about <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671300/how-to-format-a-drive-on-a-mac.html\">How to format a drive on a Mac</a> in a separate article. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ask Mac 911</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve compiled a list of the questions we get asked most frequently along with answers and links to columns: \n<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/228117/your-top-questions-to-mac-911-and-some-answers.html\">read our super FAQ</a> to see if your question is covered.
