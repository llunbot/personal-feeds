Even though I had taken multiple measures to prevent the theft of my account (including two-factor authentication), the attacker made it impossible for me to log in (though they were locked out of the account as well). It took several weeks and some high-level communication with Twitter to restore my account. As someone whose livelihood is tied to getting the word out about things with a verified Twitter account, this went beyond inconvenience and was really screwing with my job.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1804312#p3\">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1804312&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sean Gallagher","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"412d0eeafd417992707b17557b5f019a791b27c3c999a07fa3f943cdd0b9675f","category":"Tech"}
