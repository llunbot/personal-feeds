When a video recording is in progress, there is now a pause button on the left side of the Camera Remote interface. Tapping it pauses a video, and then tapping the red record button restarts the video.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple initially added a feature for pausing video recordings with the ‌iPhone‌ Camera app in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, and the watchOS 11.2 update expands that same functionality to the Apple Watch's Camera Remote app. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nOther new additions in watchOS 11.2 include expanded support for tidal conditions and coastal locations in the Tides app in China. watchOS 11.2 will see a release alongside iOS 18.2 next Monday.\r<br />\n<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-11/\">watchOS 11</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/05/watchos-11-2-camera-remote-pause-video/\">watchOS 11.2 Lets You Pause iPhone Video With Camera Remote App</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/watchos-11-2-lets-you-pause-iphone-video-with-camera-remote-app.2444708/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f807c6149425ca53a2099e613f5715448a6198b68d813145e3a8f17fb5815aba","category":"Apple"}
