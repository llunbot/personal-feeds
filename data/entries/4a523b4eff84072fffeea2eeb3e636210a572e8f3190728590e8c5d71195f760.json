Just how long will we have to wait to see the new MacBook Air and what specs and price can we expect?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We look at the rumors and keep track of what’s being reported, as well as offer a perspective based on Apple’s current lineup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>UPDATE: February 19 2025: Apple didn’t launch a new MacBook Air alongside the iPhone 16E on Wednesday February 19, but we could still see the anticipated update really soon. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>M4 MacBook Air: Release date</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Launch after March 15, 2025 (Predicted)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in April 2024, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman said that the Mac’s version of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2302124/apple-plans-to-go-big-with-ai-and-m4-mac-processors-starting-later-this-year.html\">M4 chip</a> would be introduced in the MacBook Pro and iMacs later in 2024, and indeed it was. At that time, Gurman predicted that the M4 MacBook Air release wouldn’t come until spring 2025, about a year after the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2259608/15-inch-macbook-air-m3-review.html\">M3 MacBook Air</a> was released.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In June 2024, Gurman again <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-06-23/apple-vision-plans-cheaper-model-in-late-2025-vision-pro-2-in-2026-ar-glasses-lxrjk6wu\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> that the M4 MacBook Air is not expected until the spring of 2025. And in August, he <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2417766/apple-is-planning-a-mess-of-m4-mac-updates-this-fall-with-dramatic-changes-in-store.html\">reiterated</a> that the M4 MacBook Air will not be available until 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In October 2024, Gurman <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2499116/early-2025-apple-bonanza-includes-m4-macbook-air-iphone-se-ipad-air-11th-gen-ipad.html\">reported</a> that Apple is getting ready to start production on the M4 MacBook Air, with a possibility of a release between January and March of 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In December, Gurman claimed the updated 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air models with the M4 chip would be announced “earlier” than the anticipated iPhone SE and iPad updates. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In January 2025, Gurman <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2575467/the-m4-macbook-air-is-set-to-kick-off-a-loaded-2025-for-the-mac.html\">reported</a> that the M4 MacBook Air will ship “relatively soon” with the new laptop is already in production.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, an update does seem to be coming but when? One indication that Apple won’t be updating the MacBook Air until March 15 comes from Australia where Apple is currently running its <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673191/apple-back-school-sale.html\">Higher Education Offer 2025</a> until that date. For that student targeted deal they are offering free AirPods with MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, or iMac. Apple is unlikely to change the specs of a device currently in a promotion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple may release the new MacBook Air at an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1484151/apple-spring-event-date-time-how-to-watch-rumors.html\">Spring Apple Event</a>, but the absence of an event for the launch of the iPhone 16E makes this look unlikely. As with the iPhone 16E launch, Apple may issue a press release announcing the new product. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We anticipate that this update will happen between March 15 and the end of Apple’s second quarter on March 28. Our best guess is March 18. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>M4 MacBook Air: Processor</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple surprised us with the release of the M4 chip in the iPad Pro in early May, barely six months after the M3 debuted in the MacBook Pro. In October 2024, Apple released the M4 MacBook Pro, iMac, and Mac mini. Here are the specs:</p>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<p><strong>iPad Pro models with 256GB or 512GB of storage</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>9-core CPU (3 performance cores and 6 efficiency cores)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>10-core GPU</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hardware-accelerated ray tracing</li>\n\n\n\n<li>16-core Neural Engine</li>\n\n\n\n<li>120GBps memory bandwidth</li>\n\n\n\n<li>8GB RAM</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<p><strong>iPad Pro models with 1TB or 2TB storage</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>10-core CPU (4 performance cores and 6 efficiency cores)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>10-core GPU</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hardware-accelerated ray tracing</li>\n\n\n\n<li>16-core Neural Engine</li>\n\n\n\n<li>120GBps memory bandwidth</li>\n\n\n\n<li>16GB RAM</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>MacBook Pro, iMac &amp; Mac mini M4</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>10-core CPU (4 performance cores and 6 efficiency cores)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>10-core GPU</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hardware-accelerated ray tracing</li>\n\n\n\n<li>16-core Neural Engine</li>\n\n\n\n<li><em>120GBps memory bandwidth</em></li>\n\n\n\n<li>16GB RAM</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>MacBook Pro &amp; Mac mini M4 Pro </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>12-core or 14-core CPU (10 performance cores and 4 efficiency cores)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>16-core or 20-core GPU</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hardware-accelerated ray tracing</li>\n\n\n\n<li>16-core Neural Engine</li>\n\n\n\n<li>273GB/sec memory bandwidth</li>\n\n\n\n<li>24GB RAM</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>MacBook Pro M4 Max </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>14-core or 32-core CPU (12 performance cores and 4 efficiency cores)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>32-core or 40-core GPU</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hardware-accelerated ray tracing</li>\n\n\n\n<li>16-core Neural Engine</li>\n\n\n\n<li>546GB memory bandwidth</li>\n\n\n\n<li>36GB RAM or 48GB RAM</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>How will Apple allocate the M4 in the next MacBook Air? We could see the company use the 10-core CPU version of the chip. It doesn’t seem likely that the 9-core version will be in the Air.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to the 8-core M3, the M4 has two extra efficiency cores and higher memory bandwidth (120 GB/s vs 100GB/s). Apple will likely use the same design for the Mac, making the M4 the first non-Pro or Max chip that has </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the M4 arrived in the iPad, Gurman reported that the chip <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2302124/apple-plans-to-go-big-with-ai-and-m4-mac-processors-starting-later-this-year.html\">would focus on AI enhancements</a>. Apple talked briefly during its Let Loose event about the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2325929/apple-silicon-m4-processor-ipad-pro-performance-graphics-neural-engine.html\">improved Neural Engine</a> and its ability to deliver over 38 trillion operations per second but didn’t get into much detail about real-world use. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Will Apple continue to sell a cut-price M3 MacBook Air?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s been Apple’s habit in recent years to keep the previous generation model on sale in order to offer a lower price of entry to the range. This time, however, there is some speculation that the M3 MacBook Air will be discontinued with Apple perhaps keeping the M2 MacBook Air in the lineup instead. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s thought that the M3 chip has proved to costly to manufacture. Apparently the manufacturer of the chip, TSMC, found that it was costly to produce and yields were lower than those of previous processes. The M4 chip uses a more efficient 3nm fabrication process. This goes some way to explain why Apple jumped from M2 to M4 for the iPad Pro and completely bypassed the M3 for the Mac mini, Mac Studio and Mac Pro. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The M2, on the other hand, is being used in the iPad Air so Apple could keep the M2 MacBook Air in the line up since it utilises that same chip and will therefore keep costs down. See: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2578508/apples-m3-nightmare-is-coming-to-an-end.html\">Apple’s M3 nightmare is coming to an end</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>M4 MacBook Air: Design and specs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The M4 upgrade would be the fourth generation of the M-series chip in the MacBook Air, but it’s not the fourth time around for the current Air design. Apple shipped the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234819/macbook-air-m1-review-an-absolutely-stunning-debut-for-apple-silicon-in-a-mac.html\">M1 MacBook Air</a> in 2020 with an older design that was used with Intel chips and the current design wasn’t introduced until the M2 chip upgrade in July 2022. Apple isn’t expected to change it at all for the M4.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple made a slight change to the Air’s design with the M3 update in March 2024, but only for one specific color. The Midnight version now has an anodization seal to help cut down on fingerprints–it’s a similar process introduced with the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2259608/15-inch-macbook-air-m3-review.html\">Space Black MacBook Pro</a>. Apple is not expected to offer the process for the Silver, Space Gray, and Starlight colors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Apple released the M4 MacBook Pro in October 2024, the company increased the base amount of RAM to 16GB. It also did the same with the M2 and M3 MacBook Air that is currently for sale. Apple will; no longer release a laptop that starts with 8GB of RAM.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another feature that could get an upgrade is battery life. If the MacBook M4 follows the iPad Pro’s chip design, it could be more energy-friendly with two extra efficiency cores. That could mean more battery life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/24/12/11/m4-macbook-air-leaked-in-macos-sequoia-152-update-regulatory-documents\">AppleInsider</a> reported that it has seen a regulatory document for the M4 MacBook Air that refers to a “Front Ultra Wide Camera.” That could mean that the 1080p FaceTime camera will be replaced with a 12MP Center Stage camera, like the one in the M4 MacBook Pro.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MacbookAirM3Mitternacht_f5beba.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Macbook Air M3 Mitternacht hello\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MacbookAirM3Mitternacht_f5beba.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1600w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MacbookAirM3Mitternacht_f5beba.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MacbookAirM3Mitternacht_f5beba.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MacbookAirM3Mitternacht_f5beba.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MacbookAirM3Mitternacht_f5beba.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MacbookAirM3Mitternacht_f5beba.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/MacbookAirM3Mitternacht_f5beba.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>The Midnight MacBook Air now has an anodization seal to cut down on fingerprints.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Macwelt</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Everything else about the MacBook Air will likely stay the same with an M4 upgrade. The display, size, weight, mics, speakers, ports, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth are expected to remain unchanged.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TheElec <a href=\"https://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=5116\">reports</a> that Apple is developing an oxide thin-film transistor liquid crystal display for the MacBook Air, but this feature won’t be ready until 2027. The new display would replace the standard TFT LCD that is currently in use.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>M4 MacBook Pro: Price</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With concerns about Trumps tariffs making headlines are the prices of the MacBook Air likely to increase? It seems inevitable that they will if Apple decides to pass on the extra costs to the consumer. Costs outside the U.S. may also increase due to currency fluctuations.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the prices for the current standard configurations of the M3 MacBook Air for reference.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<p><strong>13-inch MacBook Air</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>$1,099/£1,099: M3 with 8-core CPU, 8-core GPU; 8GB unified memory; 256GB SSD</li>\n\n\n\n<li>$1,299/£1,299: M3 with 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU; 8GB unified memory; 512GB SSD</li>\n\n\n\n<li>$1,499/£1,499: M3 with 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU; 16GB unified memory; 512GB SSD</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<p><strong>15-inch MacBook Pro</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>$1,299/£1,299: M3 with 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU; 8GB unified memory; 256GB SSD</li>\n\n\n\n<li>$1,499/£1,499: M3 with 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU; 8GB unified memory; 512GB SSD</li>\n\n\n\n<li>$1,699/£1,699: M3 with 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU; 16GB unified memory; 512GB SSD</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple will likely offer similar configurations, so hopefully the M4 MacBook Air prices won’t change. Alternatively Apple may introduced a less powerful entry-level model in order to combat the higher prices of components. </p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"4a523b4eff84072fffeea2eeb3e636210a572e8f3190728590e8c5d71195f760","category":"Apple"}
