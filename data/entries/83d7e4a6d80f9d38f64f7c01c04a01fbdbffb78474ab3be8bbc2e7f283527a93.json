The goal is for students to build a device using bubble wrap, straws, or various other materials designed to hold an egg and keep it intact after being dropped from a substantial height—say, ten meters (nearly 33 feet). There's even a \"naked egg\" version in which a raw egg is dropped into a container below.  The competition is intended to teach students about structural mechanics and impact physics, and it is not an easy feat; most of the dropped eggs break.</p>\n<p>MIT engineering professor Tal Cohen decided to investigate why the failure rate was so high and reported her team's findings in <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s42005-025-02087-0\">a paper</a> published in the journal Communications Physics. \"The universal convention is that the egg should be in a vertical orientation when it hits the ground,\" <a href=\"https://physics.aps.org/articles/v18/100\">Cohen told Physics Magazine</a>. But their results from controlled trials simulating the egg drop challenge in the lab calls this conventional wisdom into question.</p>\n<p>It is not an unreasonable assumption to make. Another popular physics party trick is to walk on several cartons of eggs without breaking them. Typically it only takes about five and a half pounds of force to crack a single eggshell, much less than the average adult human. As I <a href=\"https://slate.com/technology/2012/09/whats-the-best-way-to-crack-an-egg-how-physics-can-help-you-when-youre-making-your-next-souffle.html\">wrote for Slate</a> back in 2012, \"The key is to align the eggs so that the narrow pole is pointing upward, and step in such a way to distribute your weight over the entire surface area, to avoid overloading any one eggshell.\" (Being barefoot also helps.)</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/the-key-to-a-successful-egg-drop-experiment-drop-it-on-its-side/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/the-key-to-a-successful-egg-drop-experiment-drop-it-on-its-side/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"83d7e4a6d80f9d38f64f7c01c04a01fbdbffb78474ab3be8bbc2e7f283527a93","category":"Tech"}
