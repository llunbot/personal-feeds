{"title":"World's Thinnest Foldable Phone Launches in Europe and Asia","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/20/worlds-thinnest-foldable-launches/","date":1740070510000,"content":"Oppo has launched the <a href=\"https://www.oppo.com/en/smartphones/series-find-n/find-n5/\">Find N5</a>, the world's thinnest foldable phone yet. When closed, the book-style foldable measures 8.93mm. That's less than a millimeter thicker than an iPhone 16 Pro, and thinner than the Honor Magic V3, which was the previous record holder.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/oppo-find-n5-fingers.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nThe device is barely thicker than its USB-C port. Indeed, Oppo has suggested that the obstacle to making it any thinner is now \"the limit of the charging port.\" It's already thinner than a headphone jack, which is probably why there isn't one.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen opened, the Find N5 is 4.21mm at its thinnest point, which is actually thicker than the new <a href=\"https://consumer.huawei.com/en/phones/mate-xt-ultimate-design/\">Huawei Mate XT Ultimate</a> tri-fold phone at 3.66mm – so the \"world's thinnest\" claim only applies when the Find N5 is closed. It has a 6.62-inch outer screen, a titanium hinge, and a 8.2-inch square inner LTPO display, which (as <a href=\"https://x.com/MKBHD/status/1892577302220870047\">Marques Brownlee notes</a>) is more screen real estate than an iPad mini.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOn the back is a ring triple camera system featuring a 50MP main sensor with optical image stabilization (OIS). That's accompanied by a smaller 50MP periscope telephoto sensor with 3x optical zoom and OIS, and an 8MP ultra-wide camera.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Find N5 has IPX6, X8, and X9 ratings, so it can survive immersion and sprayed water, but not dust or dirt. It features a Snapdragon 8 Elite processor and a 5,600mAh battery, and the whole package weighs in at a relatively light 229 grams. However, it will also make your wallet lighter – the phone's starting price is 2,499 Singapore dollars, which is around $1,867 USD. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition to the slim profile, the Find N5 can connect to a Mac for file transfers and remote control using Oppo's O Plus Connect app on the Mac, according to <em><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/616303/oppo-find-n5-remote-control-mac-o-plus-connect\">The Verge</a></em>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nExcept for the US, the Find N5 is available in markets globally, including Europe and Asia. The phone was expected to be re-branded as the OnePlus Open 2 in the US, but Oppo's sister brand says it has no plans to launch a foldable phone this year, so it looks like Americans will miss out.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/oppo-find-n5.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"769\" height=\"1046\" />\r<br />\nThe smartphone market is fascinated with thinness right now. Samsung recently teased its super-thin <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/22/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge/\">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>, following reports that Apple is planning to launch a so-called iPhone 17 Air in September. The rumored device, which will replace the Plus model in its next-generation iPhone 17 lineup, is expected to be Apple's thinnest iPhone to date.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/10/iphone-17-air-details-ming-chi-kuo/\">Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a> believes that the iPhone 17 Air will be 5.5mm thick at its thinnest point, which likely means that it will have a 5.5mm chassis with a thicker rear camera bump area.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oppo/\">Oppo</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/20/worlds-thinnest-foldable-launches/\">World's Thinnest Foldable Phone Launches in Europe and Asia</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/worlds-thinnest-foldable-phone-launches-in-europe-and-asia.2449798/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c5a771453968f14a319edea3da5ab415f77da06acdf02171869a8ced88c5c3ea","category":"Apple"}
