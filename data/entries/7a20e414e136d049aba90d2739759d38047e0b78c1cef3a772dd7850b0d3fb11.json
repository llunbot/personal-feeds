For weight purposes, this is the front brake with brake pads and filled with the new Low-Viscosity mineral oil. The brake checks in at 292g on our scale, and is 307/327g claimed. Shimano is also offering this brake lever paired with the M9200 XC two-piston brake caliper, and they claim the weight for that set is 239/259g (F/R). Compare that to the full XC M9200 brake with new resin pistons, seals, and the Low-Viscosity brake fluid, which has a claimed weight of 192/212g.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The M9220 Enduro brakes sell for $330 front, $335 rear, or you can get the brake upgrade kit, which includes both brakes, fluid, and extra brake pads for $670. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The M9220/M9200 Trail brakes are priced at $305 each, while the updated M9200 XC brakes are $295 each.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Shimano-XTR-Di2-1-x-12-actual-weights-01.webp\"><img width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Shimano-XTR-Di2-1-x-12-actual-weights-01.webp\" alt=\"Shimano XTR Di2 actual weight rotor\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Shimano-XTR-Di2-1-x-12-actual-weights-01.webp 2500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Shimano-XTR-Di2-1-x-12-actual-weights-01-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Shimano-XTR-Di2-1-x-12-actual-weights-01-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Shimano-XTR-Di2-1-x-12-actual-weights-01-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Shimano-XTR-Di2-1-x-12-actual-weights-01-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Shimano-XTR-Di2-1-x-12-actual-weights-01-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Shimano-XTR-Di2-1-x-12-actual-weights-01-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Shimano-XTR-Di2-1-x-12-actual-weights-01-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The RT-CL900 rotors are not new for the group, but we threw one on the scale anyway to verify the weight.

Mostly, they focused the material on the areas of the ring that were most likely to see impact, and removed it from the other areas. The result is a 65g ring in a 32t. These sell for $150 each in 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, and 38t sizes. Note that the new rings are 0mm offset, while the previous rings are 3mm offset to account for differences in the cranks to accomplish a 55mm chainline. Make sure you get the right ring for the right crankset to maintain the proper chainline. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Shimano XTR Di2 Weight: Shifter</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Shimano-XTR-Di2-1-x-12-actual-weights-06.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Shimano-XTR-Di2-1-x-12-actual-weights-06-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"Shimano XTR Di2 actual weight I-spec shifter\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Shimano-XTR-Di2-1-x-12-actual-weights-06-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Shimano-XTR-Di2-1-x-12-actual-weights-06-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Shimano-XTR-Di2-1-x-12-actual-weights-06-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Shimano-XTR-Di2-1-x-12-actual-weights-06-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Shimano-XTR-Di2-1-x-12-actual-weights-06-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Shimano-XTR-Di2-1-x-12-actual-weights-06-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Shimano-XTR-Di2-1-x-12-actual-weights-06-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It wouldn’t be a wireless group without a wireless shifter, and it wouldn’t be a Shimano group without obsessively engineered ergonomics. The new shifter is a thing of beauty, and checks in exactly as claimed at 97g for the I-Spec EV version, or 104g for the band clamp version. Each sells for $220.

On the scale, the SGS derailleur checks in at 415g with a battery installed, or 391g without, which matches the claimed weight of 391g. The GS rear derailleur has a slightly lower claimed weight at 389g, so with the addition of a 24g battery, you’re looking at a 413g short cage derailleur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both the SGS and the GS rear derailleurs are the same for the XC and Enduro groups, and sell for $665 each. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are also two rear derailleur models for ebikes, which are hard-wired without their own batteries. Split into an 11-speed Linkglide model and a 12-speed Hyperglide+ model, both have claimed weights of 372g and retail prices of $665.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Shimano XTR Di2 Weight: Cassette</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Shimano-XTR-Di2-1-x-12-actual-weights-02.webp\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Shimano-XTR-Di2-1-x-12-actual-weights-02-1536x1024.webp\" alt=\"Shimano XTR Di2 actual weight 10-51t cassette\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Shimano-XTR-Di2-1-x-12-actual-weights-02-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Shimano-XTR-Di2-1-x-12-actual-weights-02-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Shimano-XTR-Di2-1-x-12-actual-weights-02-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Shimano-XTR-Di2-1-x-12-actual-weights-02-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Shimano-XTR-Di2-1-x-12-actual-weights-02-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Shimano-XTR-Di2-1-x-12-actual-weights-02-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Shimano-XTR-Di2-1-x-12-actual-weights-02-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There are new cassettes for the XTR Di2 group, but they’re not required since the group will work with all existing Shimano Hyperglide+ 12-speed cassettes. On the scale, the CS-M9200-12 10-51t cassette showed 365g. The 9-45t compact cassette has a claimed weight of 327g, and Shimano says you’ll drop about 70g total by moving to the GS group. As usual, the cassette is pricy at $500, but the beauty of this group is that if you want to save money and run a heavier Deore cassette, you can (for the SGS group, at least).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Shimano XTR Di2 Weight: Chain</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2019-Shimano-XTR-M9100-actual-weights-cassette-chain-chainguide.jpg\"><img width=\"1685\" height=\"700\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2019-Shimano-XTR-M9100-actual-weights-cassette-chain-chainguide.jpg\" alt=\"Shimano M9100 12 speed weights\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2019-Shimano-XTR-M9100-actual-weights-cassette-chain-chainguide.jpg 1685w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2019-Shimano-XTR-M9100-actual-weights-cassette-chain-chainguide-120x50.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2019-Shimano-XTR-M9100-actual-weights-cassette-chain-chainguide-297x123.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2019-Shimano-XTR-M9100-actual-weights-cassette-chain-chainguide-768x319.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2019-Shimano-XTR-M9100-actual-weights-cassette-chain-chainguide-600x249.jpg 600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2019-Shimano-XTR-M9100-actual-weights-cassette-chain-chainguide-696x289.jpg 696w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2019-Shimano-XTR-M9100-actual-weights-cassette-chain-chainguide-1068x444.jpg 1068w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2019-Shimano-XTR-M9100-actual-weights-cassette-chain-chainguide-1011x420.jpg 1011w\" /></a><figcaption>Weights of the Shimano XTR M9100 12-speed mechanical group components, which includes the current M9100 chain in the middle.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no new chain for the XTR Di2 group, so any existing Hyperglide+ 12-speed chain will work.

The Titanium-spoked M9200 XC wheels drop substantial weight to a claimed 1157g, but also substantially increase the price to $2,400 for the pair. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Low Drag Hubs will also be available separately for $170/$365 (F/R), and weigh in at a claimed 121g/231g, which is the same listed for both the straight pull (XC) and J-bend versions (Enduro).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>XTR Di2 Upgrade Kits</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When considering pricing, it’s important to mention that Shimano will be offering upgrade kits that include everything you need for the new Di2 group to update an existing Hyperglide+ 12-speed Shimano drivetrain. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Di2 Drivetrain Upgrade Kit will include a rear derailleur, shifter, battery, battery charger, and a 12s Quicklink and will sell for $985. If you price it out, it’s basically the same price as buying all the components individually, except you get an additional Quicklink for the chain, which Shimano requires as they’re one-time-use-only. Shimano points out that this will be available full-time, not just at the time of the launch. There are also four versions of the upgrade kit with a choice of SGS 10-51t or GS 9-45t derailleurs, and I-Spec EV or Band Clamp shifter mounts. Everything will ship in a nice presentation box made from easily recycled paper and cardboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shimano will also be offering disc brake upgrade kits, which will include right and left brake levers, front and rear calipers and hoses, metal brake pads installed and additional resin pads included, and 100ml of the new low viscosity oil. The brake upgrade kits will only be offered in the four-piston enduro brake spec and are priced at $670.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Availability</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>All of the XTR components will be available starting today, from OEM partner brands and Shimano Dealers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure to <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/?p=385658\" target=\"_blank\">check out our complete tech breakdown on the new Shimano XTR Di2 group here</a>! </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://bike.shimano.com/en-NA/products/series/xtr.html\" target=\"_blank\">bike.shimano.com</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/shimano-di2-xtr-m9220-actual-weights-prices/\">Shimano Di2 XTR M9220 Actual Weights &amp; Prices</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"7a20e414e136d049aba90d2739759d38047e0b78c1cef3a772dd7850b0d3fb11","category":"Cycling"}
