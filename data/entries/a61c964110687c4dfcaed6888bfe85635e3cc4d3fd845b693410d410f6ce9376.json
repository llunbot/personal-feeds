Now, some players are using that kill screen—and some complicated memory manipulation it enables—to code new behaviors into versions of <em>Tetris</em> running on unmodified hardware and cartridges.</p>\n<p>We've covered similar \"arbitrary code execution\" glitches in <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/01/how-an-emulator-fueled-robot-reprogrammed-super-mario-world-on-the-fly/\">games like <em>Super Mario World</em></a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/03/how-to-beat-paper-mario-really-fast-by-playing-ocarina-of-time/\"><em>Paper Mario</em></a>, and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/01/how-to-get-star-fox-64-ships-into-ocarina-of-time-no-hacking-required/\"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</em></a> in the past.
