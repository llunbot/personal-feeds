By comparison, IDC estimated that Samsung and Amazon shipped a combined 12.3 million tablets in the quarter, suggesting that Apple shipped more tablets than Samsung and Amazon did combined in the quarter.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/06/iPadOS-Widgets.png\" />\r\n<br />\r\nA big caveat is that Apple no longer reports iPad unit sales in its earnings results, forcing IDC to estimate shipments based off the iPad quarterly revenue number that Apple does share. As a result, other research firms like <a href=\"https://news.strategyanalytics.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Strategy-AnalyticsTablet-Market-Posts-5th-Quarter-of-Growth-but-Supply-Constraints-Limit-Progress/default.aspx\">Strategy Analytics</a> and <a href=\"https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/worldwide-pc-market-q2-2021\">Canalys</a> have different iPad shipment numbers for the second quarter, but it doesn't change the narrative, as both have Apple with a significant lead over Samsung and Amazon.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/idc-2q21-tablets.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\niPad sales continued to surge last quarter as many people continue to work, learn, and communicate with others remotely. According to Apple CEO Tim Cook, the ‌iPad‌ had its best June quarter in nearly a decade, with the company <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/27/apple-mac-ipad-sales-up-q3-2021/\">reporting iPad revenue of $7.4 billion in the quarter</a>, a significant increase over $6.6 billion in the year-ago quarter.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe launch of a new iPad Pro with an M1 chip and a mini-LED display on the 12.9-inch model likely also bolstered sales during the quarter.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/idc/\">IDC</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/30/ipad-shipments-q2-2021-idc/\">Apple Shipped More Tablets Than Samsung and Amazon Did Combined Last Quarter</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-shipped-more-tablets-than-samsung-and-amazon-did-combined-last-quarter.2306003/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=L5cAiaHHWOs:mMcowpU01t8:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=L5cAiaHHWOs:mMcowpU01t8:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/L5cAiaHHWOs\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c8632de233a1ad3a49ff07afb5afa67f1900b8c7ce36b16503727430d54a7ddd","category":"Apple"}
