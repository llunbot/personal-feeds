{"title":"Apple Research Paper Documents Anthropomorphic, Emotionally Expressive Robot Lamp, à la Pixar’s Luxo","link":"https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/elegnt-expressive-functional-movement","date":1739725200000,"content":"\n<p>New research published from Apple machine learning researchers Yuhan Hu, Peide Huang, Mouli Sivapurapu, Jian Zhang:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Nonverbal behaviors such as posture, gestures, and gaze are\nessential for conveying internal states, both consciously and\nunconsciously, in human interaction. For robots to interact more\nnaturally with humans, robot movement design should likewise\nintegrate expressive qualities — such as intention, attention,\nand emotions — alongside traditional functional considerations\nlike task fulfillment, spatial constraints, and time efficiency.\nIn this paper, we present the design and prototyping of a\nlamp-like robot that explores the interplay between functional and\nexpressive objectives in movement design.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I enjoyed seeing something Luxo-esque made real, and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12493\">the paper itself</a> is fairly readable — and worth skimming at least for the illustrations. But I’ll wait for an actual product to get excited. Unlike <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2011/11/companies_that_publish_concept_videos\">marketing concept videos</a>, I don’t think publishing academic research is harmful to a company — and in fact, as has been <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/12/26/apple-ai-research-paper\">much</a> <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/07/19/apple-machine-learning-journal\">discussed</a> regarding Apple’s institutional penchant for secrecy, it’s seemingly essential for Apple to not only permit but encourage this, to recruit top-tier talent in the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence. But publishing academic research is closer to publishing marketing concept videos than it  is to releasing an actual product. Which is to say it doesn’t count.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/16/apple-luxo\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f2db02b807a45d43cb3c665e0d2094ae428fb3990238ccc29906c3c1aaffbb3b","category":"Tech"}
