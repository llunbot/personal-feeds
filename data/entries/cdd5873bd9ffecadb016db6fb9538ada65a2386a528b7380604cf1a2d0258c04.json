Pairing fast-growing bamboo frame tubes with recycled plastic lugs, they’ve created a bike they say is as close as you can get to carbon-neutral, while still being 100% functional, cool to look at, and affordable for parents faced with kids that grow like weeds. For now, the Belo bike is being offered through a Kickstarter campaign in 14″ to 20″ wheelsize. But Belo hopes to deliver their sustainable, made-in-Germany kids bikes already by the middle of next summer!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Belo bamboo kids’ bikes made from sustainable materials</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Belo-bamboo-kids-bikes-made-from-sustainable-materials_bike-at-Bespoked-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Belo-bamboo-kids-bikes-made-from-sustainable-materials_bike-at-Bespoked-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Belo bamboo bikes for kids, complete bike at 2024 Bespoked show\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Belo-bamboo-kids-bikes-made-from-sustainable-materials_bike-at-Bespoked-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Belo-bamboo-kids-bikes-made-from-sustainable-materials_bike-at-Bespoked-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Belo-bamboo-kids-bikes-made-from-sustainable-materials_bike-at-Bespoked-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Belo-bamboo-kids-bikes-made-from-sustainable-materials_bike-at-Bespoked-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Belo-bamboo-kids-bikes-made-from-sustainable-materials_bike-at-Bespoked-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Bespoked photos/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Let your little ones explore the world sustainably. Belo bikes for little eco-heroes!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Belo’s goal was to create a better, more sustainable bike for kids. As parents themselves also faced with fast-growing kids, the Belo design team wanted to figure out how to build a high-quality bike that would get their children excited about riding. But at the same time, a bike that they could feel was more in line with the climate-positive benefits of actually riding bikes, instead of creating another disposable product.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sustainable bamboo &amp; recycled plastics </h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Belo-bamboo-kids-bikes-made-from-sustainable-materials_bamboo-is-better-for-the-environment-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Belo-bamboo-kids-bikes-made-from-sustainable-materials_bamboo-is-better-for-the-environment-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Belo bamboo bikes for kids, Belo is probably the world's most sustainable kids' bike, bamboo is the most eco-friendly bike frame material\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Belo-bamboo-kids-bikes-made-from-sustainable-materials_bamboo-is-better-for-the-environment-jpg.webp 1000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Belo-bamboo-kids-bikes-made-from-sustainable-materials_bamboo-is-better-for-the-environment-297x149.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Belo-bamboo-kids-bikes-made-from-sustainable-materials_bamboo-is-better-for-the-environment-120x60.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Belo-bamboo-kids-bikes-made-from-sustainable-materials_bamboo-is-better-for-the-environment-768x384.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Bamboo as a frame material first came to mind for its rapidly renewable character, minimal processing needs, red water consumption, and net negative CO2 impact. However, building conventional bamboo bikes is still very labor intensive and requires a lot of less-friendly epoxy work. So they spent the past 3 years developing a plug-and-play lug system that uses injection-molded recycled plastic to give the bikes structure, and requires much less harmful adhesive.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Belo-bamboo-kids-bikes-made-from-sustainable-materials_recycled-plastic-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"900\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Belo-bamboo-kids-bikes-made-from-sustainable-materials_recycled-plastic-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Belo bamboo bikes for kids, Belo is probably the world's most sustainable kids' bike, recycled plastic lugs\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Belo-bamboo-kids-bikes-made-from-sustainable-materials_recycled-plastic-jpg.webp 900w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Belo-bamboo-kids-bikes-made-from-sustainable-materials_recycled-plastic-297x99.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Belo-bamboo-kids-bikes-made-from-sustainable-materials_recycled-plastic-120x40.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Belo-bamboo-kids-bikes-made-from-sustainable-materials_recycled-plastic-768x256.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, the white recycled plastic lugs were specifically infused with splashes of colorful throughout to create an eye-catching look to contrast the neutral tones of the bamboo frame elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The result is lightweight and fun to ride. Plus, Belo builds affordable frames thanks to the simple lugged construction, even factoring in production in Germany.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“By choosing our eco-friendly kids’ bike, you’re not only providing your child with a fun and healthy activity but also supporting a more sustainable planet.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Belo-bamboo-kids-bikes-made-from-sustainable-materials_20in-geared-model-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Belo-bamboo-kids-bikes-made-from-sustainable-materials_20in-geared-model-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Belo bamboo bikes for kids, Belo is probably the world's most sustainable kids' bike, made-in-Germany\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Belo-bamboo-kids-bikes-made-from-sustainable-materials_20in-geared-model-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Belo-bamboo-kids-bikes-made-from-sustainable-materials_20in-geared-model-297x149.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Belo-bamboo-kids-bikes-made-from-sustainable-materials_20in-geared-model-120x60.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Belo-bamboo-kids-bikes-made-from-sustainable-materials_20in-geared-model-768x384.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Belo describes the bamboo they build their frames &amp; rigid forks from as “<em>light as aluminum, as strong as steel, and has a high resistance to compression, bending, and torsion</em>“. Still, the fiber-reinforced, recycled plastic lugs are overbuilt to be extra strong for how kids use &amp; abuse bikes, while still being lightweight. The bikes are also disc brake only and feature thru-axles to work with high-quality wheels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond the eco-friendly frames, Belo bikes feature solid kid-centric components. Comfy saddles, ergonomic bar shapes, child-specific levers for easy reach, and light affordable alloy components.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Belo-bamboo-kids-bikes-made-from-sustainable-materials_3-sizes-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1400\" height=\"350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Belo-bamboo-kids-bikes-made-from-sustainable-materials_3-sizes-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Belo bamboo bikes for kids, Belo is probably the world's most sustainable kids' bike. 3 sizes: 14&quot;, 16&quot;, or 20&quot; wheels\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Belo-bamboo-kids-bikes-made-from-sustainable-materials_3-sizes-jpg.webp 1400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Belo-bamboo-kids-bikes-made-from-sustainable-materials_3-sizes-297x74.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Belo-bamboo-kids-bikes-made-from-sustainable-materials_3-sizes-120x30.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Belo-bamboo-kids-bikes-made-from-sustainable-materials_3-sizes-768x192.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>available in 3 wheelsize-specific sizes (S-L) to fit kids from around 3- to 8-years-old</li>\n\n\n\n<li>offered with 14″ and 16″ wheels as a singlespeed bike, or</li>\n\n\n\n<li>the 20″ kids bike features a 1x 10-speed drivetrain</li>\n\n\n\n<li>designed and manufactured in Dresden, Germany</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Belo sustainable kids’ bikes – Kickstarter pricing, options &amp; expected availability</h3>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n<p>Belo has just opened up a crowdfunding campaign for their sustainable bamboo and recycled plastic kids’ bikes on <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/belo/belo-probably-the-most-sustainable-bike-for-kids/\" target=\"_blank\">Kickstarter</a>, and they still have quite a ways to go to meet their funding target.
