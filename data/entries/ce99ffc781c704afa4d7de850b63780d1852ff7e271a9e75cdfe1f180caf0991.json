Cook said that Apple needs more time to ensure ‌Siri‌ meets its quality bar, but progress is being made.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/Sad-Siri-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\n<blockquote>With regard to the more personal Siri features we announced, we need more time to complete our work on these features, so they meet our high quality bar. We are making progress, and we look forward to getting these features into customers' hands.</blockquote>\r<br />\nApple first unveiled the more personalized ‌Siri‌ features at WWDC 2024, and rumors suggested that the plan was to introduce them with an update to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>. That didn't happen, and Apple earlier this year said that there would be a delay because more time was needed for development.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAt this point, the new ‌Apple Intelligence‌ features will be held for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-19/\">iOS 19</a>, and it is not yet clear if they will be in the first ‌iOS 19‌ release or held for a later update. Apple's delay wording suggested that we could be waiting until 2026 for the functionality.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBehind the scenes, Apple made a number of changes to ‌Siri‌ leadership, moving AI chief John Giannandrea <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/22/siri-management-team-overhaul/\">off of the project</a> and instead turning to Mike Rockwell, who handled Vision Pro development.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/aapl/\">AAPL</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/earnings/\">Earnings</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/01/apple-intelligence-siri-features-progress/\">Tim Cook: Apple is 'Making Progress' on Apple Intelligence Siri Features</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tim-cook-apple-is-making-progress-on-apple-intelligence-siri-features.2456331/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ce99ffc781c704afa4d7de850b63780d1852ff7e271a9e75cdfe1f180caf0991","category":"Apple"}
