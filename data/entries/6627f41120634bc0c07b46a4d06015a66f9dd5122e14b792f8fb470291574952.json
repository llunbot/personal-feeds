Like SRAM’s similar XO1 DH drivetrain, the 7-speed groupset is designed specifically for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/mountain-bike-race-formats-explained/\">downhill racing</a>.</p>\n<p>The groupset will cost $1,343 for its cheapest spec and is expected to launch in April.</p>\n<h2>TRP’s first full groupset</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The crankset is available in either carbon or alloy options.</span></figcaption><span> <i>TRP</i></span></div>\n<p>Previously, TRP focused solely on brakes and limited drivetrain components. But the new cassette and crankset see the brand release its first full groupset.</p>\n<p>The crankset uses a 30mm spindle and is available in either forged alloy or carbon options.</p>\n<p>TRP has licensed <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/groupsets/chainring/chainring-mountain/mrp-wave-ring-review/\">MRP’s Wave</a> tooth profile for the 1x chainrings used with the crankset. The drivetrain is also designed to use a third-party KMC X12 chain.</p>\n<p>A single 10-52t cassette is available. The 10 lower cogs are machined from steel. The two largest are made from aluminium. This mounts onto a Shimano Micro Spline <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/freehubs/\">freehub</a>.</p>\n<h2>Updated shifter ergonomics and a stiffer derailleur</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The ergonomics of the shifter and the derailleur construction have been updated.</span></figcaption><span> <i>TRP</i></span></div>\n<p>TRP says the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/a-complete-guide-to-rear-derailleurs/\">rear derailleur</a> body and pivots have been strengthened. This is claimed to improve shift accuracy compared to the outgoing TR12 derailleur.</p>\n<p>The Hall Lock is a feature unique to TRP drivetrains. Activating this locks a band clamp around the main mounting bolt of the derailleur. This prevents the derailleur from pivoting in rough terrain, which can exacerbate chain slap.</p>\n<p>Deactivating it enables the derailleur to move freely, making for easier wheel swaps.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The new rear derailleur is a step up, aesthetically and mechanically, from the outgoing TR12 ‘drivetrain’.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Alex Evans</i></span></div>\n<p>TRP has also updated the ergonomics of its shifter. The downshift lever can be adjusted to shift between one to five gears, depending on user preference.</p>\n<p>The groupset will be on show at Sea Otter 2023, where further details will be announced.</p>","author":"Jack Luke","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"6627f41120634bc0c07b46a4d06015a66f9dd5122e14b792f8fb470291574952","category":"Cycling"}
