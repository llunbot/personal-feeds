The new iPad Pro models will shift to using OLED display panels for the first time and will have their designs tweaked for the first time since <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/11/2018-ipad-pro-review-whats-a-computer/\">the 2018 iPad Pros</a> introduced the current rounded, slim-bezeled look. Those new iPad Pros will also come with redesigned Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil accessories, though it's unclear whether those accessories will be totally rethought or if they'll just tweak existing designs to work with the new tablets.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013454#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013454&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"06f9192775cf6dcb9861459e7d868e5ec8d656e8c30d0b187d9ff49d971c6005","category":"Tech"}
