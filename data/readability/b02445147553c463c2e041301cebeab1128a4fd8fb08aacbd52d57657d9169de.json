Launched just over two years ago, the UK clothing maker had created an ambitious project to make it easy for riders looking to customize the look of their cycling kit, while maintaining the quality and attention to detail that Rapha built its brand on. But it turns out that it was harder than it seems, and Rapha had difficulty delivering the level of quality and service they hoped for, so has decided to call it quits on consumer custom, focusing on the continued development and innovation of their production cycling clothing.</p><h2>Rapha Custom stops offering customized consumer cycling kit</h2><figure id=\"attachment_243834\"

Rapha Custom just couldn’t sustainably match the high quality level customers have come to expect from Rapha’s production clothing or the brand’s overall experience. Cutting consumer custom out seems to be a move to not let it water down the brand overall.</p><p><a href=\"http://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2021-Merida-Reacto-Disc-aero-road-bike_everyday-race-lightweight-carbon-aero-road-race-bike_sunset-ride.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2021-Merida-Reacto-Disc-aero-road-bike_everyday-race-lightweight-carbon-aero-road-race-bike_sunset-ride.jpg\" alt=\"2021 Merida Reacto Disc aero road bike, everyday race lightweight carbon aero road race bike\" width=\"1500\" height=\"844\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2021-Merida-Reacto-Disc-aero-road-bike_everyday-race-lightweight-carbon-aero-road-race-bike_sunset-ride.jpg 1500w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2021-Merida-Reacto-Disc-aero-road-bike_everyday-race-lightweight-carbon-aero-road-race-bike_sunset-ride-297x167.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2021-Merida-Reacto-Disc-aero-road-bike_everyday-race-lightweight-carbon-aero-road-race-bike_sunset-ride-800x450.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2021-Merida-Reacto-Disc-aero-road-bike_everyday-race-lightweight-carbon-aero-road-race-bike_sunset-ride-120x68.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2021-Merida-Reacto-Disc-aero-road-bike_everyday-race-lightweight-carbon-aero-road-race-bike_sunset-ride-768x432.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2021-Merida-Reacto-Disc-aero-road-bike_everyday-race-lightweight-carbon-aero-road-race-bike_sunset-ride-696x392.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2021-Merida-Reacto-Disc-aero-road-bike_everyday-race-lightweight-carbon-aero-road-race-bike_sunset-ride-1068x601.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2021-Merida-Reacto-Disc-aero-road-bike_everyday-race-lightweight-carbon-aero-road-race-bike_sunset-ride-746x420.jpg 746w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2021-Merida-Reacto-Disc-aero-road-bike_everyday-race-lightweight-carbon-aero-road-race-bike_sunset-ride.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2021-Merida-Reacto-Disc-aero-road-bike_everyday-race-lightweight-carbon-aero-road-race-bike_sunset-ride.jpg 1500w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2021-Merida-Reacto-Disc-aero-road-bike_everyday-race-lightweight-carbon-aero-road-race-bike_sunset-ride-297x167.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2021-Merida-Reacto-Disc-aero-road-bike_everyday-race-lightweight-carbon-aero-road-race-bike_sunset-ride-800x450.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2021-Merida-Reacto-Disc-aero-road-bike_everyday-race-lightweight-carbon-aero-road-race-bike_sunset-ride-120x68.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2021-Merida-Reacto-Disc-aero-road-bike_everyday-race-lightweight-carbon-aero-road-race-bike_sunset-ride-768x432.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2021-Merida-Reacto-Disc-aero-road-bike_everyday-race-lightweight-carbon-aero-road-race-bike_sunset-ride-696x392.jpg 696w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2021-Merida-Reacto-Disc-aero-road-bike_everyday-race-lightweight-carbon-aero-road-race-bike_sunset-ride-1068x601.jpg 1068w,https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/2021-Merida-Reacto-Disc-aero-road-bike_everyday-race-lightweight-carbon-aero-road-race-bike_sunset-ride-746x420.jpg 746w\"></a></p><p><em>Read Rapha’s full end of Custom statement below:</em></p><p><em>In 2019 we launched Rapha Custom with the ambition of creating a unique and innovative custom cycling apparel service. Our goal was to develop a digital experience that puts the design power in the riders’ hands, whilst offering the same Rapha product quality, performance and innovation that customers have come to expect. We are incredibly proud of what we achieved but unfortunately, despite our best efforts, we have struggled to deliver an experience, both digitally and physically, that our customers, local teams and communities expect from the Rapha brand. So we have taken the difficult decision to close Rapha Custom.</em></p><p><em>As a brand we have always chosen the harder route, the more rewarding route and the route that we believe will benefit our customers most. Our Rapha Custom ambition was the harder route and we have learnt a lot over the last two years that will help drive our brand forward.</em></p><p><em>Our decision to step away from Rapha Custom will ensure sharper focus on our main ranges, which will allow us to continue to develop the most innovative performance cycling apparel, drive the sport forward and continue to inspire millions of people around the world to ride.</em></p><p><a href=\"https://www.rapha.cc/custom/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Rapha.cc/custom</em></a></p></div></div>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"b02445147553c463c2e041301cebeab1128a4fd8fb08aacbd52d57657d9169de","category":"Cycling"}
