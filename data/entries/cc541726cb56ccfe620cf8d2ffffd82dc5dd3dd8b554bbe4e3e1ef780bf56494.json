Flight details are easy to follow, so family members can monitor a flight, see if there are delays, and know when you land.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo use Flighty Friends, you just need to connect with a person, and then you can see each other's trips automatically, eliminating the need to send over flight data like airline, flight number, and arrival times. The app will send regular notifications for events like delays, takeoffs, and landings, and there are customizable notifications so each user can decide how much info they want to see.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/flighty-friends-2.jpg\" alt width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nA live flight map displays the flight locations of every person that you've connected with, so you can keep track of flight progress in real-time.
