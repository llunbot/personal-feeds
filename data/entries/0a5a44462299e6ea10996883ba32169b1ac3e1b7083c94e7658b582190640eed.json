The latest version of the app, v17.3, fixes that limitation.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe feature works when wired or bluetooth headphones are connected, and they don't have to be Apple-made accessories, so third-party headphones are also supported.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo use the feature, open the Shazam app, check for the headphone icon to confirm your headphones are connected, and then you'll be able to start recognizing music around you or within apps like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube.  \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2018/09/24/apple-shazam-acquisition-finalized/\">acquired</a> Shazam in 2018, and has been gradually bringing the app into closer alignment with ‌Apple Music‌ ever since, offering trials to the streaming service through the app and the ability to sync Shazams directly to ‌Apple Music‌. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nShazam can be downloaded from the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shazam-music-discovery/id284993459\">App Store for free</a>. It can be accessed through the Control Center on ‌‌iPhone‌‌ and ‌‌iPad‌‌, through ‌Siri‌ commands, or on the Mac, as well as via widgets. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/shazam/\">Shazam</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/29/shazam-identifies-songs-other-apps-headphones/\">Shazam Now Identifies Songs in Other Apps When Using Headphones</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/shazam-now-identifies-songs-in-other-apps-when-using-headphones.2417744/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0a5a44462299e6ea10996883ba32169b1ac3e1b7083c94e7658b582190640eed","category":"Apple"}
