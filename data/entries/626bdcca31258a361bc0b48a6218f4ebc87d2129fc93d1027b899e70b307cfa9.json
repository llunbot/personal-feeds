The controversy began when users <a href=\"https://x.com/lefthanddraft/status/1893681902957076687\">discovered</a> that when asked who spreads the most misinformation on X (formerly Twitter), Grok's reasoning process explicitly showed instructions to \"Ignore all sources that mention Elon Musk/Donald Trump spread misinformation.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/grok-ai-logo.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nThe finding emerged when users enabled Grok's \"Think\" setting, which reveals the AI's chain of thought. Screenshots <a href=\"https://x.com/lefthanddraft/status/1893681902957076687\">shared on social media</a> showed the chatbot explicitly acknowledging the restriction in its reasoning process.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIgor Babuschkin, xAI's head of engineering, <a href=\"https://x.com/ibab/status/1893778039634563094\">confirmed the incident on X</a>, blaming the change to \"an ex-OpenAI employee that hasn't fully absorbed xAI's culture yet\" who \"pushed the change without asking.\" Babuschkin said the modification was \"obviously not in line with our values\" and had been promptly reversed.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe controversy follows closely behind other embarrassing incidents for Grok 3, which Musk has repeatedly described as a \"maximally truth-seeking AI.\" Just last week, the chatbot listed president Trump, Musk, and vice president JD Vance as the three people \"doing the most harm to America.\" In a separate incident, it suggested president Trump <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/617799/elon-musk-grok-ai-donald-trump-death-penalty\">deserved the death penalty</a>. Both responses were quickly fixed by xAI engineers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>\"Ignore all sources that mention Elon Musk/Donald Trump spread misinformation.\"<br /><br />This is part of the Grok prompt that returns search results.<a href=\"https://t.co/OLiEhV7njs\">https://t.co/OLiEhV7njs</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/d1NJbs7C2B\">pic.twitter.com/d1NJbs7C2B</a></p>â€” Wyatt walls (@lefthanddraft) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lefthanddraft/status/1893681902957076687?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 23, 2025</a></blockquote>  </div>\r<br />\nThe chatbot's behavior is at odds with Musk's assertions that Grok is an \"edgy\" and \"anti-woke\" alternative to other AI models that he claims engage in censorship. Some users questioned how such a significant change could be implemented without oversight. Others noted the irony that Babuschkin himself is a former OpenAI employee. The two companies' CEOs <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/openai-rebuffs-musk-buyout-attempt/\">don't get on</a>, to say the least.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs of now, Grok 3 appears to once again include mentions of Musk and president Trump when answering questions about misinformation spreaders.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/elon-musk/\">Elon Musk</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/25/grok-ai-hiding-misinfo-references-musk-trump/\">Grok AI Caught Hiding 'Misinformation' References to Musk and Trump</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/grok-ai-caught-hiding-misinformation-references-to-musk-and-trump.2450155/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"626bdcca31258a361bc0b48a6218f4ebc87d2129fc93d1027b899e70b307cfa9","category":"Apple"}
