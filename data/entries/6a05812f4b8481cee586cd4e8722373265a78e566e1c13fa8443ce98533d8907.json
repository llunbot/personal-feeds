{"title":"M3 Ultra Chip's Massive 80-Core Graphics Performance Revealed in Benchmark Result","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/m3-ultra-chip-gpu-benchmark/","date":1741364189000,"content":"Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/apple-introduces-m3-ultra-chip/\">new M3 Ultra chip</a> can be configured with a massive 80-core GPU, and an early benchmark result offers a look at its graphics performance.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/M3-Ultra-Chip.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1960\" height=\"1092\" />\r<br />\nIn <a href=\"https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/compute/3785744\">one Geekbench 6 result</a> for the new Mac Studio, the M3 Ultra with an 80-core GPU achieved a Metal score of 259,668, up from 222,582 for the M2 Ultra chip with a 76-core GPU in the previous-generation Mac Studio. If that single result is accurate, then the M3 Ultra offers up to 16% faster graphics performance than the M2 Ultra.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis means the M3 Ultra offers the best graphics performance of any Apple chip ever.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn the 16-inch MacBook Pro, the highest-end M4 Max chip with a 40-core GPU has an average Metal score of 187,460, so the M3 Ultra appears to offer up to 38% faster graphics performance than the M4 Max based on the one result.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA few other Geekbench 6 results for the M3 Ultra chip with an 80-core GPU show Metal scores in the 195,000 range. We believe those results are inaccurate, as it would not make any sense for the score to be that low. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs for CPU performance, we previously reported that the M3 Ultra is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/06/m3-ultra-chip-first-benchmark-result/\">up to 10% faster than the previous-fastest M4 Max chip</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/05/new-mac-studio-with-m4-max-and-m3-ultra/\">new Mac Studio</a> is available to pre-order now on Apple's online store, and it will launch in stores on Wednesday, March 12. In the U.S., pricing starts at $1,999 for M4 Max configurations, and at $3,999 for M3 Ultra configurations.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/\">Mac Studio</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/benchmarks/\">Benchmarks</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/geekbench/\">Geekbench</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac-Studio\">Mac Studio (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-studio.237\">Mac Studio</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/m3-ultra-chip-gpu-benchmark/\">M3 Ultra Chip's Massive 80-Core Graphics Performance Revealed in Benchmark Result</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m3-ultra-chips-massive-80-core-graphics-performance-revealed-in-benchmark-result.2452431/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6a05812f4b8481cee586cd4e8722373265a78e566e1c13fa8443ce98533d8907","category":"Apple"}
