For example, agricultural landowners may restrict access temporarily when moving stock or may even revoke access permanently.</p>\n<p>White roads are another category shown on maps. On OS maps, they’re shown as ‘other routes of public access’. The presence of a white road on an OS map merely indicates its existence – information on access cannot be inferred from an OS map alone.</p>\n<h3>Accessibility for disabled riders</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Adaptive bikes, such as hand cycles, are not subject to the same access rules as bicycles.\" title=\"Rear View Of Man And Woman Riding Handcycle Amidst Trees On Field\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Adaptive bikes, such as hand cycles, are not subject to the same access rules as bicycles.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Getty</i></span></div>\n<p>Transcending these categories are provisions for physically disabled riders using an adapted cycle for the same purpose as a wheelchair or mobility scooter.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/adaptive-bikes/\">Adaptive bikes</a> for disabled riders can be used anywhere where access on foot applies.</p>\n<p>However, it is worth remembering that many of these ways will have gates and stiles not designed for wheelchair or mobility vehicle users. There are some groups and movements promoting routes within the path networks that are accessible, including Miles without Stiles, for example with this <a href=\"https://www.lakedistrict.gov.uk/visiting/things-to-do/walking/mileswithoutstiles\" target=\"_blank\">Lake District map</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.dartmoor.gov.uk/enjoy-dartmoor/outdoor-activities/accessible-dartmoor\" target=\"_blank\">accessible Dartmoor</a>.</p>\n<h2>Putting it all together – who’s allowed where?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"13_grinduro_uk_2017_arran-1501153037722-996q5iz10q3m-e9c251c\" title=\"13_grinduro_uk_2017_arran-1501153037722-996q5iz10q3m-e9c251c\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A trail’s legal status does not necessarily reflect how rideable it is on the ground…</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Ed Plowden, programme director of Paths for Everyone at Sustrans, helped to summarise where in this network cyclists are permitted.</p>\n<p>He explained that ”people can legally cycle on public carriageways [roads], public bridleways, restricted byways, byways open to all traffic and cycle tracks, but not public footpaths.”</p>\n<p>He went on to note that path infrastructure may make cycling challenging in places – “existing restrictions like gates, A and K frames, or chicanes, previously installed to try and prevent motorcycle access or as part of outdated cycle infrastructure design standards do impede access for cyclists.”</p>\n<p>Alongside the infrastructure on paths, it is worth remembering that path classification does not guarantee path substrate.</p>\n<p>Paths of the same category can range from tarmac to hard-packed gravel through to bog, so always be sure to research and pack appropriately when planning your route.</p>\n<h3>Sharing with care</h3>\n<p>In addition, regardless of the way type, it’s important for cyclists to consider other users while riding. Cyclists should give way to walkers and equestrians when cycling on bridleways and restricted byways.</p>\n<p>Plowden added that cyclists should “remember to share with care, slowing down when passing other path users including people cycling, people on foot, horse riders and people in wheelchairs.</p>\n<p>“Ring your bell or shout a gentle warning if need be, well before approaching people from behind. Remember that many people who walk, wheel or cycle also have hidden disabilities, which may mean they cannot hear or move quickly out of the way.”</p>\n<h2>Access laws by nation</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"OS Maps app on iPhone\" title=\"OS Maps app on iPhone\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Ordnance Survey mapping is, generally speaking, the best way to determine the legal status of a way in the UK.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>What happens away from the rights of way is largely determined by so-called ‘access laws’.</p>\n<p>These vary by each nation of the UK, and determine how the general public is permitted to interact with the land off the beaten track.</p>\n<h3>England and Wales</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Snow forced an early retreat\" title=\"snowdon-mondraker-104-1483961661820-vxad6yfbqzid-8ee6cec\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Cyclists are permitted to ride on bridleways.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act (2000, CRoW) <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/open-access-land-management-rights-and-responsibilities#:~:text=The%20Countryside%20and%20Rights%20of,as%20'open%20access%20land'.\" target=\"_blank\">open access land</a> is defined as registered ‘common land’ or ‘open country’ where the public have the right to roam.</p>\n<p>This land includes mountains, moors and heaths and some of the land around the Coast Path – covering only around <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/04/right-to-roam-england-access-to-green-space-proposals\" target=\"_blank\">8 per cent of England</a>.</p>\n<p>On an OS map, this land is marked by a yellow wash with a brown/orange border, and coastal margin as a magenta wash with the same border.</p>\n<p>Natural England also provides a search tool for finding <a href=\"http://www.openaccess.naturalengland.org.uk/wps/portal/oasys/maps/MapSearch\" target=\"_blank\">open access land </a>.</p>\n<p>In England, you can use this land for walking, running, wildlife watching and rock climbing, but not usually for cycling.</p>\n<p>There are some exceptions – if there are public bridleways or byways that cross the land you can use these, or where there are local traditions and rights of access.</p>\n<p>In Wales, the same applies for now, with these laws currently under review and the Welsh government keen to increase access to the countryside.</p>\n<p>In England, the <a href=\"https://www.righttoroam.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Right to Roam campaign</a> is also looking to put pressure on the government to increase accessibility to the countryside.</p>\n<h3>Scotland</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Moray Coast Trail -
