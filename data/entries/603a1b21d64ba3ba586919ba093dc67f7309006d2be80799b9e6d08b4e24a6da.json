Over the years, we've regularly seen this kind of GPU from both major GPU manufacturers. Those companies regularly turn down some specs, repurpose sub-optimal chips, and get a moderately priced option to follow their biggest kahunas for anybody tiptoeing into solid 1080p or 1440p gaming options on PC.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there's nothing traditional about the latest traditional PC hardware cycle. Today's supply-and-demand ecosystem of computer GPUs looks like something out of a terrifying <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/10/suspiria-and-border-offer-two-compelling-alternatives-to-classic-halloween-fare/\">Dario Argento film</a>. The horrors that lurk in every shadow include chip shortages and bot-fueled scalper waves.</p>\n<p>And that context really helps us frame the $379 RX 6600XT—an underpowered, overpriced, and downright disappointing GPU whose primary sales pitch is 1080p gaming. That category is famously CPU-limited, not GPU-limited, so this GPU's mileage will truly vary based on your rig. In general, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/12/nvidia-announces-the-399-rtx-3060-ti-and-weve-tested-it/\">Nvidia's RTX 3060 Ti</a> (at only $20 more MSRP) wins handily, while <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/07/nvidia-refreshes-rtx-line-super-gpus-add-performance-at-same-msrp/\">Nvidia's RTX 2060 Super</a> (which launched for $399 in July 2019) is within shouting distance of this brand-new card. That latter yardstick in particular makes AMD's newest product a hard GPU to recommend.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1785836#p3\">Read 20 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1785836&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"603a1b21d64ba3ba586919ba093dc67f7309006d2be80799b9e6d08b4e24a6da","category":"Tech"}
