As evidence, the OCU cites \"numerous media outlets.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe OCU asked Apple to justify the \"lack of performance\" of the aforementioned ‌iPhone‌ models following the recent iOS updates, and said that the letter is intended to \"initiate a dialog with Apple\" in order to find the \"best way to compensate consumers.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's \"excessively rapid wear and tear\" on iPhones following updates is unfair to consumers and harms the environment, says the OCU.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIf Apple does not provide an adequate response, the OCU plans to consider other actions such as a lawsuit enforcing consumer rights.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-slowdown/\">accused of planned obsolescence</a> in the past, primarily relating to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/18/geekbench-iphone-6s-slowdowns/\">2017 release of iOS 10.2.1</a>, which included a feature that throttled the performance of older iPhones with degrading batteries in order to prevent device shutdowns.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple failed to make it clear that mitigating shutdowns would require compromising device performance, which led to consumer upset and a series of lawsuits that Apple is continuing to deal with today. Most recently, Apple shelled out $3.4 million to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/08/apple-chile-planned-obsolescence-lawsuit/\">settle a lawsuit</a> in Chile, and it has also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/13/iphone-slowdown-lawsuit-notification/\">faced lawsuits</a> in the United States, Belgium, Spain, Italy, and Portugal.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs for iOS 14.5, 14.5.1, and 14.6, there have indeed been reports of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/01/ios-14-6-users-reporting-battery-drain/\">excessive battery drain</a>, and iOS 14.5 in particular fixed an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/08/ios-14-5-will-fix-iphone-11-battery-drain-bug/\">iPhone 11 battery drain issue</a> with a new recalibration process. There were also some scattered <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/beware-ios-14-5-1-is-throttling.2294990/\">reports of throttling</a> with the iOS 14.5.1 update, but reports from affected users suggest the issue <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/beware-ios-14-5-1-is-throttling.2294990/post-29930013\">was addressed</a> in iOS 14.6.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/12/28/apple-iphone-battery-performance-price-drop/\">has maintained</a> that it would never intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product, or degrade the user experience to push customers to upgrade.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-slowdown/\">iPhone Slowdown</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/15/iphone-slowdown-apple-spain-ios-14-6/\">Consumer Rights Group in Spain Demands Apple Compensate Customers for iPhone Slowdowns Caused by iOS 14.5 and 14.6</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/consumer-rights-group-in-spain-demands-apple-compensate-customers-for-iphone-slowdowns-caused-by-ios-14-5-and-14-6.2304370/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=7yxSrIG5yNY:0YrVakJOz5c:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=7yxSrIG5yNY:0YrVakJOz5c:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/7yxSrIG5yNY\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"40e779e5c7641639031664e7474e732e1b13cedfde5db7efb34634d642406daf","category":"Apple"}
