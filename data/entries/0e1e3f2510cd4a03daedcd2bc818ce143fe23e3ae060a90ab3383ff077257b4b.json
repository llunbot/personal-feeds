Recent studies have proposed that the megalodon was a robust species of shark akin to today's great white sharks, only three times longer. And just like the great white shark inspired <em>Jaws</em>, the megalodon has also inspired a 1997 novel and a blockbuster film (2018's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/08/the-meg-film-review-were-going-to-need-a-stupider-boat/#:~:text=In%20some%20ways%2C%20it%27s%20so,boring%20shark%20don%27t%20help.&amp;text=Making%20fun%20of%20The%20Meg,a%20scientifically%20unsound%20super%2Dshark.\"><em>The Meg</em></a>)—not to mention a controversial <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megalodon:_The_Monster_Shark_Lives\">bit of \"docu-fiction\"</a> on the Discovery Channel. But now a team of 26 shark experts is challenging the great white shark comparison, arguing in a <a href=\"https://palaeo-electronica.org/content/2024/5079-megalodon-body-form\">new paper</a> published in the journal Paleontologia Electronica that the super-sized creature's body was more slender and possibly even longer than researchers previously thought.</p>\n<p>“Our study suggests that the modern great white shark may not necessarily serve as a good modern analogue for assessing at least certain aspects of its biology, including its size,” co-author Kenshu Shimada, a palaeobiologist at DePaul University in Chicago, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/jan/22/huge-fearsome-and-slender-rethink-megalodon-body-shape-experts-say\">told The Guardian</a>. “The reality is that we need the discovery of at least one complete megalodon skeleton to be more confident about its true size as well as its body form.” Thus far, nobody has found a complete specimen, only fossilized teeth and vertebrae.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/06/worlds-largest-predatory-shark-had-elevated-body-temperature/\">previously reported</a>, the largest shark alive today, reaching up to 20 meters long, is the whale shark, a sedate filter feeder. As recently as 4 million years ago, however, sharks of that scale likely included the fast-moving predator megalodon (formally <em>Otodus megalodon</em>). Due to incomplete fossil data, we're not entirely sure how large megalodons were and can only make inferences based on some of their living relatives, like the great white and mako sharks.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1996598#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1996598&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0e1e3f2510cd4a03daedcd2bc818ce143fe23e3ae060a90ab3383ff077257b4b","category":"Tech"}
