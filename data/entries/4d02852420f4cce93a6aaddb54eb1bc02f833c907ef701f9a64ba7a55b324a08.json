In 3T’s case, it’s a special version of its <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/03/3t-exploro-racemax-review-a-one-bike-solution-with-one-big-downside/\" target=\"_blank\">Exploro RaceMax aero gravel bike</a>, though the party includes far more than just a bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a garage, too. Really. Well, sort of.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to hitting the six-decade milestone, 3T recently brought frame production in-house to Presezzo, Italy, switching from Asian manufacturing with a lot of manual labor to a more automated setup involved filament winding and post-layup resin injection (a topic we’ll discuss in greater depth in an upcoming Nerd Alert podcast episode with company owner Gerard Vroomen). Painting is done in-house, too. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a big deal for 3T to bring frame production back “home” so to speak, and that Italian sourcing is a big part of this 60th-anniversary bike. It starts with the company’s flagship Exploro RaceMax Italia, which — of course — is then built with <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2020/09/new-campagnolo-ekar-groupset-brings-mechanical-13-speed-to-gravel/\" target=\"_blank\">Campagnolo’s Ekar 1×13 mechanical groupset</a>. 3T augments the package with its own made-in-Italy Torno carbon fiber 1x crankset, Discus 45/32 ultra-wide carbon rims, forged aluminum stem, and carbon fiber bar. Carbon-Ti then supplies the hubs, thru-axles, steel-and-carbon fiber disc rotors, and aluminum water bottle cage bolts. The 700×35 mm Pirelli Cinturato Gravel M tires get special badging on the sidewalls, Elite supplies a set of Leggero Carbon cages, and the whole lot is capped with a custom painted and 3D-printed <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2020/07/new-lower-priced-options-for-3d-printed-fizik-adaptive-saddles/\" target=\"_blank\">Fizik Antares Versus Evo 00 saddle</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At least in pictures, it’s a beautiful bike to behold with its iridescent and elegantly minimal blue paint job. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/3T-Dreambox-Exploro-RaceMax-2-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>I personally don’t find the Exploro RaceMax frameset to be the prettiest shape in and of itself, but in this treatment, it looks decidedly elegant.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To go along with the bike, 3T has partnered with a number of other Italian brands to make sure you’re properly outfitted for the ride. There’s special-edition riding kit from Castelli, a <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2018/10/best-road-cycling-helmets-ct-recommends/\" target=\"_blank\">Kask Protone aero helmet</a>, sunglasses from Koo, Fizik Terra X4 gravel shoes, <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2017/05/elite-fly-team-water-bottle-review-one-for-the-weight-weenies/\">Elite Fly bottles</a> to put in those ultralight cages, and even a <a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2020/12/reviewed-campagnolos-very-big-corkscrew/\" target=\"_blank\">Campagnolo Big Corkscrew</a> so you can recover with a suitably aerated glass of wine. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But wait, there’s more! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Surely you can’t be expected to just store that bike next to the other lesser steeds in your garage, and that limited-edition clothing definitely can’t co-mingle with anything else in your closet. To rectify all of that, 3T is supplying a custom-built “garage” that opens with a touch of a button on the wireless remote control and has dedicated spots for all of that fancy gear. Lest you think it’s just a dark cave inside, the whole thing is outfitted with interior LED lighting. From the outside, the giant gold-accented black box is sort of like the bike industry version of the monolith from Arthur C. Clarke’s Space Odyssey (which, interestingly enough, was set twenty years ago).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/3T-Dreambox-Exploro-RaceMax-6-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>The flared down tube is intended to divert air around water bottles for less aerodynamic drag.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Seems a bit over the top, no? Even 3T admits that it’s “rather insane”, but I’d imagine that only made the company want to do it even more — and I’d be lying if I said this exercise in gross excess doesn’t bring a grin to my face.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Needless to say, the entire “Dreambox” anniversary package is extravagantly priced at a truly jaw-dropping €19,610. American buyers get to join in the party if they’ve got US$19,610 to spare — plus US$750 for trans-Atlantic shipping. Maybe you just want the garage “for your other 3T bikes”? Well hey, that’ll only cost you €4,900 plus shipping. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>3T is limiting Dreambox production to — of course — 60 pieces. And while this whole thing probably seems completely bonkers to everyday folks like you and me, my guess is that 3T will sell every last one of them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>More information can be found at <a href=\"https://60thanniversary.3t.bike/\" target=\"_blank\">www.3t.bike</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><ul><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/3T-Dreambox-Exploro-RaceMax-3-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>The new filament wound construction is left raw up top for all to see.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/3T-Dreambox-Exploro-RaceMax-4-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>Clearance seems a bit tight, but wow, does this look good.</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><img src=\"https://cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/3T-Dreambox-Exploro-RaceMax-5-1340x754.jpg\" /><figcaption>Bringing frame production to Italy is a big deal.
