You can add a name for the pet and confirm additional photos.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn this album, you'll see all of the images you have of that animal, which is handy, and this function also allows specific memories of the pet to show up in the For You section.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe pet recognition feature seems to be accurate, and it is able to tell pets apart that have the same coloration. It was able to distinguish between two white cats, two orange cats, and two tabby cats with no issues and no mistakes.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPets are now denoted by more accurate icons with the Look Up feature, and the app will try to better determine a specific species.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has also improved the ‌iOS 17‌ ‌Photos‌ app with Visual Look Up for food items, which brings up recipes for similar dishes, and an option to look up information about the subject of a photo when you remove it from the background. Visual Look Up also now works in videos.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe changes to the ‌Photos‌ app are available to developer running the ‌iOS 17‌ beta, with Apple planning to release an ‌iOS 17‌ public beta next month.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/06/ios-17-photos-recognizes-pets/\">iOS 17 Photos App Recognizes Your Pets</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ios-17-photos-app-recognizes-your-pets.2391981/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"acd9dc666c9edbbed08f6cb2cde6d6a3fe3f1eb8cb89ce77329d6d2779854ce8","category":"Apple"}
