And it’s just 39g, with tons of mounting options, so you can literally stick it anywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there’s more to it than just enhanced video quality, this one packs a few nifty upgrades over <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/insta360-go-3-now-comes-in-black-still-remarkably-small/\">the 2.7K GO3</a> that make it worth a look…</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/insta360-go3s-4k-mini-action-camera.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1612\" height=\"1064\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/insta360-go3s-4k-mini-action-camera.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/insta360-go3s-4k-mini-action-camera.jpg 1612w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/insta360-go3s-4k-mini-action-camera-297x196.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/insta360-go3s-4k-mini-action-camera-1536x1014.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/insta360-go3s-4k-mini-action-camera-120x79.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/insta360-go3s-4k-mini-action-camera-768x507.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The GO3S get Dolby Vision for enhanced HDR footage, which means more vibrant colors. MegaView FOV captures more of what’s in front of the camera, then de-warps it for less of a fisheye effect without giving up width. A new CPU boosts processing power with a 120Mbps bitrate, so that 4K footage stays on track.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It comes with the Action Pod, which serves as both a charging cradle that can boost battery life to 140 minutes, up from 38 minutes for the camera alone. But it’s also a remote control with a 2.2″ color screen that flips around for easy selfies. The screen works wirelessly for live previews, too, so you can use the Action Pod to frame your shots no matter where you mount the camera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It syncs with Garmin devices and Apple Watch to record GPS position, speed, and other ride data, letting you overlay metrics in your video as graphics. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/insta360-GO3S-4K-action-camer-3.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/insta360-GO3S-4K-action-camer-3.jpg\" alt=\"insta360 GO3S 4k action camera shown with magnetic attachment on a shirt.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/insta360-GO3S-4K-action-camer-3.jpg 1920w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/insta360-GO3S-4K-action-camer-3-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/insta360-GO3S-4K-action-camer-3-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/insta360-GO3S-4K-action-camer-3-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/insta360-GO3S-4K-action-camer-3-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/insta360-GO3S-4K-action-camer-3-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The GO3S is magnetic, so you can use their pendant behind your shirt to record POV footage without the bulk of a chest strap for light activity, or put it in their optional two-prong mounting cases to attach it to traditional action camera mounts. Various other clips and stick-on mounts let you put it just about anywhere, and it’s size makes that even more interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Action Pod uses their magnetic click mount, same as what’s found on the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/insta360-launches-a-beast-of-an-8k-traditional-action-camera/\">Ace Pro 8K action camera</a> (which is also pretty awesome, IMO).</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, one of the best new features of the GO3S is its compatibility with Apple Find My. It’s tiny, which means it likes to hide, but now you can ping it from your iPhone and it’ll chime and show off its location so you can find it easier. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/insta360-GO3S-4K-action-camera-features.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2144\" height=\"1294\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/insta360-GO3S-4K-action-camera-features.jpg\" alt=\"graphic showing all the features of the insta360 GO3S 4k action camera.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/insta360-GO3S-4K-action-camera-features.jpg 2144w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/insta360-GO3S-4K-action-camera-features-297x179.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/insta360-GO3S-4K-action-camera-features-1536x927.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/insta360-GO3S-4K-action-camera-features-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/insta360-GO3S-4K-action-camera-features-768x464.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/insta360-GO3S-4K-action-camera-features-2048x1236.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>MSRP is $399 for the camera with Action Pod.
