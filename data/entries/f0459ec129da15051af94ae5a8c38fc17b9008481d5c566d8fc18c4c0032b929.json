{"title":"iPhone 16 Pro Demand Has Been Lower Than Expected, Analyst Says","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/15/iphone-16-pro-demand-estimate/","date":1726441087000,"content":"Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo today <a href=\"https://medium.com/@mingchikuo/iphone-16-first-weekend-pre-order-analysis-estimated-total-sales-of-about-37-million-units-pro-0a04869b147c\">said</a> demand for the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max has been \"lower than expected\" since the devices <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/13/iphone-16-preorders-now-available/\">became available to pre-order</a> in the U.S. and dozens of other countries on Friday. Kuo said his data is based on a \"supply chain survey\" and shipping estimates listed on Apple's online store.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/16-pro.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"898\" />\r<br />\nKuo estimated that sales of all four iPhone 16 models reached about 37 million units in the first weekend after Apple began accepting pre-orders, which is down nearly 13% compared to first-weekend sales of the iPhone 15 series last year. The analyst said a key factor for the decline is the lower demand for the Pro models, with first-weekend sales of the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max estimated to be down 27% and 16%, respectively, compared to iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max sales during the equivalent period last year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe standard iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus have seen higher demand than the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus during the first weekend of sales, but this has not been enough to offset the lower demand for the Pro models, according to Kuo.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nKuo said a major reason for the iPhone 16 Pro models having lower-than-expected demand is that Apple Intelligence will not be available on the devices when they launch on Friday. Instead, the first Apple Intelligence features are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/13/apple-intelligence-features-timing/\">rolling out with iOS 18.1 in October</a>. In addition, the analyst said the iPhone is facing \"intense competition\" in China.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16-Pro\">iPhone 16 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/15/iphone-16-pro-demand-estimate/\">iPhone 16 Pro Demand Has Been Lower Than Expected, Analyst Says</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-pro-demand-has-been-lower-than-expected-analyst-says.2436413/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f0459ec129da15051af94ae5a8c38fc17b9008481d5c566d8fc18c4c0032b929","category":"Apple"}
