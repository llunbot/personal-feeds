Look for Apple to position the device as a dream for game developers. Next, media consumption. I expect Apple to work with media partners to create content that can be watched in VR on the device. Third, communications. Look for Animojis and a VR FaceTime-like experience to be the new-age Zoom.</blockquote>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nA large number of details about the headset's hardware and specifications have now been reported, with the device rumored to feature a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/22/kuo-apple-headset-150-grams/\">lightweight design</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/25/kuo-apple-ar-headset-mac-level-computing/\">two main processors</a>, two <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/14/apple-vr-headset-3000ppi-micro-oled-display/\">4K micro LED displays</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/09/mixed-reality-headset-15-cameras/\">15 optical modules</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/18/apple-mixed-reality-headset-eye-tracking/\">eye-tracking</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/17/iphone-14-and-mixed-reality-headset-wi-fi-6e/\">Wi-Fi 6E connectivity</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-glasses/\">more</a>. Apple has filed a number of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/11/apple-mixed-reality-headset-revealed-patents/\">patents related to the device's potential software</a> and while it is expected to feature a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/09/mixed-reality-headset-15-cameras/\">see-through AR mode</a>, the anticipated software features Gurman outlined today are among the limited number of rumors around the device's functionality.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWith Apple's mixed reality headset now \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/16/apple-ar-headset-approaching-liftoff/\">approaching liftoff</a>,\" according to Morgan Stanley analysts, Kuo believes that the device will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/08/kuo-apple-ar-headset-2q-2022/\">begin mass production</a> in the second quarter of 2022 and launch in the fourth quarter of 2022.
