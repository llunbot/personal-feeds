You know the fish the USFS drops from helicopters into alpine lakes and can live in cut bank streams only 12″ wide and 30″ deep. Those fish.</p>\n<p>Like GCS’ other tapes, it’s made from super durable, custom-dyed nylon yarn, although this version has a softer, smother feel than the Eastern and Western Rattler tapes. The colors were chosen to look great with your favorite leather saddle and play nice with our Rattler-trimmed bags and accessories.</p>\n<p>You get two 3300mm rolls packaged in a high-quality mesh drawstring bag. The tape is backed with 1.5mm of foam for a little cushion on the rough stuff.</p>\n<p>Bartape made in Taiwan<br />\nBag cut and sewn in Seattle</p>\n<p>Check out more at <a href=\"https://www.campandgoslow.com/product/trout-tape-brown\" target=\"_blank\">Campandgoslow</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/campandgoslow-brown-trout-tape-restocked/\">Campandgoslow Brown Trout Tape Restocked</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"43054f839ac9cdeebfb58881b7641fb11bb72e7b5a25c688e2deb237a7566de3","category":"Cycling"}
