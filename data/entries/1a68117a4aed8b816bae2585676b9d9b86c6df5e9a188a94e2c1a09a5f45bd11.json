That changed with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/10/everything-to-know-about-apples-new-m3-m3-pro-and-m3-max-processors/\">the M3 chip generation</a>, which came to the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/review-apples-16-inch-m3-max-macbook-pro-crams-ultra-level-speed-into-a-laptop/\">MacBook Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/10/apples-m3-gives-the-new-24-inch-imac-a-big-speed-boost-but-little-else/\">iMac</a> first but left the Air untouched.</p>\n<p>That situation should change early next year, according to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-06/apple-prepares-m3-macbook-air-and-revamped-ipad-pro-for-early-next-year\">a report from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman</a>. Apple is reportedly preparing to launch updates to the MacBook Air, as well as several new iPad models, in \"the March time frame.\" Apple hasn't released any new iPads in 2023, and the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/07/2022-macbook-air-review-apples-clean-slate/\">13-inch M2 MacBook Air</a> was introduced in July of 2022.</p>\n\n<p>Gurman says not to expect design changes from the M3 Air. The M2 version introduced a new non-tapered design with a display notch, a new keyboard, and a MagSafe port, and the M3 Air should look externally identical.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1989392#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1989392&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1a68117a4aed8b816bae2585676b9d9b86c6df5e9a188a94e2c1a09a5f45bd11","category":"Tech"}
