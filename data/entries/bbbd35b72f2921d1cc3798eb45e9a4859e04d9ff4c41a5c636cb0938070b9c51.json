To maintain a slim design, the Gigabit Ethernet port is retractable.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe hub is available in Space Gray and Silver to match the finish of the MacBook Pro's chassis. While it has been designed for the new 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models to match their side profile and avoid interfering with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a> charging port, the DUO PRO also works with any MacBook from 2016 to 2020. With a universal USB-C adapter, the DUO PRO is also compatible with any Chromebooks, PCs, and iPads that have a USB-C port.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div></div>\r\n<br />\r\nThe DUO PRO has extended USB-C connectors that allow the hub to work with protective MacBook cases, and an optional adapter allows it to sit flush against MacBooks without a case. The DUO PRO also features HYPER's Magnetic Grip to allow it to securely attach to the MacBook.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe HyperDrive DUO PRO 7-in-2 USB-C Hub <a href=\"https://duopro.kckb.st/2e75e3d2\">is available for backing on Indiegogo now</a>. Early backers will be able to get the DUO PRO hub for $49.99, which is half of the final retail price.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<small><em>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with HYPER.
