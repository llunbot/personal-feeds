The latest addition to the ever-growing “<a href=\"https://ergonbike.shop/collections/comfort-touring-fitness\" target=\"_blank\">Comfort / Touring / Fitness Grips</a>”  section on Ergon’s website is the <a href=\"https://ergonbike.shop/collections/comfort-touring-fitness/products/gt1\">GT1.</a> It takes cues from the legacy <a href=\"https://ergonbike.shop/collections/comfort-touring-fitness/products/ergon-gp1\" target=\"_blank\">GP1</a>  and some of Ergon’s newer aesthetic in the <a href=\"https://ergonbike.shop/products/gs1-evo?variant=40772191092780&amp;currency=USD&amp;mtm_campaign=us_shop_pmax_2024&amp;mtm_kwd=&amp;mtm_source=googleads&amp;mtm_medium=cpc&amp;mtm_group=&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAl4a6BhBqEiwAqvrqugaIbRmITX_CqRErMAxpCZfFSe-jaNBqPbM5SEuJePYSRu_yir0zbRoCE5YQAvD_BwE\" target=\"_blank\">GS1 EVO</a>. The GT1 adds a small bar-end nub on the outside of the grip as well as a thumb catch nub on the inboard side of the grip. The wing or paddle of the grip is considerably larger than its predecessors as well.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Ergon_GT1_Review-7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Ergon_GT1_Review-7.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Ergon_GT1_Review-7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Ergon_GT1_Review-7.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Missing the Mark</h3>\n<p>I’m gonna state my bias here. I was hoping the GT1 would be the grip that fulfilled my dreams of a <a href=\"https://ergonbike.shop/collections/mountain-trail-grips/products/ergon-ga3-1\" target=\"_blank\">GA3</a> and <a href=\"https://ergonbike.shop/collections/comfort-touring-fitness/products/ergon-gp2?variant=1000845068\" target=\"_blank\">GP2</a> hybrid. Unfortunately, the GT1 fell short of my expectations in two regards: the nubs were too small to function how I would have liked, and the bar clamp was on the outside of the grip.</p>\n<p>I was hoping the bar-end nub would serve as more of a thumb catch for long climbs and airing my sweaty hands out. Rather, it functions as something you have to wrap your whole hand around. The inner nub serves this purpose moreso, but I was hoping for a more substantial bar end on the outside of the grip.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Ergon_GT1_Review-4.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Ergon_GT1_Review-4.jpg?w=200&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Ergon_GT1_Review-4.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Ergon_GT1_Review-3.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Ergon_GT1_Review-3.jpg?w=200&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Ergon_GT1_Review-3.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Ergon_GT1_Review-2.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Ergon_GT1_Review-2.jpg?w=200&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Ergon_GT1_Review-2.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Ergon_GT1_Review-1.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Ergon_GT1_Review-1.jpg?w=200&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Ergon_GT1_Review-1.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Secondly, the clamp is placed at the end of the bar and the lock-on sleeve of the grip does not extend the full length of the grip. This led to the grip being able to “rev” much like a motorcycle throttle. The grip does not slip, but the inherent flex of the material allows a significant amount of movement. Some people might find this an appreciable attribute, but I found it unnerving. I was able to ascertain that the flex was an intentional design for the grips. However, I would have liked to have seen the same clamp style as the GS1 EVO, as the recessed bolt on the GT1 is too recessed to adjust easily with multi-tools.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Ergon_GT1_Review-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Ergon_GT1_Review-6.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Ergon_GT1_Review-6.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Ergon_GT1_Review-6.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Still Hitting the Target</h3>\n<p>Is the GT1 a bad grip? Not at all. The wing is very comfortable and generously sized. I had no hand discomfort during any of my test rides. For less demanding off-road touring or trekking, the GT1 is a great multi-position grip for flat bars. I’m projecting my aspirations and dreams onto something that wasn’t designed for my specific use. Maybe one day Ergon will hear my call and make a dreamy GA3 with a small bar-end, but it’s not the GT1, and that’s okay.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Ergon_GT1_Review-8.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Ergon_GT1_Review-8.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Ergon_GT1_Review-8.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Ergon_GT1_Review-8.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Winged Evolution</h3>\n<p>If you are looking for a more modern winged touring grip that allows for multiple hand positions, the Ergon GT1 is a great option. While the GS1 EVO was a perfect modernization of the GP1, I was hoping for the same with GT1 as an upgrade to the GP2 grips. Nonetheless, the GT1 is a great grip with a very large winged platform and many ways to cradle your hand on long rides or tours.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Ergon_GT1_Review-5.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Ergon_GT1_Review-5.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Ergon_GT1_Review-5.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/11/2024_Ergon_GT1_Review-5.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Pros</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Multiple hand positions</li>\n<li>Large winged design</li>\n<li>Comfortable and supportive</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cons</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The lock-on sleeve doesn’t extend the full length of the grip, which leads to twisting</li>\n<li>The bar-end nub is too small to use as a thumb catch</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/ergon-gt1-grip-review/\">Ergon GT1 Grip Review: Not What I Hoped For</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"spencer harding","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"0db93b962f102f37eb76c67791c59773b93e8b690e317161ab1c6e64a778a969","category":"Cycling"}
