In the M1 line, the Ultra was the top-of-the-line chip with substantially better performance than the Pro or Max—particularly in graphically intensive tasks. M2 Ultra will support 192 GB of unified memory, 800 GB/s memory bandwith, and a 24-core CPU and up to 76 cores of GPU. Apple claims the M2 Ultra will work 30% faster than the M1 Ultra, and that a single system with the Ultra can work machine learning datasets that would choke systems with discrete GPUs.</p>\n<p>The M2 Max is \"up to 50 percent faster\" than the prior Max-based Studio, according to Apple, and features a 12-core CPU, 38-core GPU, and up to 96 GB unified memory, with 400 GB/s memory bandwidth.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1944178#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1944178&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1647d0c532c009c92ee9528e0432349ea68bfd0422cff22576dca51e52764e72","category":"Tech"}
