The last 12-inch MacBook model offered the same low-powered, tapered, USB-C-centric, and fanless design of the subsequent ‌MacBook Air‌, so they were clearly positioned as similar devices.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nElsewhere in the product lineup, the inverse may happen with the ‌iMac‌. In recent years, Apple has sold two main ‌iMac‌ models: a 21.5-inch model and a more powerful 27-inch model. Earlier this year, the 21.5-inch model was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/20/apple-announces-redesigned-imac/\">replaced with an all-new 24-inch model</a> with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a> chip. The 27-inch model has yet to receive a redesign or an update with Apple silicon, but <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/30/imac-pro-2022-rumors/\">another rumor from Dylandkt</a> claims that the new model could actually be called the \"‌iMac‌ Pro.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple previously offered an ‌iMac‌ Pro in Space Gray from 2017, in addition to the other two ‌iMac‌ models, but the machine was discontinued in early 2021. The high-end ‌iMac‌ model <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/2022-imac-pro/\">rumored to launch next year</a> is expected to feature a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/30/imac-pro-2022-rumors/\">different design</a>, more ports, and more powerful chips compared to the 24-inch model. The \"‌iMac‌ Pro\" moniker could make it clearer to customers that the larger, high-end ‌iMac‌ is a professional machine that is significantly different from its smaller sibling, rather than just calling both models the \"‌iMac‌\" as in previous years.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThese changes would mean that there was simply the \"MacBook\" and \"MacBook Pro\" in terms of Apple laptops, and the \"‌iMac‌\" and \"‌iMac‌ Pro\" for Apple all-in-one desktops. This would also bring the Mac more in line with the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, where there is primarily only the \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a>\" and \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13-pro/\">iPhone 13 Pro</a>.\" \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs machines that are expected to get a major overhaul, it seems plausible that Apple could use the launch of the \"MacBook\" and \"‌iMac‌ Pro\" to simplify the Mac lineup's naming. Apple once <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/29/apple-considered-launching-apple-watch-pro/\">considered launching an \"Apple Watch Pro\"</a>, but there is no sign of the \"Pro\" label coming to the Apple Watch for 2022 even though a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/02/rugged-apple-watch-explorer-edition/\">new model with a \"rugged\" casing</a> designed for sports and challenging environments is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/08/rumored-apple-watch-lineup-for-2022/\">reportedly on the way</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> lineup, on the other hand, remains an open question due to the prominence of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air</a>, which is offered in between the entry-level ‌iPad‌ and the high-end <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, so Apple could yet have some way to go before it achieves consistency across the naming of its major products.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iMac\">iMac (Neutral)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">MacBook Air (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/imac.91\">iMac</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/11/apple-could-simplify-its-naming-strategy-in-2022/\">2022 'MacBook' and 'iMac Pro' Could Help Apple Simplify Its Naming Strategy</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/2022-macbook-and-imac-pro-could-help-apple-simplify-its-naming-strategy.2327054/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=00OUE9FGz-M:8SQXwSlgVlQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=00OUE9FGz-M:8SQXwSlgVlQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"92507cd389a75b0866a141fab962f84a27c68377f6692ddb5dc57fd3cfdcc9ae","category":"Apple"}
