However, the GC results are not the only thing that defines a team’s performance at a Grand Tour. Plenty of squads came into this race with ambitions of sprint glory, breakaway antics or simply a chance of getting on TV.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Out of the 23 teams that started the Giro d’Italia, 11 claimed stage wins, 15 teams were represented inside the top 20 of the overall rankings and six ended up winning special prizes in Rome. Elsewhere, 11 teams scored over 1,000 UCI points and ten squads managed to accrue more than €50,000 in prize money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we’ve let the dust settle on the 108th Giro d’Italia, we’ve put together a report card for every team. To settle on our scores from A to F, we’ll factor in roster strength, pre-race ambitions, results and visibility throughout the race.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Alpecin-Deceuninck: B</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"693\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2215255253-970x693.webp\" alt=\"NAPOLI  ITALY - MAY 15: Kaden Groves of Australia and Team Alpecin - Deceuninck celebrates at finish line as stage winner during the 108th Giro d'Italia 2025, Stage 6 a 227km stage from Potenza to Napoli / #UCIWT / on May 15, 2025 in Potenza, Italy.

By that, I mean a sprint stage victory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, Kaden Groves continued the Belgian team’s incredible victory streak, with another win to add to their books on a rainy day in Naples. After that, he continued to get stuck in at the head of sprint finales, with two further podium finishes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, the squad were present in breakaways when they had the resources. Quinten Hermans and Groves were off the front of the race on several occasions – most notably the gravel stage – but no additional wins would come their way. In all fairness, it’s tough for a sprint team to claim a win outside the flatlands, but Alpecin-Deceuninck certainly filled their customary role as a reliable pack of rouleurs and fastmen.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"332\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-4-970x332.webp\" alt=\"Cyclist newsletter banner saying 'get your regular dose of Cyclist, click here to sign up'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-4-970x332.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-4-300x103.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-4-768x263.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-4-1536x526.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-4-2048x701.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-4-750x257.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Newsletter-flash-v2-4-1140x390.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Arkéa-B&amp;B Hotels: F</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1672\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2217635372-min-scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2217635372-min-scaled.webp 2560w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2217635372-min-300x196.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2217635372-min-970x633.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2217635372-min-768x501.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2217635372-min-1536x1003.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2217635372-min-2048x1337.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2217635372-min-750x490.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2217635372-min-1140x744.webp 1140w\" /><figcaption>Dario Belingheri/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If anyone can recall one highlight from Arkéa-B&amp;B Hotels’ Giro d’Italia, I’ll give you a fiver.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their silence has been almost deafening throughout the three weeks. There has been no ambition in the breakaways, no attempts on the sprints, and nothing to write home about. Alessandro Verre almost gave me the right to crack an egg on my face on Stage 20, but otherwise the squad had an enormous lack of impact in the race mechanics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is some praise to be handed to the 22-year-old Embret Svestad-Bårdseng, who finished in 22nd place in the overall standings. Although this was a solid result for a rider no one had heard of three weeks ago, I would have expected more from a team <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/uci-rankings-promotions-and-relegations\">on the cusp of WorldTour relegation</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/simon-yates-giro-ditalia-2025\">Simon Yates takes the bull by the horns to win Giro d’Italia</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pro-cycling-winners-losers-may-2025\">Pro cycling winners and losers in May</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cyclist-way-too-early-tour-de-france-2025-predictions\">Cyclist’s way too early Tour de France 2025 predictions</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\">Men’s Tour de France 2025 route revealed with Mont Ventoux, Superbagnères, La Plagne, Col de la Loze and a mountain TT</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Bahrain Victorious: B-</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2216096760-970x647.webp\" alt=\"Bahrain Victorious' Italian rider Antonio Tiberi (C) rides after crossing the finish line of the 14th stage of the 108th Giro d'Italia cycling race of 195kms from Treviso in Italy to Nova Gorica in Slovenia on May 24, 2025.

They’ve reached the podium, won the points jersey and claimed plenty of stages in recent years. This season they were solid once again but not quite as prevalent as before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For most of the first two weeks, Antonio Tiberi looked set for a top ten finish. While in third place overall the Italian’s Giro came crumbling down <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-2025-week-two\">after a heavy crash and time loss on Stage 14</a>. He would soon feel the effects of the tumble and drop down the standings even further in the final week. With Tiberi out of sight, Damiano Caruso would soldier on to another top five finish at the Giro, his third in four years. Without that result, it would have been tough to praise this team at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Bahrain secured another top GC result, the squad has failed to win a stage, continuing a drought in the Grand Tours stretching from the 2023 Vuelta. With that, we can consider Bahrain’s race to be bang average for a team of its budget.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Cofidis: D</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1831\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2215055368-scaled.webp\" alt=\"LECCE, ITALY - MAY 14: (L-R) Alex Edmondson of Australia and Team Picnic PostNL, Jan Maas of Netherlands and Nicolas Debeaumarche of France and Team Cofidis compete during the 108th Giro d'Italia 2025, Stage 5 a 151km stage from Ceglie Messapica to Lecce / #UCIWT / on May 14, 2025 in Lecce, Italy.

And yes, they started on the right foot, as Sylvain Moniquet had a brief stint in the blue jersey. However, the other noteworthy results were few and far between.

They took two stages and finished in fourth overall with Ben O’Connor. With two of the stars from last year’s roster off their books in 2025, the French squad were never going to surpass their results from twelve months ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, Nicolas Prodhomme managed to bring some champagne to the dinner table. The French climber, who only took his first pro win at the Tour of the Alps in April, enjoyed a solid Giro. Surfing in the teens in GC, Prodhomme managed to break free of the GC politics and claim a first Grand Tour stage victory on a tough day through the Valle d’Aosta on Stage 19.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite Prodhomme’s stage victory and eventual fifteenth place finish in GC, there will be some disappointment for the team’s sprint contingent. Sam Bennett had plenty of support, but the Munsterman would only reach the top ten of a sprint on one occasion over the three weeks. What he lacked in the sprints, Dries de Bondt picked up in the breakaway, claiming the lesser-known Intergiro prize.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>EF Education-EasyPost: A</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"707\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2217321837-min-970x707.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2217321837-min-970x707.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2217321837-min-300x219.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2217321837-min-768x560.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2217321837-min-1536x1119.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2217321837-min-2048x1493.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2217321837-min-120x86.webp 120w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2217321837-min-750x547.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2217321837-min-1140x831.webp 1140w\" /><figcaption> Dario Belingheri/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I can easily say that EF Education-First were one of the best teams at this year’s Giro d’Italia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the stage-winning front, the American team, which has nowhere near a superteam budget, exceeded expectations. Richard Carapaz and Kasper Asgreen took wins during the second week, with both affirming their big-money contracts over the past couple of seasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, EF won’t be remembered for Asgreen’s breakaway effort. Instead, we will revisit Carapaz’s Stage 20 mind games. As the Ecuadorian failed to work with Del Toro on the Colle delle Finestre, his hopes of adding a second <em><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-d-italia-why-jersey-pink\">maglia rosa </a></em>to his jersey collection went up in pink smoke. A second place turned into a third place, putting a bit of a downer on what had been an exceptional final week for the 2019 Giro champion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carapaz aside, EF played a bigger role in the race than some may have expected. Mikkel Honoré was back to his best, and Darren Rafferty, the first rider from the north of Ireland to ever compete in the Giro d’Italia, was an important domestique for Carapaz in the final week. Despite the squad’s relative lack of resources and manpower, they still managed to provide a solid GC bubble in support of Carapaz.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Groupama-FDJ: D</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2216677026-min-scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2216677026-min-scaled.webp 2560w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2216677026-min-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2216677026-min-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2216677026-min-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2216677026-min-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2216677026-min-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2216677026-min-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2216677026-min-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2216677026-min-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2216677026-min-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2216677026-min-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Tim de Waele/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people had high hopes of Groupama-FDJ coming into this Giro. David Gaudu, a former top five finisher at the Tour de France, had finally made his Giro debut, and some hoped he would be able to shake off the lofty expectations of the French press now that he’d escaped the Grande Boucle. However, these hopes would soon disappear as Gaudu slipped down the GC pecking order.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Naturally, Groupama-FDJ then fulfilled their breakaway role. We got to know the likes of Enzo Paleni and Lorenzo Germani, while Gaudu and Rémy Rochas popped up when the road went uphill. In the end, there are no stage victories to discuss here, not even a top three placing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s no secret that Groupama-FDJ will be looking forward to their home race in July. The Tour has always been a priority, with the Giro once again taking a second-tier role in the team’s results sheet. However, they really need to figure out how to win Giro stages, because it’s starting to become a bit of a mystery in the post-Pinot and Démare era.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ineos Grenadiers: B</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214944654-min-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214944654-min-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214944654-min-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214944654-min-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214944654-min-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214944654-min-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214944654-min-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214944654-min-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214944654-min-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214944654-min-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214944654-min-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Luca Bettini/AFP</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ineos Grenadiers tried to reprise their role as an all-star GC team at this year’s Giro. Using their cast of young names, the squad were bullish in their quest for Egan Bernal to return top of the Grand Tour podium. In the end, these efforts would come up short as the Colombian finished in seventh place overall in his first Giro since winning the whole thing back in 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can’t accuse Ineos of not trying. During the second week they threw the kitchen sink at the peloton, trying to create a selection that could bring Bernal closer to the podium. Ultimately, the wheels fell off in the final week as Thymen Arensman ran out of steam and Bernal finally reached his limit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, some of the more notable results came outside of the mountains. Josh Tarling claimed his first Grand Tour time-trial in Albania, Ben Turner came close to a sprint win during the second week and Brandon Rivera continued to impress, particularly with his work on the gravel stage to Siena.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All things considered, a stage and top ten isn’t quite classic Ineos, but it’s certainly better than some other teams on this list and Bernal’s comeback is huge, even if he’s not at podium level yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Intermarché-Wanty: E</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"699\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2215027452-970x699.webp\" alt=\"CEGLIE MESSAPICA, ITALY - MAY 14: Louis Meintjes of South Africa, Francesco Busatto of Italy, Kevin Colleoni of Italy, Simone Petilli of Italy, Dion Smith of New Zealand, Gerben Thijssen of Belgium, Taco Van Der Hoorn of Netherlands, Gijs Van Hoecke of Belgium and Team Intermarche - Wanty prior to the 108th Giro d'Italia 2025, Stage 5 a 151km stage from Ceglie Messapica to Lecce / #UCIWT / on May 14, 2025 in Ceglie Messapica, Italy.

Louis Meintjes picked up the baton in the final week, but he would also struggle to stick around at the head of the race.

It’s not common for teams to win two stages from the breakaway in any Grand Tour, so we can only praise Jayco for pulling it off on two highly competitive days in the escape group.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Lidl-Trek: A</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214883680-min-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214883680-min-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214883680-min-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214883680-min-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214883680-min-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214883680-min-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214883680-min-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214883680-min-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214883680-min-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214883680-min-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/GettyImages-2214883680-min-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Tim de Waele/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Lidl-Trek were one of the teams of the 2025 Giro d’Italia. They started in winning form, with Pedersen’s double in Albania during the opening days. This winning streak would only continue, with two further victories from Pedersen, a time-trial victory by Daan Hoole and one final breakaway victory for Carlos Verona. In total Lidl-Trek scored six stages, almost a third of the entire Giro. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Disappointingly Giulio Ciccone was wiped out of the GC following a crash on Stage 14. That was through no fault of his own because he was looking mightily strong beforehand, capable of reaching the top ten in GC at least if he stuck in the fight. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall though, this was an ideal Giro for Lidl-Trek. Yes, they missed out on the GC cherry, but Pedersen was the stand-out, proved by his <em>maglia</em> <em>ciclamino</em> tyranny. The team’s domestiques also shone, most notably Daan Hoole, Mathias Vacek and Carlos Verona. Everyone in the squad played their part, becoming some of the most familiar characters at this year’s Giro d’Italia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’ll be a tough ask for Jonathan Milan and Mattias Skjelmose to follow at the Tour de France, that’s for sure.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/simon-yates-giro-ditalia-2025\">Simon Yates takes the bull by the horns to win Giro d’Italia</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pro-cycling-winners-losers-may-2025\">Pro cycling winners and losers in May</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cyclist-way-too-early-tour-de-france-2025-predictions\">Cyclist’s way too early Tour de France 2025 predictions</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\">Men’s Tour de France 2025 route revealed with Mont Ventoux, Superbagnères, La Plagne, Col de la Loze and a mountain TT</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Movistar: C</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1742\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2217338466-scaled.webp\" alt=\"SAN VALENTINO, ITALY - MAY 27: Einer Rubio of Colombia and Movistar Team crosses the finish line during the 108th Giro d'Italia 2025, Stage 16 a 203km stage from Piazzola sul Brenta to San Valentino (Brentonico) 1316m / #UCIWT / on May 27, 2025 in San Valentino, Italy.

They missed the sprints, many breakaways and kept a relatively low profile in the mountains. I’ll therefore keep this short and sweet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite their relative lack of pizzazz, team leader Einer Rubio still managed to climb up the standings into the final top ten in Rome. He didn’t just scrape through either, he finished in eighth, not far off the much more visible Egan Bernal. Although there were no distinctive ‘wow moments’ from Movistar, this GC result certainly means the team were not left in the doldrums.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Picnic-PostNL: B</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"1865\" height=\"1243\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2214285626.webp\" alt=\"Team Picnic PostNL's Dutch rider Casper Van Uden celebrates as he crosses the finish line of the 4th stage of the 108th Giro d'Italia cycling race 189kms from Alberobello to Lecce on May 13, 2025 (Photo by Luca Bettini / AFP) (Photo by LUCA BETTINI/AFP via Getty Images)\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2214285626.webp 1865w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2214285626-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2214285626-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2214285626-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2214285626-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2214285626-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2214285626-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2214285626-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2214285626-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2214285626-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Luca Bettini/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Picnic-PostNL needed to have a good Giro. They have been stalling so far in 2025, with victories few and far between. The Dutch team have, therefore, been dropping towards the relegation zone and have become locked in a tight battle between several lower-ranked teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Casper van Uden claimed a first Grand Tour stage victory early on in the race, supported greatly by a killer leadout from Bram Welten. Romain Bardet would face a worse fate, stumbling down the GC standings, only to then miss out on a stage win when we thought he’d have enough breakaway freedom to chase one final victory as a pro. Stages aside, the team were anchored by Max Poole’s GC yo-yo, eventually yielding a decent eleventh place in the overall standings. Not bad for an untested youngster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/uci-rankings-promotions-and-relegations\">In terms of the ongoing relegation battle</a>, Picnic-PostNL stood their ground above the relegation zone, perhaps due to lacklustre performances from Cofidis and Intermarché. Van Uden’s stage win and Bardet’s runner-up spot helped prop up a healthy haul. It’s not been as successful as some of their Grand Tours before, but they did what they needed to squeeze out some sense of momentum for the races to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Polti-VisitMalta: C</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2216502200-scaled.webp\" alt=\"VIADANA, ITALY - MAY 22: Andrea Pietrobon of Italy and Team Polti VisitMalta in the breakaway caught by the peloton during the 108th Giro d'Italia 2025, Stage 12 a 172km stage from Modena to Viadana (Oglio-Po) / #UCIWT / on May 22, 2025 in Viadana, Italy.

The Italian squad couldn’t add another stage this year, but they scored a couple of solid results in the sprints and breakaways. From the break, Mirco Maestri finished inside the top ten twice, as did sprinter Giovanni Lonardi. To top off these efforts, Davide Piganzoli pulled another solid GC result out the bag, finishing in fourteenth place overall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although this may not look all too impressive on paper, Polti received the sixth biggest prize money cheque from the race organisers at €58,183. Alessandro Tonelli alone scored roughly €12,000, not too far off Intermarché’s total for the entire race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, Polti missed out on their precious Fuga prize, which is handed out to the rider with the most amount of breakaway kilometres. That aside, it was a solid Giro for the team part owned by former Giro champions Alberto Contador and Ivan Basso. Regardless of that near miss, Polti-VisitMalta were still one of the more visible teams in the breakaway, especially in the doomed escape groups on the flat. For this reason, I have to give them kudos for fulfilling the role the Italian invitees are often expected to fall into at the Giro.

Having beaten the likes of Uno X and the Italian Solutions squad to a wildcard spot, it was understandable for the Swiss team to be under a microscope for many.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the road though, Tom Pidcock was incredibly disappointing throughout this Giro. Yes, he picked up a couple of top tens here and there, but he lacked any real chance in the GC. If you look at the final overall standings, he’s the lowest ranked out of the competitors who fully targeted the pink jersey coming into this race and weren’t blighted by crashes or breakaway snakes and ladders. I think this shows that Pidcock just isn’t cut out for GC. Some called this a practice run before the Vuelta, but I think this is categorical evidence that he needs to focus on stage wins and breakaways going forward. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given that they were all-in for Project Pidcock, the team lacked any real stand-out performances from the breakaway. Matteo Moschetti provided some positive headlines in the sprints, but most of us were too busy criticising Pidcock to appreciate them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s hope <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/cycling-transfer-rumours\">the transfer news is true</a> and Q36.5 start bolstering their roster, because if they get invited to next year’s Giro, I won’t be as lenient on their grade.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe: C</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2218131606-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2218131606-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2218131606-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2218131606-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2218131606-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2218131606-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2218131606-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2218131606-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2218131606-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2218131606-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2218131606-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Dario Belingheri/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe came into the race with one of the strongest startlists. They boasted two former champions in Primož Roglič and Jai Hindley, and were supported by last year’s runner-up Dani Martínez and upcoming star Giulio Pelizzari. Their ambitions were sky high, with the victory a real possibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In reality, they were underwhelming for most of the race. Roglič’s buddies failed to control the race and then support him when he came down in several crashes and lost time. There was no sprinter to chase other top tens, so all hands were on board the sinking Slovenian ship, which would eventually run aground on Stage 16.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly, the team only got better once Roglič climbed into the car. Nico Denz salvaged a stage victory, while Guilin Pelizzari impressed throughout the final week, paving the way to an affirming sixth place overall. If it weren’t for these two riders’ results, Red Bull-Bora Hansgrohe would be firmly on a D or E grade.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Soudal-QuickStep: D</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2214239275-min-scaled.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2214239275-min-scaled.webp 2560w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2214239275-min-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2214239275-min-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2214239275-min-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2214239275-min-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2214239275-min-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2214239275-min-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2214239275-min-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2214239275-min-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2214239275-min-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2214239275-min-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Tim de Waele/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve seen plenty of Grand Tours in my time. I’ve never seen one with such a poor performance from Soudal-QuickStep during all of its iterations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be fair, they were cruelly dealt a rough hand on day one when Mikel Landa was forced to abandon. As the team’s main priority and designated leader, some head scratching was required to get something out of the race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>James Knox made a brief GC bid, while Josef Černý and Mattia Cattaneo were sent out on breakaway duties, but Gianmarco Garofoli was the stand-out. The young Italian was a staple of the breakaways once the race hit the mountains. Although it didn’t lead to any stage victory, he deserves a big pat on the back for carrying the Belgian team’s race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, Paul Magnier received his first blow from Patrick Lefevere’s boxing glove of insults. He wasn’t convinced of Magnier’s Grand Tour debut, so don’t expect the Frenchman to be making a switch to the Tour de France anytime soon. Likewise, American sprinter Luke Lamperti was similarly off the mark, contrasting his early-season results in smaller competitions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tudor Pro Cycling: B</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1708\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2217684442-scaled.webp\" alt=\"CESANO MADERNO, ITALY - MAY 29: Rick Pluimers of Netherlands and Team Tudor Pro Cycling eats Haribo during the 108th Giro d'Italia 2025, Stage 18 a 144km stage from Morbegno to Cesano Maderno on May 29, 2025 in Cesano Maderno, Italy.

This is quite rare for wildcard squads, so it can be hard for ProTeams to stand out over two separate Grand Tour rosters. New signings Marc Hirschi and Julian Alaphilippe have been handed a pass into the Tour de France, so it was down to Michael Storer and his band of young teammates to make it count here in Italy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As expected, Storer once again finished inside the top ten. His GC result may not seem as ambitious as it once looked, but we have to factor in his waning form towards the final week of the race. At times, it looked as though he had the legs for better, but some crashes and off-days moved him down a couple of pegs in the overall standings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elsewhere, Florian Stork was a bit of a revelation at this year’s Giro, as he has been over the course of the 2025 season. Yannis Voisard was equally impressive, flying off in the breakaway on several occasions. The Swiss squad’s lead-out train looked first class at points, but there were only two top tens from Maikel Zijlaard to show for these efforts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, I look forward to what they bring at the Tour, but going forward, they really need better fortunes in Grand Tours if they want to compete for a WorldTour license at the end of the next cycle in 2028.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>UAE Team Emirates XRG: A</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2216871256-scaled.webp\" alt=\"UAE Team Emirates XRG's Mexican rider Isaac Del Toro celebrates as he crosses the finish line to win the 17th stage of the 108th Giro d'Italia cycling race, 155kms from San Michele all'Adige to Bormio, on May 28, 2025.

They managed to win two stages, the white jersey and finish in second place in GC, however they ultimately lost the race through strange tactics on the final stage to Sestriere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Isaac del Toro ended up as the team leader after a tense two-pronged strategy during the second week. To that end, the squad lost the support of Juan Ayuso after cracking on Stage 16, then getting stung by a bee the following day. For Del Toro, on the other hand, this Grand Tour opened the door for an entertaining pink jersey bid. He claimed a stage and ruffled some feathers in the final week, riding like a Grand Tour champion. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As strong as Del Toro was, the team missed the opportunity to have satellite riders in the breakaway during the final week. Instead they nursed the chances of Brandon McNulty in the GC and kept Majka in the bunch to do the brunt of the work when they could have relied on rival squads. Many have raised criticism of UAE for playing this too defensively while Del Toro only had a minute’s advantage in the overall standings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of how it all turned out, ten days in the pink jersey, two stages and a podium finish shouldn’t be overlooked. It feels subjective to say this but in terms of entertainment and getting us talking, UAE Team Emirates certainly overdelivered.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Visma-Lease a Bike: A</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2217513955-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2217513955-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2217513955-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2217513955-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2217513955-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2217513955-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2217513955-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2217513955-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2217513955-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2217513955-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2217513955-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>Luica Bettini/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As traditional Grand Tour wish lists go, Visma-Lease a Bike ticked all the boxes. They won two sprint stages, the gravel stage and the overall classification. Clearly, it’s hard to pick flaws in their results sheet, given that they won on all terrains and claimed the biggest prize of them all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming into the race with a split focus between Olav Kooij and Simon Yates, they ended up succeeding in both domains, especially once Van Aert clicked into gear on the gravel stage. The team were quite hands-off in the mountains, but Yates would soon lean on Van Aert to support him during the final week, not only in the valley after the Colle delle Finestre. These tactics were smart, relying on EF and UAE to set the pace and chase the breakaway during the final week, paving the way for a fresh Yates to pounce when it mattered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Very few teams have mastered the art of balancing sprinting and GC in recent years. Not only that, but to the extent where you can win the GC and two sprint stages in the same year. For that, and bearing in mind the relatively weak startlist for Visma’-Lease a Bike’s standards, we can only say that they exceeded expectations in every sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>XDS-Astana: A</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"2508\" height=\"1672\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/06/GettyImages-2216765238.webp\" alt=\"XDS Astana Team's Italian rider Christian Scaroni (R) celebrates alongside second placed XDS Astana Team's Italian rider Lorenzo Fortunato after victory as he crosses the finish line of the 16th stage of the 108th Giro d'Italia cycling race of 203kms from Piazzola sul Brenta to San Valentino on May 27, 2025.

There, early-season star Christian Scaroni added more UCI points to his growing haul as well as a first Grand Tour stage victory. We also can’t forget Diego Ulissi’s day in the <em>maglia</em> <em>rosa</em>, ending a ten-year wait to finally pull on the jersey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the end, XDS-Astana were the sixth-highest points scorers according to the UCI points scale. Their <em>maglia</em> <em>azzura</em> siege alone yielded over 300 points, the equivalent of a seventh place finish in GC, so they certainly managed to strike the jackpot in terms of their ongoing relegation fight. With a stage win along the way and a pink jersey stint, there’s not much more they could have asked for.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+3\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-3-970x300.webp\" alt=\"Cyclist banner saying 'the best rides, bikes, kit and pro interviews every month, click here to subscribe'\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-3-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-3-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-3-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-3-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-3-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-3-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/05/Subs-flash-164-for-web-3-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/2025-giro-ditalia-ranking\">We graded every team’s 2025 Giro d’Italia</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Ewan Wilson &#124; Staff Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"384bc2695a40c41adba65abfcab098e59e786dc16a730739f5bedf4d08183661","category":"Cycling"}
