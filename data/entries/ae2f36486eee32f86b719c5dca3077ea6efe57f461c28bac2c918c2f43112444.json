That said, GymKit has become less important since Peloton rolled out Apple Watch integration to all its fitness equipment in 2022.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPeloton's app does all the things that GymKit offers, including tracking things like distance, pace, and heart rate metrics, and showing them live on Peloton screens. The only difference is that it's no longer using Apple's GymKit API to do the syncing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple introduced GymKit as part of watchOS 4.1, which was released back in October 2017.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/gymkit/\">GymKit</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/peloton/\">Peloton</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/13/peloton-losing-apple-watch-gymkit-support/\">Peloton Is Dropping Apple Watch GymKit Support</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/peloton-is-dropping-apple-watch-gymkit-support.2419319/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ae2f36486eee32f86b719c5dca3077ea6efe57f461c28bac2c918c2f43112444","category":"Apple"}
