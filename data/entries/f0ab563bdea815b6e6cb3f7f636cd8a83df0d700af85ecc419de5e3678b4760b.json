Kamala Harris will protect your right to\n<em>disagree</em> with her. About policies, or ideas. And then, as we\nhave done for centuries, we’ll debate them. We’ll work on them\ntogether. And we’ll move forward. The other guy? He demands\nunquestioning loyalty. Says he wants revenge.</p>\n\n<p>I’m Harrison Ford, I’ve got one vote, same as everyone else — and I’m going to use it to move forward. I’m going to vote for\nKamala Harris.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ford’s message is a powerful framing of the authoritarian, anti-democracy dynamic in this election. Short, gruff, and to the point. Worth sharing to anyone you think might still be on the fence.</p>\n\n<p><strong>See Also:</strong> <a href=\"https://x.com/KamalaHQ/status/1852800821387268351\">Same video, on X</a>, if that’s easier for you to share.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/11/04/harrison-ford-harris\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f0ab563bdea815b6e6cb3f7f636cd8a83df0d700af85ecc419de5e3678b4760b","category":"Tech"}
