Steed aims to help you sidestep any dilemma by offering the Thoroughbred, a bike that it says blends good looks with practicality at a fair price.</p>\n<p>London-based Steed Bikes was founded this year by designer and fitness professional Ian Steed. He says he started the brand with the desire to create his dream bikes: stylish, fun to ride, durable and affordable.</p>\n<p>A classic city-style single-speed bike, the Thoroughbred immediately impressed me with its good looks and it was a similar story once the pedals started turning.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/10022/steed-thoroughbred-singlespeed-bike-photos#32\"><p><span>Image 33 of</span> 33</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/08/steed_thoroughbred_33.jpeg?itok=4E7exYMn\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 33 of </span>33</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<h3>It's neigh bother</h3>\n<p>In the saddle, the comfort of the Thoroughbred was an early defining attribute. The 28mm Kenda tyres combined with the high-tensile steel frame and forks provide an smooth ride that takes broken and uneven surfaces in its stride.</p>\n<p>The build of the frame, with a compact rear triangle, gives the bike really solid power transfer that works nicely alongside the carefully chosen 44/18 gearing to make short work of small suburban ramps and – with a bit of leg work – even some harsher climbs.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/10022/steed-thoroughbred-singlespeed-bike-photos#5\"><p><span>Image 6 of</span> 33</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/08/steed_thoroughbred_6.jpg?itok=0gMDW6ZE\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 6 of </span>33</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<p>It helped significantly in traffic, too, as quick accelerations and accurate handling make navigating lights and stationary vehicles simple.</p>\n<p>The Steed comes fitted with eyelets to mount bottle cages, mudguards and racks, which should imbue the bike with year-round adaptability. The Promax rim brakes that the Thoroughbred comes equipped with are well-modulated and powerful, coping well downhill and in stop-start situations in the dry, although I didn't have the opportunity to thoroughly test their performance in the wet.</p>\n<h3>We're not judging books...</h3>\n<p>Although appearance is a subjective matter I really do think Steed has done well in the Thoroughbred. It is a handsome bike, and those handle grips and saddle score in the eco department as well as the looks department, being made from vegan leather.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://steedbikes.com/collections/bikes\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the Steed Thoroughbred bike now</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>That's not the only environmentally conscious thing about the bike either: Steed has partnered with the International Tree Foundation to pledge that a tree is planted in fragile ecosystems – such as areas of deforestation – for every bike purchased.</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/reviews/10022/steed-thoroughbred-singlespeed-bike-photos#2\"><p><span>Image 3 of</span> 33</p><img src=\"https://cdn2.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/08/steed_thoroughbred_3.jpg?itok=3DLtVa1p\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 3 of </span>33</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n<h3>From the horse's mouth</h3>\n<p>Thanks to the Thoroughbred's sensible components list and simplicity of design, I think Steed has attained one of the biggest advantages of a single-speed bike – riding pleasure with minimum fuss.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/2104/vuelta-a-espana-route-race-reports-tv-guide-and-all-you-need-to-know\">Vuelta a Espana 2021: Route, start list, live TV guide and all we know so far</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/913/tour-of-britain-route-riders-live-tv-guide-all-you-need-to-know\">Tour of Britain 2021: Route, teams and all you need to know</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/10046/young-brit-ben-tulett-signs-with-ineos-grenadiers\">Young Brit Ben Tulett signs with Ineos Grenadiers</a></div>    </div></div><p>\nEach ride, whether that be on inner city roads or through the suburban landscape, was easy, fast and comfortable.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://steedbikes.com/collections/bikes\" target=\"_blank\"><em><strong>Buy the Steed Thoroughbred bike now</strong></em></a></p>\n<p>What's more, at £425 it's more affordable than most of its competitors and comes with a lifetime guarantee.
