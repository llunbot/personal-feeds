At one point during the discussion, the host asked the Arianespace representative—its chief of sales in Southeast Asia, Richard Bowles—how the institutional European company would respond to SpaceX's promise of lower launch costs and reuse with the Falcon 9 rocket.</p>\n<p>\"What I'm discovering in the market is that SpaceX primarily seems to be selling a dream, which is good. We should all dream,\" Bowles replied. \"I think a $5 million launch or a $15 million launch is a bit of a dream. Personally, I think reusability is a dream. How am I going to respond to a dream? My answer to respond to a dream is, first of all, you don't wake people up.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033625#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2033625&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4723949d345af6ef2904e9f4bc9f63e16cbe302a4e7413e2c6618c50bb218ca7","category":"Tech"}
