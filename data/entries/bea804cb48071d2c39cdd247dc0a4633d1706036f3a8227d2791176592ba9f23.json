Some have also released slightly less expensive machines equipped with the new Ultegra.</p>\n<p>We’ll certainly see more and more bikes released with Shimano’s newest groupsets over the coming months but, in the meantime, here are 13 bikes already dressed in Shimano’s finest.</p>\n\n<h2>Trek Madone SLR 9</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Trek Madone SLR 9 has all the bells and whistles.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>How much? With a list price of £12,400, the new Trek Madone SLR 9 is about as pricey as it comes.</p>\n<p>However, as Trek’s top-specced <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-aero-road-bike/\">aero road bike</a>, it has all the bells and whistles – Dura-Ace R9200 and Bontrager Aeolus RSL 51 wheels. The frame is also constructed from 800 Series OCLV Carbon, Trek’s lightest carbon fibre.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere in the range, the new £9,190 Trek Madone SLR 7 is one step below with the same carbon fibre frame but Ultegra R8100 and slightly lower-spec components. There is also the £4,700 SLR 6, which once again has Ultegra R8100 but its frame is made from 500 Series OCLV Carbon.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Trek Émonda SLR 9</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The 2022 Trek bikes come in an array of flashy colours, including this Amethyst colour scheme.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>Trek’s top-tier <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-climbing-bikes/\">climbing bike</a> also comes equipped with Shimano Dura-Ace R9200.</p>\n<p>The Émonda SLR 9 uses the same grade of top-spec carbon fibre as the Madone SLR 9 but the frame is focussed primarily on low weight – less than 700g for an unpainted SLR frame, according to Trek.</p>\n<p>That said, the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2021-trek-emonda/\">2021 Trek Émonda</a> also has a healthy smattering of aero touches, making this an appealing all-round race bike.</p>\n<p>As for the spec, the Émonda SLR 9 has mountain-appropriate, 37mm-deep carbon wheels and a Bontrager Aeolus RSL integrated bar and stem.</p>\n<p>This bike will cost you £11,020. One step below is the SLR 7 with Ultegra R8100.

It can also take 38mm tyres, improving comfort and increasing versatility.</p>\n<p>The 2022 SLR 7 comes with Ultegra R8100 and 37mm-deep wheels, setting you back £8,000. There is also the Trek Domane SLR 9 with the latest Dura-Ace for £11,000.</p>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Giant TCR Advanced SL Disc 0</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Giant’s top-flight TCR gets Dura-Ace R9200.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Giant </i></span></div>\n<p>Giant Australia has already listed the Giant TCR Advanced SL Disc 0 with Dura-Ace R9200 on its website.</p>\n<p>The 2021 <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/2021-giant-tcr-advanced-sl-0-disc-review/\">Giant TCR Advanced SL Disc 0</a> got a full five stars when we tested it in May and was also our 2021 Superbike of the Year.
