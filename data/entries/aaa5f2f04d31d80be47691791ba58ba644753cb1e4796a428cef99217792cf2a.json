George Hincapie for one sported them during most of his U.S. Postal Service campaigns.<span> </span></p>\n<p><strong>Also read:</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/2023/04/3t-exploro-lamborghini-gravel-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">Meet the Lamborghini gravel bike made by 3T – Sea Otter Classic 2023</a></strong></p>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GettyImages-988922822.jpeg?width=730\" alt width=\"1024\" height=\"664\" srcset=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GettyImages-988922822.jpeg?width=650 650w, https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GettyImages-988922822.jpeg?width=190 190w\" /><figcaption><span><span>Goerge Hincapie rocking a pair of Racing Jackets in the 2003 Tour de France (Photo by Tim De Waele/Getty Images).<br />\n</span></span></figcaption></figure>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GettyImages-989527326.jpeg?width=730\" alt width=\"1024\" height=\"612\" srcset=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GettyImages-989527326.jpeg?width=650 650w, https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GettyImages-989527326.jpeg?width=190 190w\" /><figcaption>2001: No helmets, just gold chains and vibes (Photo: Photo by Tim De Waele/Getty Images)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>While the style long ago entered the Oakley vault — second only to Fort Knox and maybe the Disney vault in terms of security — it is reemerging for a super limited comeback, and Oakley has pulled together a striking design for the occasion.</p>\n<figure>\n<p></p><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Oakley_MUZMRACINGJACKETCAMPAIGNIMAGE5-1340x754.jpg?width=730\" alt=\"Oakley MUZM Racing Jacket Red Tiger red and black striped sunglasses\" width=\"1340\" height=\"754\" srcset=\"https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Oakley_MUZMRACINGJACKETCAMPAIGNIMAGE5.jpg?width=650 650w, https://cdn.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Oakley_MUZMRACINGJACKETCAMPAIGNIMAGE5.jpg?width=190 190w\" /><figcaption>The Oakley MUZM Racing Jacket in all its glory.
