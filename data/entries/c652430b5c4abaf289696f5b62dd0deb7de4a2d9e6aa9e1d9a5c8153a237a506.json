The initial stretch of that would be some of the more intimidating riding I’d done in the whole trip so far. Sand dunes to drag my bike through, sparse villages, carefully planned water re-supply points, and endless Mongolian steppe in every direction. Just looking to the east from some of the mountain passes I’ve been on and seeing the empty terrain fade into the distance was a little unnerving, but at the same time exciting.</em></p>\n<p>I spotted a 550km track from Brigitte &amp; Ivo over at <a href=\"http://bikepackground.com/\">bikepackground.com</a> that looked promising, and, after a few days enjoying the luxuries of Khovd, I set off into the arid expanse toward the Zavkhan province, re-tracing their steps through the land that connects the Gobi Desert with the Khangai Mountains.<span></span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-02.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-02.jpg?w=2500&amp;quality=75 2500w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-02.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-02.jpg?resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-02.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-02.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-02.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-02.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-02.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-02.jpg?resize=2048,1366&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>I was hoping that heading east would reduce my chances of the notorious headwinds that one can run into while heading in the opposite direction through this part of the country, but if I learned anything here it’s that you cannot outsmart Mongolian winds. From day one it was apparent that this wouldn’t be the case when I was crawling along the plateau at a very gradual incline, with my 3-inch tires sinking into the soft sand, and a face full of wind. I looked down at my map to see the minuscule progress I’d made into the 550km route and wondered if this was a great idea.</p>\n<p>Some rather threatening storm clouds were brewing all around me, and the day was getting long, so I took shelter in a strategically placed cluster of dirt mounds.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-08.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt width=\"405\" height=\"270\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-08.jpg?w=2500&amp;quality=75 2500w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-08.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-08.jpg?resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-08.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-08.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-08.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-08.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-08.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-08.jpg?resize=2048,1366&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-03.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt width=\"403\" height=\"269\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-03.jpg?w=2500&amp;quality=75 2500w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-03.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-03.jpg?resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-03.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-03.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-03.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-03.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-03.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-03.jpg?resize=2048,1366&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-04.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-04.jpg?w=2500&amp;quality=75 2500w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-04.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-04.jpg?resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-04.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-04.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-04.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-04.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-04.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/08/RyanWilson_Mongolia_Zavkhan-04.jpg?resize=2048,1366&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>The sky let out a burst of rain that lasted only a few minutes just as I got my tent set up, and when I unzipped the tent to survey the surroundings, I was treated to one of the more spectacular sunsets I’d ever seen along with a herd of camels grazing just a little ways away from my campsite. They would look at me like “wtf are you doing here?!”, way more intrigued by my presence than the combo double-rainbow sunset that I was enthralled by.</p>\n<p>I woke up early in the night in my tent with an all too familiar feeling. Apparently, the mysterious canned dinner I’d consumed the night before and my insides were going to war and I was losing that battle.

At times the sandy track I was following would disappear entirely and I would be left to follow the tracks of random camel hooves, which seemed to vaguely be heading for the part of the ridge-line in the distance where my GPS was telling me a track would cross the hills.</p>\n<p>The wide-open expanse was growing all around me. I could just barely make out herds of animals through the heat mirage that stretched across the horizon. It was the closest I’d felt to a place like the Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/once-upon-a-time-in-the-bolivian-west-ryan-wilson/\">since I was there in 2017</a>, except the soft and slightly inclined terrain here was much more of a slow drag to cross when compared to the hard salt flat.

I knew this was coming, so I probably made it out to be something grandiose and brutal in my head beforehand, but when I got there it was just a couple of hours of pushing the bike, slow and steady.</p>\n<p>The relief of having the dunes behind me was short-lived as I found myself at the bottom of a sizable climb with a solid 4km section in the middle that averages over a 14% gradient.
