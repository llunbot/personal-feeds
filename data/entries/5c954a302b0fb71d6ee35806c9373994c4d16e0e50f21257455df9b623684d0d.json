{"title":"Can’t decide between AirPods Pro and Powerbeats Pro 2? Don’t buy either… yet","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2657625/cant-decide-between-airpods-pro-and-powerbeats-pro-2-dont-buy-either-yet.html","date":1743762600000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this year, Apple officially introduced the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2601169/powerbeats-pro-2-review.html\">Powerbeats Pro 2</a> after a near-six-year wait. Compared to their predecessor, these earbuds have shrunk in size, become lighter, and adopted smarter features. More importantly, though, they’ve incorporated a heart rate sensor for the first time on an Apple audio product. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given that the AirPods Pro 2 share the same $249 price tag, are overdue for an update, and lack heart-rate monitoring, many users shopping for a pair of earbuds might gravitate toward the Powerbeats Pro 2. Or they may still be tempted by the recent AirPods Pro 2 addition of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2498966/your-airpods-pro-2-can-now-work-as-a-hearing-aid-heres-how.html\">Hearing Protection</a> and its overall smaller design. Well, anyone struggling to decide <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668628/best-earbuds-for-iphone.html\">which pair of new earbuds to buy</a>, we have some advice: Save your money for now.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Underpowered Powerbeats</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In typical Apple fashion, the latest Beats earbuds miss out on some key features offered by the AirPods Pro 2. Despite packing the same H2 chipset, the Powerbeats Pro 2 lack Adaptive Audio support, which combines the ANC and Transparency modes to suppress loud noises without completely isolating users from their surroundings. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They similarly don’t support the handy Conversation Awareness perk, which lowers media volume whenever you talk to someone. And the Hearing Protection features that turn your AirPods Pro into an over-the-counter hearing aid are also predictably absent, as are MagSafe charging, head gestures, and the U1 chip for precise Find My tracking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s a lot for an Apple user to give up. And Apple has shown an impressive willingness to keep adding features to the AirPods Pro 2, which probably won’t be the case with the PowerBeats Pro. So when you’re talking about features, the AirPods Pro 2 clearly have the advantage.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mahmoud-Itani-wearing-AirPods-Pro-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Mahmoud Itani wearing AirPods Pro 2\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mahmoud-Itani-wearing-AirPods-Pro-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mahmoud-Itani-wearing-AirPods-Pro-2.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mahmoud-Itani-wearing-AirPods-Pro-2.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mahmoud-Itani-wearing-AirPods-Pro-2.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mahmoud-Itani-wearing-AirPods-Pro-2.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mahmoud-Itani-wearing-AirPods-Pro-2.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mahmoud-Itani-wearing-AirPods-Pro-2.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Mahmoud-Itani-wearing-AirPods-Pro-2.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>AirPods Pro 2 have a minimal aesthetic compared to the Powerbeats Pro’s ear loops.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Design decisions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond the performance, the AirPods Pro 2 look sleeker than the Powerbeats Pro 2. Not only are they smaller and lighter, but they also shed the Powerbeats’ iconic ear hooks designed to help keep the earbuds secure during intense workouts. If you have trouble keeping AirPods in your ear, the Powerbeats are a good option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, while the AirPods Pro 2 feature pressure-sensitive surfaces for media control, the Powerbeats Pro 2 still resort to traditional buttons. While <em>they work well</em>, they almost objectively give the gadget a cheaper feel. Additionally, despite both sets being resistant to sweat and water splashes, only the AirPods can withstand dusty environments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The PowerBeats do have extra color options that the classic white AirPods Pro 2 don’t have, but unless they really want a pair of electric orange earbuds, most people will be happier with the clean, minimal AirPods aesthetic.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The beat goes on</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some may think that the Powerbeats Pro 2’s heart rate sensor is more valuable than any of the above-mentioned perks. And while it is a neat feature for a pair of earbuds, a wearable heart-rate sensor is hardly a novel feature for anyone who’s worn an Apple Watch at some point over the past decade.  </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/powerbeats-pro2-heartrate.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Powerbeats 2 Heart Rate sensor\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/powerbeats-pro2-heartrate.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 3727w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/powerbeats-pro2-heartrate.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/powerbeats-pro2-heartrate.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/powerbeats-pro2-heartrate.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/powerbeats-pro2-heartrate.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/powerbeats-pro2-heartrate.jpg?resize=2048%2C1366&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/powerbeats-pro2-heartrate.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/powerbeats-pro2-heartrate.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>The Powerbeats Pro 2 have a built-in rate-rate sensor.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s also worth noting that the heart rate sensor’s implementation on the Powerbeats Pro 2 is far from perfect. For starters, the monitor only works with a handful of supported apps, which oddly doesn’t include Apple’s own Fitness+ service. And if you’re wearing an Apple Watch, your iPhone will simply prioritize its readings and ignore the Powerbeats Pro 2, with no way to pick a default heart rate monitoring device on your iPhone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, the AirPods Pro 3 reportedly launching in September, are rumored to adopt heart-rate monitoring tech as well. So, assuming Apple doesn’t hike the AirPods Pro 3 price, you’ll get the best of both worlds for the same $249. And it’s a near-certainty that they will support Apple Fitness+ and play nicer with the Apple Watch, along with any other goodies Apple has planned.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Wait it out—unless you use Android</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>All of this isn’t to say that the Powerbeats Pro 2 or AirPods Pro 2 are bad—we’ve reviewed both and they’re excellent. However, if you wait for just a few more months, you may be able to grab an even better set of buds once the AirPods Pro 3 debut. Not only will they potentially adopt the Powerbeats’ heart rate sensor, but they’re also rumored to have an even more compact design.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AirPods-Pro-2-next-to-Beats-logo.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"AirPods Pro 2 next to Beats logo stickers\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AirPods-Pro-2-next-to-Beats-logo.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AirPods-Pro-2-next-to-Beats-logo.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AirPods-Pro-2-next-to-Beats-logo.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AirPods-Pro-2-next-to-Beats-logo.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AirPods-Pro-2-next-to-Beats-logo.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AirPods-Pro-2-next-to-Beats-logo.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AirPods-Pro-2-next-to-Beats-logo.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AirPods-Pro-2-next-to-Beats-logo.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Apple is likely to launch the third-generation of AirPods Pro this fall.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, there are still a couple of reasons why Powerbeats Pro 2 are a good pick now. For one, the AirPods Pro 3 definitely won’t have ear hooks. If you have trouble getting AirPods Pro to stay in your ears, the Powerbeats Pro are a great option. Another Powerbeats benefit is the longer battery life. The latest Powerbeats Pro can offer up to 45 hours of listening on a single charge, while AirPods Pro 2 only last for about 30 hours. It’s unlikely that AirPods Pro 3 will add more than an hour or two to the listening duration, so if you need the best possible battery life, Powerbeats are the way to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there’s one more thing—Powerbeats fully supports Android devices, thanks to Beats’ companion app. On a Galaxy or Pixel phone, there’s no official way to customize, update, or meaningfully control AirPods (though they will pair and play music). Those fully invested in the Apple ecosystem, however, will want to wait a few months to see if something better comes along.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"5c954a302b0fb71d6ee35806c9373994c4d16e0e50f21257455df9b623684d0d","category":"Apple"}
