Italian brand Castelli have been producing technical cycling clothing for over a century and have often been at the vanguard of apparel innovation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Castelli has made kit for Fausto Coppi, Gino Bartali, Jacques Anquetil and even designed some of the first skinsuits – made from silk! – that were used in time-trials. Having taken over from his father Armando in the 70s, Maurizio Castelli was one of the first to introduce Lycra and coloured designs into cycling shorts, and – since its inception in 1876 – the brand has been involved with racing kit and WorldTour riders.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/castelli-espresso-air-4-970x645.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/castelli-espresso-air-4-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/castelli-espresso-air-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/castelli-espresso-air-4-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/castelli-espresso-air-4-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/castelli-espresso-air-4-2048x1363.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/castelli-espresso-air-4-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/castelli-espresso-air-4-1140x758.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/castelli-espresso-air-4-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/castelli-espresso-air-4-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/castelli-espresso-air-4-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>More recently, Castelli has ensured its place in the history of cycling kit through its pioneering Gabba jersey, which continues to be one of the most highly-regarded pieces of technical road cycling kit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This rich experience has fed into the launch of its new Ristretto fabric, a material that has been designed with the shoulder seasons and winter in mind – but with one big difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Castelli’s research, most road cyclists aren’t intentionally riding in the rain very frequently at all. Seeing that no other producers were making a fabric with the exact specifications Castelli had in mind, this led the brand to develop a new fabric that worries less about keeping rain out, and focusses instead on how to use dry, incoming air to remove warm moisture generated by a rider’s body.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It wasn’t possible to use a woven fabric, as this would have degraded over time and allowed too much cold air through. Importantly, Castelli still wanted the garment to feel windproof, even though the fabric is highly ventilated in order to create a temperate and dry equilibrium for the rider’s body.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Castelli has engineered Ristretto Technology to function between 0-15°C, helping with what the brand calls ‘moisture management’. To you and I, this is the fine balance of insulating a rider without totally preventing airflow. So long as the garment maintains a certain transaction of air from in to out and vice versa, the rider’s perspiration won’t overwhelm their environment, or that’s the idea anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/castelli-perfetto-air-1-970x645.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/castelli-perfetto-air-1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/castelli-perfetto-air-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/castelli-perfetto-air-1-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/castelli-perfetto-air-1-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/castelli-perfetto-air-1-2048x1363.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/castelli-perfetto-air-1-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/castelli-perfetto-air-1-1140x758.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/castelli-perfetto-air-1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/castelli-perfetto-air-1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/castelli-perfetto-air-1-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Castelli, warm, moisture heavy air created around a rider’s body passes through the Ristretto fabric to the cooler, drier air outside the garment, maintaining a comfortable air temperature for the body to function in. This is possible despite the insulating qualities of the fabric and the exterior’s environmentally-friendly PFAS-free DWR coating which is said to shrug off light rainfall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Handily, Castelli’s main testers – based in Fonzaso, Veneto – had access to the imposing <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/monte-grappa-italy-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">Monte Grappa</a>, which rises to 1,700m above sea level. Even in summertime, the testers could ride in single-digit weather conditions to put the nascent Ristretto fabric through its paces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two items from Castelli’s Café Racer Collection to feature the new Ristretto material are the Espresso Air Jacket and Perfetto Air Jacket. Both offer the Ristretto’s water and wind repellent qualities, pliable performance fit, and the mentioned breathability, but the Espresso Air is tailored more towards insulation, while the Perfetto is one for the weight weenies, at just 256g.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/castelli-perfetto-air-2-970x645.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/castelli-perfetto-air-2-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/castelli-perfetto-air-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/castelli-perfetto-air-2-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/castelli-perfetto-air-2-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/castelli-perfetto-air-2-2048x1363.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/castelli-perfetto-air-2-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/castelli-perfetto-air-2-1140x758.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/castelli-perfetto-air-2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/castelli-perfetto-air-2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/castelli-perfetto-air-2-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For those bitter days, when the mercury is dropping to zero, the Espresso Air Jacket uses fleece-lined Ristretto Warm fabric to trap body heat but also provides stretch and flexibility for riders who like to switch between different positions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For context, the Espresso Air is said to be four times as ventilated as Gore Windstopper fabric. Castelli says the fabric functions differently at different temperatures. On sunnier days, once a rider begins to sweat, because of the volume of fresh air entering the jacket, the body begins to be cooled down. Overall, this reduces the number of fluctuations in body temperature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Perfetto Air Jacket is made from Ristretto Lite fabric, which saves some weight and makes the jacket more suitable for temperatures up to 15°C. The front and rear panels of the jackets contain an element of windproofing while the Perfetto has an extended zipper garage to prevent wind from entering through the double ended zip.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Perfetto Air is even more ventilated than the Espresso, with Castelli claiming six times as much permeability as the Gore Windstopper. As you might expect, this makes it function well at higher temperatures, but Castelli says the technical Ristretto fabric is also able to evacuate enough air to handle high intensity efforts at low temperatures.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/castelli-perfetto-air-3-970x646.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/castelli-perfetto-air-3-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/castelli-perfetto-air-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/castelli-perfetto-air-3-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/castelli-perfetto-air-3-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/castelli-perfetto-air-3-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/castelli-perfetto-air-3-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/castelli-perfetto-air-3-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/castelli-perfetto-air-3-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/castelli-perfetto-air-3-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/12/castelli-perfetto-air-3.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Elsewhere, the Perfetto and the Espresso jackets share some design architecture. Both have three storage pockets with reflective detailing, as well as an extended rear Lycra silicone gripper to minimise any riding up of the material and keep everything covered up from road spray.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Castelli has also addressed the small details which might have derailed the efficacy of the whole jacket. An outcome of the extensive low temperature testing on Monte Grappa, a 4cm strip of fabric along the front of the arm and shoulder has been added, as the testers felt that the ventilation tipped over into an actual cold breeze, when riding at 40kmh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How our bikes look and feel, what we wear, and how efficient we are when riding them might be unrecognisable to a rider from 30 or 40 years ago, but what we need from our cycling kit remains the same. As we move into the darker, colder and less inviting seasons of the year, picking the right apparel to help us out becomes both more difficult, and more important. Being able to combine breathability and insulation is a fine balancing act, and Castelli claims the Ristretto Technology has achieved just that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new <a href=\"https://bit.ly/espressoair\" target=\"_blank\">Castelli Espresso Air Jacket (£225)</a> and <a href=\"https://bit.ly/perfettoair\" target=\"_blank\">Perfetto Air Jacket (£250)</a> are available now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shop the future of cycling apparel now at <a href=\"https://castellicafe.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">castellicafe.co.uk</a></p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/sidi-2025-collection\">The Sidi 2025 Collection: Technology meets heritage</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/castelli-espresso-collection\">Elevate every ride with Castelli’s Espresso Collection</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/castelli-ristretto\">Castelli’s new Ristretto fabric provides breathable winter warmth</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Will Strickson &#124; Website Editor","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"7d727ed1ea3c744b33de623d2d58252f923633636b47298aec34f216baf3d396","category":"Cycling"}
