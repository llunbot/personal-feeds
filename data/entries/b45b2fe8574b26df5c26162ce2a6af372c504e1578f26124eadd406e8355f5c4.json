For YouTube, users can click on the video placeholder and choose the \"Notify me\" option to get a notification when the livestream is up.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf YouTube has your location information, the notification and countdown are in local time, so it's a good way to double check when you'll need to tune in to see Apple's announcements. Apple almost always holds events at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time, which is 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time, evening in Europe, and early morning in countries in Asia and Australia.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-events/\">Apple's Events website</a> also has an option to add the event to your calendar for a cross-platform reminder.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor those who are unable to watch, MacRumors will be providing full event coverage on MacRumors.com and the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/macrumorslive\">MacRumorsLive Twitter account</a> so you can follow along with the announcements.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2024-apple-event/\">September 2024 Apple Event</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/apple-fall-2024-event-youtube-placeholder/\">Apple Shares 'It's Glowtime' Event Placeholder on YouTube</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-shares-its-glowtime-event-placeholder-on-youtube.2434437/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b45b2fe8574b26df5c26162ce2a6af372c504e1578f26124eadd406e8355f5c4","category":"Apple"}
