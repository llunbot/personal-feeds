(Handmade Ultra-Light Carbon) layup and C-LUX finish, with both technologies first introduced on the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/campagnolo-bora-ultra-wto/\">Bora Ultra WTO</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/campagnolo-levante-gravel-wheelset/\">Levante</a> wheelsets.</p>\n<p>Campagnolo says the H.U.L.C. construction sees the carbon fibre oriented in a specific angle when it is laid up in the mould.</p>\n<p>Campagnolo is keen to point out the carbon layup on the Hyperon Ultra differs slightly from the Bora Ultra WTO, though.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Campagnolo emblem by the valve is a neat touch.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>The Hyperon Ultra is Campagnolo’s first rim to be manufactured with one join, compared to the industry standard of four.</p>\n<p>The brand says this process ensures optimal profiles of the carbon.</p>\n<p>The manufacturing process gives the wheels a notably smooth, mirror-like appearance, which Campagnolo calls C-Lux. This removes the need for lacquer, also saving weight. The rims also get classy laser-etched, copper graphics instead of stickers or paint.</p>\n<p>The spoke holes are moulded during the construction of the rim, rather than drilled post-moulding. Campagnolo claims its method makes for a stronger wheel.</p>\n<h2>Sticking to hooked rims</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Campagnolo has used hooked rims on the Hyperon Ultra.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Campagnolo</i></span></div>\n<p>Campagnolo says the 37mm rim depth strikes the ideal balance between climbing and faster riding. The rims are 21mm wide internally and 27mm wide externally.</p>\n<p>Like all of Campagnolo’s C21 rims (with a 21mm <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/rim-width-explained-for-road-bikes-mountain-bikes-and-gravel-bikes/\">internal rim width</a>), the Hyperon Ultra is compatible with 25mm <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bike-tyres/\">road bike tyres</a> upwards.</p>\n<p>Campagnolo is sticking with a hooked rim for the Hyperon Ultra.</p>\n<p>The brand introduced its ‘Mini-Hook’ standard on the Levante, which is claimed to combine the advantages of both hooked and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/hookless-rims-road-tubeless/\">hookless rims</a>.</p>\n<p>However, the brand hasn’t ported this over to the Hyperon Ultra, given the narrower tyres likely to be used, and the resulting higher <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/road-bike-tyre-pressure/\">tyre pressures</a>.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The front wheel uses 21 spokes in a 2:1 pattern.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>The front wheel uses 21 spokes in the brand’s 2:1 pattern. This sees seven spokes on the driveside, paired with 14 on the non-driveside. Campagnolo says this is optimal for the additional forces exerted by the disc brake on the non-driveside.</p>\n<p>The rear wheel has 24 spokes.</p>\n<p>Like other Campagnolo rims, the Hyperon Ultras use the brand’s 2-Way Fit rim design, which means they’re compatible with both clincher and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/tubeless/\">tubeless tyres</a>.</p>\n<h2>Internal nipples look clean, but you’ll need a proprietary tool</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The additional head is designed to stop the spoke from twisting.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Canmpagnolo </i></span></div>\n<p>Like the Bora Ultra WTO, the Hyperon Ultra inherits Campagnolo’s Aero Mo-Mag technology.</p>\n<p>This sees the oversized aluminium spoke nipples hidden inside the rim that are accessible externally so you can true the wheel without removing the tyre. You’ll need a proprietary tool to adjust them though.</p>\n<p>An internal polymer seat is inserted into the rim during manufacturing and is wrapped into the rim’s carbon layup.</p>\n<p>Campagnolo is debuting its Head-To-Bay system on the Hyperon Ultra. This sees a rounded head fit over the spoke at the hub that allows any forces to dissipate to come out of the spoke head, meaning it shouldn’t deform.</p>\n<h2>Slim, smooth hubs</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Svelte hubs with a matching copper-coloured graphic.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>The hubs are noticeably slimmer in profile compared to the brand’s other offerings. Campagnolo says this is to save weight.</p>\n<p>They use Campagnolo’s CULT ceramic bearings (Ceramic Ultimate Level Technology) and are compatible with Center Lock disc brake rotors.</p>\n<h2>Introducing the N3W Light freehub</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The N3W Light freehub is easily identifiable by its red appearance.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Campagnolo</i></span></div>\n<p>Campagnolo is debuting its N3W Light <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/freehubs/\">freehub</a> on the Hyperon Ultra. This sees the conventional N3W hub go on a diet, and Campagnolo says it has removed excess material to apparently improve the wheel’s reactivity.</p>\n<p>The freehub has 36 points of engagement.</p>\n<p>Campagnolo has said N3W Light isn’t necessarily going to be used on all of its wheelsets going forward.</p>\n<p>The Hyperon Ultra will also be available with XDR and Shimano HG freehubs.</p>\n<p>A Shimano Microspline freehub will be available to purchase in the future.</p>","author":"Oscar Huckle","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"5d0ba297d32d9a2e575c234977aa737063df4c3c30e4317769fff9797c6b7448","category":"Cycling"}
