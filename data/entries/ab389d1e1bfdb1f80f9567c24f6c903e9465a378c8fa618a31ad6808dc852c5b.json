That means the proven four-bar linkage suspension design remains, though its layout has been tweaked slightly.</p>\n<p>In a bid to improve upon the alloy bike, the leverage curve looks a little different, with an increase to the starting leverage rate (which will help keep the suspension nice and sensitive and able to eke out traction more easily).</p>\n<p>There’s a little more in the way of mid-stroke support (ideal for loading the bike up through turns or popping jumps) and more ramp-up towards the end of the stroke (to add bottom-out resistance and handle heavy landings a little more confidently).</p>\n<p>Overall progression is now 24 rather than 22 per cent.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Nukeproof Megawatt Carbon full suspension mountain eBike (eMTB)\" title=\"Nukeproof Megawatt Carbon News - Wheel sensor\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The wheel sensor sits discreetly down around the rear axle.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Laurence Crossman-Emms / Nukeproof</i></span></div>\n<p>Although the anti-rise has only been increased slightly compared to the alloy bike, the anti-squat has been upped more significantly in the climbing gears to 102 per cent at sag (compared to 92 per cent on the alloy bike) to help keep things more stable under power when winching up the hills.</p>\n<p>There’s also a little more rearward axle movement (handy for very effectively absorbing square-edged bumps) for the first 65mm of rear-wheel travel. When we say rearward, we’re talking about less than 5mm until the wheel starts moving up and forwards, until the full 172mm of travel has been accessed.</p>\n<h2>Nukeproof Megawatt geometry details</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Nukeproof Megawatt Carbon full suspension mountain eBike (eMTB)\" title=\"Nukeproof Megawatt Carbon News -

Having spent a decent length of time aboard its alloy counterpart, though, getting accustomed to this carbon version didn’t take long.</p>\n<p>Because the bike is designed for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/beginners-guide-to-enduro-racing/\">enduro riding and racing</a>, I picked a hillside in South Wales that’s littered with challenging, steep, natural trails, along with some decent bike-park berms and jumps.</p>\n<p>The new Powertrain system is smooth and feels very natural when applying pressure to the pedals. There’s not as much grunt as found with the Bosch system, but I never felt as though I was lacking power.</p>\n<p>There’s a whirring from the motor that’s easy to live with.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Nukeproof Megawatt Carbon full suspension mountain eBike (eMTB)\" title=\"Nukeproof Megawatt Carbon News - Ride3\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> It’s decent on the climbs, though the Auto Shift function may need overriding when things get really technical and steep.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Laurence Crossman-Emms / Nukeproof</i></span></div>\n<p>Toggling between modes is easy and selecting how you want to shift gears is straightforward enough.</p>\n<p>Auto Shift is a neat feature and works well in certain types of terrain, though I did find myself overriding it when attempting tricky off-road climbs.</p>\n<p>The bike itself is almost totally silent when descending. For me, this is a first when riding an <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-electric-bikes/\">ebike</a>.

It’s an easy bike to ride fast, but never feels unwieldly or cumbersome when navigating slower, tighter sections of trails.</p>\n<p>In the bike park, it’s easy to really push the Megawatt Carbon hard because it just feels so eager to rip turns and pop jumps.</p>\n<h2>Nukeproof Megawatt Carbon early verdict</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Nukeproof Megawatt Carbon full suspension mountain eBike (eMTB)\" title=\"Nukeproof Megawatt Carbon News - Ride1\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> It was easy to push the new Megawatt Carbon RS from the get-go.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Laurence Crossman-Emms / Nukeproof</i></span></div>\n<p>Like the alloy version of the Megawatt, the new carbon bike feels great from the get-go.</p>\n<p>SRAM’s new motor offers a lot in terms of features, and feels natural and easy to live with on the trail.
