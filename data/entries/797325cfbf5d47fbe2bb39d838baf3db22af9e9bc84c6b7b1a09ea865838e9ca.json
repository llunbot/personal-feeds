It works with both Presta and Schrader valves, rotates to keep the screen in view, and has a pressure release valve to help you dial in your setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter what type of cyclist you’re buying for, they all have aches and pains. That’s why the<strong> KT Health Ice Sleeve</strong> ($29.99) is one of the best gifts for cyclists. We use ours a <em>lot</em>, and we’re convinced it’s resulted in more time on the bike with less pain. Unlike a traditional ice pack or bag of frozen peas, the Ice Sleeve is made from a soft, flexible fabric filled with a semi-solid gel that won’t ever leak. Not only does it stay in place so you can still move around the house, but it also provides gentle compression to help reduce swelling. Available in three sizes for use on knees, elbows, arms, legs, and other areas if you get creative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>Adventure Medical Kits Ultralight/Watertight .7</strong> ($33 at <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgoutdoorbikinggeneralgg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F695383%2Fadventure-medical-kits-ultralightwatertight-7-medical-kit%3Fcolor%3DNONE\">REI</a>) is a compact first aid kit in a waterproof pouch that fits in a jersey pocket.

Pretty much every serious bike rider has gone tubeless for all the right reasons over the past decade or so. But most of us forget that we have to actually refresh the sealant in our tires at least every year. Many new tubeless sealants have come and gone, but Stan’s was really the original. And you’d still be hard-pressed to find a better and more universally appreciated sealant than their Race Day formula. This is a super practical one, like finding new merino socks under the tree. But we’re all adults, right?

It can be heard pretty far away with its distinctive “ring”. It’s a sharp but pleasant ring that we’ve witnessed penetrate trail users’ headphones. These are precision-built in the USA for a lifetime of bell ringing. Comes with the ability to swap from a handlebar with a 2.22 diameter, to a bar with a 31.8 diameter. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your favorite cyclist has been dropping hint that they need more hydration, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brgg&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F237683%2Fcamelbak-hydrobak-light-hydration-pack\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Camelbak Hydrobak Light 50oz</strong> </a>($65) could be a good place to start.

So, while each is solid on its own, this combo is even better together. The USB-C rechargeable Blinder 1300 headlight is like a tiny super-powered flashlight that you can strap around a handlebar, clip to a helmet, or hang under your out-front GPS mount. It’s bright enough for extending your road, gravel, or most mountain biking in the winter months, and snaps securely on &amp; off the bike in a second. The Blinder R-150 taillight is simply bright and easy to loop around a seatpost, and has a USB-A plug built into its mount so you never need a cable to keep its battery topped off. Simple bright lights mean your favorite cyclist doesn’t have to stop riding just because Daylight Savings is back.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Gift-Guide-for-Cyclists-Theragun-prerace--scaled.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Gift-Guide-for-Cyclists-Theragun-prerace--scaled.webp\" alt=\"Theragun with pre-cyclocross set up \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Gift-Guide-for-Cyclists-Theragun-prerace--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Gift-Guide-for-Cyclists-Theragun-prerace--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Gift-Guide-for-Cyclists-Theragun-prerace--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Gift-Guide-for-Cyclists-Theragun-prerace--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Gift-Guide-for-Cyclists-Theragun-prerace--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Gift-Guide-for-Cyclists-Theragun-prerace--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BikeRumor-Gift-Guide-for-Cyclists-Theragun-prerace--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Theragun Mini</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re looking for the perfect gear bag companion for the rider you list, the <a href=\"https://www.therabody.com/us/en-us/theragun-mini.html?utm_a=145406791569&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAxKy5BhBbEiwAYiW--8iYYUbMIzRTysH4iLPUBiC_3XyoJ6oBYeY-s6RQ1a5j546FDCftthoCoboQAvD_BwE\">Theragun Mini</a> is it.

It provides a slight “wake-up” to the muscles without overstaying its welcome. The $199 price tag is enough to make it a premium gift, but if you’re lucky, you can find refurbished ones on the TheraBody site for $140. Plus, it has an excellent case for falls, drops, and mishaps. My Theragun Mini has hit the pavement more than I can count, and it’s always good to go when needed. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best Cycling Gifts over $250</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1220\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BR-Holiday-Gift-Guide-for-the-Cyclist8-wahoo-feedback-1536x1220.webp\" alt=\"best gifts for cyclists repair stand computer\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BR-Holiday-Gift-Guide-for-the-Cyclist8-wahoo-feedback-1536x1220.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BR-Holiday-Gift-Guide-for-the-Cyclist8-wahoo-feedback-297x236.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BR-Holiday-Gift-Guide-for-the-Cyclist8-wahoo-feedback-120x95.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BR-Holiday-Gift-Guide-for-the-Cyclist8-wahoo-feedback-768x610.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/BR-Holiday-Gift-Guide-for-the-Cyclist8-wahoo-feedback-jpg.webp 1759w\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every cyclist should have a good work stand, and if you’re working on heavy e-bikes (see below), you’ll need a heavy-duty work stand ($495 ).
