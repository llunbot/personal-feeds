Some pedals use a 6mm hex key instead, but these are in a minority.\n<p>A hex key with a long handle is best for removing pedals, and a T-shaped hex key with a sliding end is ideal because it enables you to move the long part of the hex key to avoid the bike’s chainrings.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"How to fit and remove pedals from a bicycle – dust cap\" title=\"How to fit and remove pedals from a bicycle – dust cap\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Don’t get confused by dust caps on the outside face of the pedal – these are used for servicing.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Laura Dow / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Note you always fit or remove pedals from the crank end of the pedal spindle.
