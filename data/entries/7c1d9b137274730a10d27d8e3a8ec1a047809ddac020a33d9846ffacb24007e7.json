{"title":"Get ready for next week’s new Macs with $250 off the Apple Studio Display","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/1937569/get-ready-for-next-weeks-new-macs-with-250-off-the-apple-studio-display.html","date":1685562190000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s Studio Display isn’t just a gorgeous monitor—it also has features you won’t find on other monitors, including spatial audio, Center Stage, and a built-in USB-C hub. It’s also much more expensive than other displays but today’s sale definitely helps: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Studio-Display-Standard-Tilt-Adjustable/dp/B09V3GZD32/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Amazon is selling the 27-inch Apple Studio Display for $1,350</a>, a savings of $249 and one of the best prices we’ve ever seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Studio Display is an excellent monitor with a 27-inch 5K Retina display sporting 600 nits of brightness, True Tone, and a P3 wide color gamut. It also has a built-in 12MP ultra-wide camera with Center Stage support, support for Siri and spatial audio sound, as well as three USB-C ports with enough power to charge a MacBook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/622664/apple-studio-display-review.html\">In our review</a>, we called it “an affordable alternative to the Pro Display XDR,” but didn’t love its price tag. But at this price, it gets our full recommendation­—especially with <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1937070/wwdc-15-inch-macbook-air-mac-pro-studio-imac-announcements.html\">new Macs coming at WWDC</a>. So go grab one before the price shoots back up.</p>\n\nMonitors</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"7c1d9b137274730a10d27d8e3a8ec1a047809ddac020a33d9846ffacb24007e7","category":"Apple"}
