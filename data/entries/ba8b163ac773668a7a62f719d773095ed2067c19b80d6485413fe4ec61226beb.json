This news is sad, as The Radavist has featured so many of <a href=\"https://allcitycycles.com/\" target=\"_blank\">All-City</a>‘s products over the years via custom builds and product launches. We’ve long been a fan of the company and as always, it’s a big bummer to see a steel-focused company shutter its doors.</p>\n<p>The brand will no longer develop products after 2024 and will be retired in a few years. Check out the full email that QBP, All-City’s parent company, just sent to its dealer network below, edited for public visibility…</p>\n<p><span></span></p>\n<blockquote><p><em>“Dear Authorized All-City Retailer,</em></p>\n<p>As a valued partner, it’s important that you know QBP’s long-term plans for All-City Cycles. Over the coming year, we will begin to wind down the All-City Cycles brand, with no new product development beyond model year 2024. The brand will eventually be retired in a few years.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, All-City remains a powerful opportunity for your business. New inventory of exciting All-City bicycles will continue to enter the market through calendar year 2024, including new models and colorways. QBP will continue to service retailers and consumers with replacement parts and support product warranties through our current warranty program.</p>\n<p>(redacted…)</p>\n<p>While the All-City brand will eventually end years from now, QBP will continue to grow and support our other proprietary bike brands, Salsa Cycles and Surly Bikes, as well as our distributed brand Benno Bikes. Expect new and compelling products to launch from these brands, with sales programs that offer flexibility and favorable margin.</p>\n<p>Please reach out to your QBP sales representative with questions and pricing.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>(redacted…) “</p></blockquote>\n<p>We’d love to see your All-City Cycles, so if you have a build you’d like to share, drop it in the comments…</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/all-city-cycles-closing/\">All-City Cycles is Closing</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"ba8b163ac773668a7a62f719d773095ed2067c19b80d6485413fe4ec61226beb","category":"Cycling"}
