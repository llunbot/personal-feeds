ERG mode uses the two in tandem to ensure you hit the prescribed power output.</p>\n<p>As an example, if a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/best-workouts-training-plans-zwift/\">Zwift workout</a> requires you to hold 200 watts, the resistance will automatically increase if your cadence drops, or decrease if your cadence increases, in order to keep you at 200 watts.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Bluetooth and Ant+ logos on a Wahoo Kickr Core smart trainer\" title=\"Bluetooth and Ant+ logos on a Wahoo Kickr Core smart trainer\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The latest smart trainers offer Bluetooth and/or Ant+ connectivity to communicate with third-party apps and sensors.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>This is in contrast with other trainer modes, or when you’re out on the bike in the ‘real world’, where the onus is on you to adjust your torque and cadence in order to hit the target power.</p>\n<p>Perhaps not surprisingly, ERG mode only works with pre-built workouts, or via rider inputs on an app, because it requires a target power to be defined; otherwise, the trainer wouldn’t know how much resistance to apply.</p>\n<p>However, the latest <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-indoor-cycling-apps/\">indoor cycling apps</a> offer a wide range of workouts and training plans, and also enable you to build your own, so there’s no shortage of options.</p>\n<h2>What are the benefits of ERG mode?</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Simon von Bromley riding a Giant TCR on a Wahoo Kickr Move smart trainer\" title=\"Simon von Bromley riding a Giant TCR on a Wahoo Kickr Move smart trainer\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> ERG mode automatically controls the resistance of your smart trainer to match your cadence, in order to achieve a specific power output.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>One of the big advantages of ERG mode is that you don’t need to think (much) about your workout, which can be helpful if you’re riding at the end of a tiring day. Just start the workout and pedal.</p>\n<p>The only thing you really need to focus on is keeping your cadence in a comfortable range, and not varying this too much.</p>\n<p>ERG mode is particularly appealing for interval workouts, and for good reason.</p>\n<p>First, using ERG mode is helpful for people who struggle to pace their efforts and regulate their power. There’s often a temptation to go harder than planned over the first few intervals, which might mean you can’t complete the last few. ERG mode prevents this by fixing the power in the correct range.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Simon von Bromley using Zwift\" title=\"Simon von Bromley using Zwift\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> ERG mode is ideal for following a workout on Zwift, but it’s not without its drawbacks.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Second, ERG mode can help you hang on over the last few seconds of an interval, where you may ordinarily have given up. Think of it like an automated training companion, keeping you pushing right up to the last second.</p>\n<p>By fixing your power to hit a pre-determined output, both during an interval and recovery, ERG mode also enables you to target specific training adaptations, whether you’re working on your <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/what-is-vo2-max-explaining-chris-froomes-physiological-testing-data/\">VO2 max</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/how-to-improve-your-sprinting/\">improving your sprinting</a>.</p>\n<p>You can use ERG mode in conjunction with your <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/training-zones/\">training zones</a> to set the precise output for a particular workout (training apps will do this for you), helping you get the most out of a short training session – one of the key <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/indoor-cycling-benefits/\">benefits of indoor cycling</a>.</p>\n<p>While people tend to use ERG mode mostly for <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/hiit-interval-training/\">interval training</a>, another important benefit it offers is keeping riders ‘reined in’ during lower-intensity rides, including <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/base-training-cycling/\">base training</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/5-steps-to-recover-faster-from-a-hard-ride/\">recovery rides</a>, where there can be a tendency to go harder than is necessary.</p>\n<h2>What are the drawbacks of ERG mode?</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Simon von Bromley riding a Giant TCR Advanced Pro Disc road bike\" title=\"Simon von Bromley_GOTY 2022\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> ERG mode is great for targeting specific training zones, but isn’t necessarily reflective of real-world riding.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>One major drawback of ERG mode is your workouts are likely based on a fixed percentage of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/what-is-ftp-and-why-it-matters-for-cyclists/\">FTP</a> (Functional Threshold Power).</p>\n<p>However, FTP changes from day to day, depending on factors such as fatigue, sleep, nutrition, hydration and so on.</p>\n<p>This means on some days your power targets in your workout might be a little too high, and on others they might be a little too low. Some apps, including Zwift, enable you to adjust the difficulty of an interval session during the workout.</p>\n<p>Riding too often in ERG mode can also <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/opinion/erg-mode-is-overrated/\">limit the development of skills that are important in the real world</a>.</p>\n<p>These include the ability to gauge your effort level and determine appropriate pacing, controlling your power output through appropriate gear selection and cadence, and having the mental fortitude to push hard entirely of your own volition.</p>\n<p>It’s great to be able to ride a workout in the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/tips-for-building-the-ideal-indoor-training-space/\">pain cave</a> without too much thinking involved. However, sometimes the focus needed in continually adjusting your own resistance and cadence to meet your power targets can add interest to a session. It’s also an important pacing skill to master for when you’re not on a smart trainer.</p>\n<p>So, switching off ERG mode every now and again, if you use it often, might be a good call if you’ve got a long indoor session to get through.</p>\n<h3>Spiral of death</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Simon von Bromley riding a Giant TCR on a Wahoo Kickr Core smart trainer\" title=\"Simon von Bromley riding a Giant TCR on a Wahoo Kickr Core smart trainer\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> If your cadence decreases, the trainer will apply more resistance, which can result in the dreaded ‘spiral of death’.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Another downside of ERG mode is that intervals can sometimes feel harder, particularly if you start to fatigue and your cadence drops outside a comfortable range.</p>\n<p>At the extreme of this, you can get stuck in a spiral, where cadence drops with fatigue, leading to increased resistance and force demands on your legs. This is sometimes called the ‘spiral of death’, and can result in you grinding to a complete halt.</p>\n<p>It pays to be aware of these limitations when getting started with ERG mode so that you can use it to its full potential and get the best experience from using it in your training platform of choice.</p>\n<h2>When to use ERG mode</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Zwift on a laptop and the BikeRadar Podcast on an iPhone\" title=\"Zwift on a laptop and the BikeRadar Podcast on an iPhone\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> If your workout includes a lot of sprints, then it might be best to turn ERG mode off.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>While ERG mode is suitable for most types of workouts, it can be helpful to perform at least some of your interval sessions without ERG mode on.</p>\n<p>This will help you both assess whether your interval power targets are appropriate or might be holding you back too much, and develop some of those real-world skills mentioned above, notably gear selection and pacing.</p>\n<p>From a practical perspective, ERG mode can be slow to adjust to changes in your target power, which can be problematic if you’re doing short sprinting intervals, and in this case riding without ERG may be best.</p>\n<p>If your workout includes a variety of intervals – including sprints – then some apps may enable you to turn ERG mode off and on during the workout itself.</p>\n<section>\n    <div>\n        \n<h2>Top ERG mode tips</h2>\n<p>Finally, here are a few pointers to help you get the best from your rides and workouts using ERG mode.
