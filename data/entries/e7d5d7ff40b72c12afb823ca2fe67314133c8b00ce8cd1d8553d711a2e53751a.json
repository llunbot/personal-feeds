Mainly, they just had to be light. But then <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-steel-road-bike\" target=\"_blank\">steel</a> was supplanted by magnesium, which <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-aluminium-road-bikes\" target=\"_blank\">aluminium</a> even more quickly overtook. Then in the naughty noughties, carbon composite truncated aluminium’s time in the sun, and brands got wise to the near-limitless potential the new material held for bike design. It made bikes a lot better, but also gave designers and engineers the opportunity to specialise. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They could make some bikes lighter than any metal could ever achieve for the same stiffness, and easily add in some extra tyre clearance to create bonafide <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/is-cyclocross-the-future-of-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">cyclocross</a> counterparts. Alternatively, they could make other designs more efficient through the air by altering tube shapes. On top of that, by shifting the location of a composite ply here and swapping the modulus of another there, brands could introduce tangible benefits to comfort, creating yet another strain of bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As such, we got to the point we’ve been at for the past 10 years or so, where most brands offer four categories of drop-bar bike: <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-road-bike\" target=\"_blank\">lightweight</a>, CX, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-aero-bikes\" target=\"_blank\">aero</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-endurance-road-bikes\" target=\"_blank\">endurance</a>. And that was a great way to categorise bikes for a long time. There was clear water between the performance of each genre, and the delineation made it easy for consumers to identify the bike that fit their riding requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But all that has changed.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-all-road-bikes\">Best all-road bikes 2023 reviewed</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-gravel-bike\">Best of the best gravel bikes 2023: Cyclist’s top-rated gravel and adventure bikes</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-road-bike\">Best road bikes: Best bikes from under £1,000 to over £10,000</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>The times, they are a-changin’</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I blame new technology (AI, anyone?). When combined with the infinitely iterative nature of composite fabrication, and added to shifting market trends, it meant that bikes continued to evolve. I now believe what has become the traditional way of categorising drop bar bikes needs to be reconsidered.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/scott_addict_gravel_review_04-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/scott_addict_gravel_review_04-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/scott_addict_gravel_review_04-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/scott_addict_gravel_review_04-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/scott_addict_gravel_review_04-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/scott_addict_gravel_review_04-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/scott_addict_gravel_review_04-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/scott_addict_gravel_review_04-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/scott_addict_gravel_review_04-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/01/scott_addict_gravel_review_04.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For starters, we now have <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-gravel-bike\" target=\"_blank\">gravel bikes</a> to factor in. They properly emerged (or reemerged, depending in your age) five years or so ago. For a time, they sat quite happily as an additional, separate category, but the rapid progression of their designs in more than one direction has quickly meant that ‘gravel’ is now far too nebulous a term for all the bikes that are associated with the discipline. It simply is no longer relevant enough to be useful. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That goes for both the brand trying to market a bike – ambiguous messaging surrounding the launch of a new design is a PR manager’s nightmare – and the consumer trying to buy one. Imagine the confusion for a new cyclist, attempting to choose a gravel bike, caused by being presented with the lightweight, stripped-back and nimble <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/bmc-kaius-review\" target=\"_blank\">BMC Kaius</a> as an equal tool to the mount-laden, ambling <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/genesis-fugio-30-review-2\" target=\"_blank\">Genesis Fugio</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/12/02120716/giant-propel-14-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"giant-propel-14\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/12/02120716/giant-propel-14-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/12/02120716/giant-propel-14-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/12/02120716/giant-propel-14-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/12/02120716/giant-propel-14-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/12/02120716/giant-propel-14-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/12/02120716/giant-propel-14-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/12/02120716/giant-propel-14-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/12/02120716/giant-propel-14-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2015/12/02120716/giant-propel-14.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Then we also have to consider that lightweight bikes and aero bikes are moving inexorably towards a convergence. Plenty of big brands have already reached that point by either making their lightweight bikes aero – for example, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-tarmac-sl8-review\" target=\"_blank\">Specialized’s Tarmac</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/cannondale-supersix-evo-review\" target=\"_blank\">Cannondale’s SuperSix Evo</a> – or in the case of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/giant-propel-advanced-sl-0-review\" target=\"_blank\">Giant’s Propel</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/trek-madone-review\" target=\"_blank\">Trek’s Madone</a>, their aero bikes lightweight. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There may still just be enough of a difference in performance to justify separate bikes for the pros, but there won’t be for long. For recreational riders, the margin is so small it has as good as already disappeared.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/cannondale-synapse-smartsense-1-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/cannondale-synapse-smartsense-1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/cannondale-synapse-smartsense-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/cannondale-synapse-smartsense-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/cannondale-synapse-smartsense-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/cannondale-synapse-smartsense-1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/cannondale-synapse-smartsense-1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/cannondale-synapse-smartsense-1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/cannondale-synapse-smartsense-1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/cannondale-synapse-smartsense-1-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/cannondale-synapse-smartsense-1.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the traditional endurance bike no longer exists. While differences in fit remain, one of the endurance category’s original key tenets, tyre clearance, is now bettered as standard by most race bikes. Gravel bikes provided more comfort too when they came along, usurping another endurance USP. With <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/road-bike-geometry-handling\" target=\"_blank\">geometry</a> as its one remaining vocation – its fit characteristics being more forgiving than a race bike, and its handling being better suited to road than that of gravel bikes – the category has had to shift towards utility and versatility.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New world order</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, I present to you a reimagined classification. Four new categories, listed in order (I imagine it running from left to right, perhaps with a colour gradient, like the pH scale).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It starts with the lightweight and aero categories being combined into a ‘Race’ category – all bikes here are designed to be ridden fast, and flirt with the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/uci-weight-limit#:~:text=The%20UCI%20weight%20limit%20is,weighing%20at%20least%206.8kg.\" target=\"_blank\">UCI weight limit</a>. Next, endurance formally gives way to ‘<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-all-road-bikes\" target=\"_blank\">All-Road</a>’. These are comfortable bikes that are happy on the road but have the clearance for slim treaded tyres to tackle tame bridleways.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"648\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Udog_distanza_gravel_shoes-3-970x648.jpg\" alt=\"Udog Distanza gravel shoes\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Udog_distanza_gravel_shoes-3-970x648.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Udog_distanza_gravel_shoes-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Udog_distanza_gravel_shoes-3-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Udog_distanza_gravel_shoes-3-1536x1026.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Udog_distanza_gravel_shoes-3-2048x1368.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Udog_distanza_gravel_shoes-3-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Udog_distanza_gravel_shoes-3-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Udog_distanza_gravel_shoes-3-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Udog_distanza_gravel_shoes-3-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/03/Udog_distanza_gravel_shoes-3-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>Udog</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravel then divides in two. ‘Gravel Race’ absorbs cyclocross and consists of pared-back bikes intended to be ridden fast, mostly off-road. And completing the set we have ‘Adventure’, being made up of bikes intended to be laden with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-best-bikepacking-bags\" target=\"_blank\">luggage</a> and ridden far, nearly exclusively off-road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There you have it. Lightweight, Aero, Endurance and CX has become Race, All-Road, Gravel Race and Adventure. I don’t claim to have reinvented the wheel, as most of this is already happening, but I do take satisfaction in aggregating numerous trends into a cohesive and sensible framework for the future (although no doubt AI could have done a better job in half the time).</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/road-gravel-bike-categories\">Opinion: It’s time to rethink drop bar bike categories</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"e7d5d7ff40b72c12afb823ca2fe67314133c8b00ce8cd1d8553d711a2e53751a","category":"Cycling"}
