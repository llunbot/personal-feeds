The machine-learning software was combined with live CCTV footage to try to detect aggressive behavior and guns or knives being brandished, as well as looking for people falling onto Tube tracks or dodging fares.</p>\n<p>From October 2022 until the end of September 2023, Transport for London (TfL), which operates the cityâ€™s Tube and bus network, tested 11 algorithms to monitor people passing through Willesden Green Tube station, in the northwest of the city. The proof of concept trial is the first time the transport body has combined AI and live video footage to generate alerts that are sent to frontline staff. More than 44,000 alerts were issued during the test, with 19,000 being delivered to station staff in real time.</p>\n<p></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2002361#p3\">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2002361&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e4db4ce226f96f8087de4f671e1beb6c769bc68a01f9e60ef29b70408a9dc720","category":"Tech"}
