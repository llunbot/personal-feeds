Gerben Thijssen briefly lost traction, reportedly on a wet section of the track, and then behind him, Kenny De Ketele swerved sharply to his right just in front of Lasse Norman Hansen. Hansen crashed, and then Cavendish, just behind, crashed as he collided with Hansen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both riders were standing after a few moments, with Cavendish waving to the crowd, but Cavendish was taken away on a stretcher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Further evaluations revealed the extent of his injuries, requiring an overnight stay in the hospital. According to Deceuninck-QuickStep, he is expected to be discharged either on Monday or on Tuesday morning, and he “will then undergo a period of recuperation.”</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/11/cavendish-suffers-two-broken-ribs-and-a-collapsed-lung-in-ghent-six-crash/\">Read More</a>","author":"Dane Cash","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"9271b3ade0d0cbd85cb7a5666a3724a84b17de1ed98135b8187446f90466e943","category":"Cycling"}
