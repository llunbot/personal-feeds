{"title":"U.S. Department of Justice Sues Apple, Accusing It of Illegally Abusing an iPhone Monopoly","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/21/technology/apple-doj-lawsuit-antitrust.html","date":1711032309000,"content":"\n<p>David McCabe and Tripp Mickle, reporting for The New York Times: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The lawsuit filed Thursday focuses on a group of practices that the government said Apple had used to shore up its dominance.</p>\n\n<p>The company “undermines” the ability of iPhone users to message with owners of other types of smartphones, like those running the Android operating system, the government said. That divide — epitomized by the green bubbles that show an Android owner’s messages — sent a signal that other smartphones were lower quality than the iPhone, according to the lawsuit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But of course SMS <em>is</em> a vastly lower-quality platform than iMessage. The Times doesn’t include a link to the actual lawsuit, but I’m curious what they think Apple should do differently on this front.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple has similarly made it difficult for the iPhone to work with smartwatches other than its own Apple Watch, the government argued. Once an iPhone user owns an Apple Watch it becomes far more costly for them to ditch the phone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Apple peripherals and Apple software exclusive to Apple devices is, in a nut, what Apple does and what has made their products popular. Without having yet read the lawsuit, this summary reeks of technical naivety.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/21/us-vs-apple\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d52e7b5b0169b1205c5fa78d39417636f0425ce40b5abb1631a9d6df2be08927","category":"Tech"}
