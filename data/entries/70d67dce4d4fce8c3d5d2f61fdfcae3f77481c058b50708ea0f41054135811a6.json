A <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/mass-cyber-outage-airports-businesses-broadcasters-crowdstrike-rcna162664\">massive global IT outage</a> affecting countless businesses and services grounded United, Delta, and American Airlines flights, delayed British soccer team Manchester United ticket sales, and knocked Sky News off the air. The reason? A Windows update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to CrowdStrike CEO George Kurtz, “a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts” pushed Friday morning wreaked havoc on computers around the world and resulted in the dreaded blue screen of death on all clients connected to the host, rendering the machines unable to function. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>CrowdStrike is actively working with customers impacted by a defect found in a single content update for Windows hosts.

On Reddit, a workaround from CrowdStrike Engineering has been posted, but it needs to be applied separately to each machine. And since Crowdstrike posted it behind a login page, many users will likely be unable to find it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of Monday morning, some systems were still affected by the glitch, though CrowdStrike reported that it was testing “a new technique to accelerate impacted system remediation” and is “in the process of operationalizing an opt-in to this technique.” </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previous Apple software engineer Ananay <a href=\"https://x.com/ananayarora/status/1814269058088304760\">outlined</a> a “full technical breakdown” of how the update took down so many networks. In the meantime, somewhere Apple’s marketing team is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HjDpPnxcP0\">working on a new ad</a>.</p>\n\nMac</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"70d67dce4d4fce8c3d5d2f61fdfcae3f77481c058b50708ea0f41054135811a6","category":"Apple"}
