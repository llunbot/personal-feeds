Just open up Terminal on your Mac, copy in the\nbelow, and press return.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The one-line command:</p>\n\n<pre><code>defaults write com.apple.finder _FXEnableColumnAutoSizing -bool YES; killall Finder\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(Change <code>YES</code> to <code>NO</code> if you want to go back.)</p>\n\n<p>Marcel Bresink’s <a href=\"http://www.bresink.com/osx/TinkerTool.html\">TinkerTool</a> is a great free app for adjusting hidden preferences using a proper GUI, and it turns out TinkerTool has exposed this hidden Finder preference for a few years now. You learn something every day. I enabled this a few days ago on MacOS 15 Sequoia, and it seems exactly like the implementation Apple has exposed in the Finder’s View Options window in Tahoe, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2026/01/resize_columns_to_fit_filenames\">which I wrote about Friday</a>.
