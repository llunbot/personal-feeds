After building <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/07/the-first-all-new-lotus-in-years-will-be-a-1971hp-electric-car/\">a low-volume electric hypercar</a> and then <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/06/driving-lotus-new-emira-gives-us-lots-of-confidence-in-its-evs/\">its last gasoline-powered sportscar</a>, it debuted an all-new electric vehicle, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/03/whether-you-love-the-idea-or-hate-it-lotus-is-making-an-electric-suv/\">an SUV called the Eletre</a>. And next year another new EV goes into production, a new four-door GT called the Emeya that uses the same Electric Premium Architecture platform as that SUV.</p>\n<p>Despite sharing a corporate parent and a very similar design brief, the Lotus Emeya is unrelated to the Polestar 5 four-door GT <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/07/watch-out-porsche-polestar-is-working-on-a-proper-taycan-rival/\">that we rode in a few weeks ago</a>. Both cars clearly target <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/11/the-2022-porsche-taycan-gts-first-drive/\">the Porsche Taycan</a>, offering high power outputs, very rapid charging, and an engaging driving experience. But there's nothing shared between the Polestar and the Lotus, which, unlike the Polestar 5, uses a more conventional chassis construction that's a mix of different strength steels and aluminum.</p>\n<p>\"This is a Lotus like you've never seen before,\" said Lotus Group Vice President of Design Ben Payne. \"We've built on everything Lotus has achieved so far, creating a luxury performance car for the drivers, designed to inspire confidence, exhilarate with raw emotion and pure joy—connecting them to the road.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1966321#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1966321&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
