Debuting this weekend for gravel racing at Unbound, Silca’s new ‘Ultimate’ solution will strip all of the grease of your chain and have it ready for their fastest wax-based lube in 10 minutes of less, and you don’t even have to pull the chain off your bike!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Silca Ultimate Chain Stripper and Wax Prep makes you faster</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Silca-secret-chain-melt-Coefficent_of_Friction_imageBG_480x480.jpg\"><img width=\"480\" height=\"319\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Silca-secret-chain-melt-Coefficent_of_Friction_imageBG_480x480.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Silca-secret-chain-melt-Coefficent_of_Friction_imageBG_480x480.jpg 480w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Silca-secret-chain-melt-Coefficent_of_Friction_imageBG_480x480-297x197.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Silca-secret-chain-melt-Coefficent_of_Friction_imageBG_480x480-120x80.jpg 120w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve pretty much all come to accept that waxed chain lubrication is the path to the lowest drivetrain friction and the fastest-spinning drivetrain on our bikes. But getting a properly waxed chain isn’t easy. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sram-eagle-axs-direct-mount-chains-01.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sram-eagle-axs-direct-mount-chains-01-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"sram flat top mountain bike chains\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sram-eagle-axs-direct-mount-chains-01-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sram-eagle-axs-direct-mount-chains-01-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sram-eagle-axs-direct-mount-chains-01-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sram-eagle-axs-direct-mount-chains-01-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sram-eagle-axs-direct-mount-chains-01-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/sram-eagle-axs-direct-mount-chains-01.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting from a factory-greased chain, it often requires multiple degreasing and ultrasonic cleaning steps to get the chain clean enough to make wax lubes properly stick. And if you skimp on this step, the wax lubrication won’t properly penetrate and adhere to your chain, so you won’t get those magic speed benefits. If you are starting with a used chain that’s already seen time on your bike, the process is even more fraught. Only by removing the chain, and restarting the degreasing &amp; ultrasonic cleaning process do you have any hope. And our own experience suggests that truly getting a used chain fully clean again is a pipedream.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>So what’s new here?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Silca’s new solution makes it super simple to clean away that old grease on your chain and make the leap to better wax lubrication… </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new highly-concentrated, biodegradable degreaser that makes up the ‘Ultimate Chain Stripper’ part of this new mix cleans away all of your existing chain lube. Then, the ‘Wax Prep’ part acts as a primer on the metal of your chain to help adhere your new wax lube with a single quick application.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Silca-Ultimate-Chain-Stripper-and-Wax-Prep-easy-drivetrain-cleaner-makes-you-faster_label-details.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Silca-Ultimate-Chain-Stripper-and-Wax-Prep-easy-drivetrain-cleaner-makes-you-faster_label-details-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Silca Ultimate Chain Stripper and Wax Prep easy drivetrain cleaner makes you faster, label details\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Silca-Ultimate-Chain-Stripper-and-Wax-Prep-easy-drivetrain-cleaner-makes-you-faster_label-details-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Silca-Ultimate-Chain-Stripper-and-Wax-Prep-easy-drivetrain-cleaner-makes-you-faster_label-details-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Silca-Ultimate-Chain-Stripper-and-Wax-Prep-easy-drivetrain-cleaner-makes-you-faster_label-details-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Silca-Ultimate-Chain-Stripper-and-Wax-Prep-easy-drivetrain-cleaner-makes-you-faster_label-details-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Silca-Ultimate-Chain-Stripper-and-Wax-Prep-easy-drivetrain-cleaner-makes-you-faster_label-details-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Silca-Ultimate-Chain-Stripper-and-Wax-Prep-easy-drivetrain-cleaner-makes-you-faster_label-details-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Silca-Ultimate-Chain-Stripper-and-Wax-Prep-easy-drivetrain-cleaner-makes-you-faster_label-details-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption><em>photos c.

Some of the recommended methods use as many as 3 separate chemicals and can take up to 2 full days to complete. By taking a totally different approach with this product, we’ve developed something that not only strips the chain completely of other lubricants, but actually leaves the metal prepped for optimal adhesion of the wax. This is a huge win on both fronts, we’ve ultimately increased application longevity and performance of the lubricant, while reducing the preparation time to achieve this from hours to minutes!</p>\n<cite><em>– Josh Poertner, Silca CEO</em></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3>How do you use it?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Classified-Powershift-Boost-MTB-2x-internal-gear-mountain-bike-hub-for-Shimano-SRAM-12sp_Mountain-Bike-Connection-Winter_Mirror-Media_SRAM-Eagle-chain.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Classified-Powershift-Boost-MTB-2x-internal-gear-mountain-bike-hub-for-Shimano-SRAM-12sp_Mountain-Bike-Connection-Winter_Mirror-Media_SRAM-Eagle-chain-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"Classified Powershift Boost MTB 2x internal gear mountain bike hub for Shimano or SRAM 12-speed, Bike Connection Agency photo by Mirror Media, Eagle chain\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Classified-Powershift-Boost-MTB-2x-internal-gear-mountain-bike-hub-for-Shimano-SRAM-12sp_Mountain-Bike-Connection-Winter_Mirror-Media_SRAM-Eagle-chain-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Classified-Powershift-Boost-MTB-2x-internal-gear-mountain-bike-hub-for-Shimano-SRAM-12sp_Mountain-Bike-Connection-Winter_Mirror-Media_SRAM-Eagle-chain-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Classified-Powershift-Boost-MTB-2x-internal-gear-mountain-bike-hub-for-Shimano-SRAM-12sp_Mountain-Bike-Connection-Winter_Mirror-Media_SRAM-Eagle-chain-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Classified-Powershift-Boost-MTB-2x-internal-gear-mountain-bike-hub-for-Shimano-SRAM-12sp_Mountain-Bike-Connection-Winter_Mirror-Media_SRAM-Eagle-chain-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Classified-Powershift-Boost-MTB-2x-internal-gear-mountain-bike-hub-for-Shimano-SRAM-12sp_Mountain-Bike-Connection-Winter_Mirror-Media_SRAM-Eagle-chain-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Classified-Powershift-Boost-MTB-2x-internal-gear-mountain-bike-hub-for-Shimano-SRAM-12sp_Mountain-Bike-Connection-Winter_Mirror-Media_SRAM-Eagle-chain-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Classified-Powershift-Boost-MTB-2x-internal-gear-mountain-bike-hub-for-Shimano-SRAM-12sp_Mountain-Bike-Connection-Winter_Mirror-Media_SRAM-Eagle-chain.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption><em>c.

After that, simply rinse it off with a hose – no pressure washers please, but plenty of water flow to flush out all of the degreased residue. Then, simply apply a drip-on lube like Silca’s Secret Chain Lube – <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/silca-super-secret-chain-lube-liquifies-drag-with-bottled-hot-melt-wax/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>aka</em> Hot Melt Wax in a bottle</a> – and away you go with a faster chain.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Silca-Secret-Chain-Blend-hot-melt-wax-lube-3.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1467\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Silca-Secret-Chain-Blend-hot-melt-wax-lube-3.jpg\" alt=\"SILCA HOT MELT WAX\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Silca-Secret-Chain-Blend-hot-melt-wax-lube-3.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Silca-Secret-Chain-Blend-hot-melt-wax-lube-3-297x218.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Silca-Secret-Chain-Blend-hot-melt-wax-lube-3-800x587.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Silca-Secret-Chain-Blend-hot-melt-wax-lube-3-120x88.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Silca-Secret-Chain-Blend-hot-melt-wax-lube-3-768x563.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Silca-Secret-Chain-Blend-hot-melt-wax-lube-3-1536x1127.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news here is that it is compatible with other drip-on wax-based lubes, too – not only Silca’s.

For $36 / 44€ you get a small 4oz/118ml bottle of Ultimate Chain Stripper and Wax Prep combined with a small 4oz/118ml bottle of Super Secret Chain Lube. That is said to be enough to clean around 4 chains, and make them super-fast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bigger 16oz/473ml bottle of Ultimate Chain Stripper and Wax Prep sells for the same $36 / 44€ as the bundle, but will be better suited for cleaning and prepping more than a dozen chains. Just to be clear, you should only need to do this clean &amp; prep work once on a chain before you first apply a wax-based lubricant to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://silca.cc/\">Silca.cc</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/silca-ultimate-chain-stripper-and-wax-prep-makes-you-faster/\">Silca Strips at Unbound: The Ultimate Chain Stripper and Wax Prep To Go Faster</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"0bf72f08bf1aa6c3d52da04a58e4ed9490461f627ef230f565083e749b9ede1f","category":"Cycling"}
