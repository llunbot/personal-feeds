You can currently buy the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/232610/airpods-2nd-generation-review.html\">2nd-gen AirPods</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/549094/airpods-3rd-generation-review.html\">3rd-gen AirPods</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1207444/airpods-pro-2022-review.html\">2nd-gen AirPods Pro</a> with USB-C, and the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234986/airpods-max-review.html\">AirPods Max</a> over-the-ear headphones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s set that last option aside for a moment. If you’re willing to spend $500 or more on a pair of cans, you’re making a whole different buying decision than if you want true wireless earbuds. You might like to take a look at our round-up of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/201379/best-over-ear-headphones-airpods-max-vs-the-competition.html\">best over-ear headphones</a> where we compare the AirPods Max to the competition. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that still leaves three relatively similar-seeming earbuds to choose from. So which is right for you?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>AirPods and AirPods Pro features compared</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is how the three in-ear AirPods stack up side-by-side. Note there are two versions of the 3rd gen AirPods as indicated, one has a MagSafe charging case the other doesn’t charge wirelessly. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>AirPods (2nd gen)</th><th>AirPods (3rd gen)</th><th>AirPods Pro (2nd gen)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Price</td><td>$129/£129</td><td>Lightning model: $169/£169<br />MagSafe model: $179/£179</td><td>$249/£229</td></tr><tr><td>Weight (earbuds)</td><td>0.14 oz (4 grams)</td><td>0.15 oz (4.3 grams)</td><td>0.19 oz (5.3 grams)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight (case)</td><td>1.35 oz (38 grams)</td><td>1.34 oz (38 grams)</td><td>1.79 oz (50.8 grams)</td></tr><tr><td>Battery Life</td><td>5 hrs + 19 from case</td><td>6 hrs + 24 from case</td><td>6 hrs + 24 from case</td></tr><tr><td>Charging</td><td>Lightning charging case, no wireless charging</td><td>Wirelessly charge with MagSafe.

The 2nd-gen AirPods have the original design from 2016, with long white stems and earbuds that resemble the wired earpods that used to come with iPhones, just without the wire.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>AirPods (2nd-generation)</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://www.idg.se/editorial/980/path/1.701871.1525355032!imageUploader/851228956.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"AirPods (2nd-generation)\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/232610/airpods-2nd-generation-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Read our review</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$129\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2FUS1583925.html&amp;publisher_slug=macworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=macworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macworld.com%2Ffeed&amp;u1=1-1-546049-5-197984-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$34 at  Adorama</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/321564/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-2nd-Generation/604342441&amp;subid1=1-1-546049-5-197984-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$69 at  Walmart</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/321564/633495/10014?prodsku=6539358&amp;u=https://api.bestbuy.com/click/-/6296120/pdp&amp;intsrc=CATF_4831&amp;subid1=1-1-546049-5-197984-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$79.99 at  Best Buy</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<p>The newer 3rd-generation AirPods have shorter stems and a more bulbous, rounded earpiece.

Not only do the rubberized tips help block out more outside noise, the active noise cancelling gives you a real sense of a more private listening space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While we’re at it, we should mention that only the AirPods Pro support the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/541938/airpods-pro-conversation-boost-how-to.html\">Conversation Boost</a> accessibility feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>AirPods and AirPods Pro Spatial Audio and sound quality</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>All AirPods support Dolby Atmos spatial audio in Apple Music. In fact, you can force it on for <em>any</em> pair of headphones. But spatial audio for video in the TV and other supported apps, with head tracking, is not supported on the 2nd-generation AirPods. You need the 3rd-generation or the AirPods Pro to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 3rd-gen AirPods have better sound than the 2nd-gen in other ways, too. Apple has a new redesigned low-distortion driver that it says delivers better sound quality, and they support Adaptive EQ like the AirPods Pro. AirPods Pro (2nd-gen) sound significantly better than regular AirPods, even without active noise canceling. The 2nd-generation version, released in September 2022 (and updated with USB-C in September 2023), offered a big step up in sound quality over the original AirPods Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>AirPods and AirPods Pro features and controls</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You control the 2nd-gen AirPods by tapping on them, while the 3rd-gen AirPods and AirPods Pro have a little cutout area on the stem that is sensitive to pressure. Squeeze the stem (there’s a faux “click” sensation) to play/pause, skip forward, back, or summon Siri. The AirPods Pro can also detect a swipe up or down along the stem to change volume (that’s new in the 2nd-gen model). All AirPods models support hands-free “Hey Siri” control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both AirPods Pro and 3rd-gen AirPods are water- and sweat-resistant, and probably better suited to working out, though you wouldn’t want to dunk any of them in the pool. The 2nd-gen AirPods don’t have any water resistance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 3rd-gen AirPods support expanded Find My support for tracking down lost earbuds and setting separation alerts. The AirPods Pro, since the release of the 2nd-gen version, also have a speaker on the charging case to play a loud tone when using Find My, and have the U1 chip so you can guided directly to them. The 3rd-gen AirPods and AirPods Pro also support Announce Notifications, which lets Siri dictate important messages and alerts as they arrive. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3817880/comparativa-airpods-airpods-pro.png\" alt=\"Which AirPods\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>AirPods and AirPods Pro battery life</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2nd-gen AirPods last five hours, and you can charge roughly four times with the charging case for a total of 24 hours of listening time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 3rd-gen AirPods and AirPods Pro extend that listening time by an hour for six hours of listening time, and with four more charges in the case, you get a total of 30 hours. With AirPods Pro, turning noise canceling off will add about an hour of listening time.

There is a cheaper version of the 3rd-gen AirPods that doesn’t offer wireless charging, that model, which is $10/£10 cheaper, ships with a case for charging via Lightning. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 3rd-gen AirPods with MagSafe and AirPods Pro come with a wireless charge case that lets you charge any Qi wireless charger, or Apple’s MagSafe wireless charging. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also use the case to charge the 3rd-gen AirPods via Lightning and the AirPods Pro via USB-C (an older model offered Lightning). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can charge the AirPods Pro using your Apple Watch charger, and, if you have an iPhone 15-series phone you can charge your AirPods Pro by plugging the cable into the USB-C port on your iPhone.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/airpods-pro-iphone-15-charging.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPhone 15 with AirPods usb-c case\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/airpods-pro-iphone-15-charging.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/airpods-pro-iphone-15-charging.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/airpods-pro-iphone-15-charging.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/airpods-pro-iphone-15-charging.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/airpods-pro-iphone-15-charging.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/airpods-pro-iphone-15-charging.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/airpods-pro-iphone-15-charging.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/airpods-pro-iphone-15-charging.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" /></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Each of the three AirPods models Apple offers are very different. If you don’t care about wireless charging, the 2nd-gen AirPods is a decent buy. They won’t sound quite as good or last quite as long as the 3rd-gen AirPods, but they’re a good affordable option. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If wireless charging matters, definitely get the 3rd-gen AirPods, since buying the charging case with the 2nd-gen AirPods will actually cost more than the 3rd-gen AirPods. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The AirPods Pro were updated to a second-gen model in September 2022 and again in September 2023 (when they gained USB-C support), and while they cost a lot more than the standard AirPods, they offer much better sound quality and unique features like active noise canceling, adaptive transparency, and conversation boost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We think the 3rd-gen AirPods are the best buy for most. They’re technically cheaper than the 2nd-gen AirPods with a wireless charging case and come with a slew of new features. They have better battery life and sound better than the older model. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second-generation AirPods Pro are clearly the superior choice, but you’ll pay more than 40% more for them.
