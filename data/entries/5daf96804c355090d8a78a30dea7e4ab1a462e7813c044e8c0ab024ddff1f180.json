This enables ‌Siri‌ to leverage ChatGPT's image- and text-understanding capabilities with no need to jump between tools. Users can ask questions related to text, documents, photos, PDFs, and more. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nChatGPT will also be available in Apple's new systemwide Writing Tools to help users generate content for anything they're writing about. With Compose, users can similarly access ChatGPT image tools to generate images in a range of styles to compliment their writing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌Siri‌ will leverage GPT-4o for free, with no need to create an account. Requests are not logged and IP addresses are obscured. ChatGPT subscribers will also be able to access paid features within the experiences.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chatgpt/\">ChatGPT</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/siri-can-access-chatgpt-with-ios-18/\">Siri Can Access ChatGPT Directly With iOS 18</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/siri-can-access-chatgpt-directly-with-ios-18.2428665/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5daf96804c355090d8a78a30dea7e4ab1a462e7813c044e8c0ab024ddff1f180","category":"Apple"}
