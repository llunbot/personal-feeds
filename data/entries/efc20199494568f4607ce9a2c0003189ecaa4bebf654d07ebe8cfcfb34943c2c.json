With the platform’s launch in Hong Kong, users have\ndiscovered that one episode in particular has been scrubbed from\nthe streamer — the one that mocks Tiananmen Square.</p>\n\n<p>According to users, season 16 of the show offers episode 11 and\nthen 13, but skips episode 12 altogether. The episode — first\nbroadcast in 2005 and titled “Goo Goo Gai Pan” — follows the\nSimpson family on a trip to China, where they visit Tiananmen\nSquare. While there, they spot a placard that reads: “On this\nsite, in 1989, nothing happened.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Profiles in courage.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/12/01/disney-plus-simpsons-tiananmen-square\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"efc20199494568f4607ce9a2c0003189ecaa4bebf654d07ebe8cfcfb34943c2c","category":"Tech"}
