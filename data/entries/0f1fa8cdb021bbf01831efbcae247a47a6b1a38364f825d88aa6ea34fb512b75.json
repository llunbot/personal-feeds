It's a good price on a pivotal part of Apple's past, featuring all of the components from the 2011 ‌iPhone‌ 4S.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/grid-studio-4s-4.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nThe ‌iPhone‌ 4S was the last ‌iPhone‌ introduced during Apple co-founder Steve Jobs' lifetime, and it was the first ‌iPhone‌ Apple CEO <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a> released without Jobs. It was the fifth ‌iPhone‌ that Apple came out with, and in the name, the \"S\" stood for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a>. The ‌iPhone‌ 4S was the first ‌iPhone‌ that included Apple's personal assistant.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/grid-studio-4s-5.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nCompared to the ‌iPhone‌ 4, the ‌iPhone‌ 4S included an upgraded A5 chip, an 8-megapixel camera, and up to 64GB of storage. It ran iOS 5, a major operating system update that brought features like <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud/\">iCloud</a> and iMessage. All of the internal components from the ‌iPhone‌ 4S are thoughtfully arranged in GRID Studio's piece, and there's even a look at the default app arrangement that was available at the time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe GRID 4S measures in at 11.7 by 16.5 inches, the same size as an A3 sheet of paper. It features a white background with a black frame, which allows it to match with any decor. GRID Studio also has a <a href=\"https://gridstudio.cc/collections/iphone\">range of other iPhone pieces available</a>, with a 15 percent discount on everything this week.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/03/grid-studio-4s-6.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nWe have one 256GB 10.9-inch ‌iPad‌ with WiFi and cellular connectivity for a lucky <em>MacRumors</em> reader.
