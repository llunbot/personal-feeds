But the company is not about to delay the launch of the iPhone 16 series just to coincide with the availability of Apple Intelligence.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman notes that ahead of the 2011 launch of the iPhone, Apple did choose to postpone the device's release from its then-usual June timing to October, in order to align it with the availability of iCloud and Siri, which were new online services at the time. This year, however, Gurman does not see the delayed arrival of Apple Intelligence as being a big enough issue to change Apple's hardware launch plans, especially given that the tools that will be rolled out first aren't particularly game-chaining on their own.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple Intelligence features in the iOS 18.1 beta include Writing Tools for proofreading, rewriting, and summarizing text, a new Siri interface with Type to Siri, Mail and Messages app improvements like summarizing emails and Smart Reply, phone call recording, and audio transcription in Notes and other apps, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/ios-18-1-apple-intelligence-features/\">more</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSome of the more significant and compelling Apple Intelligence features that Apple plans to introduce at a later date include Image Playground, Genmoji, ChatGPT integration with Siri, priority notifications, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/29/ios-18-1-apple-intelligence-unavailable-features/\">several other additions</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/05/iphone-16-september-launch-on-track/\">iPhone 16 Still Coming in September Despite Delayed Apple Intelligence Rollout</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-still-coming-in-september-despite-delayed-apple-intelligence-rollout.2432950/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3bf03738cb9af972ffdc1cf654d868cf3f0d353cd162d2d37550f25821d8c639","category":"Apple"}
