So why are we recommending Thunderbolt 4 cables? Well, because there just aren’t many accessories that support Thunderbolt 5, and the ones that are out are entirely too expensive. Plus Thunderbolt 4 is no slouch: Not only will this cable allow you to transfer data at up to 40GB/s, but it will also allow you to connect your laptop to a 4K display. Of course, there’s also the fact that you’ll be able to charge your laptop or other devices with up to 100W of power.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This cable is a 1m (3-foot) braided cable that is well-made and that will coil neatly without tangling. At $35, it’s comparable to other Thunderbolt 4 cables from Satechi and OWC, and we wholeheartedly recommend it at this price. <a href=\"https://www.target.com/p/apple-thunderbolt-4-usb-c-pro-cable-1m/-/A-89564439\">So get your own Apple Thunderbolt 4 cable</a> for half-off at Target sooner rather than later because you can’t know how long it’s going to be on sale.</p>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.target.com/p/apple-thunderbolt-4-usb-c-pro-cable-1m/-/A-89564439\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now at Target</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"d02ada21fc6674b0a77d6bf815bf41ad34d9663c9ce30a68a706200de79543a6","category":"Apple"}
