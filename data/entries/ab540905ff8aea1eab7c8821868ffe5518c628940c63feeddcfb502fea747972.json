{"title":"Two Russian YouTubers Post Videos Unboxing Purported M4 MacBook Pro Base Models","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/07/apple-potentially-facing-worst-leak-since-iphone-4/","date":1728431301000,"content":"\n<p>Joe Rossignol, writing for MacRumors:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/eqPZ42NNTGI\">latest video</a> of what could be a next-generation\nMacBook Pro was shared on YouTube Shorts today by Russian channel\nRomancev768, just one day after another Russian channel <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/06/alleged-m4-macbook-pro-unboxing-video/\">shared a\nsimilar video</a>. The clip shows a box for a 14-inch MacBook\nPro that is apparently configured with an M4 chip with a 10-core\nCPU and a 10-core GPU, 16GB of RAM, 512GB of storage, three\nThunderbolt 4 ports, and a Space Black finish. [...]</p>\n\n<p>The source of these leaks is unclear. Last week, “ShrimpApplePro”\n<a href=\"https://x.com/VNchocoTaco/status/1840807198223712347\">claimed</a> that at least one of the unannounced 14-inch\nMacBook Pro units was apparently being offered for sale in a\nprivate Facebook group. In a <a href=\"https://x.com/VNchocoTaco/status/1843133165302591861\">follow-up post</a> on X on\nSunday, the leaker claimed that he saw someone online who was\napparently advertising 200 of the unannounced 14-inch MacBook Pro\nunits for sale, leading him to believe this leak originates from a\nwarehouse. It is unclear if these details are accurate, but this\nwhole situation is clearly very sketchy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s somewhat weird that the box art is identical to that of last year’s M3 MacBook Pros, but I lean toward thinking these are real. Best guess is that someone stole 200 of these from China and some or all of them wound up in Russia? No sympathy for Apple here if that’s what happened — if you assemble your products in a dictatorship, stuff like this is bound to happen. Kinda surprising it hasn’t happened with iPhones, which would garner far more attention and value a month ahead of launch. That it hasn’t happened with iPhones probably indicates that Apple puts more security around them than they do MacBook Pros.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/08/russian-youtubers-m4-macbook-pros\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"ab540905ff8aea1eab7c8821868ffe5518c628940c63feeddcfb502fea747972","category":"Tech"}
