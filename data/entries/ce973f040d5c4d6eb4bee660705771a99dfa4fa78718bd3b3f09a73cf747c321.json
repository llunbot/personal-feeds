Some season 2 spoilers, but no major reveals.)</strong></p>\n<p>Longtime fans of the comics can attest to the powerful allure of the basic premise: three traumatized siblings whose father was recently murdered return to dad's ancestral home, Key House, with their mother and discover that the house is filled with hidden magical keys that \"whisper\" to the children until they find them. The TV series preserves that allure. Only kids can hear the keys whispering, and any adults who witness the \"magic\" of the keys in use quickly forget what they've seen. There is an Anywhere Key that can turn a door into a portal to anywhere in the world, for instance, and a Ghost Key that lets your spirit leave your body. A Head Key provides access to one's inner self, and an Identity Key allows you to change your appearance.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1806312#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1806312&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ce973f040d5c4d6eb4bee660705771a99dfa4fa78718bd3b3f09a73cf747c321","category":"Tech"}
