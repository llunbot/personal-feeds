Ars does not accept paid editorial content.</aside>\n<p>This year marks the return of the Jeep Wagoneer, which formerly served as a more luxurious version of the Cherokee, but now hits the market as Jeep's first full EV. The challenge? How to merge the modern electric lifestyle with the outdoorsy, rugged ethos that defines Jeep as a brand, alongside the more recent addition of the internal-combustion Grand Wagoneer SUV's enormous luxury.</p>\n<p>First of all, the new Wagoneer S wound up much smaller in person than I expected. The overall profile falls more in line with the shape of mid-size electric crossovers including the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/01/kias-new-ev6-electric-crossover-goes-straight-to-the-head-of-the-pack/\">Kia EV6</a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/12/the-hyundai-ioniq-5-is-the-best-ev-weve-driven-in-2021/\">Hyundai Ioniq 5</a>, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/05/the-2024-chevrolet-equinox-ev-shows-gm-can-make-a-car-for-the-masses/\">Chevrolet Equinox</a>, and of course, Tesla's Model Y. But the interior volume belies that relatively compact exterior, with plenty of space for me at 6'1\" (185 cm) to sit comfortably in both the front and rear seats. Total cargo volumes of 30.6 cubic feet (866 L) with the second row up and 61 cubic feet (1,727 L) with the second row folded flat end up mattering less than the large floor footprint, because the height used to calculate those measurements drops with the low sloping roofline and rear window.</p>\n<p>Much of the interior space can be attributed to packaging of the Wagoneer EV's battery. Rather than going for all-out kilowatt-hours in a dedicated skateboard layout, Jeep instead used the Stellantis group's STLA Large platform, in this case stuffed with a 100.5-kWh lithium ion pack built on 400 V architecture. That's enough for an EPA-estimated 303 miles of range (487 km), a solid figure but not a seriously impressive efficiency stat. In comparison, the world-beating <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/07/the-lucid-air-pure-review-lower-weight-better-steering-amazing-efficiency/\">Lucid Air Pure RWD</a> manages about 40 percent more range per kilowatt-hour and a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/06/the-2025-polestar-3-is-a-torque-vectoring-suv-thats-fun-to-drive/\">Polestar 3 AWD</a> does about 18 percent worse. Claimed DC fast charge times of 23 minutes for a 20-80 percent top up, or 100 miles (160 km) in 10 minutes similarly get the job done without standing out from the pack.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/jeeps-first-battery-ev-is-not-what-we-expected-the-2024-wagoneer-s/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/01/jeeps-first-battery-ev-is-not-what-we-expected-the-2024-wagoneer-s/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Michael Teo Van Runkle","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f209e35157c23a340963d84920339cbe7041cfd73bbe9390994b544059bc6dc5","category":"Tech"}
