[credit:\n                        <a href=\"https://www.digit.in/news/mobile-phones/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-exclusive-leaked-renders-specs-61203.html\">OnLeaks and Digit.in</a>\n                        ]\n                  </p>\n        </div>\n      </li>\n      </ul><p>It's never too early to start talking about new Samsung phones, is it? OnLeaks has a series of renders out for the Galaxy S22. These are usually based on CAD renders given to case manufacturers, and while they might get some of the smaller details wrong, the cutouts, camera block, and other major features should be correct.</p>\n<p>First up is a <a href=\"https://www.digit.in/news/mobile-phones/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-exclusive-leaked-renders-specs-61203.html\">Galaxy S22 Ultra</a> render, and here's a shocker: it has an S-Pen! Samsung <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/12/samsung-will-reportedly-kill-the-note-line-to-focus-on-foldables/\">killed the Note line</a> this year to focus on foldable phones, but it apparently still can't let the idea of phone handwriting go. Samsung has shipped pen accessories for the S21 Ultra and Galaxy Z Fold 3, but those required some kind of case for storage. This render shows the S22 Ultra with the telltale oval along the bottom edge, just like an old Note phone. Push it in and the pen will pop out.</p>\n<p>The upside to an integrated S- Pen is that if you want to do handwriting on your phone, you'll always have the pen with you. The downside is that the S22 Ultra battery will be smaller than it could be, because a lot of space is taken up by the pen holder. It's also a huge bummer for anyone who wants a premium Samsung phone but has no interest in handwriting because they'll have to put up with the pen sucking up battery space. You don't get a choice.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1798553#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1798553&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a6806e84ee35898dffa7c29674d382d28868d095896c4d891f227edd9c669384","category":"Tech"}
