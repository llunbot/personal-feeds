Half of all payments are now contactless, a steep rise from 13% a year ago. By introducing Apple Pay in the ING Banking app, we are seizing the momentum by offering our customers a new payment method that offers incredible ease of use in shops, online and on the go.\"</blockquote>ING said it had recorded 51.5 million contactless payments during the first five months of 2021, compared to 21.5 million over the same period last year. The contactless payments are said to have accounted for half of all in-store debit card payments and had an average amount of €19. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWith support for ‌Apple Pay‌ now live, ING customers will have the added benefit of paying for things using their <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, Apple Watch, and Mac, without having to enter their PIN, even for amounts over 50 euros.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nING already offers ‌Apple Pay‌ in the Netherlands, France, Italy, Spain, Romania, Poland, Australia and Germany. ‌Apple Pay‌ launched in Belgium in November 2018. The digital payment method first launched in the United States in October 2014 and has since expanded to many other countries around the globe.\r\n<br />\r\n<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/\">Apple Pay</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/belgium/\">Belgium</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-music-apple-pay-card-icloud-fitness.134\">Apple Music, Apple Pay/Card, iCloud, Fitness+</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/03/ing-belgium-supports-apple-pay/\">ING Belgium Announces Support for Apple Pay</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ing-belgium-announces-support-for-apple-pay.2306353/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=bfZaGGsNWqc:ByNtPYhd57Y:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=bfZaGGsNWqc:ByNtPYhd57Y:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/bfZaGGsNWqc\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8f291a0addb09356faa5e95509251e5d052b73d46e692f1b254af17a9b4d4dcf","category":"Apple"}
