There’s a lot of choice though, so it can be hard to know what’s best. But fortunately, you have come to the right place.</p>\n<p>We’ve put in the miles, so you can find the best cycling shoes for your performance requirements, riding style and budget.</p>\n<p>Do you need to spend big bucks to get the latest pro model or will a cheaper option perform just as well?</p>\n<p>Some riders love a gleaming white pair of disco slippers, though these can be hard to keep clean (especially in a climate like the UK); others prefer classic black, but some might say that black shoes are boring.</p>\n<p>Cycling shoes can also vary wildly in fit (we’ve got a guide to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/wide-shoes-why-you-need-them-and-which-brand-makes-the-best/\">wide cycling shoes</a>) and intended use. It would be easy to throw lots of money at the problem and end up with a set of shoes that don’t suit your unique foot shape or riding style.</p>\n<p>If you need something to clip into, check out our guide to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bike-pedals/\">best road bike pedals</a>. If road cycling isn’t your only riding discipline, or you prefer <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/shimano-spd-vs-spd-sl/\">SPD vs SPD-SL pedals</a>, why don’t you check out our buyer’s guides to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/best-shoes-for-mountain-bikers/\">best mountain bike shoes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bike-shoes/\">best gravel bike shoes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/best-shoes-for-mountain-bikers/\">best mountain bike pedals</a>.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve considered all of the options, keep reading to the end for our buyer’s guide to road cycling shoes.</p>\n<section><div>\n        <h2>Best cycling shoes in 2021, as tested and rated by our expert reviewers</h2>\n<p>Here’s our full list of the best cycling shoes, as rated by our expert testers.

Shimano has <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/shimano-rc902/\">recently launched a new version</a> and, if it’s as good as the previous model featured here (the only shoe to score a full five stars), it’s one to seek out.</p>\n<p>Built around Shimano’s stiffest carbon sole, these are Tour de France proven race shoes. They’re not cheap, but we found the fit, performance and comfort to be seriously impressive. We think they look great too, and the electric blue is particularly lovely.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/shoes/road-bike-shoes/shimano-s-phyre-rc9-road-shoe-review/\">Read our review of the Shimano S-Phyre RC9 cycling shoes</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Boardman Carbon</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The sole has a decent front bumper and a replaceable heel bumper, virtually unheard of at this price.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudery / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><span>£80 as tested</span></li>\n<li><span>Great value</span></li>\n<li><span>Stiff soles and two dial adjustment</span></li>\n</ul><p><span>For £80, the Boardman Carbon shoes offer great features, including an all-carbon sole and twin Atop dial adjustment – a cheaper equivalent of the Boa system that works just as well.

This allows for a stiff, efficient pedalling platform without restricting the uppers at the sides of the shoe, like a traditional, flat sole.</p>\n<p>The upside of this design is an increased range of movement for your mid-foot and ankle, adding comfort without compromising performance. A choice of arch inserts adds an element of customisation.</p>\n<p>They’re only available in all black or white, so if you’re looking for something spicy, this might not be for you. Otherwise, they’re a pro-level shoe at a good price.</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/shoes/road-bike-shoes/giant-surge-pro-shoe-review/\">Read our review of the Giant Surge Pro cycling shoes</a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Sidi Wire 2</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Sidi’s Wire 2 shoes offer comfort and performance.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Sidi</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£330 as tested</li>\n<li>Excellent power transfer</li>\n<li>Comfortable fit</li>\n</ul><p>The Sidi Wire 2 shoes aren’t the lightest shoes on this list, at 660g for a size 45.5, but they look, fit and perform brilliantly – you’ll likely be very happy with a pair of these unless you’re a weight weenie.</p>\n<p>Our tester found them to have quite a narrow fit, but was able to easily find the right size by simply going a half size larger than usual, which is something not offered by many other brands.</p>\n<p>Sidi persists with its own closure dials, but these work just fine.

Look out for Mavic’s close fit though, you might want to go up half a size. </span></p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/shoes/road-bike-shoes/mavic-cosmic-boa-road-shoe-review/\"><span>Read our review of the Mavic Cosmic Boa cycling shoes</span></a></li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Northwave Revolution 2</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Northwave’s Revolution 2 shoes use a mix of materials on the sole.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudery / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li>£175 / $230 / €199.95 as tested</li>\n<li>Good mix of cleat stiffness with a little flex elsewhere</li>\n<li>Hi-viz option, Speedplay compatible</li>\n</ul><p>With a sole that’s mainly carbon-reinforced nylon and an all-carbon plate under the cleat, the Revolution 2 shoes mix sprint-level power transfer with a dose of comfort-inducing flex.

With that in mind, we’ve compiled a short buyer’s guide to help you get to grips with the basics.</p>\n<h3>Fit</h3>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Cycling shoes, like any other shoes, are built around what’s called a ‘Last’. This is essentially a mould, shaped like a foot, that brands use to shape their shoes.</p>\n<p>Every brand has a different last, based on their own fit philosophy. Finding a shape that works for you is obviously very important, but the only way to find out is really to try shoes on. So make sure you either go in to a shop in person or buy from an online retailer with a good returns policy.</p>\n<h3>Sole</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Carbon soles offer performance and efficient power transfer.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Alex Evans</i></span></div>\n<p>As with most things bike-related, carbon is the material du jour when looking at cycling shoe soles. It does make sense though; prized for its ability to be stiff yet lightweight, carbon really is an ideal material for making cycling shoe soles.</p>\n<p>The downside is, of course, cost. Entry-level shoes tend to use nylon or glass fibre composite soles in a bid to save money. These are likely to be slightly more flexible than full carbon soles, but will still be streets ahead of standard training shoes, so it’s certainly not a huge loss if your budget doesn’t stretch to carbon.</p>\n<h3>Closure system</h3>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Boa dial is a popular closing mechanism for cycling shoes, alongside the more classic velcro.</span></figcaption><span> <i>David Caudery / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>There are three main closure systems in use today. The most popular are Velcro straps or wire laces with micro-adjustable dials (Boa and similar).</p>\n<p>Occasionally you even get a combination of both. Velcro straps have the advantage of being cheap, effective and easy to use, so you’ll often find these on lower-end shoes. On higher-end shoes, Boa and other similar dial systems tend to dominate due to their ability to precisely control fit.</p>\n<p>Traditional laces have also had a bit of a renaissance in the last few years, so if you like a classic look you’ll have a few more options now, just remember you won’t be able to adjust your shoes on the bike.</p>\n<h3>Other features</h3>\n<p>It’s always worth considering what type of riding your shoes are designed for. A lot of road cycling shoes are designed to be ridden in hot weather, for example, meaning they’re very breathable and won’t offer much protection from the elements.</p>\n<p>If you live somewhere where the weather is invariably cold and wet, it’s worth considering if those sorts of shoes are really the right choice or if you’d be better off with something more robust.</p>","author":"Simon Bromley","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"d21c1e32cd7af17faa3329ec7c8c5e416814c0fbfc0d535b7875ff02c9430787","category":"Cycling"}
