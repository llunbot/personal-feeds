But what makes this flight truly special is that <em>Perseverance</em> was able to track the helicopter's takeoff and flight.</p>\n<p>Imagery from this flight was only recently relayed back to Earth, and the Mars rover team at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory has compiled the data into a video showing nearly the entire flight. This footage offers by far the best view we've ever seen of <em>Ingenuity</em> flying across the surface of Mars.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1814298#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1814298&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1a98f4fc5bb5833f8a2f5707031ae308c4b2d0e6296c5df8d1238e3b79add7c7","category":"Tech"}
