Small games that aren't currently selling get abandoned, and compatibility issues arise as technology moves forward or as one-off development ideas age like milk.</p>\n<p>Classic games are only 20 percent of GOG's catalog, and the firm hasn't actually called itself \"Good Old Games\" in 12 years. And yet, today, GOG announces that it is making \"a significant commitment of resources\" toward a new GOG Preservation Program. It starts with 100 games for which GOG's own developers are working to create current and future compatibility, keeping them DRM-free and giving them ongoing tech support, along with granting them a \"Good Old Game: Preserved by GOG\" stamp.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-13-at-10.47.07%E2%80%AFAM.png\"><img width=\"1674\" height=\"1042\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-13-at-10.47.07%E2%80%AFAM.png\" alt=\"Selection of games available in GOG's &quot;Preserved&quot; program, including System Shock 2, Fallout, Diablo, RollerCoaster Tycoon, Resident Evil 2.\" loading=\"lazy\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-13-at-10.47.07 AM.png 1674w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-13-at-10.47.07 AM-640x398.png 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-13-at-10.47.07 AM-1024x637.png 1024w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-13-at-10.47.07 AM-768x478.png 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-13-at-10.47.07 AM-1536x956.png 1536w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-13-at-10.47.07 AM-980x610.png 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-13-at-10.47.07 AM-1440x896.png 1440w\" />\n        Credit:\n          GOG\n      </a></p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/gogs-preservation-program-is-the-drm-free-store-refocusing-on-the-classics/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/gogs-preservation-program-is-the-drm-free-store-refocusing-on-the-classics/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"965a45f9fb602c372c0446c3214babd51554b53241194447e2ac8aed25f1347c","category":"Tech"}
