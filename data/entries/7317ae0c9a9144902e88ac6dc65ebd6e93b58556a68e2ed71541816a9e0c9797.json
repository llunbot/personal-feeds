{"title":"Qualcomm Announces Renewed Deal With Apple for 5G Modems","link":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-09-11/apple-aapl-renews-qualcomm-qcom-deal-in-sign-its-own-modem-chip-isn-t-ready","date":1694447645000,"content":"\n<p>Ian King and Mark Gurman, reporting for Bloomberg:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple Inc. is extending an agreement to get modem semiconductors\nfrom Qualcomm Inc. for three more years, a sign that its ambitious\neffort to design the chips in-house is taking longer than\nexpected. Qualcomm shares surged on the news.</p>\n\n<p>The new pact will cover “smartphone launches in 2024, 2025 and\n2026,” Qualcomm said in a statement Monday. The companies’\nagreement had been set to end this year, and the latest iPhone — due on Tuesday — was expected to be one of the last to rely on\nthe Qualcomm modem chip. […]</p>\n\n<p>“This agreement reinforces Qualcomm’s track record of sustained\nleadership across 5G technologies and products,” the San\nDiego-based chipmaker said. Though the financial terms of the new\ndeal weren’t disclosed, Qualcomm said it was similar to the\nprevious arrangement signed in 2019.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Funny how they announced this today, and even funnier that there’s no quote from anyone at Apple. Qualcomm, seemingly, has Apple over the barrel on these 5G modems. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Keep in mind that Apple has been trying to build its own 5G modems for years now. Back in 2019 <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/07/25/apple-intel\">they bought Intel’s modem business</a> — the same year <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2019/04/16/apple-qualcomm-settlement/\">they settled (effectively, losing) a lawsuit with Qualcomm</a>. And then there was <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2023/07/11/qualcomm-is-harassing-apple/\">this story over the summer</a>, where Apple accused Qualcomm of harassing Apple executives by subpoenaing them for a lawsuit filed by the FTC. These two companies do not like each other.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/11/qualcomm-apple-5g\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"7317ae0c9a9144902e88ac6dc65ebd6e93b58556a68e2ed71541816a9e0c9797","category":"Tech"}
