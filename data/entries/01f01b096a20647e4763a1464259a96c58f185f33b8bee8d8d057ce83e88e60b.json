You can use it on Apple products as well as PCs, Android, Sonos, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/232243/apple-music-alexa-amazon-echo-default-service.html\">Amazon Alexa</a>, PlayStation and other devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are various subscription tiers, including a cheaper price for students.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://music.apple.com/deeplink?app=music&amp;p=subscribe-student&amp;at=1000l4QJ&amp;ct=405&amp;itscg=10000&amp;itsct=405x\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Music Student</a>: $5.99/£5.99 a month</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://music.apple.com/deeplink\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Music Individual</a>: $10.99/£10.99 a month (was $9.99/£9.99 until October 2022)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://music.apple.com/deeplink\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Music Family</a>: $16.99/£16.99 a month (was $14.99/£14.99 until October 2022)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-one/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple One</a>: From $19.95/£18.95 a month (includes Apple Music, Apple Arcade, 50GB iCloud+, and Apple TV+ and might represent a saving if you were already paying for any of those other services.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The cheaper <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678309/apple-music-voice-plan-vs-apple-music-the-differences.html\">Apple Music Voice Plan</a> (which cost half the price of the standard Apple Music plan at $4.99/£4.99 a month) has been discontinued.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, you don’t have to pay that much. Apple offers various trials – including a one-month free trial, but there are ways to get up to six months free with certain purchases. Apple also makes trials or discounts available to lapsed subscribers from time to time.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>Updated August 20, 2024:</strong> Apple has a summer promotion. From August 7 to September 23 you can get three free months of Apple Music. It is for new subscribers only, as usual, and must be redeemed on an iPhone, iPad, or Mac. <a href=\"https://offers.applemusic.apple/2024-three-month-offer\">GET THREE FREE MONTHS OF APPLE MUSIC HERE</a>. </em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple-owned Shazam also offers trials including <a href=\"https://www.shazam.com/gb/applemusic\" target=\"_blank\">two months for free</a> and the ability to gift a <a href=\"https://offer.shazam.apple.com/sharewithafriend\">three-month Apple Music trial to friends</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Find out what Apple Music trials are available and how to get Apple Music for free in this article.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus if you are a student you can <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/674847/students-can-get-apple-tv-free-with-half-price-apple-music.html\">get Apple Music for half price</a>, a deal that includes <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673723/how-to-get-apple-tv-plus-free.html\">Apple TV+ for free</a>!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Is Apple Music free?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike <a href=\"https://www.spotify.com\" target=\"_blank\">Spotify</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/music/free\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon Music</a>, there isn’t a free, ad-supported Apple Music tier. The closest option was Apple Music Voice, which was a cut-price, cut-down version of the music streaming service that didn’t allow you to download tracks or create your own playlists. But Apple ditched Apple Music Voice, two years after it was introduced, in November 2023. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, you can get Apple Music for free for a limited time if you take advantage of the many trials on offer from Apple and its partners. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apple Music free trial</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple offers a one-month free Apple Music trial to new users, but you can find trials that extend that period, including six months Apple Music for free if you buy AirPods, a HomePod or Beats headphones.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s partners and subsidiaries, such as Shazam, also offer Apple Music trials of various lengths. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read on for details of the best Apple Music trials we’ve seen, including how to get Apple Music for free for longer than the standard one-month trial and how to get a free trial of Apple Music if you have previously had a trial and/or subscribed to Apple Music. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don’t want to pay for Apple Music once your trial is over you must make sure to cancel your subscription before it automatically renews. It’s easy to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/231231/how-to-cancel-a-subscription-on-ios.html\">cancel a subscription on iPhone, iPad or Mac</a>, just follow these steps: </p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>On an iPhone just go to Settings and click on the section at the top with your Apple ID. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Tap on Subscriptions find the one you want to cancel and tap on it. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Then tap on Cancel Subscription. </li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apple’s summer promotion: Three months free</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has kicked off a summer promotion, from August 7 to September 23, where you can get three months of Apple Music free, no purchase necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll have to be a new subscriber (that’s how these deals always seem to work) and you’ll have to redeem it on an iPhone, iPad, or Mac running the latest software. Just open the Music app and the offer should appear; if it does not, navigate to the Home tab where you should see it.</p>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://offers.applemusic.apple/2024-three-month-offer\" target=\"_blank\">Get Apple music for three months free</a></div>\n\n\n<h2>How to get Apple Music for one month free</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve never tried Apple Music before you’ll be able to get one month free of charge, with no catch and no questions asked. Prior to February 2022, the length of this trial was three months though, so this trial period is not quite as good as it once was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get the one-month free Apple Music trial visit Apple’s website via the links below and choose ‘Try 1 one month free’ in the top right corner, or click ‘Try it free’ on the relevant plan (just about halfway down the page).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>U.S. customers:</strong></p>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-music/\" target=\"_blank\">Get Apple Music free for one month with Apple</a></div>\n\n\n<p><strong>U.K. customers:</strong></p>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/apple-music/\" target=\"_blank\">Get Apple Music free for one month with Apple</a></div>\n\n\n<h2>How to get Apple Music free for 6 months</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Want more than a month? You can get Apple Music free for six months if you buy a qualifying Apple product. Apple offers six months free to new Apple Music users who buy AirPods, a HomePod mini or Beats headphones. You do need to be a new subscriber to Apple Music though. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following devices are eligible as per <a href=\"https://offers.applemusic.apple/six-month-offer\">Apple’s terms and conditions</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>AirPods Pro </li>\n\n\n\n<li>AirPods (2nd and 3rd generation)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>AirPods Max</li>\n\n\n\n<li>HomePod</li>\n\n\n\n<li>HomePod mini</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Beats Fit Pro</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Beats Studio Buds</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Powerbeats</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Powerbeats Pro</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Beats Solo Pro</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Beats Studio Buds +</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Beats Studio Pro </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have bought one of these eligible devices you can qualify, as long as you haven’t previously subscribed to Apple Music and as long as the device has been paired with your iPhone or iPad for less than 90 days. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To qualify for the free six-month trial you need to sign up within 90 days of first pairing your qualifying audio device with an iPhone or iPad that is running the latest iOS or iPadOS. So if you’ve been using your HomePod with your Apple ID for more than 90 days you won’t be able to take advantage–unless you switched your HomePod to a different Apple ID… </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>U.S. customers:</strong></p>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://offers.applemusic.apple/six-month-offer\" target=\"_blank\">Get Apple Music free for six months with Apple U.S.</a></div>\n\n\n<p><strong>U.K. customers:</strong></p>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://offers.applemusic.apple/en-gb/six-month-offer\" target=\"_blank\">Get Apple Music free for six months with Apple U.K.</a></div>\n\n\n<p>To get Apple’s six-month trial of Apple Music follow these steps: </p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Update your iPhone or iPad to the latest version of iOS/iPadOS. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Pair your AirPods, HomePods or Beats headphones with you iPhone or iPad. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Open Apple Music on the iPhone or iPad. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sign in with your Apple ID. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>You should see details of the offer, if you don’t click on Listen Now.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to get Apple Music free with Shazam</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not only Apple that is offering a trial of Apple Music.

But there is a trick to getting an extra three months: start using Family Sharing via another user and switch to the Apple Music Family Sharing plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re happy to use Family Sharing, you could get another member of your family to sign up for the free trial of the Apple Music Family Sharing plan, and then share that with you. You’ll then be able to take advantage of an extra three months for free. In fact, it can be shared between up to six people so you could share the free trial with other family members too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a separate article with more information about \n<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671350/how-to-set-up-family-sharing-on-ipad-iphone-mac.html\" target=\"_blank\">Family Sharing and how to set it up.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Top Tip: Just want Apple Music for a short period of time?
