A VPN can keep your online activity anonymous and secure, as well as being able to provide access to geo-blocked content. The downside is there’s no one-step solution for using a VPN on an Apple TV like with iOS and macOS devices. But don’t worry, there is still a way – here, we show you how to set up and use a VPN on the Apple TV.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve exhausted all your local Netflix has to offer, you may want to consider watching content from other regions on your Apple TV. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not just Netflix, either, with a whole host of apps offering new content in different regions, and while setting up a VPN on your iPhone or Mac has always been relatively straightforward, it wasn’t until tvOS 17 arrived that it’s been much easier to do on your Apple TV hardware, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Letting you circumnavigate content blockers, we’ve been working on our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/231047/best-vpn-for-mac.html\">roundup of the best VPN services</a> for a while, but this guide will help you get them running on your Apple TV box. It’s worth stressing that we’re not looking to ensure your network activity is anonymous in this instance – while that is a common purpose of VPNs, it’s an added bonus in this instance as we’re primarily working with streaming services.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to set up an Apple TV VPN</h2>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div><span>1.</span>\n<h3>Open the App Store on your Apple TV</h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/App-Store-on-Apple-TV.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"App Store on Apple TV\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>You’ll need to be running tvOS 17 or later.
