It arrived in the <em>Cyclist</em> office just like me – brand new, unproven and some months before we’d even sent the first issue of <em>Cyclist</em> to the printers. It was a pre-production frameset for a bike that would become a stalwart of the SwiftCarbon range: the Ultravox. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bloke who brought it in and sat me down to explain it was Swift’s founder, Mark Blewett, a South African ex-pro who had upped sticks to China to live by the factory that was making his frames.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blewett was my baptism into the ways of Far East manufacturing, opening my eyes to the fact that behind most bike brands stood a slew of ‘gun for hire’ Chinese factories. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These ‘vendors’ produced overseas designs using expertise, materials and machines that the West could only dream of. Blewett’s rationale of being so close to the action was to exploit such talents while ensuring quality control and quick decisions.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n

frame was one of the first results and bore all the hallmarks of cutting-edge 2012 design: boxy down tube and chainstays for stiffness, skinny seatstays for comfort, bladed fork for aero gains, 28mm absolute max tyre clearance and a racer’s geometry. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hinting at its pre-production ways, it also had a bonded alloy sleeve in the PF30 BB instead of moulded carbon, and graphics that didn’t quite line up. Look at this bike’s head tube and fork and you’ll see it’s actually the Swiift.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Big day out</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/james-spender-swift-ultravox-03-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"James Spender's Swift Ultravox\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/james-spender-swift-ultravox-03-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/james-spender-swift-ultravox-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/james-spender-swift-ultravox-03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/james-spender-swift-ultravox-03-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/james-spender-swift-ultravox-03-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/james-spender-swift-ultravox-03-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/james-spender-swift-ultravox-03-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/james-spender-swift-ultravox-03-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/james-spender-swift-ultravox-03.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Joseph Branston / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>At Blewett’s invitation I built the Ultravox frameset up with a Sram Red groupset and some Reynolds R32 wheels to ride it at the Cape Rouleur sportive in his native South Africa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By today’s standards a mechanical rim brake groupset and a pair of skinny carbon wheels (the R32’s internal width was a mere 17mm) sound positively antique, but at the time my mind was blown.

But it weighed just 1,741g (claimed), which as far as I’m aware makes it the lightest groupset ever produced. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, the Reynolds wheels would be competitive even now, weighing just 1,351g (claimed) – no mean feat given carbon wheels back then needed lots of extra material in the brake track so they didn’t just melt. You kids with your disc brake wheels don’t know you’re born.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/james-spender-swift-ultravox-05-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"James Spender's Swift Ultravox\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/james-spender-swift-ultravox-05-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/james-spender-swift-ultravox-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/james-spender-swift-ultravox-05-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/james-spender-swift-ultravox-05-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/james-spender-swift-ultravox-05-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/james-spender-swift-ultravox-05-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/james-spender-swift-ultravox-05-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/james-spender-swift-ultravox-05-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/james-spender-swift-ultravox-05.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Joseph Branston / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>On my first ride out in South Africa, I beat Stephen Roche in the Cape Rouleur’s time-trial.

I mean, look, you can see the bloody cables. But I still love it and ride it when I can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For starters the Ultravox weighs less than most bikes I test today. This is a size medium and weighs a mere 6.93kg. The 1,266g DT Swiss Mon Chasseral wheels and Veloflex tubeless tyres (a snip at just 255g) help, but otherwise this is a basic bike and one that was not ever considered top tier. The frame weighs a claimed 950g and the frameset cost a middle-of-the-road £2,150 in 2012.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/james-spender-swift-ultravox-06-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"James Spender's Swift Ultravox\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/james-spender-swift-ultravox-06-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/james-spender-swift-ultravox-06-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/james-spender-swift-ultravox-06-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/james-spender-swift-ultravox-06-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/james-spender-swift-ultravox-06-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/james-spender-swift-ultravox-06-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/james-spender-swift-ultravox-06-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/james-spender-swift-ultravox-06.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Joseph Branston / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Weight aside, what endears the Ultravox to me is its ride feel. It is stiff and agile, feeling highly chuck-able thanks to short 410mm chainstays and 987mm wheelbase, yet stable enough owing to a longish 61mm trail. Interestingly, these are all figures that disc brake bikes struggled to return to after early disc brake placement played havoc with things such as chainstay length (430mm anyone?).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a reason I’ve ridden the Ultravox so much I’ve had to replace the jockey wheels and the headset and the BB many times over: I just love it. It has been all over the world with me and has never let me down.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>James’s Swift ‘classic’ racer specs</h2>\n\n\n\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n\t<td>Frameset:</td><td>Swift Ultravox RS-1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td>Groupset:</td><td>SRAM Red 22</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td>Power meter:</td><td>Verve InfoCrank</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td>Wheels:</td><td>DT Swiss Mon Chasseral</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td>Handlebars:</td><td>Easton E100</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td>Stem:</td><td>Zipp SL Speed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td>Seatpost:</td><td>Zipp SL Speed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td>Saddle:</td><td>Pro Stealth Team</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td>Tyres:</td><td>Veloflex Race TLR 25mm</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n\t<td>Bar tape:</td><td>Cinelli Leather</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>• This article originally appeared in issue 152 of Cyclist magazine. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to </a><a href=\"https://store.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\">subscribe</a></em></strong></p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/adrian-hogan-feather-custom-bike\">What we ride: Adrian’s custom Feather all-road bike</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/bicycles-by-design-framebuilding-course-custom-bike\">What We Ride: James’s handbuilt (by him) custom Cyclist Thread race bike</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cinelli-laser-custom-road-bike\">What We Ride: James’s Cinelli Laser dream road bike</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-road-bike\">Best road bikes: Best bikes from under £1,000 to over £10,000</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/james-spender-swift-ultravox\">What we ride: James’s Swift ‘classic’ racer</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Martin James","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"77a9e1a660bab35563321418a1fca78b26700b89f34fc46d6494cfaa5c7fabe1","category":"Cycling"}
