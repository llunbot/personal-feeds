Made by the same company that builds highly capable electric <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/09/rivians-67-500-314-mile-electric-adventure-truck-put-to-the-test/\">trucks</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/07/rivians-r1s-is-an-electric-suv-for-those-with-an-adventurous-lifestyle/\">SUVs</a> for the affluent tech crowd, Rivian has now built more than 5,000 delivery vans for the online retailing giant. The vans have delivered more than 150 million packages to date.</p>\n<p>Amazon and Rivian <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/02/electric-truck-startup-announces-700-million-funding-round-led-by-amazon/\">made news together in 2019</a> when the former led a $700 million investment round into the EV startup. A few months later, Amazon announced <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/09/amazon-orders-100000-electric-trucks-to-fight-climate-change/\">an order of 100,000 electric vans from Rivian</a>. At the time, Amazon's then-CEO Jeff Bezos said all 100,000 vehicles would be deployed by 2024â€”a timeline that even pre-pandemic appeared extremely optimistic; the official press release gave a more circumspect 2030 deadline. The vans <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/02/amazon-begins-delivering-packages-with-prototype-electric-trucks/\">began delivering packages in 2021</a>.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Amazon-EDV18-scaled.jpg\"><img alt=\"No, I don't think it has Apple CarPlay.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Amazon-EDV18-980x654.jpg\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Amazon-EDV18-scaled.jpg\">No, I don't think it has Apple CarPlay.</a> (credit: Amazon)</p></div>\n<p>Like the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/04/our-first-impressions-after-driving-fedexs-new-electric-delivery-van/\">BrightDrop Zevo 600</a>, the Rivian van is a clean-sheet design, optimized specifically for Amazon's logistics workflow. It's equipped with a full suite of advanced driver assistance systems, and the cab design minimizes blind spots. It even has a charming appearance, much like Rivian's R1 series, thanks to friendly round daytime running lights.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1952117#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1952117&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
