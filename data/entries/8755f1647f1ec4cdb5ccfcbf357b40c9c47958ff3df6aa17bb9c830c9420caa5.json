Today, there are new G3 Hubs in stock and ready to roll, so to speak. Project321 is actively seeking to partner with new dealers, distributors as well OEM opportunities. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-new-facility.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"482\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-new-facility.jpeg\" alt=\"Project321 G3 Hub Launch new facility\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-new-facility.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-new-facility-297x112.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-new-facility-120x45.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-new-facility-768x289.jpeg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>New facility. (Photo/Project321) </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new G3 Hub is Project321’s first product launch after being acquired and <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/project-321-relocates-to-canada-new-g3-hubs/\" target=\"_blank\">relocated to Canada</a>. Although the G3 Hubs are built on the shoulders of the prior G2 hubs, the G2 hub has officially been discontinued and is no longer for sale. Warranties will continue to be honored as well as service and spare parts. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Meet the New G3 Hubs</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Engagement</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The G3 Hubs will be using the same 72-tooth drive ring and three-step magnetically actuated pawls as their proven G2 hubs. Adding two additional pawls increases engagement. They added the two pawls instead of miniaturizing the teeth on the drive ring and pawls, which would have compromised reliability. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-drivering-cutaway.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"854\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-drivering-cutaway.jpeg\" alt=\"Project321 G3 Hub Launch drivering cutaway\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-drivering-cutaway.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-drivering-cutaway-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-drivering-cutaway-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-drivering-cutaway-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-drivering-cutaway-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-drivering-cutaway-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a total of eight pawls that work in teams of two, to give 1.25° or 288 points of engagement. Project321 believes this gives riders the “ideal balance of instant engagement and rock-solid reliability.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Poject321 M-Pulse</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-m-pulse-pawls.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-m-pulse-pawls.jpeg\" alt=\"Project321 G3 Hub Launch m-pulse pawls\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-m-pulse-pawls.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-m-pulse-pawls-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-m-pulse-pawls-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-m-pulse-pawls-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-m-pulse-pawls-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-m-pulse-pawls-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>M-Pulse technology features pawls that are magnetically activated and designed to keep drag to a minimum while coasting. Another benefit to the system is there are fewer moving parts, without easy-to-lose springs come maintenance time. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>6-Lock</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The 6-Lock tech is a new technology by Project321. 6-lock is a clever six-bolt design that features stainless steel bolt threads. It requires no lockring, just the T25 Torx hardware giving the rider true six-bolt rotor retention. The 6-Lock easily converts to a center lock application giving the rider total freedom when choosing rotors. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-clever-6-bolt-system.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"863\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-clever-6-bolt-system.jpeg\" alt=\"Project321 G3 Hub Launch clever 6-bolt system\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-clever-6-bolt-system.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-clever-6-bolt-system-297x200.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-clever-6-bolt-system-120x81.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-clever-6-bolt-system-768x518.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The way it works is with a stainless steel collet that locks into the channel behind the splines on a center lock brake mount. Stainless steel is said to eliminate the risk of stripping and significantly improve bolt retention. A 7075 aluminum flange fits over the collet to support it while locking it onto the canter lock splines. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-rotor-cutaway.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-rotor-cutaway.jpeg\" alt=\"Project321 G3 Hub Launch rotor cutaway\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-rotor-cutaway.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-rotor-cutaway-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-rotor-cutaway-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-rotor-cutaway-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-rotor-cutaway-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-rotor-cutaway-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This system provides a strong brake mount interface for any six-bolt rotors and adds redundancy as it is completely modular. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Axle and Bearing Layout</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The new G3 Hub’s internal architecture has been updated as well showcasing an entirely new axle and bearing layout. The new design features two double-row bearings that provide additional support at the axle’s highest stress point. The hope is to make broken axles a thing of the past. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-Hub-and-bearing-cutaway.jpeg\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-Hub-and-bearing-cutaway.jpeg\" alt=\"Project321 G3 Hub Launch Hub and bearing cutaway\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-Hub-and-bearing-cutaway.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-Hub-and-bearing-cutaway-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-Hub-and-bearing-cutaway-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-Hub-and-bearing-cutaway-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-Hub-and-bearing-cutaway-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-Hub-and-bearing-cutaway-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>G3 axles are fully anodized 7075 aluminum that maintains the preload adjustment of the rear hub, allowing for perfect bearing preload. Project321 is so confident in their axle design, that they are offering a 10-year warranty on them. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sealing</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Project321’s new G3 Hubs have the most robust sealing system yet, which was developed with Stan’s during the development of Stan’s M-Pulse hubs. The system has a low-drag, light-contact rubber seal that is pressed into the hub shell, and an aluminum dust shield pressed on the the drive body. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-seal-system-e1712258918296.jpeg\"><img width=\"851\" height=\"878\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-seal-system-e1712258918296.jpeg\" alt=\"Project321 G3 Hub Launch seal system\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-seal-system-e1712258918296.jpeg 851w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-seal-system-e1712258918296-291x300.jpeg 291w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-seal-system-e1712258918296-116x120.jpeg 116w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-seal-system-e1712258918296-768x792.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This improved two-piece system keeps the oil in and the contaminants out. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>G3 Hub Colors, Sizes, Weights, and Price</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-mix-and-match-colors-e1712258974607.jpeg\"><img width=\"851\" height=\"836\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-mix-and-match-colors-e1712258974607.jpeg\" alt=\"Project321 G3 Hub Launch mix and match colors\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-mix-and-match-colors-e1712258974607.jpeg 851w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-mix-and-match-colors-e1712258974607-297x292.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-mix-and-match-colors-e1712258974607-120x118.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Project321-G3-Hub-Launch-mix-and-match-colors-e1712258974607-768x754.jpeg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>G3 Hubs will be available in 12 colors.
