From there, an animation directs you to bring the Apple Watch next to another Apple Watch or next to the top of an ‌iPhone‌ to initiate the contact information transfer.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNameDrop was introduced in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, but it did not make it into the initial <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/\">watchOS 10</a> release. Apple has instead added it in this beta to make exchanging contact information simpler. NameDrop is part of AirDrop, and it sends out your Contact Poster, name, and phone number when you use it.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/watchos-10-namedrop.jpg\" alt width=\"1118\" height=\"430\" />\r<br />\nNameDrop requires two iPhones running ‌iOS 17‌, two Apple Watches running watchOS 10.1, or an ‌iPhone‌ running ‌iOS 17‌ and an Apple Watch running watchOS 10.1.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere are also signs of the new Double Tap feature <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 9</a> and Ultra 2 feature in the watchOS 10.1 code, but the function is not enabled and Double Tap remains inaccessible for now.<code><div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/\">watchOS 10</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-programming.135\">Apple Programming</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/watchos-10-1-beta-namedrop-apple-watch/\">watchOS 10.1 Beta Brings NameDrop to Apple Watch</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/watchos-10-1-beta-brings-namedrop-to-apple-watch.2405136/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /></code>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8853b4d91206134cff53a5447bbb802648687bd3e2157b3eb0e110aa53164a10","category":"Apple"}
