{"title":"Owner Patrick Soon-Shiong Is Tanking the LA Times’s Credibility","link":"https://www.status.news/p/los-angeles-times-patrick-soon-shiong","date":1733448241000,"content":"\n<p>Oliver Darcy, in a well-sourced report at Status (paywalled, alas, but with a preview of the article if you sign up for the free version of his newsletter, which I agree is sort of a “<em>Yeah, no thanks</em>” offer):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Patrick Soon-Shiong is tightening his grip over the Los Angeles\nTimes. The MAGA-curious owner, who drew controversy when he\nblocked the newspaper’s planned endorsement of Kamala Harris,\nhas waded further into its operations since the November\nelection, according to new information I have learned and public\nremarks the billionaire made Wednesday during a media appearance\nwith right-wing personality Scott Jennings. [...] Several\nveteran staffers told me that morale has never been lower, with\nsome people even wondering whether the newspaper will be\ndisfigured beyond recognition under this new era of\nSoon-Shiong’s reign. [...]</p>\n\n<p>One disturbing example came after the newspaper <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2024-11-06/elon-musk-donald-trump-tesla-spacex\">published an\nopinion piece</a> in November about Elon Musk that Soon-Shiong\ndid not care for, people familiar with the matter told me. The\npiece, written by Times opinion contributor Virginia Heffernan,\ncarried the headline, “Elon Musk bought himself a starring role in\nTrump’s second term. What could go wrong?”</p>\n\n<p>While the headline seemed innocuous, Soon-Shiong expressed dismay\nover it, according to the people familiar with the matter. The\nheadline was allowed to remain unchanged. But, as a result, the\npeople said, a new rule was put into place: Prior to publishing\nopinion stories, the headlines <em>must</em> be emailed over to\nSoon-Shiong, where he can then choose to weigh in. While it is\nnormal for newspaper owners to influence the opinion wing of a\nnewspaper, it is <em>highly unusual</em> for an owner to have article\nheadlines sent to them ahead of publication for review.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That also seems like a lot of work for a busy billionaire. Wonder how he might handle that?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Speaking to Jennings as the latter hosted a radio show Wednesday,\nthe billionaire revealed that, behind the scenes, he is working on\ndeveloping a “bias meter” powered by artificial intelligence that\nwill be placed on both opinion <em>and</em> news stories. Soon-Shiong\nsaid that the hope is to roll out the new feature, which will use\nthe technology to seemingly warn readers that his own reporters\nare biased, as early as next month. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Suffice to say, but when the journalists at the Times heard the\n“breaking news” that Soon-Shiong delivered to Jennings, they\nspiraled even further. “People are now deeply fucking concerned,”\none staffer bluntly told me Wednesday night.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What could go wrong?</p>\n\n<p>In response, <a href=\"https://latguild.com/news/2024/12/5/lat-guild-statement-our-commitment-to-journalistic-integrity\">the LAT Guild issued a statement</a>, concluding:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The statements of Dr. Soon-Shiong in the press and on social media\nreflect his own opinions and do not shape reporting by our\nmember-journalists.</p>\n\n<p>Our members — and all Times staffers — abide by a strict set of\n<a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/local/readers-rep/la-rr-la-times-updates-newsroom-ethics-guidelines-20140618-story.html\">ethics guidelines</a>, which call for fairness, precision,\ntransparency, vigilance against bias, and an earnest search to\nunderstand all sides of an issue. Those longstanding principles\nwill continue guiding our work.</p>\n\n<p>The Guild has secured strong ethics protections for our members,\nincluding the right to withhold one’s byline, and we will firmly\nguard against any effort to improperly or unfairly alter our\nreporting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/05/owner-patrick-soon-shiong-is-tanking-the-la-times\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d7ff5c567b344b3c6279a2f8d99a6288b4dd7a38eda612f7b3451889a17b6e1e","category":"Tech"}
