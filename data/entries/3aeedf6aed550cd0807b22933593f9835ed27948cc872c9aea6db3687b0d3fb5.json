The first Qi2-certified chargers are expected to be available in time for the 2023 holiday season, according to the Wireless Power Consortium.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/10/magsafecasedangle.jpg\" alt width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" />\r<br />\nQi2 is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/03/qi2-wireless-charging-standard-gains-magsafe/\">based on Apple's MagSafe standard</a>, meaning that Qi2 chargers will likely be able to charge iPhone 15 models at up to 15W speeds like Apple's MagSafe Charger. With current iPhones, non-MagSafe wireless chargers are limited to 7.5W speeds.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>ChargerLAB</em> notes that Qi2 chargers do not need to use Apple's pricy MagSafe module, and are not required to be certified under Apple's \"Made for iPhone\" program, which will bring more affordable MagSafe-like chargers to the market. The website confirmed with supply chain sources that the wholesale price of Apple's MagSafe module is about $16, while the Qi2 module apparently costs less than one third as much.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>ChargerLAB</em> and its Chinese sister website <a href=\"https://www.chongdiantou.com/archives/231382.html\"><em>Chongdiantou</em></a> appear to be the source behind the rumor from earlier this week claiming that iPhone 15 models will <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/24/iphone-15-15w-wireless-fast-charging-non-certified/\">support 15W charging with third-party chargers</a>. The websites have leaked several accurate charging-related details about future iPhones and Apple power adapters in the past.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to launch the iPhone 15 lineup in September. MagSafe is expected to remain supported on the devices alongside Qi2.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/chargerlab/\">ChargerLab</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/25/iphone-15-expected-to-support-qi2/\">iPhone 15 Expected to Support Both Qi2 and MagSafe Wireless Charging With Up to 15W Speeds</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-expected-to-support-both-qi2-and-magsafe-wireless-charging-with-up-to-15w-speeds.2390510/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3aeedf6aed550cd0807b22933593f9835ed27948cc872c9aea6db3687b0d3fb5","category":"Apple"}
