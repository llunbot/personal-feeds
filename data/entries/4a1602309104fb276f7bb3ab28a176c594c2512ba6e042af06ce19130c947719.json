Based on searches on <a href=\"https://pepy.tech/\">https://pepy.tech</a>, a site that provides download stats for Python packages, the researchers estimate the malicious packages were downloaded about 30,000 times.</p>\n<h2>Systemic threat</h2>\n<p>The discovery is the latest in a long line of attacks in recent years that abuse the receptivity of open source repositories, which millions of software developers rely on daily. Despite their crucial role, repositories often lack robust security and vetting controls, a weakness that has the potential to cause serious supply chain attacks when developers unknowingly infect themselves or fold malicious code into the software they publish.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1784124#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1784124&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4a1602309104fb276f7bb3ab28a176c594c2512ba6e042af06ce19130c947719","category":"Tech"}
