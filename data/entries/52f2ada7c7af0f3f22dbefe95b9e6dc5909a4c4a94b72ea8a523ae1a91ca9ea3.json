There isn't an employee at Sonos who isn't pained by having let you down, and I assure you that fixing the app for all of our customers and partners has been and continues to be our number one priority.</blockquote>Spence shared an outline of future feature plans, with Sonos planning to push updates on a bi-weekly basis. Alarms are set to be addressed in September, with edit mode for playlists and the queue coming in September or October.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<strong>July and August:</strong>\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n \t<li>Improving the stability when adding new products</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Implementing Music Library configuration, browse, search, and play</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\n<strong>August and September:</strong>\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n \t<li>Improving Volume responsiveness</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>User interface improvements based on customer feedback</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Improving overall system stability and error handling</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\n<strong>September:</strong>\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n \t<li>Improving Alarm consistency and reliability</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\n<strong>September and October:</strong>\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n \t<li>Restoring edit mode for Playlists and the Queue</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Improving functionality in settings</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\nSpence says that Sonos is working hard to earn back customer trust through the continual app improvements.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSonos in May <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/redesigned-sonos-app/\">released its redesigned app</a> with customizable home screen and a more personalized listening service.
