Apple has since expanded support, and it is available for Safari on Mac, Safari on ‌iPhone‌ and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, and also Edge, Chrome, and Firefox on Macs, PCs, and mobile devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's possible that ‌Apple Maps‌ on the web support for ‌iPhone‌ was tied to iOS 18.4 and the option that allows EU users to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/12/ios-18-4-new-setting/\">select a new default mapping app</a>. With a different Maps app set, ‌Apple Maps‌ links that an EU user receives are still be able to be opened via the ‌Apple Maps‌ website.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/09/maps-on-web-iphone/\">Apple Adds Maps on the Web Support to iPhone</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-adds-maps-on-the-web-support-to-iphone.2455026/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"867a1dce786a790e3666403489a9fa964dee7d795a104323f6bdca41bb0d1569","category":"Apple"}
