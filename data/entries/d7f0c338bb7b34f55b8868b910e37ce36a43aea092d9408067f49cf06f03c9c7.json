They’re often the least expensive entry point into ebikes.</p>\n<p>With lots of mounting points for accessories such as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-pannier-bags/\">pannier bags</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mudguards-fenders-a-buyers-guide/\">mudguards</a>, electric hybrids are great if you’re planning to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/cycling-to-work-guide/\">commute to work</a> by bike, ride around town or want to go for leisurely rides on bike trails or through parks.</p>\n<p>Electric hybrid bikes can be quite heavy because they tend to use less sophisticated motor systems and the bikes are built for robustness. This is worth bearing in mind if you need to carry them up stairs.</p>\n<p>Below is a selection of four of the very best electric hybrid bikes as tested by our <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/author/warrenrossiter/\">senior road technical editor, Warren Rossiter</a>.

Whereas the standard <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/electric-bikes/specialized-turbo-vado-4-0-review/\">Turbo Vado</a> is a heavy-duty ebike, the Vado SL uses a less powerful motor with 35Nm of torque. This reduces the weight to under 15kg, but the flip side is that you have less assistance than with the Turbo Vado, which could be a problem on hills.</p>\n<p>The other advantage of the lower output is clean looks, with the concealed battery giving a sporty appearance.

It’s a good position for the motor because it puts the extra mass low down and centrally in the frame where it won’t affect the bike’s stability and handling.</p>\n<p>The rear-wheel hub is also a popular place to put the motor. Again, it’s low down and since a lot of the rider’s weight is on the back wheel, handling and road grip are not too adversely affected by the extra weight and power.</p>\n<p>Finally, the motor may be in the front hub. It’s a slightly trickier position because the motor unit can affect steering and generally there’s not as much weight on the front wheel, so grip may be impacted. It’s often used for folding ebikes and sometimes for hybrids.</p>\n<p>As well as ready-built ebikes, you can buy kits to convert a non-assisted bike to an ebike. There are kits that use a motor in each of these positions. We’ve got a round-up of the most popular <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/how-to-electrify-your-normal-bike/\">ebike conversion kits</a>.</p>\n<h3>Electric bike batteries explained</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Electric bike batteries are stored either inside the frame, on the top of the down or seat tube, or under the bike’s rear carrier.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Behr / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>An electric bike will be powered by a rechargeable lithium-ion battery. Like the batteries in other electric vehicles, they’re used for their low weight and performance, along with rapid recharging – typically charging to full capacity in a few hours.</p>\n<p>In general, the more expensive the ebike, the larger the battery capacity, so the mileage you can get between charges increases.</p>\n<p>There’s a range of battery shapes, sizes and positions. Bolted to the top of the down tube is a popular option and some hybrids have the battery positioned below a rear luggage rack. Some ebikes will have their batteries hidden within the down tube or sometimes the seat tube, making for a more elegant (and invariably more expensive) solution.</p>\n<p>Bottle-cage batteries are another way to disguise the battery and are often used for a back-up battery to increase range.</p>\n<p>The batteries themselves can normally be charged from a standard wall plug, either in situ on the bike via a port or with the battery itself removed from the bike. It’s very common to see removable battery packs that are secured with a key.</p>\n<h3>Electric bike range explained</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Power modes may have customisable levels of torque.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Russell Burton</i></span></div>\n<p>How far you can ride before your battery gives up is unlikely to be an issue for most ebike riders – it’s more a question of how often you can ride before you need to recharge it.</p>\n<p>Range is very dependent on your riding style, and where and how you ride, as well as being dependent on the battery capacity. Some ebikes will have multiple batteries that might eke out 100 miles or more from a charge, whereas others, particularly folding ebikes designed for easier carrying and folding and for shorter city rides, may have a range of 20 miles or less.</p>\n<p>There will be multiple assistance levels that you can tailor to your needs and select between as you ride. Select an eco or low assist mode and you will need to put in more effort, but your battery will last longer.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, a higher assist setting is useful to get you up hills and to accelerate more easily in stop-start conditions, but will drain your battery significantly faster.</p>\n<p>You can swap between modes as you ride and can usually switch the motor off entirely to conserve battery. With most systems there won’t be any additional drag when the motor is not in use, although you still have the extra weight of the motor and battery.</p>\n<h3>Sensors</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Where your bike’s speed or pedalling sensor is located will depend on the motor system used.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>To control the motor’s output, an ebike will have a range of sensors. First, there’ll be a speed sensor, so that assistance cuts out at the legal maximum speed.</p>\n<p>To match the assistance level to your pedalling input and make sure that an ebike won’t run away with you, there’ll be cadence and torque sensors too.</p>\n<p>More sophisticated systems may add more sensors. The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/electric-bikes/giant-trance-e-plus-1-pro-long-term-review/\">Giant Trance E + 1</a> electric mountain bike, for example, uses five sensors in all to control its output in Smart Assist mode.</p>\n<p>There’ll be some sort of display of battery and assistance level, along with buttons to select the assistance mode. The display is often a bar-mounted LED unit that might also give you speed, distance and range info.</p>\n<p>More minimalist displays are often used on racier road ebikes though, with the front of the top tube being a popular position. Some may work via a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-computers/\">cycling computer</a>.</p>\n<p>Many ebikes will also come with a companion smartphone app. Functionality varies, but more sophisticated apps will give you battery status info, enable you to tailor assistance levels and may include some GPS-based route planning and navigation, as well as the option to share your ride records.</p>\n<section><div>\n        \n<h3>Electric bike jargon buster</h3>\n<h4>Assist level</h4>\n<p>How much additional assistance your motor gives you as you ride. Most ebikes will have multiple levels to switch between as you ride, depending on the terrain (and your energy levels). Some will be able to automatically switch support level up and down, depending on where you’re riding or to conserve your battery levels. More power means less range.</p>\n<h4>EAPC</h4>\n<p>Short for Electrically Assisted Pedal Cycle, this is the official legal term often used by the UK government to describe ebikes.</p>\n<h4>Watts</h4>\n<p>Output for an ebike motor is typically measured in watts. That’s a measure of the maximum power it can produce.</p>\n<h4>Watt hours</h4>\n<p>Ebike battery capacity is measured in watt hours – or, in other words, how many watts a battery can put out and for how long. So if a 250-watt motor was fed by a 250Wh battery and run at full power, the battery would drain in an hour. In practice, your motor doesn’t run at full power much of the time, so your battery will last considerably longer than this.</p>\n<h4>Torque</h4>\n<p>For eMTBs, in particular, torque is also an important figure. It measures how much turning force a motor will put in, something that helps add to your own effort especially when climbing hills.</p>\n<h4>Pedelec (pedal electric cycle)</h4>\n<p>Another synonym for an electric bike.</p>\n<h4>Walk mode</h4>\n<p>If you’re going to have to push your ebike, a walk mode will use the motor to move the bike along with you. Since ebikes tend to be heavy, it’s useful if you need to push your machine any distance.</p>\n<p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section>","author":"Jack Luke","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"d7f0c338bb7b34f55b8868b910e37ce36a43aea092d9408067f49cf06f03c9c7","category":"Cycling"}
