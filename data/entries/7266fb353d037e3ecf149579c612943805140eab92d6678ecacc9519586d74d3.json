It’s one of the most iconic and influential tech gadgets of all time, and everyone wants to know what’s coming next. That Apple is so secretive only heightens the appeal of iPhone rumors and leaks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it should come as little surprise that iPhone 17 rumors, leaks, and info started to circulate months before the iPhone 16 was even formally announced. Here’s everything we know so far, but don’t take any of it as solid info: even when early rumors are accurate, plans can change, and nothing is ever certain until Apple announces it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Updated April 24:</strong> Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reiterates that Apple intends to equip the iPhone 17 Pro, and potentially even iPhone 17, with 12GB of RAM</em>.<em> An episode of the YouTube channel Unboxed Therapy goes hands-on with a dummy model of the iPhone 17 Air from a third-party supplier.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 17 release date: When is the next iPhone coming out?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s something we do know: The new iPhone lineup is almost always announced in September—usually on a Tuesday in the second week of September, to be specific. So we would expect the iPhone 17 line to be announced on or around <strong>September 9, 2025</strong>. Here’s when the most recent models were released:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>iPhone 15:</strong> September 12, 2023</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPhone 14: </strong>Sepember 7, 2022</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPhone 13:</strong> Sepember 14, 2021</li>\n\n\n\n<li>i<strong>Phone 12:</strong> October 13, 2020 (delayed due to Covid)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Historically, preorders for the iPhone begin on the Friday after the announcement, and the phones ship a week later. On occasion, some specific models may ship a couple of weeks later than others due to production issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 17: Price</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We haven’t yet heard if the iPhone 17 line will cost the same as the iPhone 16 line. Most rumors suggest the “Plus” model will be replaced by the new super-slim “Air” model, which will take over its price in the lineup as well:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>iPhone 17</strong>: 6.27-inch LTPO display, A19/8GB ($799)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPhone 17 Pro</strong>: 6.27-inch LTPO display, A19 Pro/12GB ($1,099)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPhone 17 Pro Max</strong>: 6.86-inch LTPO display, A19 Pro/12GB ($1,199)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPhone 17 Air</strong>: 6.65-inch LTPO display, A19/8GB ($899)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This would mean a significant upward shift in overall iPhone pricing, with the Pro model jumping up $100 and a new model replacing the Plus with a price of $100 more than the Pro Max.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that Apple has introduced the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1354114/new-iphone-se-release-date-se4-16e-design-specs-features.html\">iPhone 16e</a> there may also be an iPhone 17e joining the lineup in September 2025, although we don’t know if it will be updated in September 2025, or if that model won’t arrive until spring 2026. The price is likely to be $599 for the iPhone 17e, unless Apple introduces an iPhone 17e in place of the iPhone 15, with a price of $699, in which case the iPhone 16e could remain in the lineup with its $599 price tag.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 17: Colors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In April, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2747498/apple-is-planning-to-launch-an-irresistible-sky-blue-iphone-17-pro.html\">Majin Bu reported</a> that the iPhone 17 Pro models will come in a new and “irresistible” sky blue color. That would be the second product with that color, following the M4 MacBook Air.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone 16 comes in five colors including Ultramarine, Teal, Pink, White, and Black. The iPhone 16 Pro comes in Desert Titanium, Natural Titanium, White Titanium, and Black Titanium, which are reminiscent of the classic gold and space gray options. There were rumors that the iPhone 16 would also come in purple, so perhaps that’s in the pipeline for 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 17: New slimmer ‘iPhone 17 Air’ model</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Several analysts have reported that the existing Plus model will be replaced by a <strong>new “Slim” model</strong> with a larger screen size and a much thinner body. Analyst Jeff Pu was the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2324602/iphone-17-slim-24mp-front-camera-2025.html\">first to report this change</a> (in May 2024), and in the same month,  The Information <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2337606/the-2025-iphone-could-feature-a-thin-redesigned-ultra-high-end-model.html\">reported on the Slim model</a>, stating that it would be a new even-higher-end model that sits above “Pro Max” in the lineup and would have a centered rear camera and a smaller Dynamic Island.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has been accurate about supply-chain predictions, <a href=\"https://mingchikuo.craft.me/84AOn3Ll8Zah6f\">mentions</a> that a future <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2629813/apple-folding-iphone-design-display-specs-release.html\">folding iPhone</a> will have “the same <strong>high-density battery cells</strong> as the ultra-thin iPhone 17.” It’s already possible for iPhone batteries to hold more energy in the same volume, it’s just a matter of cost—with the slim iPhone 17 Air, Apple will likely spend more on a battery that holds more charge in its limited volume.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A report by Mark Gurman of Bloomberg in August 2024 claimed the new model will fit between the standard iPhone and the Pro: ” If you want something snazzier than a standard iPhone–but don’t really need the performance, screen size, or cameras of a Pro model–you can get something that looks much cooler while still having the specifications of a regular iPhone.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A report from Jeff Pu in November 2024 claims that the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2525205/get-ready-for-the-iphone-17-air-apples-thinnest-phone-ever.html\">iPhone 17 Air/Slim will be around 6mm thick</a>. That’s thinner than any iPhone so far. The iPhone 16, for context, is 7.8mm thick. The thinnest new iPad Pro is 5.1mm thick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.sisajournal-e.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=408493\">Korea’s Sisa Journal</a> in January 2025, the so-called iPhone 17 Air will be <strong>6.25mm thick</strong> and cost in the <strong>same price range as the iPhone 16 Plus</strong> (starting at $899 U.S.). A <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2574312/the-iphone-17-air-may-be-even-thinner-with-a-mind-blowing-5-5mm-body.html\">medium post from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a> stated that the “thinnest part” of the new ultra-slim iPhone is just <strong>5.5mm thick</strong>, but it’s difficult to know what that means without more context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The camera bump, <a href=\"https://weibo.com/5673255066/PidH1oskN\">according to Weibo leaker Ice Universe</a>, will be <strong>4.0mm thick</strong>, bringing the total phone thickness to 9.5mm at the camera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In October 2024 Pu <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/18/iphone-17-air-rumored-features/\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> he expects the phone to have an A19 chip (not A19 Pro), 8GB of RAM, around a 6.6-inch display, an aluminum body, and a single 48MP rear camera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2584214/iphone-17-air-leak-shows-off-new-camera-bar-design.html\">leaked image in January</a> reportedly showed the case of the new iPhone 17 Air, with a prominent “<strong>camera bar</strong>” design.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iphone-17-air-leak.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"image showing iPhone 17 Air rear case\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iphone-17-air-leak.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iphone-17-air-leak.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iphone-17-air-leak.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iphone-17-air-leak.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iphone-17-air-leak.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iphone-17-air-leak.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iphone-17-air-leak.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iphone-17-air-leak.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Majin Bu/X</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Most recently, an episode of the YouTube channel Unboxed Therapy featured a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2760920/crazy-thin-iphone-17-air-aakes-first-appearance-in-hands-on-video.html\">“dummy model” version of the phone</a> from a third-party supplier. It’s our best look yet at the overall size and thin design.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 17: Cameras</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>All iPhone 17 models have been rumored to feature a <strong><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/02/iphone-17-24mp-front-camera-rumor/\">24MP front-facing camera</a></strong>. An October 2024 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/18/iphone-17-pro-rumored-features/\">research note</a> from analyst Jeff Pu added that the iPhone 17 Pro would feature a <strong>48MP telephoto camera</strong> along with a new <strong>24MP front camera</strong>. According to a <a href=\"https://majinbuofficial.com/iphone-17-pro-revolution-in-mobile-photography-with-advanced-telephoto-lens/\">later report from Majin Bu</a>, the 48MP telephoto camera will have a <strong>zoom of 3.5x (85mm)</strong>, with an optical “crop zoom” mode similar to today’s 48MP wide camera, so <strong>you can shoot 12MP 7x (160mm) shots</strong> before the digital zoom kicks in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some iPhone 17 models (maybe even all of them) will have a <strong><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2555317/leaked-iphone-17-frame-shows-wide-pixel-style-camera-bump.html\">new camera bump</a></strong>, a wide rectangular raised area that stretches across the phone similar in style to Google’s Pixel line. According to a leaked image of one iPhone 17 aluminum frame (we don’t know from which model), it will be substantial in size.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pro models are expected to have a “camera bar” design like the iPhone 17 Air, only larger and with three cameras in the familiar array. According to leaker Jon Prosser, it should look something like this:</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iphone17-pro-air-leak1.png?w=1200\" alt=\"iPhone 17 Pro vs Air leak\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iphone17-pro-air-leak1.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 3720w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iphone17-pro-air-leak1.png?resize=300%2C151&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iphone17-pro-air-leak1.png?resize=768%2C386&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iphone17-pro-air-leak1.png?resize=1200%2C604&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iphone17-pro-air-leak1.png?resize=1536%2C773&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iphone17-pro-air-leak1.png?resize=2048%2C1031&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"604\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Front Page Tech / @Zellozi</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Months later, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-04-06/will-apple-raise-iphone-prices-in-the-us-after-trump-tariffs-iphone-17-details\">Mark Gurman clarified in his newsletter</a> that the camera bump won’t have a dark interior, but rather the entire area will match the color of the phone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In February 2025, veteran leaker Majin Bu <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2617275/leaked-iphone-17-cad-images-reveal-three-different-camera-designs.html\">leaked iPhone 17 CAD images that seemed to reveal three different camera designs</a>. The images suggest that there will be not one or two but three different camera module designs on show. The two Pro models will have triple rear lenses embedded in a thick band that runs across the back of the phone, as predicted by Jon Prosser (above). The standard iPhone 17 will stick feature two lenses stacked vertically. And the rumored iPhone 17 Air will offer an iPhone 16e-like single camera lens on the rear in order to reduce costs and keep the chassis slim and light. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/iphone-17-line-dummy.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPhone 17 line dummy\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/iphone-17-line-dummy.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/iphone-17-line-dummy.jpg?resize=300%2C164&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/iphone-17-line-dummy.jpg?resize=768%2C419&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/iphone-17-line-dummy.jpg?resize=1200%2C655&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/iphone-17-line-dummy.jpg?resize=1536%2C839&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"655\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/sonnydickson.bsky.social/post/3lkhtmu6p5c2w\" target=\"_blank\">Sonny Dickson</a></div>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2406933/report-at-least-one-iphone-17-model-to-feature-a-mechanical-aperture.html\">report from The Information</a> in July 2024 claims that “at least one” model will feature a <strong>mechanical aperture</strong>, which would be new for iPhones but has been seen in a handful of Android phones so far.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 17: Rumored specs and features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Various rumors suggest that the new iPhones could benefit from the following updates: </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Design and display</h3>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>always-on display</strong> is supposed to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2251596/report-claims-the-iphone-17-will-finally-get-an-always-on-display.html\">finally be available on the non-Pro models</a>. In addition, some believe that <strong>ProMotion</strong> will come to the non-Pro models, since the same LPTO technology that enables the always-on display is what makes ProMotion possible, in Apple’s iPhone implementation. If true, it would be the first time Apple has offered ProMotion on a non-Pro device.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is also <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2270684/iphone-17-anti-glare-scratch-resistant-display.html\">said to be working with Corning</a> on a <strong>new anti-glare and scratch-resistant glass</strong> for the iPhone 17 lineup.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Dynamic Island </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone 17 Pro Max may have a <strong>smaller dynamic island</strong>. Rumors have changed back and forth—Jeff Pu said the dynamic island (or rather, the hardware “pill” that the island surrounds) will be smaller in the iPhone 17 Pro Max. Then Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said it will be the same size as current models. Then leaker <a href=\"https://weibo.com/6048569942/Pe6wSfDxj\">Digital Chat Station on Weibo</a> said it will indeed be smaller.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Processor</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We don’t know much about what chips will power the iPhone 17 line, but we expect the high-end models will get an <strong>A19 Pro</strong>, while the non-Pro models may get a standard or cut-back version of the A19, or perhaps a more souped up variant of the A18.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>RAM</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Apple bumped every iPhone 16 model to 8GB of RAM due to the demands of Apple Intelligence, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2441215/\">rumors</a> have suggested Apple will increase the memory in the iPhone 17 Pro models to <strong>12GB</strong>. In a <a href=\"https://mingchikuo.craft.me/luXVWtplQ9Bokb\">report concerning RAM suppliers</a>, Ming-Chi Kuo says that Apple wants the <strong>regular iPhone 17 to feature 12GB as well</strong>, but supply shortages may be an issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Wi-Fi </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to wireless, the cellular modem is likely to still be supplied by Qualcomm; Apple’s own efforts to produce a top-tier 5G modem seem to be stalled and likely won’t be ready in time for next year’s iPhone 17 line. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/828757/wi-fi-7-speed-latency-apple-devices.html\">Wi-Fi 7 support</a> seems likely, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone history</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><br />The iPhone 16 range and the iPhone 16e are the current-generation models available from Apple.
