It’s super secure with a Touch ID-enabled power button and will last through a busy workday with 10 hours of battery life and a fast-charging USB-C charging port. Weighing just a little more than a half-pound, it’s smaller and lighter than a textbook, and sturdy enough to cram into any bag or backpack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course, it’ll be ready to run iPadOS 17 when it arrives later this fall. So go grab one right now and enjoy the last few weeks of summer.</p>\n\niPad</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"754ce292f951249696ca20a39ea35a74bc6cf4ce54006863f81b9f90b4c7b128","category":"Apple"}
