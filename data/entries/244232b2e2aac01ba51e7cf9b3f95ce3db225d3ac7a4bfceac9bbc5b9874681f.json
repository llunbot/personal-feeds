It includes a Magnetic Power Profile that ensures that smartphones are \"perfectly aligned with charging devices\" and it is meant to offer \"improved energy efficiency and faster charging.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSome companies have announced Qi2 chargers that can charge at up to 15W, the same as ‌MagSafe‌, but it does not appear that Apple's iPhones will support the faster 15W Qi2 charging functionality.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere have been no improvements to ‌MagSafe‌ charging speeds either, and rumors that suggested we could see quicker wired charging may also be incorrect. <em>9to5Mac</em> said that the ‌iPhone 15‌ models could support faster charging speeds using a 35W charger, but Apple's technical specifications page doesn't list any improvement to fast charging.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌iPhone 15‌ models will continue to charge to 50 percent in around 30 minutes with a 20W or higher adapter. It is possible that using a 35W or higher charger will speed up charging, but that will need to be figured out once the devices are released.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2023-apple-event/\">September 2023 Apple Event</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/iphone-15-qi-charging-no-improvement/\">iPhone 15 Models Still Limited to 7.5W on Qi Chargers, Fast Charging Has Not Improved</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-models-still-limited-to-7-5w-on-qi-chargers-fast-charging-has-not-improved.2401281/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"244232b2e2aac01ba51e7cf9b3f95ce3db225d3ac7a4bfceac9bbc5b9874681f","category":"Apple"}
