Apple can enforce these restrictions due to its position as an intermediary between product creators such as developers on the one hand and users on the other.\"</p>\n<p>The DOJ is seeking an order determining that Apple has illegally monopolized the smartphone market in the US. The agency also wants the requested order to block Apple from continuing its allegedly anticompetitive practices.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011858#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2011858&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a97f7a315881fab2f320b60595f62b84ecce707a9dd0ebea33678768ebf8a337","category":"Tech"}
