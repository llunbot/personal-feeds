Apple CEO <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a> was successful getting Apple devices exempted from tariffs during Trump's first term, but he has had less luck so far this time around.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has been working to ramp up manufacturing in India for the last several years, and it will make 25 million iPhones in India this year. By redirecting iPhones made in India to the U.S. market, Apple can meet approximately 50 percent of U.S. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> demand in 2025.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile Trump has set tariffs on Chinese goods at 54 percent, he said today that he would increase them if China does not remove the 34 percent reciprocal tariff that it announced on Friday.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOver the weekend, a report from <em>The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wsj-com/\">Wall Street Journal</a></em> suggested that the current tariff on goods from China could <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/iphone-apple-tariffs-china-bb20c7a3\">increase Apple's component cost</a> for the ‌iPhone‌ significantly. An <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a> that costs Apple $580 now, for example, could cost $850 with tariffs. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nTrump is pushing for companies like Apple to make their devices in the United States, but that is not feasible because it is more affordable for Apple to pay the tariffs than to attempt to move manufacturing to a country that does not have the number of skilled workers available for the kind of advanced fabrication that Apple requires.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple earlier this year announced plans to spend $500 billion on U.S. manufacturing, with the company aiming to create <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a> servers and other similar products that have lower demand.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple could <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/07/how-apple-could-navigate-trumps-tariffs/\">employ other strategies</a> to deal with the tariffs, including pressuring suppliers for lower prices and absorbing some of the cost, but it is quite possible that Apple will raise its prices in the near future.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTrump's tariff plans have caused stocks to drop significantly over the course of the last three days, with Apple stock <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/07/apple-stock-wild-morning/\">down nearly 20 percent</a> since last Wednesday.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/07/apple-iphone-tariffs-india/\">Apple to Lessen Tariff Impact by Shipping More iPhones From India</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-to-lessen-tariff-impact-by-shipping-more-iphones-from-india.2454901/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"aec343607812beb8ced6783bc5e7a6b9ee78cf9552c06899ab0bfb0bf6fa4e6e","category":"Apple"}
