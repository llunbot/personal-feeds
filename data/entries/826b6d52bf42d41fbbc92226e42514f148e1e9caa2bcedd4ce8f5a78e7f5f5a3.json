In addition, the same legal logic may apply to many similar statutes and executive orders adopted elsewhere in the US.</p>\n<h2>Norwegian vs. the sunshine state</h2>\n<p>If a Sunday ruling seems unusual, it's because of the case's tight timeline. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, which runs a number of cruise ships out of Florida, is planning on starting a cruise next weekend. The company has promised its customers that everyone—all fellow passengers and the crew—will have been vaccinated, and the company will confirm their status. While in keeping with CDC guidance and requirements at a number of locations the cruise will visit, that approach runs afoul of Florida law, specifically a statute called Section 381.00316.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1785844#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1785844&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"826b6d52bf42d41fbbc92226e42514f148e1e9caa2bcedd4ce8f5a78e7f5f5a3","category":"Tech"}
