But amid the health crises, vaccination rates slipped to 94 percent in the 2020–2021 school year, then to 93 percent in the 2021–2022 school year. For the 2022–2023 school year, overall coverage remained around 93 percent, but exemptions rose to 3 percent, up from 2.6 percent in the previous year. The current exemption rate is the highest ever recorded for the country.</p>\n<p>The study, published in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, included reported data from 49 states and the District of Columbia. Montana did not report vaccination data to the CDC.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983182#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1983182&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1813c6cb38ecf07b5534560424ed435e9034a2119e60074a9622db21fb7c15c0","category":"Tech"}
