These plans would describe and attest to their efforts to follow existing best practices with respect to Route Origin Authorizations and Route Origin Validation using the Resource Public Key Infrastructure. In addition, we propose quarterly reporting for the largest providers to ensure we are making progress addressing this well-known vulnerability.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029635#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2029635&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"29b198d9875007ad645dece6888b59922a32e3c6a8c91301ada2813ea89be9c1","category":"Tech"}
