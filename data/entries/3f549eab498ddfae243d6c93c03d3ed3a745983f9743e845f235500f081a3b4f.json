Apple says the primary user's Apple ID account settings, Optic ID, passcode, passwords, Apple Pay, Persona, and health data will be restricted while the Guest User mode is active.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGuest User mode was discovered last year <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/22/visionos-hands-on/\">in the visionOS simulator</a>, part of Apple's app development tool Xcode. Once the mode is turned on, it will automatically shut off if the headset is not worn within five minutes, the simulator showed.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-Vision-Pro-Travel-Mode.jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nWhen turned on via Control Center, Apple says Travel Mode stabilizes visuals on the Vision Pro for users wearing the headset on an airplane.
