E.g. what happens if a small developer — or even a kid in the proverbial garage — gets a 10-million-download hit and suddenly owes Apple 4.5 million euros? Apple’s Kyle Andeer (<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyle-andeer-0137b849/\">VP of legal</a>) gives a too-long answer but ends with, “This is something we need to figure out. And it is something we’re working on. So I would say on that one, stay tuned.”</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/03/18/viral-hit-ctf-problem\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d0100442e1865a232724b7f8d246db8ef8bb383a293de1c748c8c7419d557c66","category":"Tech"}
