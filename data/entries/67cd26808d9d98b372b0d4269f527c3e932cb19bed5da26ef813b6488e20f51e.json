Last year <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/12/ars-technicas-best-video-games-of-2022/\">in this space</a>, we lamented how COVID-related development delays meant a dearth of big-budget blockbusters that would usually fill a year-end list. In 2023, many of those delays finally expired, leading to a flood of long-anticipated titles over just a few months.</p>\n<p>But the year in games didn’t stop there. Beyond the usual big-budget suspects, there were countless delightful surprises from smaller indie studios, many of which came out of nowhere to provide some of the most memorable interactive experiences of the year.</p>\n<p>These two trends make it difficult to narrow this year’s best games down to just 20 titles. The “shortlist” we assembled during the winnowing process easily approached 50 titles, most of which could have easily made the list in a less packed year—or been swapped with a game that did make this year’s list.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992252#p3\">Read 127 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1992252&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"67cd26808d9d98b372b0d4269f527c3e932cb19bed5da26ef813b6488e20f51e","category":"Tech"}
