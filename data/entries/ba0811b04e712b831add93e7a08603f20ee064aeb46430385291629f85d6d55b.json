A similar initial spike was seen across the nation, with states that either limited or protected access to abortions seeing a 17 percent increase.</p>\n<p>But, after that, states with bans saw a divergent trend. The states that limited or protected abortion access saw sterilization procedures largely level off after July 2022. In contrast, states with bans continued to see increases. From July 2022 to December 2022, use of sterilization procedures increased by 3 percent each month.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049152#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2049152&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ba0811b04e712b831add93e7a08603f20ee064aeb46430385291629f85d6d55b","category":"Tech"}
