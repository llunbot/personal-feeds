It's December 19, and as we get closer to the year-end holidays your humble space correspondent is starting to get a little stir-crazy. Hence the reason for today's abdominal, I mean abominable, headline.</p>\n<p>This amazingly cool image of Uranus <a href=\"https://webbtelescope.org/contents/news-releases/2023/news-2023-150\">comes from the Near-Infrared Camera</a> on the James Webb Space Telescope. This wide-field image shows Uranus with an assortment of background galaxies and 14 of its 27 moons, including Oberon and Titania. We can also see the north polar cap gleaming a bright white, as well as the planet's rather faint (in visible light) inner and outer rings.</p>\n<p>I've also included the close-up image of Uranus, which is really quite stunning with all of its various rings. </p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1991865#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1991865&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"98598ff354a5a718a59dfe04c5903de092f15d5cf571c0ed8eb229d7b7b90188","category":"Tech"}
