Plus, because you can’t beat free, we’ll also explain your options for getting Photoshop on Mac for free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’d like to get the same software on your tablet, read <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678517/how-to-get-photoshop-on-ipad.html\">How to get Photoshop on iPad</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to get Photoshop free on a Mac</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of people will be wondering if there is a way to get Photoshop for free on a Mac. First a warning: if you find Photoshop on a file sharing site don’t download it. This is because it’s very unlikely to be a legitimate version of the app and will almost definitely cause you problems – this is how viruses spread.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s no completely free version of Adobe Photoshop, but there are a couple of options that could get you a copy of Photoshop free for a limited time, or on a short term subscription.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first option is a Photoshop trial. There is a <a href=\"https://adobe.prf.hn/click/camref:1011lroIY/pubref:1-1-676673-1-0-0/destination:https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html#mini-plans-web-cta-photoshop-card\" target=\"_blank\">7-day free trial</a> that gives you access to the full program, with no restrictions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Adobe advertises the free 7-day trial, you can actually get 14-days free, because you can cancel within 14-days of your initial order and get fully refunded. In fact you could, theoretically, get 21 days free if you had the trial and then cancelled your subscription after 13 days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second option is signing up for a monthly subscription on a monthly rather than an annual basis. This won’t give you Photoshop for free, but the option will allow you to subscribe to Adobe Photoshop on a temporary basis and cancel when you no longer need it. We’ll run through the various subscription options in the sections below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To explain how it works we need to explain the difference between Adobe’s two monthly subscription packages:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two monthly subscription packages: one is cheaper ($20.99/£19.97 a month) because it is part of an annual plan; the other is a more expensive option ($31.49/£30.34 a month), but you can cancel without having to pay Adobe anything.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>Plan</td><td>U.S.</td><td>U.K.</td></tr><tr><td>Annual, paid monthly, cancel within 14 days</td><td>$20.99/month</td><td>£19.97/month</td></tr><tr><td>Annual, prepaid, cancel within 14 days</td><td>$239.88/year</td><td>£238.42/year</td></tr><tr><td>Monthly, cancel at any time</td><td>$31.49/month</td><td>£30.34/month </td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Adobe explains the legal terms of the various contracts <a href=\"https://adobe.prf.hn/click/camref:1011lroIY/pubref:1-1-676673-1-0-0/destination:https://www.adobe.com/legal/subscription-terms.html\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. Basically, if you sign up for the cheaper ‘annual contract, paid monthly’ and then choose to end your subscription you will be able to do so, but if you end the contract after the first 14 days “you’ll be charged a lump sum amount of 50% of your remaining contract obligation and your service will continue until the end of that month’s billing period.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a slightly better scenario than if you were paying annually – in that case your contract will continue to the end of the term. You wouldn’t get any money back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which is why the best option in this case is to sign up for the month-to-month contract. In this case the contract will automatically renew every month, but should you choose to cancel (we explain how to cancel below) you will be able to use Photoshop until the end of that month, at which point your contract will cease.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need Photoshop, but you don’t want to tie yourself into a contract with Adobe, this could be the best option for you. However, you should note that you will lose access to anything you have saved in Adobe’s cloud after 90 days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://adobe.prf.hn/click/camref:1011lroIY/pubref:1-1-676673-1-0-0/destination:https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/plans.html\" target=\"_blank\">Sign up on Adobe’s website</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If these options aren’t right for you, but you don’t want to pay for Photoshop you will need to look for alternatives to Photoshop.

Photoshop Elements is a designed for amateur rather than pro photographers, but it does offer a number of photo editing features that might be sufficient for your needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can buy a copy of Photoshop Elements directly from Adobe’s website for $99.99/£86.56.

You will have access to features like masks, layers, colourisation, image manipulation and other useful, more consumer-level effects with Elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a creative professional though, or are used to the full-blown version of Photoshop, then you may find too many tools missing from the box. If you want to take a look there’s also a <a href=\"https://adobe.prf.hn/click/camref:1011lroIY/pubref:1-1-676673-1-0-0/destination:https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-elements/free-trial.html\" target=\"_blank\">7-day free trial</a> so you can take the software for a test run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Understandably there are lots of Mac users who are disappointed that Adobe doesn’t sell a ‘perpetual license’ for the full version of Photoshop any more. Many years ago professional Mac users might have owned a version of Adobe CS and used it for years, but the slow rate at which companies updated probably lead Adobe to switch to a subscription model.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3803575/photoshop_elements_2022_review_1_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"Photoshop Elements\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don’t care about how up to date your software is you might be interested in buying a second hand copy of Photoshop, or an old Mac with Photoshop installed. Just be aware that Adobe doesn’t support all older versions in terms of updates, so the ones you find might not be compatible with later iterations of macOS, plus newer <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673313/how-to-open-apps-that-wont-work-in-mojave-including-photoshop.html\">Macs won’t run old versions of Photoshop.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll also need to confirm that the software license hasn’t already been used, as usually these are non-transferable. And generally we would advise against <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678277/why-you-shouldnt-buy-a-second-hand-mac.html\">buying a used Mac</a> (unless it’s <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670463/where-to-buy-a-refurbished-macbook-or-mac.html\">certified refurbished</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673697/what-version-of-macos-can-my-mac-run.html\">What version of macOS can my Mac run?</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a subscription to Photoshop isn’t for you, and Photoshop Elements isn’t enough, we recommend you look at alternatives to Photoshop, many of which have comparable features with the benefit of being available to buy outright. The best options include  <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.pixelmator.com/pro/&amp;xcust=1-1-676673-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">PixelMator Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/&amp;xcust=1-1-676673-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Affinity Photo</a> and others.

There’s not actually a straightforward answer: it depends on how you want to buy it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you love or hate the subscription model, there are a few options to choose from if you want to get a copy of Photoshop:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Photoshop:</strong> If you just want the single Photoshop app you can have that for $20.99/£19.97 a month if you sign up for a year, or $31.49/£30.34 a month if you just pay on a monthly basis. <a href=\"https://adobe.prf.hn/click/camref:1011lroIY/pubref:1-1-676673-1-0-0/destination:https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/plans.html\" target=\"_blank\">Sign up on Adobe’s website</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Photography Plan:</strong> However, the Photography Plan is actually the best deal. It include Photoshop CC, Lightroom CC (for web and mobile), and Lightroom Classic CC (for desktop). That bundle costs $9.99/£9.98 a month, but you will be on a contract for a year. You get 20GB storage included (there’s a 1TB storage option that costs about $10/£10 more a month). <a href=\"https://adobe.prf.hn/click/camref:1011lroIY/pubref:1-1-676673-1-0-0/destination:https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/plans.html\" target=\"_blank\">Sign up on Adobe’s website.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Business:</strong> If you are a business user you ought to sign up for the Business option where you can get a single Photoshop licence for $35.99/£26.49 ex VAT a month per licence. It’s worth noting that all the Adobe CC apps, including Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Premiere Pro, and Acrobat, cost $84.99/£61.99 (ex VAT) per licence a month.  <a href=\"https://adobe.prf.hn/click/camref:1011lroIY/pubref:1-1-676673-1-0-0/destination:https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/plans.htmlSign%20up%20on%20Adobe&amp;#039;s%20website.\" target=\"_blank\">Sign up on Adobe’s website</a>. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3803575/how_to_get_photoshop_on_mac_pricing_thumb.jpg\" alt=\"How to get photoshop on Mac: Pricing\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to cancel a Photoshop subscription</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The ease with which you can end your Photoshop contract is one of the benefits of Adobe’s decision to switch from selling copies of Photoshop outright to a subscription model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also means that you only need to pay for Photoshop for as long as you need it. So if it’s just for a short term project you can unsubscribe as soon as the work is done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how to cancel your subscription:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Sign in to the Adobe <a href=\"https://adobe.prf.hn/click/camref:1011lroIY/pubref:1-1-676673-1-0-0/destination:https://account.adobe.com/plans.\">web page where plans are managed.</a></li><li>Sign in to your Adobe account.</li><li>Under the My Plans tab find Manage Plan (or View plan) and click on that.</li><li>Now click on Cancel plan.</li><li>Give your reason for cancellation.</li><li>Click on Continue.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best alternatives to Photoshop on Mac?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There is plenty of great photo and image manipulation software available on macOS, many of which come with lower price tags than the Adobe products.

The interface can take a little getting used to, which is not uncommon with open-source software, but once you get to know your way around, you’ll be amazed at what you can achieve. There’s also a large collection of tutorials for the software on YouTube, so if you’re willing to put in the time then it’s a powerful suite that will cost you nothing at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also recommend you read  <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676023/best-mac-for-photo-editing.html\">Best Mac for photo editing</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may also be interested in: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1654096/how-get-adobe-illustrator-on-mac.html\">How to get Adobe Illustrator on a Mac</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1530570/how-get-indesign-on-mac.html\">How to get InDesign on a Mac</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\nMacOS, Personal Software, Professional Software</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"c9767eb92a0003dcfdd745477ef4c3304b5a9bf1626e3df5a5e068bed4af54b7","category":"Apple"}
