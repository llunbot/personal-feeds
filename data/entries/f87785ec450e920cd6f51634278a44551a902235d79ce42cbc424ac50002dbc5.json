Combined with a detailed knowledge of which regions of the brain are involved in specific processes, we've been able to do remarkable things, such as using functional MRI (fMRI) to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2008/12/mindreading-101-identifying-images-by-watching-the-brain/\">determine what letter a person was looking at</a> or an implant to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2015/05/new-neural-implant-reads-a-persons-intentions-to-control-robotic-arm/\">control a robotic arm</a></p>\n<p>But today, researchers announced a new bit of mind reading that's impressive in its scope. By combining fMRI brain imaging with a system that's somewhat like the predictive text of cell phones, they've worked out the gist of the sentences a person is hearing in near real time. While the system doesn't get the exact words right and makes a fair number of mistakes, it's also flexible enough that it can reconstruct an imaginary monologue that goes on entirely within someone's head.</p>\n<h2>Making functional MRI functional</h2>\n<p>Functional MRI is a way of seeing what parts of the brain have been active. By tuning the sensitivity of the imaging to pick up differences in the flow of blood, it's possible to identify areas within the brain that are replenishing their energy after having processed some information. It has been extremely useful for understanding how the brain operates, but it also has some significant limitations.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1935842#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1935842&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f87785ec450e920cd6f51634278a44551a902235d79ce42cbc424ac50002dbc5","category":"Tech"}
