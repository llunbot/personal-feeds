The iPhone 15 mostly resembles its predecessor but swaps the top-of-screen notch for the \"Dynamic Island\" Apple introduced with the iPhone 14 Pro last year, and it ditches Apple's proprietary Lightning port in favor of the industry-standard USB-C.</p>\n<p>Like the iPhone 14, the iPhone 15 comes in two screen sizes: 6.1 inches for the standard phone, and 6.7 for the iPhone 15 Plus. The two models are the same apart from the screen sizes. The iPhone 15-series' overall design is also similar to that of its predecessor, with a glass back and front and an aluminum enclosure.</p>\n<p>The edge of the aluminum enclosure has a new contoured design that looks a bit different from the iPhone 14, though. The new iPhones will come in yellow, green, blue, and black.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1964590#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1964590&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f6d8aca783db3e3bd310b4d74304f688a7d44b1289bcb5f50fb07f7f8e207f25","category":"Tech"}
