For other iPhone models, the report said that metric is apparently between 80% and 90%.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe reduced battery life is due in part to the iPhone 17 Air's ultra-thin 5.5mm design, which would make it the thinnest iPhone ever.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTo mitigate this problem, the report said that Apple is planning to release a battery case as an optional accessory for the iPhone 17 Air.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple last released battery cases <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/20/apple-new-iphone-11-battery-cases/\">for the iPhone 11 lineup</a>, followed by the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-discontinues-magsafe-battery-pack-and-duo/\">since-discontinued MagSafe Battery Pack</a> for iPhone 12 models and newer. A battery case both protects an iPhone and provides additional battery life as necessary.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe report added that Apple's supply chain is uncertain about how much demand there will be for the iPhone 17 Air, given it will be an all-new model with a unique form factor. As a result, the suppliers are initially only dedicating about 10% of production capacity for the iPhone 17 series to the iPhone 17 Air, according to the report.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-17-air/\">iPhone 17 Air</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/03/iphone-17-air-battery-case-report/\">iPhone 17 Air Expected to Have Battery Case Due to 'Worse' Battery Life</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-17-air-expected-to-have-battery-case-due-to-worse-battery-life.2456433/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5f162bd0d5a35a3efaddaa53c8f24d104f1bbc9870c68df65303292cb5c7a8fe","category":"Apple"}
