Maybe you need to include a receipt, registration, or other form of proof in an online form. Or, you want to keep copies of your important documents in the cloud, so they’re always accessible and safe from being lost or destroyed. Such documents are often digitized as Portable Document Format files (or PDFs).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It used to be that you needed to use either dedicated hardware or a third-party iPhone app to take a photo of a document and convert it to PDF. Apple has added a very handy document scanner into the Notes and Files apps, and it does a surprisingly good job of capturing most documents and converting them to PDF. Because it’s not very obvious, you’d be forgiven for not even knowing it exists. Here’s how you scan, convert, and store the documents using Notes or Files.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to scan a document and save it as a PDF with Notes or Files</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can scan a document into Notes and then save it as a PDF (if you want to), or you can directly scan a document into the Files app as a PDF.</p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div><div><div>At a glance </div></div><ul><li><span>Time to complete: </span><span>  5 minutes</span></li><li>Tools required: iPhone with iOS 11 or later</li><li>Cost: 0</li></ul></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div><span>1.</span>\n<h3>Create a new note and add scan</h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/iphone-scan-pdf-step1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPhone scan documents 1\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<ol><li>Open Notes and create a new Note (or open a Note to which you wish to add a scan).</li><li>Tap the Camera icon and then choose <em>Scan Documents</em>.</li><li>Hold your iPhone over your document until it is highlighted.
