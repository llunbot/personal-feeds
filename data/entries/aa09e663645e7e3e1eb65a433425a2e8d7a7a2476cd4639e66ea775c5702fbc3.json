These devices will apparently use single-stack 60Hz OLED panels.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs for Macs, Omdia believes Apple will apply 120Hz OLED two-stack panels to the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models as early as 2026, followed by 13.8-inch and 15.5-inch MacBook Air models with 120Hz single-stack panels in 2028. Two-stack panels have two emission layers, which doubles brightness and quadruples display lifespan.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMeanwhile, Omdia predicts that Apple will launch an 18.8-inch foldable device with a 120Hz single-stack panel in 2028 or later.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCommenting on the forecast, <a href=\"https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1864535769668571431\">shared on X (Twitter)</a> by leaker @Jukanlosreve, oft-accurate Display Supply Chain Consultants (DSCC) CEO Ross Young <a href=\"https://x.com/DSCCRoss/status/1864723403204366508\">suggested</a> that his own predictions largely align with Omdia's predictions, barring subtle differences, such as his firm expectation that the OLED MacBook Air will use an oxide backplane and not LPTO.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/Apple-2022-2030-iPad-Macbook-display-roadmap-Omdia.jpg\" width=\"1920\" height=\"810\" />\r<br />\nOLED panels can individually control each pixel, resulting in more precise color reproduction and deeper blacks compared to other common display technologies. They also provide superior contrast, faster response times, better viewing angles, and greater design flexibility. All of Apple's flagship iPhones use OLED panels, and in May the company brought the display technology to the iPad Pro for the first time. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jukanlosreve/\">Jukanlosreve</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled/\">OLED</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/omdia/\">Omdia</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini\">iPad Mini (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/09/oled-ipad-mini-could-launch-as-soon-as-2026/\">OLED iPad Mini Could Launch as Soon as 2026</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/oled-ipad-mini-could-launch-as-soon-as-2026.2444946/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"aa09e663645e7e3e1eb65a433425a2e8d7a7a2476cd4639e66ea775c5702fbc3","category":"Apple"}
