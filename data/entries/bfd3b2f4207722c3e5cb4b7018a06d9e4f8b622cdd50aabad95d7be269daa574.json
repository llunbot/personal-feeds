The <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-watch-live-stages-route-riders-teams-start-list\" target=\"_blank\">Giro d’Italia</a> is in full swing, with Remco Evenepoel still in the <em>maglia rosa</em> on Stage 4 following his time-trial victory on the opening day. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/5-best-thibaut-pinot\" target=\"_blank\">Thibaut Pinot</a> (Groupama-FDJ) wears the <em>maglia azzurra</em> and is racking up the points already in his final Italian Grand Tour. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>La Vuelta Femenina, the rebranded Ceratizit Challenge by La Vuelta, finished with a dramatic crescendo on Lagos de Covadonga. Demi Vollering (SD Worx) won Stage 5 and Stage 7, but Annemiek van Vleuten (Movistar) hung on to the <em>maillot rojo</em> by just nine seconds in the end. </p>\n\n\n\n<div><p><em>Results powered by <a href=\"https://firstcycling.com/race.php?r=9058&amp;y=2023&amp;s=7\" target=\"_blank\">FirstCycling.com</a></em></p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>1.

Demi Vollering (SD Worx) arrived after a victorious <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/classics\" target=\"_blank\">Classics</a> campaign in which she <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/2023-pro-cycling-liege-bastogne\" target=\"_blank\">won the Ardennes Triple</a>, while Annemiek van Vleuten (Movistar) was looking to flip an uncharacteristically quiet season. Following Jumbo-Visma’s success in the Stage 1 team time-trial and Charlotte Kool’s (Team DSM) victory on Stage 2, Marianne Vos (Jumbo-Visma) won back-to-back stages as the race turned to the mountains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s here, on the penultimate stage towards Laredo, that controversy erupted. Vollering and SD Worx stopped for a nature break with 70km to go. It was also at this moment that Movistar put the hammer down to raise the pace. Eventually Van Vleuten was off the front with Trek-Segafredo’s Gaia Realini; the Italian proving a revelation at La Vuelta Femenina. It came down to a two-woman sprint that was so close that the victory decision was reversed twice before the day’s honours were belatedly bestowed upon Realini.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The stage had been set for the final day of racing. Vollering and Realini rode Van Vleuten off their wheel with just 6km left of the race. As the gradients rose and fog clouded vision, the red jersey was slipping from Van Vleuten’s grasp. Vollering won the stage and attention turned to where Van Vleuten was on the mountain. The 40-year-old crossed the line 56 seconds behind and collapsed to the ground. She had won La Vuelta Femenina by just nine seconds.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/2023-pro-cycling-vuelta-femenina\">Pro Log: Anna Henderson wears first red jersey of Vuelta Femenina, Trek-Segafredo release Antonio Tiberi, Giulio Ciccone out of Giro d’Italia, and Charlie Burton dies aged 93</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/remco-evenepoel-specialized-sworks-tarmac-sl7-bike\">Pro bike: Remco Evenepoel’s rainbow Specialized S-Works Tarmac SL7 from Liège-Bastogne-Liège</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-watch-live-stages-route-riders-teams-start-list\">Giro d’Italia 2023: Everything you need to know including route, favourites, how to watch and start list</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>2.

It begins with a 14.5km team time-trial around Saint-Vallier. Stage 2 is a flatter 91km route into Louhans as Stage 3 is a hillier affair over 97km from Val d’Epy to Saint-didier-sur-Charlaronne.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A total of 1,941m of climbing awaits the peloton on the 76km Stage 4 from Challes-les-Eaux to Megeve. The Queen Stage is the final day of racing, with 2,543m of elevation over 96km from Saint-Gervais-Mont-Blanc to Sainte Foy Tarentaise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The men’s Tour de l’Avenir has been running since 1961. It became an U23 event in 2007 and has been won by the likes of Egan Bernal and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tadej-pogacar\" target=\"_blank\">Tadej Pogačar</a>, who have experienced their fair share of success since.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4.
