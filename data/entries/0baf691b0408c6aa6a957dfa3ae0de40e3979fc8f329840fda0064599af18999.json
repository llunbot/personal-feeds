And we have three today that are perfect for those gift cards you got, with some of the best prices we’ve ever seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First up is the <strong>Apple Watch Series 10</strong>, Apple’s latest smartwatch with a slew of excellent health features and sensors to get your new year off on the right foot. It has a bigger display than the Series 9, a thinner design, and faster charging, as well as incredible health and life-saving features, including an ECG sensor, all-day heart-rate monitoring, a-fib warnings, sleep tracking, and fall and crash detection. And today <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-Smartwatch-Aluminium-Always/dp/B0DGHV8NLZ/\">Amazon has the Apple Watch on sale for just $329</a>, a savings of $70 and the lowest price we’ve ever seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, there’s the <strong>10th-gen iPad</strong>. While it hasn’t been updated since 2022, this iPad still represents the best value in Apple’s lineup by far, with a screen as large as the $599 iPad Air. You’ll also get a 12MP FaceTime camera with Center Stage, a USB-C charging port, and a modern design with bold colors. It’s a great bargain at its $349 MSRP but <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BJLT98Q7/\">Amazon’s price of $279</a> is a downright steal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, there’s the humble <strong>AirTag</strong>, which has one job—to keep track of your non-Apple gear and help you find it when lost. It uses Apple’s robust Find My network to pinpoint lost items and alerts you when you’ve left something behind so you won’t get too far away. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MX542LL-A-AirTag-Pack/dp/B0D54JZTHY/\">Amazon is selling a four-pack today for $73</a>, good for $26 off, not quite an all-time low but just a few dollars away from the best price we’ve ever seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"0baf691b0408c6aa6a957dfa3ae0de40e3979fc8f329840fda0064599af18999","category":"Apple"}
