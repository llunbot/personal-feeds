Now, she has released a second <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2024/07/02/australia-childrens-personal-photos-misused-power-ai-tools\">report</a>, flagging 190 photos of children from all of Australia’s states and territories, including indigenous children who may be particularly vulnerable to harms.</p>\n<p>These photos are linked in the dataset \"without the knowledge or consent of the children or their families.\" They span the entirety of childhood, making it possible for AI image generators to generate realistic deepfakes of real Australian children, Han's report said. Perhaps even more concerning, the URLs in the dataset sometimes reveal identifying information about children, including their names and locations where photos were shot, making it easy to track down children whose images might not otherwise be discoverable online.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035015#p3\">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2035015&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e3c501d7ecf2b896c4c8d3e6e550f1507016ef17f7aff299d5a8c041ef017c58","category":"Tech"}
