While we're not expecting much development on that front with the iPhone 17 models later this year, we may see some progress in 2026 with Face ID components moving under the screen and potentially the camera following in 2027.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Vision Pro 2 Rumored to Have Two Key Advantages Over Current Model</h2>\r<br />\nApple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/13/vision-pro-2-two-rumored-upgrades/\">next-generation Vision Pro will reportedly be both lighter and cheaper</a> than the current model, which has struggled to gain traction users since its debut early last year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/Midnight-Vision-Pro-Mock-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nA thinner and lighter design may also be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/16/apple-vision-air-rumored-with-new-design/\">accompanied by a new \"midnight\" finish</a> similar to the bluish-black color seen on several other Apple products. The color has been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/17/images-of-apple-vision-air-cable/\">seen in some alleged part leaks</a> in recent days.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Apple Plans to Release Delayed Apple Intelligence ‌Siri‌ Features This Fall</h2>\r<br />\nApple recently delayed the Apple Intelligence-powered Siri updates that had been expected to debut by the middle of this year, noting only that the features will now roll out \"in the coming year.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/iOS-18-Siri-Personal-Context.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nThat vague time frame has led some to assume the new features may not arrive until as far out as early 2026, but a new report claims <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/11/apple-delayed-siri-features-this-fall/\">Apple is aiming to release them this fall</a>, perhaps with the initial version of iOS 19 or in one of the early major updates to it.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>MacRumors Newsletter</h3>\r<br />\nEach week, we publish an email newsletter like this highlighting the top Apple stories, making it a great way to get a bite-sized recap of the week hitting all of the major topics we've covered and tying together related stories for a big-picture view.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSo if you want to have <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/macrumors/apr-17-2025\">top stories</a> like the above recap delivered to your email inbox each week, <b><a href=\"http://eepurl.com/OHdUX\">subscribe to our newsletter</a></b>!<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/top-stories/\">Top Stories</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/19/top-stories-iphone-17-pro-rumors-carplay-bug-fix-and-more/\">Top Stories: iPhone 17 Pro Rumors, CarPlay Bug Fix, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/top-stories-iphone-17-pro-rumors-carplay-bug-fix-and-more.2455622/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"MacRumors Staff","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8b96bf373f7358d5569b7260a7099167401f963f5cda0dad40f55bdd200b5914","category":"Apple"}
