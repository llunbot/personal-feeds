With the iOS 18.2 beta, that list is topped by a new Default Apps menu. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The menu lets you choose system default apps for Email, Messaging, Calling, Call Filtering, your default browser, default app for passwords and codes, and keyboards.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/default-apps.png?w=1200\" alt=\"iOS 18.2 default apps\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/default-apps.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 5386w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/default-apps.png?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/default-apps.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/default-apps.png?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/default-apps.png?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/default-apps.png?resize=2048%2C1152&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/default-apps.png?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/default-apps.png?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of these options existed before but were scattered in various other Settings menus. However, the Calling and Messaging categories are entirely new. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There donâ€™t appear to be any third-party apps yet that can be chosen as defaults in these categories, but that would likely come later as Apple releases new frameworks and apps update to use them.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"1fbaa11f9fa2f218cea5bae62621065fb98b8fc7eafa986c918d817ea751c28c","category":"Apple"}
