We have investigated every rumor and trend we could find to bring you our predictions. Read on to find out what could be in store.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Apple released in 2023</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple hit the ground running in 2023 with new Macs and a new HomePod in January. Then at <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/wwdc\">WWDC</a> in June the company launched no less than three new Macs and a brand new device – the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/557878/apple-vision-pro-release-date-headset-specs-price.html\">Vision Pro</a> – alongside revealing its plans for <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1670742/macos-14-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">macOS 14 Sonoma</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1519552/ios-17-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 17</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1792869/watchos-10-release-date-new-features.html\">watchOS 10</a>. Finally (maybe) Apple launched the new iPhone 15 series and the Apple Watch Series 8 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 at an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672537/no-new-ipad-air-mini-pro-2023.html\">event</a> in September and then made macOS Sonoma and iOS 17 available for customers to download later that month. Then at an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1064916/apple-october-event-date-time-mac-ipad.html\">Apple event on October 30</a> the company unveiled new MacBook Pro and iMac models.  </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/347466/mac-mini-design-processsor-price-release.html\">M2 Mac mini</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678527/mac-mini-pro.html\">Mac mini with M2 Pro</a> </li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/821143/2023-macbook-pro-m2-pro-max-release-price-specs.html\">14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro</a> with M2 Pro chip</li>\n\n\n\n<li>New <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1509062/homepod-2023-review.html\">full size HomePod</a> (bit of a surprise this one!) </li>\n\n\n\n<li>A larger <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/819516/15-inch-macbook-air-release-date-specs-rumors.html\">15-inch MacBook Air</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>A new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/347010/new-mac-pro-2023.html\">Mac Pro with the M2 Ultra</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>A <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1484944/mac-studio-m2-m3-max-ultra-release-date-price-specs.html\">new Mac Studio</a>, also with M2 Ultra and M2 Max.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1351959/iphone-15-plus-pro-max-specs-release-price.html\">iPhone 15</a>, Plus, Pro and Pro Max</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1472709/apple-watch-series-9-rumors-specs-features-price-release.html\">2023 Apple Watch Series 9 And Ultra 2</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1484743/24-inch-imac-release-date-specs-m2-m3-processor-price.html\">M3 iMac</a> </li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2111544/m3-macbook-pro-release-date-price-specs.html\">M3, M3 Pro and M3 Max MacBook Pro</a> (14-inch and 16-inch) </li>\n\n\n\n<li>And of course, the brand-new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/557878/apple-vision-pro-release-date-headset-specs-price.html\">Vision Pro</a> headset was unveiled (although it won’t arrive until 2024)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>What new Apple products are coming in 2024?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Just looking at 2023 gives us clues as to what must be coming in 2024. In 2023 no iPads were updated, we didn’t get M3 variants of the MacBook Air or Mac mini (despite the M3 becoming available) and only the AirPods Pro (and EarPods) got USB-C. It seems likely that in 2024 products will get similar updates. What else can we expect? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the sections below we’ve split products into categories including Mac, iPad, iPhone and some new product categories. Read on to find out what to expect at <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672537/apples-next-event.html\">Apple next event</a> the throughout the year. </p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"New Apple Products Apple Event September\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1246w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?resize=300%2C209&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?resize=768%2C535&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?resize=1200%2C836&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/New-Apple-Products-9-sept-event.jpg?resize=1240%2C868&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"836\" /><figcaption>The products Apple announced at the September 2022 event.</figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Macs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the update for the Mac Pro at WWDC in June 2023 Apple finished transitioning all its Macs from Intel processors to its own silicon. Apple launched the M3, M3 Pro and M3 Max chips at the end of October 2023, so we can expect the following updates soon: </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mac mini with M3 and M3 Pro</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that the iMac has an M3 chip, and the MacBook Pro an M3, M3 Pro and M3 Max chip, it is surely only a matter of time before those same chips make their way into the Mac mini. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2109165/m3-mac-mini-design-processor-specs-release-rumors.html\">New Mac mini rumors</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? <em>Spring</em> 2024</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>MacBook Air with M3 </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The rumors suggest that the MacBook Air update will come in the spring of 2024. We expect that both models will be getting the same M3 update as the 14-inch MacBook Pro did, but don’t expect to see the M3 Pro here. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2000691/13-15-inch-macbook-air-m3-release-date-specs-rumors-html.html\">M3 MacBook Air rumors</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? Spring 2024</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>iMac Pro M3 Pro</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a new iMac with M3 chip, but it’s still got a 24-inch screen. What people want is a return of a more professional iMac with a bigger screen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is said to be working on a Pro version of the iMac, a return of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/349270/imac-pro-release-date-display-price.html\">27-inch iMac Pro</a> perhaps. It sounds like an M3 Pro iMac might happen, but we could be waiting a little longer for that one.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/349270/imac-pro-release-date-display-price.html\">Larger iMac Pro rumors</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? Fall 2024, or 2025</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New iPads</h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://bilder.macwelt.de/4315300_original.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"iPad Pro\" loading=\"lazy\" /><figcaption>The iPad Pro</figcaption></figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski/IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>No iPads were updated in 2023 – the first time a year passed without an iPad update. There was one iPad that wasn’t even updated in 2022 – the iPad mini – so that looks the most likely for an imminent update. But there may be an upgrade coming to the iPad Air too. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPad mini </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A new iPad mini–seventh generation–could be coming soon. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678361/new-ipad-mini-7-2022-release-date-price-specs.html\">iPad mini 7th gen rumors</a> </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? Spring 2024</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPad Air </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPad Air could soon get an update to the M2 chip. There is also a rumor that we could see a larger iPad Air, perhaps 12.9 inches. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2110304/new-ipad-air-6-rumors-release-date.html\">iPad Air 6th gen rumors</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? <em><em>Spring 2024</em></em></em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bigger iPad Pro </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside an M3 upgrade there could be a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1835319/14-inch-ipad-pro-release-specs-features-price.html\">14-inch iPad Pro</a> coming from Apple. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? Fall 2024</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>11th gen iPad</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The 10th generation iPad joined the line up in October 2022 so a new model can be expected in 2024. The 9th gen model is likely to be retired, so perhaps Apple will continue to sell the 10th gen model, or lower the entry-level price for the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2158175/ipad-11th-gen-2024-release-date.html\">11th gen iPad</a> when it launches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? Fall 2024</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New iPhones </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The arrival of a new set of iPhones isn’t likely to happen before September 2024. There is a small chance we could see a new iPhone SE before then, but we think we won’t.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPhone 14 camera\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_2.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_2.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_2.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_2.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_2.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/iPhone-14-_-review_2.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" /></figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone 16 </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone 16 is likely to arrive, like clockwork, in September 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2007943/iphone-16-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">iPhone 16 rumors</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? September 2024</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone SE</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a long shot, but a few years ago now there were rumors that Apple could launch a bigger version of the iPhone SE Plus – which would mean that those who want a big iPhone and a Home button would still have an option. It’s a nice idea but we aren’t convinced this is in Apple’s sights now. Read about the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/674037/iphone-se-plus-postponed-until-2021.html\">iPhone SE Plus</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sadly, we can’t be sure there is a future for the iPhone SE at all. An update is said to be “unlikely” to come before 2025. If it arrives in a larger screen size and has no home button the people who are drawn to this iPhone will no doubt be disappointed. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1354114/iphone-se-4-design-specs-features-release-date.html\">iPhone SE rumors</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? Spring 2025</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New AirPods </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The AirPods Max are desperately in need of an update – being unable to play lossless audio right now, will they get an update in 2024? Unfortunately, there aren’t any noisy rumors about them right now. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are rumors about a new cheaper AirPods model, dubbed AirPods Lite by some. These are said to cost $99 and could arrive alongside 4th gen AirPods in the spring. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The wait for new AirPods Pro could stretch to 2025. They could offer new health-related features when they arrive. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673885/airpods-pro-lite-release-date-price-specs-rumours.html\">New AirPods rumors</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? Spring 2024</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Apple Watch </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We expect that Apple will launch an Apple Watch Series 10 and a third-generation Apple Watch Ultra in September 2024. Both will feature a new S10 chip. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A third-gen Apple Watch SE is also possible. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2157474/new-apple-watch-2024-release-date.html\">New Apple Watch 2024</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? Fall 2024</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New product categories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If Apple was never to innovate away from the products it makes right now it could be left behind as technology progresses. It’s no surprise therefore that the company is working on various new areas. We don’t expect these to land in 2023, but rumors suggest that some of them still could arrive sooner rather than later.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Vision Pro headset </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We know it’s a real thing because Apple showed off the Vision Pro mixed reality headset at WWDC in June 2023, but we are less sure when it will launch. Apple said “Early 2024”, but Apple doesn’t always meet its self-imposed deadlines.  At first it will only be available in the U.S. coming to other countries later in the year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read about <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/557878/apple-vision-pro-release-date-headset-specs-price.html\">Apple’s Vision Pro</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When? Spring 2024</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>HomePod with screen</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We do hope there is some truth in the rumors that Apple is working on a HomePod with a screen. We’ve always said that a screen would make the HomePod infinitely more usable, but perhaps we are the only ones who hate having to talk to our speaker.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A screen would extend the uses of the HomePod beyond audio into visual – so you could watch podcasts and news reports and YouTube videos, but most usefully communicate via FaceTime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far all Apple has done is brought back the full-size HomePod that it removed from sale. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676817/homepod-with-screen-rumours-and-release-date.html\">HomePod with screen rumours</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>When?
