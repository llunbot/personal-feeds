The change means several older iPhone models are no longer officially compatible with the app.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/General-YouTube-Feature-Redux.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThe affected devices are those that cannot upgrade beyond iOS 15 â€“ namely, the iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, and the first-generation iPhone SE. If you have an iPod touch 7, that will no longer run the app either.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLikewise, the YouTube app for iPad now requires iPadOS 16 or later, which means the app has discontinued support for the iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 4. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nUsers with these older devices can still access YouTube through their web browser by visiting m.youtube.com, but the experience won't match the native app's functionality.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/youtube/\">YouTube</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/03/youtube-ios-app-dropped-support-iphones/\">YouTube's iOS App Just Dropped Support for These iPhone Models</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/youtubes-ios-app-just-dropped-support-for-these-iphone-models.2458119/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"adde42cf950e51c006620f6d3c05165e2c9fdab7545fdde4a6e60334d6cd7d2e","category":"Apple"}
