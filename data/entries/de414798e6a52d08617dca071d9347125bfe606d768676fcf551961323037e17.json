In addition, the chart indicates the new Mac mini can be configured with up to 64GB of RAM, which is double the current 32GB limit for unified memory. Storage capacities for the Mac mini will apparently continue to max out at 8TB, like the previous model.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe chart includes a very tiny image of the new Mac mini that seemingly confirms the computer will feature two front-facing USB-C ports, as <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/02/new-m4-mac-mini-5-usb-c-ports/\">previously rumored</a>. It is possible these could be Thunderbolt 4 ports, but the chart does not specify. And is that a headphone jack on the front right? The image is a little too small and blurry to say for sure.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen shown side-by-side with the Mac Studio in the comparison chart, the new Mac mini also appears to be much smaller than the current model, as previously rumored. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s Mark Gurman said the computer would be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/08/mac-mini-to-become-smallest-ever-apple-computer/\">closer in size to an Apple TV</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/M4-Mac-Mini-Amazon-Leak.jpg\" width=\"920\" height=\"632\" />\r<br />\nHere is the full comparison chart:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/Amazon-Mac-Mini-M4-Leak.jpg\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1446\" />\r<br />\nUnfortunately for Space Black fans, the chart shows the next Mac mini will apparently be available in Silver only, like the current model.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is likely that the comparison chart graphic shown in Amazon's listing is provided by Apple, so the specifications are likely accurate.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple will likely announce the new Mac mini by Wednesday.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<strong>Update:</strong> Predictably, the comparison chart was removed from the Amazon listing minutes after we published, but it was likely authentic.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Mini\">Mac Mini (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-mini.146\">Mac mini</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/28/amazon-leaks-new-mac-mini/\">Amazon Leaks Smaller Mac Mini With M4 and M4 Pro Chips, Two Front USB-C Ports, Up to 64GB of RAM, and More</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/amazon-leaks-smaller-mac-mini-with-m4-and-m4-pro-chips-two-front-usb-c-ports-up-to-64gb-of-ram-and-more.2441219/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"de414798e6a52d08617dca071d9347125bfe606d768676fcf551961323037e17","category":"Apple"}
