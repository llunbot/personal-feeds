He also applauded Apple for introducing Log recording to its feature set, as well as the ability to save video directly to an external storage device. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn MKBHD's blind smartphone camera test that was run online, the iPhone 15 Pro was also found to capture the best low-light photos. An honorable mention in the category went to the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, for its stills camera performance when using the zoom lens. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nMeanwhile, the iPhone 15 Plus won the best battery category, which is judged not only on the biggest capacity, but the overall battery experience. The iPhone 15 was chosen for its less power-hungry 60Hz display that allows the device to keep going beyond most rivals. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nMKBHD said that the iPhone 15 Plus should be the choice for those looking for a \"risk-free, no-brainer\" device with great battery life. Brownlee also gave a shout-out to the ROG Phone 7, which does not have wireless charging but has the biggest battery capacity (6000 mAh) of any phone.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPhone of the Year went to the Google Pixel 8. Despite costing $100 more than its predecessor, Brownlee praised its great stills camera, dramatically better display, several excellent software features, and the promise of seven years of software updates.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll of the category winners for the MKBHD Smartphone Awards 2023 are as follows:\r<br />\n<div><span>Best Big Phone:</span><br />\r<br />\n<span>Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra</span><br />\r<br />\n<span>Best Compact Phone:</span><br />\r<br />\n<span>ASUS Zenfone 10</span><br />\r<br />\n<span>Best Camera:</span><br />\r<br />\n<span>iPhone 15 Pro</span><br />\r<br />\n<span>The Value Award:</span><br />\r<br />\n<span>Samsung Galaxy A54</span><br />\r<br />\n<span>Best Battery:</span><br />\r<br />\n<span>iPhone 15 Plus</span><br />\r<br />\n</div><div><span>The Design Award:</span><br />\r<br />\n<span>Honor Magic V2</span><br />\r<br />\n<span>Best Foldable Phone:</span><br />\r<br />\n<span>OnePlus Open</span><br />\r<br />\n<span>Most Improved:</span><br />\r<br />\n<span>Nothing Phone 2</span><br />\r<br />\n<span>Bust of the Year (Worst Phone):</span><br />\r<br />\n<span>Saga Solana Cryptophone</span><br />\r<br />\n<span>Phone of the Year:</span><br />\r<br />\n<span>Google Pixel 8</span><br />\r<br />\n</div>\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nYou can watch the full video of MKBHD's Smartphone Awards above and on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkRXhe3KaPE\">YouTube website</a>.
