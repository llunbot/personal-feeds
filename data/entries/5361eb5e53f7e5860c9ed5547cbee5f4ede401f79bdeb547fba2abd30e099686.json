There's a microSD slot—which will most likely be needed, as the phone has only 32GB of storage—and a headphone jack. The camera bump on the back is doing its best flagship impression, but in terms of hardware, you're getting one 13 MP camera, a 2 MP \"depth sensor,\" and an LED flash. The front camera is 5 MP.</p>\n<p>The body is all plastic. The front has a teardrop camera notch with a big chin at the button, but again, the phone is cheap. The Motorola logo on the back is also a fingerprint reader, which is a nice touch. The phone supports 2.4 and 5 GHz 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac and Bluetooth 5, but sadly, there's no NFC. The USB-C port supports 10 W charging, and the phone comes with Android 11.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1802386#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1802386&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5361eb5e53f7e5860c9ed5547cbee5f4ede401f79bdeb547fba2abd30e099686","category":"Tech"}
