We call it Apple Breakfast because we think it goes great with a Monday morning cup of coffee or tea, but it’s cool if you want to give it a read during lunch or dinner hours too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A Vision of the future</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn’t buy an Apple Vision Pro, but after trying out a demo at the Apple Store, I nearly did. Apple has got a lot right with its first headset and it’s easy to see a future where we’re all wearing Vision Pros instead of carrying iPhones, iPads, and Macs. Here are 10 things I learned about Apple’s next big thing:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Eye tracking is amazing</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the mouse, Click Wheel, and Multi-touch, the wow moment of Vision Pro is navigation. It starts with eye tracking, which is incredibly accurate and feels as natural as using a mouse to select apps and elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>It’s not as goofy in person</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When I walked into the Apple Store, there were already people using Vision Pro, and in person, it didn’t look nearly as weird as it does in pictures. It’s a lot like AirPods, which were also the butt of many jokes when people were photographed trying them on. But once you see it in person, it’s not so weird anymore.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>EyeSight is necessary</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of goofy, you’ve probably seen more than a few posts showing how not-great Apple’s EyeSight feature is. And I agree—it needs work. However, it’s absolutely necessary when you understand Apple’s, uh, vision for Vision Pro. Eventually, Vision Pro will be the thing we wear all the time and people are going to need to know when you’re looking at them. But before that happens, EyeSight needs to get a lot better.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>It’s more comfortable than I thought</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s no sugar-coating it—Vision Pro is very heavy. And most of the weight is in the front. But once I strapped it to my head—with the single Solo Knit Band—and went through some slight adjustments, it was surprisingly comfortable. There will definitely be some fatigue after a few hours of use, but considering how heavy it is, it’s actually quite comfortable.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Spatial videos are incredible</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I wasn’t quite prepared for how amazing spatial videos would be when watched on the Vision Pro. My demo played the same one I saw in the WWDC keynote, but when viewed using Vision Pro, they’re absolutely stunning. Watching the clip of a birthday party made me feel like I was there in a way regular 2D videos can’t convey. So even if you don’t have a Vision Pro yet, start taking spatial videos on your iPhone 15 Pro now so they’ll be ready when you get one.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The quality is stunning</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you’ve used other VR headsets, your eyes will be amazed by Vision Pro’s 23 million-pixel Micro‑OLED display. Whether you’re looking at panoramic photos, watching a 3D movie, or reading a webpage in Safari, you won’t see a single pixel. It’s like when the iPhone went Retina—everything else is just inferior.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>You can leave windows anywhere</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple Vision Pro isn’t really meant to be worn outside, but it is meant to be worn all around your house. And you can dock windows in rooms and places where you use them most. For example, a movie can be playing in the living room while Mail and Notes are in the office, and Notes are by the fridge. Spatial computing indeed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Panorama photos are truly panoramic</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve been taking panoramic photos on our iPhones for more than a decade, but they come alive on Vision Pro. Whether you’re traveling to faraway places or just showing off your backyard, panoramas will look absolutely stunning on the Vision Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The field of view is pretty small</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has been mum about Vision Pro’s field of view, but it appears to be about the same as the other VR headsets on the market—around 100 degrees. That’s not terrible, but it makes you very aware that you’re wearing a headset when you move to look at the side of an environment or immersive experience and promptly crash into a black bar. It’ll certainly improve, but for now, it’s fairly limiting.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>It’s the future, 1st-gen issues and all</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For a $3,499 device, Vision Pro certainly has its share of 1st-gen issues. So did the iPod, iPhone, and Mac. Apple can iron out some of the issues with software updates and Vision Pro 2 can address the rest. And like all of those devices, using it feels like stepping into the future. The world might not be ready for it quite yet, but in a few years, Vision Pro will be the device everyone needs.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://images.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3811721/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Apple Breakfast logo\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Trending: Top stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Jason Snell indulges in a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2222437/macworld-40th-anniversary.html\">spot of nostalgia</a> about 40 years of the Mac, and <strong>40 years of Macworld</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A flawed, ultra-niche product for $3,499 is <strong>one hell of a hard sell</strong>.
