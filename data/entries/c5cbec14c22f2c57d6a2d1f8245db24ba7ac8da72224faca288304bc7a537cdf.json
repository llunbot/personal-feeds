The new colors are also available for same-day pickup at select Apple Store locations in the United States and Canada.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/homepod-mini-color-bars.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe new HomePod mini colors will also be available to order in China, Hong Kong, Japan, and Taiwan starting at 6 p.m. Pacific Time today, and availability will expand to Australia, Austria, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Spain, and the UK later this month.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe first <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/01/real-world-photos-of-new-homepod-mini-colors/\">real-world photos and videos of the new HomePod mini colors</a> were shared earlier today. The new yellow, orange, and blue models all have color-matched woven power cables and volume icons, but there's still a plain old white Apple sticker in the box, along with a 20W USB-C power adapter.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nBeyond the new colors, there are no other hardware changes to the HomePod mini, and these remain first-generation models. Pricing remains at $99 for the new colors, and the existing space gray and white color options continue to be available.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod-mini/\">HomePod mini</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Homepod-Mini\">HomePod Mini (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/homepod-homekit-carplay-home-auto-technology.193\">HomePod, HomeKit, CarPlay, Home &amp; Auto Technology</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/01/new-homepod-mini-colors-now-available/\">New HomePod Mini Colors Now Available to Order and for Apple Store Pickup</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/new-homepod-mini-colors-now-available-to-order-and-for-apple-store-pickup.2321137/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=UvpYcgokmdk:gZ7Zrjg08KQ:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=UvpYcgokmdk:gZ7Zrjg08KQ:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/UvpYcgokmdk\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c5cbec14c22f2c57d6a2d1f8245db24ba7ac8da72224faca288304bc7a537cdf","category":"Apple"}
