The system will include built-in censorship and filtering capabilities to comply with Chinese government requirements. Meanwhile, Baidu will act as a secondary partner, handling features like Visual Intelligence for the upcoming iPhone 16.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Chinese version of Apple Intelligence will differ significantly from the one featured on US Apple devices. The US version combines on-device features, server-based processing (<a href=\"https://security.apple.com/blog/private-cloud-compute/\">Private Cloud Compute</a>), and ChatGPT integration. In contrast, the Chinese version will rely heavily on local partnerships. Alibaba's software will basically be an intermediary layer that allows government-directed content filtering without the user knowing it.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe AI features that result from the partnership will only be available on Apple devices sold within China, while devices purchased elsewhere and brought into the country won't have access to the local AI system. Apple has reportedly submitted materials to Chinese authorities for approval, but it still faces some regulatory hurdles before the features can be launched.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe combined effort comes as Apple faces declining sales in China, its largest market outside the US, where local smartphone brands have gained market share partly thanks to their AI offerings.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/\">China</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/14/apple-intelligence-plan-for-china-report/\">Apple Intelligence Plan for China Detailed in New Report</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-intelligence-plan-for-china-detailed-in-new-report.2449364/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"acf43414633defd92d28eca2bd347ef1d63f8ee9f592b607f353661a1e8ab494","category":"Apple"}
