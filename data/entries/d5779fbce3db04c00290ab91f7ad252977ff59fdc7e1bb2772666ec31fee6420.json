Their system tackles some types of abstract pattern-matching tasks using only the puzzles themselves, challenging conventional wisdom about how machine learning systems acquire problem-solving abilities.</p>\n<p>\"Can lossless information compression by itself produce intelligent behavior?\" ask <a href=\"https://iliao2345.github.io/\">Isaac Liao</a>, a first-year PhD student, and his advisor Professor <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DVCHv1kAAAAJ&amp;hl=en\">Albert Gu</a> from CMU's Machine Learning Department. Their work suggests the answer might be yes. To demonstrate, they created <a href=\"https://github.com/iliao2345/CompressARC\">CompressARC</a> and published the results in a <a href=\"https://iliao2345.github.io/blog_posts/arc_agi_without_pretraining/arc_agi_without_pretraining.html\">comprehensive post</a> on Liao's website.</p>\n<p>The pair tested their approach on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (<a href=\"https://arcprize.org/arc\">ARC-AGI</a>), an unbeaten visual benchmark created in 2019 by machine learning researcher <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Chollet\">Fran√ßois Chollet</a> to test AI systems' abstract reasoning skills. ARC presents systems with grid-based image puzzles where each provides several examples demonstrating an underlying rule, and the system must infer that rule to apply it to a new example.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/compression-conjures-apparent-intelligence-in-new-puzzle-solving-ai-approach/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/compression-conjures-apparent-intelligence-in-new-puzzle-solving-ai-approach/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d5779fbce3db04c00290ab91f7ad252977ff59fdc7e1bb2772666ec31fee6420","category":"Tech"}
