The feature was confirmed to be operational on the LG GX OLED TV from the 2020 lineup, with expectations that it will work on all LG TVs that are compatible with Dolby Atmos from 2020 onwards.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile the TV's built-in speakers can utilize this new capability, LG suggests that the best audio experience is achieved with a compatible surround sound system, which can take advantage of the Dolby Atmos technology more effectively.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe update to the ‌Apple Music‌ app on LG TVs circumvents the necessity for additional Apple hardware. Before this update, ‌Apple Music‌'s Dolby Atmos support was available on TVs singularly through the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> 4K, paired with either Apple's HomePods or Sonos speakers connected through the Sonos app. Other smart TV manufacturers are likely to follow suit and add support for Dolby Atmos in their own ‌Apple Music‌ apps. <div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lg/\">LG</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dolby-atmos/\">Dolby Atmos</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/01/lg-tv-support-for-apple-music-dolby-atmos/\">LG TVs Gain Support for Dolby Atmos With Apple Music</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/lg-tvs-gain-support-for-dolby-atmos-with-apple-music.2425255/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"7b88fcb97fb3941bfcef79c7f2ea722bc86bd4597c2d8077bb99989a644b7520","category":"Apple"}
