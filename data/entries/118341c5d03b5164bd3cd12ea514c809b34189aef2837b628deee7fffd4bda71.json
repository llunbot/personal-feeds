{"title":"'Unleashed' Apple Event Focusing on New Macs to Take Place on October 18","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/12/apple-event-unleashed-october-18/","date":1634054877000,"content":"Apple today announced that it will be holding <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-events/\">a special event</a> on Monday, October 18 at 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time. The event is set to take place at the Steve Jobs Theater on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-park/\">Apple Park</a> campus in Cupertino, California, and it will once again be a digital only event.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/apple-event-unleashed.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen there are a lot of products coming in the fall months, Apple often holds a second October or November event, which is the case in 2021. Rumors have been teasing redesigned 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pro models for months now, and it's looking like Apple is finally ready to release them.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><blockquote><p>Unleashed! These next six days are going to speed by. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/AppleEvent?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#AppleEvent</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/0ops2bVPvl\">pic.twitter.com/0ops2bVPvl</a></p>— Greg Joswiak (@gregjoz) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gregjoz/status/1447956519132151810?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 12, 2021</a></blockquote> </div>\r\n<br />\r\nRumors suggest the 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pro models will have an overhauled design with thinner bezels and larger displays, and we've already seen hints of 3024 x 1964 and 3456 x 2234 resolutions, respectively, which would enable 2x Retina for sharper, crisper images and text. The new MacBook Pro will use an M1X chip, which is an faster, more powerful version of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m1/\">M1</a>, plus it could support up to 32GB RAM.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/08/M1X-MBP-Feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe new MacBook Pro will mark the return of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a> connectivity, a charging feature that will replace USB-C. Apple is also bringing back the HDMI port and SD card slot, and there will be no Touch Bar, with Apple instead re-adopting a standard function row of keys. The 2021 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a> models will be a throwback to the pre-2016 MacBook Pro designs, with Apple undoing many of the changes that we're introduced with the 2016 revamp.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWe thought the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods/\">AirPods</a> 3 might come out at Apple's September event because it makes sense to unveil ‌AirPods‌ alongside iPhones, but that didn't happen, so we could instead see them at the second fall event. The new ‌‌AirPods‌‌ will have shorter ‌‌AirPods‌‌ Pro-like stems and an ‌AirPods‌ Pro-style case, but will continue to be a more affordable option without Active Noise Cancellation.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/01/AirPods-Gen-3-Feature.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nWe'll likely find out when <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-12/\">macOS Monterey</a> is going to launch, and Apple could also have some surprises like an M1X version of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-mini/\">Mac mini</a> in store, but aside from MacBook Pro models and ‌AirPods‌ 3, we haven't heard rumors of anything else coming out this year.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div></div>\r\n<br />\r\nApple plans to stream the fall event <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-events/\">live on its website</a>, on YouTube, and on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> through the ‌‌Apple TV‌‌ app. For those unable to watch, MacRumors will be providing full event coverage both on MacRumors.com and the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/macrumorslive\">MacRumorsLive Twitter account</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro-13/\">MacBook Pro 13\"</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-pro/\">MacBook Pro 16\"</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-event/\">Apple event</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_13\">13\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Pro_16\">16\" MacBook Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-pro.90\">MacBook Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/12/apple-event-unleashed-october-18/\">'Unleashed' Apple Event Focusing on New Macs to Take Place on October 18</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/unleashed-apple-event-focusing-on-new-macs-to-take-place-on-october-18.2316608/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=GqkxdlhYu1k:eNuQd3UzpZ4:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=GqkxdlhYu1k:eNuQd3UzpZ4:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/GqkxdlhYu1k\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"118341c5d03b5164bd3cd12ea514c809b34189aef2837b628deee7fffd4bda71","category":"Apple"}
