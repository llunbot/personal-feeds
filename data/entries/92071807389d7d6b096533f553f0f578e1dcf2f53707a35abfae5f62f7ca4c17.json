It’s still high performance, but with clearance for 40mm tires, confident handling, and a less extreme riding position.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fiftyone-sika-all-road-bike-1.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1025\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fiftyone-sika-all-road-bike-1-1536x1025.jpg\" alt=\"fiftyone sika road bike shown from side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fiftyone-sika-all-road-bike-1-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fiftyone-sika-all-road-bike-1-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fiftyone-sika-all-road-bike-1-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fiftyone-sika-all-road-bike-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fiftyone-sika-all-road-bike-1-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fiftyone-sika-all-road-bike-1-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fiftyone-sika-all-road-bike-1.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But, Duff says that doesn’t make it an “endurance” bike, that it’s very much a performance road bike. It gets aero touches, high bottom bracket stiffness, and is very light. Claimed weight is just 690g!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fiftyone-sika-all-road-bike-7.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1137\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fiftyone-sika-all-road-bike-7-1536x1137.jpg\" alt=\"fiftyone sika road bike shown from front and rear\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fiftyone-sika-all-road-bike-7-1536x1137.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fiftyone-sika-all-road-bike-7-297x220.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fiftyone-sika-all-road-bike-7-120x89.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fiftyone-sika-all-road-bike-7-768x569.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fiftyone-sika-all-road-bike-7.jpg 2025w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That makes sub-7kg complete bike builds, with pedals, entirely possible. Duff said being ultra lightweight wasn’t the goal, but a careful selection of high-level Toray fibers let them hit their stiffness goals, use aero-optimized tube shapes, and still make it really light.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fiftyone-sika-all-road-bike-8.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1025\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fiftyone-sika-all-road-bike-8-1536x1025.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of fiftyone sika road bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fiftyone-sika-all-road-bike-8-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fiftyone-sika-all-road-bike-8-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fiftyone-sika-all-road-bike-8-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fiftyone-sika-all-road-bike-8-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fiftyone-sika-all-road-bike-8-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fiftyone-sika-all-road-bike-8-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fiftyone-sika-all-road-bike-8.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fiftyone-sika-all-road-bike-5.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1137\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fiftyone-sika-all-road-bike-5-1536x1137.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of fiftyone sika road bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fiftyone-sika-all-road-bike-5-1536x1137.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fiftyone-sika-all-road-bike-5-297x220.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fiftyone-sika-all-road-bike-5-120x89.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fiftyone-sika-all-road-bike-5-768x569.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fiftyone-sika-all-road-bike-5.jpg 2025w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Ride quality is enhanced by the larger tires (if you want them, it works great with 28-32mm tires, too), plus a standard round 27.2 seatpost and added fork compliance. Their “real rider” geometry gives it a bit shorter reach and chainstays that are a few millimeters longer than what you’d find on a race bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fiftyone-sika-all-road-bike-9.jpg\"><img width=\"1536\" height=\"1025\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fiftyone-sika-all-road-bike-9-1536x1025.jpg\" alt=\"closeup details of fiftyone sika road bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fiftyone-sika-all-road-bike-9-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fiftyone-sika-all-road-bike-9-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fiftyone-sika-all-road-bike-9-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fiftyone-sika-all-road-bike-9-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fiftyone-sika-all-road-bike-9-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fiftyone-sika-all-road-bike-9-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/fiftyone-sika-all-road-bike-9.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The one-piece bar/stem is their first in-house cockpit design. It has NACA airfoil shaping with a slightly 3º backsweep to make it and you a little more aerodynamic. All cables and hoses run internally for a full stealth look.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, it uses a T47 threaded BB and a UDH hanger for solid future component compatibility and easy service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Framesets retail for priced €4,500 / $4,500 / £3,950. They come with a lifetime warranty and are UCI-approved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.fiftyonebikes.com\" target=\"_blank\">FiftyOneBikes.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/fiftyone-sika-road-bike/\">FiftyOne Sika is a 690g pro-level road bike for real riders</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"92071807389d7d6b096533f553f0f578e1dcf2f53707a35abfae5f62f7ca4c17","category":"Cycling"}
