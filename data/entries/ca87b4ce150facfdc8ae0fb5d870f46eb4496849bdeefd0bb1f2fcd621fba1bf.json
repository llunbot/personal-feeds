For the most part, it’s a continuation of the steep discounts on MacBooks, iPads, and Apple Watches that knocked up to $250 off the latest gear. But even if your wallet is feeling the pinch, you can still snag some excellent deals without spending big bucks. Here are our favorite Cyber Monday deals under $100.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>AirTags 4-pack: $80 ($20 off)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>AirTags are the unsung hero of Apple’s accessory line, packing tremendous utility into a tiny, $29 disc. Apple normally sells a four-pack for $99, bringing the price down to $25 apiece but <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MX542AM-A-AirTag-Pack/dp/B0932QJ2JZ?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Amazon is selling it for $80</a>, knocking the per-AirTag cost down to just $20. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Magic Mouse (in black): $89 ($10 off)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We have our quibbles with the Magic Mouse—mainly, why is the charging port on the underside and why is it still Lightning—but if you need a mouse for home or the road, you won’t find many better or better-looking. Today <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Magic-Mouse-Wireless-Rechargable/dp/B09V4LZS9S?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">the best color is on sale for the best price we’ve ever seen: $89</a>, good for a savings of $10. It’s not much but Apple rarely discounts it mice and ever more rarely discounts the black one.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apple Pencil: $71-$79 (up to $50 off)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter which iPad you have, it’ll be better with an Apple Pencil. And today they’re all on sale—<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Pencil-1st-Generation-Adapter/dp/B0BJLG69QR?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">the 1st-gen is $20 off</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MU8F2AM-A-Pencil-Generation/dp/B07K1WWBJK?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">the 2nd-gen is $50 off</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MU8F2AM-A-Pencil-Generation/dp/B0CL7J12YK?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">the new USB-C model is $8 off</a>. Just make sure you <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211029&amp;xcust=1-1-2155830-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">check compatibility</a> before you buy one because it gets tricky.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apple Gift card ($100)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>OK, this one technically costs $100, but if you <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Gift-Card-accessories-Delivery/dp/B08F3C99KN/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">buy a $100 electronic Apple gift card at Amazon today</a> you’ll get a $15 promotional credit added to your account for a future Amazon purchase. Use the code <strong>APPLET5USA</strong> at checkout.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apple 35W charger ($44)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are plenty of options on Amazon for chargers that will fast-charge your iPhone while filling up your MacBook Air, but the dual USB-C port compact charger made by Apple is one of the best. At its full $59 MSRP it’s a little steep—but <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-USB-C-Compact-Power-Adapter/dp/B0B3C493HH?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">we love it at its Cyber Monday discount</a> that brings it down to $44. </p>\n\nApple Inc</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"ca87b4ce150facfdc8ae0fb5d870f46eb4496849bdeefd0bb1f2fcd621fba1bf","category":"Apple"}
