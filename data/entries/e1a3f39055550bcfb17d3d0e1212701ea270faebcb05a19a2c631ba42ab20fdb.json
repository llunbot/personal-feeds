The event is set to start at 10:00 a.m., and select members of the media have been invited to attend.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/08/glowtime-event.jpg\" width=\"2361\" height=\"1328\" />\r<br />\nThis year's event will see Apple unveil the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> lineup, new Apple Watch models, and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-4/\">AirPods 4</a>, plus we'll get official launch dates for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/\">macOS Sequoia</a>, and Apple's other software updates.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll four of the new iPhones are expected to have the customizable Action Button and a new Capture Button for taking photos that will have built-in gestures, such as a swipe for zooming in and out or a soft press for autofocus. The Capture Button will be on the right side of the devices below the power button.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>We’re glowing with excitement!

No other major new features are expected for the standard ‌iPhone 16‌ models, but the Pro lineup will get an increase in display size, going from 6.1 and 6.7 inches to 6.3 and 6.9 inches, respectively, for the Pro and Pro Max. Both models will also include the 5x Telephoto zoom option that was exclusive to the Pro Max last year. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor the Apple Watch, the standard Series 10 is expected to feature a thinner design with a larger display, but the change won't be radical. Apple also plans to refresh the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/\">Apple Watch SE</a> and the Apple Watch Ultra, and we could see new health features such as sleep apnea detection and blood pressure monitoring, but it is not yet entirely clear if Apple will have them ready in time for this year's launch.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere are two models of the ‌AirPods 4‌ coming, one that's a direct successor to the current <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods 3</a> and one that's a step up with support for Active Noise Cancellation at a non-Pro price. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple plans to stream the fall event <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/apple-events/\">live on its website</a>, on YouTube, and through the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a> app. For those unable to watch, MacRumors will be providing full event coverage on MacRumors.com and the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/macrumorslive\">MacRumorsLive Twitter account</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods 3</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 9</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-se/\">Apple Watch SE</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16-pro/\">iPhone 16 Pro</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/september-2024-apple-event/\">September 2024 Apple Event</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_SE\">Apple Watch SE (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra\">Apple Watch Ultra (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/26/apple-september-9-iphone-event/\">Apple Event Announced for September 9: 'It's Glowtime'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-event-announced-for-september-9-its-glowtime.2434429/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e1a3f39055550bcfb17d3d0e1212701ea270faebcb05a19a2c631ba42ab20fdb","category":"Apple"}
