Initial production at both suppliers <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/16/oled-ipad-displays-enter-production/\">started last month</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIndustry insiders suggest the division of labor is due to changes in Apple's demand outlook for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/oled-ipad-pro/\">OLED iPad Pro</a> models, as well as the unstable production capacity and yield of the two suppliers, which are both still getting to grips with Apple's requirement for new panel technologies. Apple is rumored to be aiming for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/12/oled-ipad-lightweight-design-and-image-quality/\">\"unrivaled\" image quality</a>, as well as a design that cuts down on the thickness and weight of the ‌<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>‌ display.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to the Korean-language report, the situation may change after production of the initial quantity, depending on fluctuations in production yield and possible adjustments to Apple's demand forecast for the new ‌OLED ‌iPad‌ Pro‌ models. Apple's shipments forecast for the year have reportedly decreased to 8 million units, down from the 10 million units that were projected for 2024 last year. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nOLED displays are a first for the ‌‌iPad‌‌ lineup. Apple has been using OLED technology for the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and the Apple Watch, but larger OLED screens are more expensive. Compared to LED or mini-LED, OLED brings deeper blacks and more vivid colors. The OLED ‌‌iPad Pro‌‌ models could be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/upcoming-oled-ipad-pro-thinner/\">much thinner</a> than the current LED versions thanks to the new display technology. The larger 12.9-inch ‌‌iPad Pro‌‌, for example, could be more than 1mm thinner.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAlong with new displays, the ‌‌iPad Pro‌‌ models are expected to be powered by Apple's latest M3 chip, which debuted in new MacBook Pro models last year. The M3 is built on 3-nanometer technology, and should bring a notable graphics improvement over the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/m2/\">M2</a> chip that is currently used in the ‌‌iPad Pro‌‌. \r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/23/how-much-oled-ipad-pro-models-cost/\">How Much Will Apple's OLED iPad Pro Models Cost?</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nThe new displays are expected to come to the ‌iPad Pro‌ models <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/28/gurman-new-ipads-and-macs-in-late-march/\">as soon as March 2024</a>.
