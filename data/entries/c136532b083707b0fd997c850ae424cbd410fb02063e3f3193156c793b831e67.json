The electric vehicle maker, which once dominated EV sales in the region, is facing sales declines of more than 50 percent in France, the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, and the UK. Sales in Germany weren't quite as bad—they fell by 46 percent in April, with slightly smaller decreases in Portugal and Spain. Only Italy and Norway saw any kind of sales growth.</p>\n<p>The headwinds were already looking unfavorable for Tesla even before CEO Elon Musk <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/05/after-two-court-losses-doge-asks-supreme-court-for-social-security-data-access/\">threw his lot in</a> with Donald Trump and his <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/05/in-his-first-100-days-trump-launched-an-all-out-assault-on-the-environment/\">authoritarian makeover</a> of the US government.

But Tesla's sales fell by 62 percent—the automaker registered just 512 cars all month. For context, 120,331 new cars were registered in the UK <a href=\"https://www.smmt.co.uk/vehicle-data/car-registrations/\">last month</a>, of which 24,558 were BEVs.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/tesla-sales-fall-by-62-in-the-uk-46-in-germany/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2025/05/tesla-sales-fall-by-62-in-the-uk-46-in-germany/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
