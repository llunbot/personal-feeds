It’s easy to turn on while idly playing with the keyboard or when a child or cat is swatting at it without intent. When enabled, Mouse Keys enables part of the keyboard’s use or a number pad on an extended keyboard to allow pointer movement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With macOS Ventura, Apple moved the setting necessary to prevent Mouse Keys from ever unintentionally activating. Here’s how to adjust it.</p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div><div><div>At a glance </div></div><ul><li><span>Time to complete: </span><span>  3 minutes</span></li><li>Tools required: macOS Ventura</li></ul></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div><span>1.</span>\n<h3>Accessibility System Settings</h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ventura-pointer-control.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Ventura Pointer Control\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Go to  &gt; <em>System Settings</em> &gt; <em>Accessibility</em> &gt; <em>Pointer Control</em>.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div><span>2.</span>\n<h3>Pointer Control &gt; Mouse Keys</h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ventura-mouse-keys.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Ventura Mouse Keys\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Click the i (info) button to the right of Mouse Keys.

However, not long after, I idly pressed the Option key five times. I went back to the setting above and found it enabled, even though I’d turned it off. Turning it off <em>again</em> this time seemed to block Mouse Keys from recognized the five presses of the Option key.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This Mac 911 article is in response to a question submitted by Macworld reader Jennifer.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ask Mac 911</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve compiled a list of the questions we get asked most frequently, along with answers and links to columns: <a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/3077986/os-x/your-top-questions-to-mac-911-and-some-answers.html\">read our super FAQ</a> to see if your question is covered.
