The Presta valve-integrated digital tire pressure sensor gets a new, low profile design. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lying almost flat against the rim, it is arguably positioned in a less vulnerable spot in respect to any wayward rocks and stones that are picked up by the bike as you ride along. And, it also means the TyreWiz 2.0 has better compatibility with a wider variety of rim depths.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/zipp-1zero-hiptop-carbon-rim-sw-wheel.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/zipp-1zero-hiptop-carbon-rim-sw-wheel-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"zipp wheel with quarq tyrewiz 2.0 against rim\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/zipp-1zero-hiptop-carbon-rim-sw-wheel-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/zipp-1zero-hiptop-carbon-rim-sw-wheel-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/zipp-1zero-hiptop-carbon-rim-sw-wheel-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/zipp-1zero-hiptop-carbon-rim-sw-wheel-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/zipp-1zero-hiptop-carbon-rim-sw-wheel-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/zipp-1zero-hiptop-carbon-rim-sw-wheel-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/zipp-1zero-hiptop-carbon-rim-sw-wheel.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>TyreWiz 2.0 sits flat against the rim, and is compatible with more rim depths</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>TyreWiz 2.0</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Accuracy: +/- 2%</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Resolution: 0.1 PSI</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Waterproof and dust proof rating: IPX7</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Power Source: CR1632 Coin Cell Batteries</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Claimed Weight: 10 grams each</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Warranty: 2 Years</li>\n\n\n\n<li>ANT+ and Bluetooth Compatible for Connection to Head Units (Garmin, Hammerhead, etc)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Quarq-TyreWiz_realtime-electronic-tire-pressure-measurement-monitoring-tracking_angled-rendering.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Quarq-TyreWiz_realtime-electronic-tire-pressure-measurement-monitoring-tracking_angled-rendering-600x360.jpg\" alt=\"quarq tyrewiz original mark 1\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Quarq-TyreWiz_realtime-electronic-tire-pressure-measurement-monitoring-tracking_angled-rendering-600x360.jpg 600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Quarq-TyreWiz_realtime-electronic-tire-pressure-measurement-monitoring-tracking_angled-rendering-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Quarq-TyreWiz_realtime-electronic-tire-pressure-measurement-monitoring-tracking_angled-rendering-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Quarq-TyreWiz_realtime-electronic-tire-pressure-measurement-monitoring-tracking_angled-rendering-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Quarq-TyreWiz_realtime-electronic-tire-pressure-measurement-monitoring-tracking_angled-rendering-696x418.jpg 696w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Quarq-TyreWiz_realtime-electronic-tire-pressure-measurement-monitoring-tracking_angled-rendering-1068x641.jpg 1068w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Quarq-TyreWiz_realtime-electronic-tire-pressure-measurement-monitoring-tracking_angled-rendering-700x420.jpg 700w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Quarq-TyreWiz_realtime-electronic-tire-pressure-measurement-monitoring-tracking_angled-rendering-1920x1152.jpg 1920w\" /></a><figcaption>The <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/quarq-tyrewiz-dials-in-speed-via-realtime-tire-pressure-measurement/\">original Quarq TyreWiz</a> stood proud of the rim</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In essence, the TyreWiz 2.0 performs exactly as its predecessor did, measuring tire pressure in real-time. Via the SRAM AXS App, the rider sets their preferred tire pressure; let’s say 22 PSI, for example. When the TyreWiz 2.0 sensor reads the tire pressure at 22 PSI, the LED on the device will blink green. When it falls below 22 PSI, or goes above it, the LED will flash red. A slow flash means the pressure has dropped, and a faster flash means the pressure is too high.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A CR1632 coin cell battery powers the TyreWiz 2.0 for up to 200 hours. The device automatically switches itself off when the bike is not in use. Then, when the built-in accelerometer detects movement again, it switches itself back on, and blinks green or red accordingly. That way, you’ll know if your tire pressures are set correctly just moments after picking the bike up to go ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/zipp-1zero-hi-top-sw-wheels-30mm-internal-width-rims-carbon.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/zipp-1zero-hi-top-sw-wheels-30mm-internal-width-rims-carbon-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"tyrewiz 2.0 tyre pressure gauge lives on rim presta valve integrated\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/zipp-1zero-hi-top-sw-wheels-30mm-internal-width-rims-carbon-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/zipp-1zero-hi-top-sw-wheels-30mm-internal-width-rims-carbon-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/zipp-1zero-hi-top-sw-wheels-30mm-internal-width-rims-carbon-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/zipp-1zero-hi-top-sw-wheels-30mm-internal-width-rims-carbon-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/zipp-1zero-hi-top-sw-wheels-30mm-internal-width-rims-carbon-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/zipp-1zero-hi-top-sw-wheels-30mm-internal-width-rims-carbon-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/zipp-1zero-hi-top-sw-wheels-30mm-internal-width-rims-carbon.jpg 1600w\" /></a><figcaption>We are told the TyreWiz 2.0 is compatible with all tire sealants</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The TyreWiz 2.0 stands to save riders time in that regard, and it can also alert the rider earlier to a slow puncture so they can take action earlier. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news that comes with this 2.0 version is the improved compatibility with differing rim depths. With a universal rim adapter and multiple valve lengths (1-80.2mm), there should be a TyreWiz 2.0 for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pricing &amp; Availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A pair of TyreWiz 2.0 pressure sensors retails at $120 USD (£130 // 145€) and are sold with a 2-year warranty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.sram.com/en/quarq/series/tyrewiz\">sram.com/tyrewiz</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/quarq-tyrewiz-2-lies-flat-improved-rim-compatibility/\">Quarq TyreWiz 2.0 Sensors Sit Flush, Now Compatible with More Rim Depths</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Jessie-May Morgan","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"e22d256b5dd4135d44326cb8a2be35cacd9dc23026a75d7ca94d7e3a079c0cea","category":"Cycling"}
