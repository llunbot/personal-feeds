However, Apple refused to comply.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn response, rather than granting the requested access, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/21/apple-pulls-encrypted-icloud-security-feature-uk/\">withdrew Advanced Data Protection from the UK</a>, ensuring it would not be required to provide decryption capabilities. Advanced Data Protection offers end-to-end encryption for iPhone, iPad, and Mac users' data stored in iCloud. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple subsequently <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/04/apple-legal-complaint-uk-backdoor/\">lodged a legal complaint</a> to the IPT. \"We have never built a back door or master key to any of our products, and we never will,\" Apple said at the time. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nNow Privacy International and Liberty have done the same. The groups argue that Apple's appeal should be heard in public, and that ordering Apple to compromise the security of its products breaches its customers' free expression and privacy rights.\r<br />\n<blockquote>\"The UK's use of a secret order to undermine security for people worldwide is unacceptable and disproportionate,\" said Caroline Wilson Palow, legal director at Privacy International. \"People the world over rely on end-to-end encryption to protect themselves from harassment and oppression. No country should have the power to undermine that protection for everyone.\"</blockquote><blockquote>\"It would be an entirely reckless and unprecedented move from the UK government to open up a back door to this data, and one that will have global consequences,\" said Akiko Hart, Liberty’s director. \"We need concrete guarantees from the UK government that they won’t proceed with these plans.\"</blockquote>The matter is being considered at a closed hearing of the tribunal at the High Court on Friday. Apple is not able to discuss the order made by the UK in public due to the terms of the law.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSeveral UK media organizations, including the <em>BBC</em>, <em>Reuters</em>, <em>Sky News</em> and the publishers of <em>The Guardian</em>, <em>The Times</em>, <em>The Telegraph</em>, <em>Computer Weekly</em> and <em>Financial Times</em>, have also made a submission to the IPT arguing that the Apple case should not be heard in private.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe US government is also looking into whether the UK's demand has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/27/us-probes-uk-apple-backdoor-treaty-violation/\">violated the CLOUD act</a>, which keeps the UK from asking for data from US citizens, and vice versa.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn a February interview with <em><a href=\"https://thespectator.com/topic/spectator-interview-president-donald-trump-full-transcript/\">The Spectator</a></em>, US president Donald Trump said he confronted UK prime minister Keir Starmer over the move and compared it with Chinese government surveillance.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"We told them you can't do this,\" Trump said. \"We actually told [Starmer]... that's incredible. That's something, you know, that you hear about with China.\"<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/encryption/\">Encryption</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-kingdom/\">United Kingdom</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/14/activist-groups-challenge-uk-apple-backdoor/\">Activist Groups Challenge UK Demand for Apple Encryption Backdoor</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/activist-groups-challenge-uk-demand-for-apple-encryption-backdoor.2453098/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"29a301bcf4e81f91efb00f558282f44e604ff9dcbe2a809c8eb0852e21aa75a4","category":"Apple"}
