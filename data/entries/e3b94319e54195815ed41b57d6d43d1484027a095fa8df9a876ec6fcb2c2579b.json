This includes a special Family calendar created by default and shared with all participants.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mac911-family-calendar-details.png\" alt width=\"291\" height=\"119\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mac911-family-calendar-details.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 552w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mac911-family-calendar-details.png?resize=300%2C123&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w\" /><figcaption>The Family calendar offers no choices.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>A Macworld reader wondered if that Family calendar could have a change in ownership. It cannot. The person who originally set up the Family Sharing group is called the Organizer. While they can anoint other members of the group as a Parent/Guardian, they cannot transfer Organizer status. Apple says the only way to change the Organizer is to disband the virtual family and have the new preferred Organizer create a new Family Sharing group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, you can simulate a Family calendar quite easily in iCloud. Here’s how to do it in macOS.</p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div><div><div>At a glance </div></div><ul><li><span>Time to complete: </span><span>  5 minutes</span></li><li>Tools required: Calendar app in macOS</li></ul></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div><span>1.</span>\n<h3>Create a new calendar</h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/new-calendar-macos.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"new calendar macOS\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Choose <em>File &gt; New Calendar. </em>A new calendar should appear in the iCloud section of the Calendar app’s left column.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div><span>2.</span>\n<h3>Name the Calendar</h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/calendsr-name.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"calendar name\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>In the calendars sidebar, name the calendar descriptively, like “Family 2.0.”</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div><span>3.</span>\n<h3>Calendar details</h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/calendar-profile.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"calendar profile\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Hover over the calendar’s name in the sidebar and click the person in a circle icon that appears.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div><span>4.</span>\n<h3>Add members</h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/calendar-members.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"calendar members\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>In the <em>Share With</em> field, enter each family member’s name in turn and click <em>Done</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>iCloud automatically sends invites to each person who can accept it and have the privilege to modify the calendar.
