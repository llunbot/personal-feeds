Similar code was <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1640512011514650624&amp;xcust=1-1-1785305-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">found</a> referencing <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1674426/apple-pay-later-available-randomly-selected-users.html\">Apple Pay Later</a> before it launched in a prerelease capacity last month. That service is only available to randomly selected users in the U.S.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>After re-examining the backend code, it seems like Apple Card Savings Accounts may go live on April 17<br /><br />Additionally, it seems like the customized Chinese Apple Pay transit cards may go live on April 18 <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://t.co/ljJxjqaIFy&amp;xcust=1-1-1785305-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">https://t.co/ljJxjqaIFy</a></p>— Aaron (@aaronp613) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1646521373458849795?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-1785305-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">April 13, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, even if it launches in full, Apple Card Savings won’t be available to everyone once it arrives. It requires opening a separate Goldman Sachs savings account that will have its own eligibility requirements. However, there are “no fees, no minimum deposits, and no minimum balance requirements,” according to Apple. Users will also be able to have Daily Cash deposit automatically into Apple Card Savings and link outside bank accounts to transfer funds. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple hasn’t announced the interest rate for Apple Card Savings, but it’s likely to be significantly higher than the national average of 0.35 percent. Most high-yield savings accounts have rates between 3.5 percent and 4.5 percent.</p>\n\niOS</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"9f05143bab2a3b07d06e18e9c026107ac02818dce1dfcdc87ff2c8b7f2d30f4b","category":"Apple"}
