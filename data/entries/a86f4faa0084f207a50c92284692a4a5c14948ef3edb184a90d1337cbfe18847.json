{"title":"HashiConf 2025 scholarship program now open for applications","link":"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashiconf-2025-scholarship-program-now-open-for-applications","date":1742569200000,"content":"<p>We are pleased to once again offer a scholarship program to support members of our community from all backgrounds to attend <a href=\"https://hashiconf.com\">HashiConf 2025</a>. This community cloud conference will be held September 24-26 in San Francisco, California.</p>\n\n<p>At HashiCorp, we value diversity and strive to foster an inclusive community. Applicants from all backgrounds in technology, cloud computing, and open source communities are welcome. The <a href=\"https://forms.gle/bnmQZ8tCCaC7DA2Z7\">scholarship program</a> exists to support members of the technical community who may lack the financial sponsorship or means to attend.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://forms.gle/bnmQZ8tCCaC7DA2Z7\">Applications</a> will be evaluated according to three criteria:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Need:</strong> Will a scholarship allow the applicant to attend when they otherwise could not?</li>\n<li><strong>Value:</strong> Would the applicant's experience and interests enable them to receive value from attending HashiConf?</li>\n<li><strong>Impact:</strong> Is the applicant likely to make a positive impact on the HashiCorp community by attending HashiConf?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are three categories of scholarship available, based roughly on where the applicant will be traveling from and therefore how much financial support they will need.</p>\n\n<p>Scholarship winners will be selected by a diverse group of HashiCorp employees. The personal information in applications will remain confidential to the committee during the review process and after scholarships are awarded.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> Thank you for your interest in the HashiConf Scholarship program. Due to an overwhelming response, capacity for the HashiConf Scholar application has been reached, and unfortunately, the scholarship application for HashiConf 2025 is now closed.</p>\n","author":"Alexandra Freeman","siteTitle":"HashiCorp Blog","siteHash":"219aa6310b3388f2335eba49871f4df9581f2c58eaeb5e498363b54e835b7001","entryHash":"a86f4faa0084f207a50c92284692a4a5c14948ef3edb184a90d1337cbfe18847","category":"Tech"}
