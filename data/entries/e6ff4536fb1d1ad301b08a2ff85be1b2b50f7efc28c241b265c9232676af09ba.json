Until now, Polestar's range has been a little limited—there was the Polestar 1, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2019/11/the-polestar-1-is-a-turbocharged-supercharged-plug-in-hybrid-enigma/\">a handsome if a little eccentric plug-in hybrid GT</a> that went out of production after just 1,500 examples. And there's the Polestar 2 sedan, now available as <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/09/now-rear-wheel-drive-the-single-motor-polestar-2-is-better-than-ever/\">a more efficient, more fun rear-wheel drive variant</a>. But the brand has lacked that most popular of body styles, the SUV—until now.</p>\n<p>\"We have been obviously waiting for this year so much in order to really accelerate now. So the two cars coming are SUVs, [which] is, for us, key to really get into the dimension that we want to be,\" said Thomas Ingenlath, CEO of Polestar. \"We have invested so much into the brand. We have so much invested into being in 25 countries. Of course we need now that kind of scale, a minimum of a three-car company to justify all of that,\" he said.</p>\n<p>The latest addition is called the Polestar 4, which slightly confusingly slots between the smaller Polestar 2 sedan and larger, more expensive Polestar 3—the other SUV <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/03/polestar-announces-polestar-3-pricing-electric-suv-starts-at-73400/\">that joins the range this year</a>. It has a clear family resemblance to its siblings, with similar front styling to the Polestar 3 and a fastback rear that calls back to the Polestar 2. The decision to ditch the rear windshield will no doubt be controversial—instead, the Polestar 4 uses a camera-based mirror that provides a wider-angle view of things behind the car than a normal passive mirror.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012902#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012902&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
