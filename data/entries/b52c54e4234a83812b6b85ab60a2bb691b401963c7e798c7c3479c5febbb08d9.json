Now, an app by established independent developers Jordi Bruin, Mathijs Kadijk, and Tom Lokhorst aims to fix that.</p>\n<p>Called Splitscreen, it enables you to utilize two virtual displays at once while working with your Mac and wearing Vision Pro. By contrast, Apple's default implementation only supports mirroring a single Mac display to a resizable virtual one.</p>\n<p>Further, the developers are working on achieving what I said I'd like to see from Apple when I wrote up my first impressions of the headset: the ability to move individual Mac windows around your space freely like visionOS apps when your Mac and Vision Pro are connected to one another.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017692#p3\">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017692&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b52c54e4234a83812b6b85ab60a2bb691b401963c7e798c7c3479c5febbb08d9","category":"Tech"}
