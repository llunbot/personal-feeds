Now, researchers are using some similar techniques with a model called MarioVGG to see if an AI model can generate plausible video of <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> in response to user inputs.</p>\n<p>The results of <a href=\"https://virtual-protocol.github.io/mario-videogamegen/\">the MarioVGG model</a>—available <a href=\"https://virtual-protocol.github.io/mario-videogamegen/static/pdfs/VideoGameGen.pdf\">as a pre-print paper</a> published by the crypto-adjacent AI company <a href=\"https://www.virtuals.io/\">Virtuals Protocol</a>—still display a lot of apparent glitches, and it's too slow for anything approaching real-time gameplay at the moment. But the results show how even a limited model can infer some impressive physics and gameplay dynamics just from studying a bit of video and input data.</p>\n<p>The researchers hope this represents a first step toward \"producing and demonstrating a reliable and controllable video game generator,\" or possibly even \"replacing game development and game engines completely using video generation models\" in the future.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047527#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2047527&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"440b33c8655472989a8761c6767c4f89bd18d6c75b7b9c47be5b617a06470bb4","category":"Tech"}
