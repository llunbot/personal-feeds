Offering 180mm of rear-wheel travel, the Shore is a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/what-is-a-high-pivot-mountain-bike/\">high-pivot</a> enduro mountain bike with a Horst-link suspension design.</p>\n<p>Built around an aluminium frame, the Shore features an excellent and progressive geometry with a generous 480mm reach, 63-degree head tube angle and 445mm chainstays on our size large.</p>\n<p>Norco is one of the only brands to vary chainstay lengths across its range. Considering its weight, the Shore climbs well despite the MaxxGrip compound on the Maxxis DoubleDown casing tyres, which we swapped to a MaxxTerra.</p>\n<p>The Shore is a very comfortable bike to ride over rough terrain and is also incredibly predictable. Thanks to the ideal geometry, you can weight the front wheel confidently and it feels super-composed, both at speed and in technical sections.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/norco-shore-2-review/\">Read our full Norco Shore 2 review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Canyon Strive CFR</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Canyon Strive enduro mountain bike\" title=\"Canyon Strive enduro mountain bike\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Canyon Strive is a race-bred enduro bike with stage-ready performance.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £5,999/$7,299/€6,299 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Chassis provides stability at high speeds; race bike feel with high-performance potential</li>\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Suspension can feel harsh at low speeds</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Strive CFR is Canyon’s race bike offering 170mm of travel and 29in wheels.</p>\n<p>The Strive is well-specced compared to its contemporaries, with a Shimano XTR drivetrain and brakes paired with a Race Face Next RS crankset.</p>\n<p>The Shapeshifter system allows for better on-the-fly adjustment to the bike’s geometry and presents a marked improvement on the previous model.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/canyon-strive-cfr-review/\">Read our full Canyon Strive CFR review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Cotic RocketMAX Gen4 Mullet Silver</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Cotic RocketMAX Gen4 Mullet Silver full suspension mountain bike\" title=\"Cotic RocketMAX Gen4 Mullet Silver - Cotic pack\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The latest RocketMAX Gen4 frame still uses a steel front triangle and 160mm of rear-wheel travel, but now comes in more sizes and is designed to work with a longer-travel fork.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £4,949 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Stable and confident through turns; carries speed well</li>\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Not as forgiving as other bikes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cotic’s RocketMAX shines when pointed downhill, carrying speed well, and is able to rail corners with ease.

The Spartan is sure-footed on tight and twisty trails, and it’s at home when ridden aggressively with intent. When pushed very hard, the Spartan can punish its rear wheel, though.

retune</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Propain’s Spindrift Al MX Performance is a freeride-focused long-travel bike aimed at bike parks and gnarly downhill trails.</p>\n<p>On the hills, we found ourselves reconsidering the stereotypes of long-travel bikes, with the Spindrift proving to be an efficient climber despite its 180mm of front and rear travel.</p>\n<p>While it wasn’t XC quick, a good seating position and supportive platform made it rival most enduro bikes up the hills.</p>\n<p>When pointed down the trail, the bike felt happy to charge through the roughest stuff and gobble up hard hits with ease. However, we found the shock struggled with high-frequency pumps due to a medium compression and rebound tune.</p>\n<p>This didn’t reduce confidence in the bike, but would be something we’d change if we were riding more natural trails.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/propain-spindrift-al-mx-performance-review/\">Read our full Propain Spindrift Al MX Performance review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3> YT Capra 29 Core 4</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.5 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"YT Capra 29 Core 4 full suspension mountain bike\" title=\"YT Capra 29 Core 4 - Capra pack\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The YT Capra 29 Core 4 is an easy bike to ride fast, straight from the off.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Olly Bowman / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £5,199/$5,299/€5,299/AU$9,999 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Fast from the get-go;

composed when it matters</li>\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Not the best value for money</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Jekyll 2 uses the same carbon frame as the top-end Jekyll 1, just with a lower component spec. It’s a striking-looking enduro bike, with its hidden shock designed to lower the centre of gravity and a great paintjob. It’s available as a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/what-is-a-29er/\">29er</a> only.</p>\n<p>The high-pivot suspension design incorporates Cannondale’s Ai asymmetric rear triangle to increase frame clearance. There’s an idler wheel in the chainline to help prevent the kickback that can come with high-pivot kinematics.</p>\n<p>Spec-wise, there’s Shimano Deore, which despite being low-spec for the Jekyll 2’s price, worked just fine. Cannondale specs 165mm cranks to reduce pedal strikes. Suspension is provided by a 170mm RockShox Zeb Select fork and a Fox Float DPX2 Performance shock with 165mm of travel. We had issues with wheel build quality though.</p>\n<p>We really liked the forward seated position and absence of bob when climbing. Head back down and the Jekyll’s balanced handling and geometry make it predictable and easy to guide through turns.</p>\n<p>We also rated the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/2022-cannondale-jekyll-1-review/\">Cannondale Jekyll 1</a> at 4 stars if you fancy a more decked-out spec.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/cannondale-jekyll-2-review-2/\">Read our full Cannondale Jekyll 2 </a><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/cannondale-jekyll-2-review-2/\">review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h3>Canyon Strive CFR Underdog</h3>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n            <div>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                                    <i></i>\n                            </div>\n            <span>\n                <span>4.0 out of 5 star rating</span>\n                            </span>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Canyon Strive CFR Underdog full suspension mountain bike\" title=\"Canyon Strive CFR Underdog - Strive pack\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Canyon Strive CFR Underdog features a host of changes over the previous Strive.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Andy Lloyd / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> £4,799/$4,999/€4,999/AU$7,399 as tested</li>\n<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Shapeshifter helps on the hills; ground-hugging suspension</li>\n<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Not the liveliest ride</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Canyon’s Strive CFR Underdog is the German brand’s lowest-tier enduro race bike.

It’s a bit chicken and egg, but the race genre and the bike genre have pushed each other’s limits, and driven development of bike tech far beyond the confines of the course tapes.</p>\n<p>Enduro bikes sit in the middle ground between <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-downhill-mountain-bikes/\">downhill bikes</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/enduro-vs-trail-bikes/\">trail bikes</a>. Like a DH bike, they’re designed to get down hills as fast as possible, tackling chunky rock gardens, matted root beds, big drops and canyon-like gaps, doing it all with a little less <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/how-much-suspension-travel-do-i-need-on-my-mountain-bike/\">suspension travel</a>.</p>\n<p>However, like the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-trail-bikes/\">best trail mountain bikes</a>, they’re also designed to be pedalled back up; so rather than pushing to the top of the track, they can be ridden up thanks to more suitable geometry, wider gear ranges and lighter builds than a DH bike.</p>\n<p>As such, they’re slightly less capable downhill than a DH bike, but far more capable up, and more capable down but less capable up than a trail bike… got it?!</p>\n<h2>How much travel does an enduro bike have?</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"RockShox fork 2023\" title=\"RockShox fork 2023 - ZEB Ultimate\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> There’s no hard and fast definition of how much travel an enduro bike should have.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Mick Kirkman / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>While there’s no set definition of travel that defines an enduro bike, the majority have between 150 and 170mm of suspension front and rear. Some 27.5in-wheel enduro bikes may push travel a touch higher and there are a few with a little less at the rear – usually 29in bikes.</p>\n<p>Expect to see the burliest single-crown suspension forks a brand has to offer with stanchion diameters varying from 35mm to 38mm. They’re built to be stiff, smooth and supportive, with higher-end models sporting plenty of adjustability.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Manitou's Mara rear shock, one of the products reviewed in this month's Wrecked and Rated.\" title=\"381_mara\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Rear shocks on enduro bikes will feature a ‘piggyback’ chamber.</span></figcaption><span></span></div>\n<p>Rear shocks, especially when you’re buying bikes from the mid-range up, will have a ‘piggyback’ design.</p>\n<p>This is an additional chamber connected to one end of the shock that allows for additional oil flow through the shock. This, then, allows for better temperature management and more consistency on long descents (you’ll be surprised by how warm a shock can get in use).</p>\n<p>How the bikes use that suspension travel will vary too. Some bikes have incredibly plush suspension that totally insulates you from the trail, leading to an incredibly planted feel that’s fast on steep and rough terrain.</p>\n<p>But with all that smoothness comes more pedal-induced movement, so these bikes can often feel sluggish on climbs and flatter tracks – you’ll be reaching for a lockout lever much sooner.</p>\n<p>However, some bikes will have a more pedal-friendly suspension, which will make the uphills much easier and the flatter tracks more fun. You may lose some of that buttery feeling when you’re going flat-out over rocks and roots, though.</p>\n<h2>Enduro bike geometry – what’s that about?</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Pole Stamina 160 Remastered enduro mountain bike\" title=\"Pole Stamina 160 Remastered enduro mountain bike-34\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Long and slack geometry helps to boost confidence in tricky terrain.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The latest enduro bikes have <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/opinion/spoke-tension-is-long-slack-and-low-geometry-always-better-our-tech-experts-give-us-their-angle/\">long, low and slack geometry</a>. This means long front centres (and reach measurements), slack head angles and low bottom brackets. This makes them feel super-confident on steep hillsides because there’s less chance of you flipping over the handlebars, and it helps you better manage weight and grip between the tyres.</p>\n<p>Longer geometry can make the bikes a little slower to react to inputs, and sometimes you may find you need to re-address your riding technique to get the most agility out of them, but these bikes have descending speed at the forefront of their design.</p>","author":"Tom Marvin","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"b8079778941859a5e8059b3debe9956f85e87df5192d653673255362d605471d","category":"Cycling"}
