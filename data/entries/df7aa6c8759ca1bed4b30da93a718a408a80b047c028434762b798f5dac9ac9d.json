The new <a href=\"https://www.wildebikes.com/collections/bikes/products/dark-star\" target=\"_blank\">Dark Star</a> is a steel hardtail that Wilde designed for a 120 to 130mm travel fork for all-around trail riding. The Dark Star doesn’t exactly follow the current MTB design trends of long wheelbases and slack AF headtubes. No, it’s running its own game, and it looks pretty sweet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, Wilde’s also launching a killer new rigid fork today, as well – dubbed simply the <a href=\"https://www.wildebikes.com/collections/frontpage/products/future-proof-fork\" target=\"_blank\">Future Proof Fork</a>.

BOSS Super Tubes are asymmetrically butte, air-hardened, custom-extruded, seamless steel tubing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wilde describes the switch to a custom-made tubeset as opening up a world of ride feel possibilities now that are no longer ‘tied to the available off-the-shelf options’ when building their bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wilde-Dark-Star-Hardtail-front-tri.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wilde-Dark-Star-Hardtail-front-tri.webp\" alt=\"Wilde Dark Star Hardtail front tri\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wilde-Dark-Star-Hardtail-front-tri.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wilde-Dark-Star-Hardtail-front-tri-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wilde-Dark-Star-Hardtail-front-tri-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wilde-Dark-Star-Hardtail-front-tri-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wilde-Dark-Star-Hardtail-front-tri-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wilde-Dark-Star-Hardtail-front-tri-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This allows them to push the boundaries of strength and weight without being held back or limited by the available tubing. So, that means that whatever they want as far as tube diameter, wall thickness, or butting profile for a certain application, they can just make it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, they can do “outlandish and techy stuff” like <em>not </em>using a gusset at the downtube/headtube junction on the new Dark Star, while still delivering extra strength. Wilde says the reason for the lack of a gusset is “that the steel downtube itself is asymmetrically butted at the headtube junction.” That means the downtube is a lot thicker at the bottom of the tube where it meets the headtube. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The result being heavy-duty reinforcement, but no need to weld an additional gusset there. That can actually equate to overall lighter weight, as well as keeping the amount of heat-affected zones on the frame to a bare minimum.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Dark Star Geometry</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image.png\"><img width=\"1241\" height=\"631\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image.png 1241w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-297x151.png 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-120x61.png 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-768x390.png 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>Fast, aggressive, and playful trail geometry.

Wilde thinks the Dark Star with the rigid fork is like that, but better. You see this is more fun already, thanks to its modern geo.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Truly Suspension-Corrected</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you took a 120mm suspension fork (axle to crown of 531mm) and subtracted the 25% (30mm) for sag, you’d get a 501mm axle to crown measurement. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, that’s exactly what the Wilde Future Proof fork’s ATC is, 501mm.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wilde-Dark-Star-Hardtail-and-Future-Proof-Fork-side-view.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wilde-Dark-Star-Hardtail-and-Future-Proof-Fork-side-view.webp\" alt=\"Wilde Dark Star Hardtail and Future Proof Fork side view\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wilde-Dark-Star-Hardtail-and-Future-Proof-Fork-side-view.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wilde-Dark-Star-Hardtail-and-Future-Proof-Fork-side-view-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wilde-Dark-Star-Hardtail-and-Future-Proof-Fork-side-view-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wilde-Dark-Star-Hardtail-and-Future-Proof-Fork-side-view-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wilde-Dark-Star-Hardtail-and-Future-Proof-Fork-side-view-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wilde-Dark-Star-Hardtail-and-Future-Proof-Fork-side-view-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Wilde thinks this makes perfect sense as the baseline to optimize the handling of the bike and for the ideal length of a rigid fork partner. Most aftermarket forks use an old, outdated standard of suspension correcting the rigid forks based on bikes that had 80-100mm suspension forks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember such short travel forks?!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most hardtails nowadays have front suspension forks with at least 120mm of travel, or sometimes more. Hence, the more useful axle-to-crown measurement of 501mm, making pairing the Future Proof fork with modern hardtails a smoother, easier transition.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Future Proof Fork Pricing &amp; Key Features</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wilde-Dark-Star-Hardtail-and-Future-Proof-Fork-front-closer.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wilde-Dark-Star-Hardtail-and-Future-Proof-Fork-front-closer.webp\" alt=\"Wilde Dark Star Hardtail and Future Proof Fork front closer\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wilde-Dark-Star-Hardtail-and-Future-Proof-Fork-front-closer.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wilde-Dark-Star-Hardtail-and-Future-Proof-Fork-front-closer-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wilde-Dark-Star-Hardtail-and-Future-Proof-Fork-front-closer-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wilde-Dark-Star-Hardtail-and-Future-Proof-Fork-front-closer-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wilde-Dark-Star-Hardtail-and-Future-Proof-Fork-front-closer-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Wilde-Dark-Star-Hardtail-and-Future-Proof-Fork-front-closer-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Retail price: $250</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Features</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Suspension corrected for frames spec’d with 120-130mm forks</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Segmented steel construction</li>\n\n\n\n<li>huge max 29 x 2.8” tire clearance</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Three Pack Mounts on each leg</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Full-coverage Fender and Rack Mounts</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mid Blade Mount for lowrider racks, too</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Specs</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>501mm Axle-To-Crown height</li>\n\n\n\n<li>44mm Rake</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Straight 1 ⅛” Steerer (works with oversized base plate for tapered headsets)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Long steerertube length to fit almost any bike and upright cockpit setups</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Boost 15x110mm thru-axle spacing</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Weight: 3lbs</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.wildebikes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">WildeBikes.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/lets-meet-the-dark-star-wildes-new-120-130-trail-hardtail-plus-the-future-proof-rigid-fork/\">Let’s Meet the Dark Star, Wilde’s New 120/130 Trail Hardtail, plus the Future Proof Rigid Fork</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"df7aa6c8759ca1bed4b30da93a718a408a80b047c028434762b798f5dac9ac9d","category":"Cycling"}
