In addition, Apple has also expanded the Mac coverage renewal option to all countries where extended ‌AppleCare‌+ coverage is offered: Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/applecare-plus-for-mac-2021.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nPrior to now, extended ‌AppleCare‌+ coverage options for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, and Apple Watch were limited to the U.S., UK, Australia, Canada, Germany, and Japan, and the Mac-specific option was only available in the United States. The changes were highlighted in an updated version of Apple's ‌AppleCare‌+ <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210580\">support document</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn all eligible countries, if you paid upfront for an ‌AppleCare‌+ plan for ‌iPhone‌, ‌iPad‌, or Apple Watch, you may be eligible to purchase new coverage that renews monthly.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIf you paid upfront for an ‌AppleCare‌+ plan for Mac, Apple may give you the option to purchase new coverage that renews on an annual basis.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple says that new coverage must be purchased within 30 days of when the original coverage ends, and customers can find out if they're eligible for extended coverage by going to <a href=\"https://mysupport.apple.com/\">mysupport.apple.com</a> and following the on-screen instructions. The new coverage plan will automatically renew until it is cancelled.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nExcept in places where local law requires it, Apple will not provide notifications that an ‌AppleCare‌+ plan is about to expire so customers must check themselves.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple also has a separate renewal plan for customers in China, who can pay annually for continued ‌AppleCare‌+ coverage once their original plans expire.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n‌AppleCare‌+ provides device coverage for after the initial warranty period, plus it covers two incidents of accidental damage every 12 months, with customers paying a small deductible for repairs or replacements.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/\">AppleCare</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/17/renewable-applecare-plus-coverage-for-mac-expands/\">Renewable AppleCare+ Coverage for Mac Now Available in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, and the UK</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/renewable-applecare-coverage-for-mac-now-available-in-australia-canada-france-germany-italy-japan-spain-and-the-uk.2311556/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=7XOTwOgH7S0:plhqwY-XzR0:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=7XOTwOgH7S0:plhqwY-XzR0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/7XOTwOgH7S0\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8037ef27996560543b7283fc0d1a2e295999cf3043489cab71e222d21e5f9d75","category":"Apple"}
