Tom’s handmade bars were fillet brazed, the Bullship Bar is tig-welded.</em></p>\n<h3>Tom Ritchey Bullmoose (Abbreviated) History</h3>\n<p>Tom Ritchey first developed the Bullmoose bar as a secure handlebar option for his early, late 1970s mountain bikes. The design dawned on him after racing <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/camera-corner-documentary-wende-cragg/\" target=\"_blank\">Repack on Wende Cragg’s klunker</a>, only to have his bars slip and cost him the win. Road stems, 25.4⌀ or 26.4⌀  and 22.2⌀ motorcycle bars required a shim that would sometimes slip.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/1980_Ritchey_Bullmoose-03.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/1980_Ritchey_Bullmoose-03.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/1980_Ritchey_Bullmoose-03.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/1980_Ritchey_Bullmoose-03.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/1980_Ritchey_Bullmoose-02.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/1980_Ritchey_Bullmoose-02.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/1980_Ritchey_Bullmoose-02.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/1980_Ritchey_Bullmoose-02.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><em>A rare, uncut-width nickel-plated vintage Bullmoose is a sight to behold!</em></p>\n<p>With the late 1970s and early 1980s bikes being limited to short 220 mm seatposts, the early Mountain Bikes made by Tom had but a “grip” of seatpost and were tall with level top tubes. Bullmoose bars were the easiest way to get the bars level with the saddle. Then, to attach the bars to the 1″ threaded fork, Tom would silver solder a steel “stub” into the steerer tubes of his bikes.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/1980-Ritchey-No-Serial-23-Inch-5.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/1980-Ritchey-No-Serial-23-Inch-5.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/1980-Ritchey-No-Serial-23-Inch-5.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/1980-Ritchey-No-Serial-23-Inch-5.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/1980-Ritchey-No-Serial-23-Inch-25.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/1980-Ritchey-No-Serial-23-Inch-25.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/1980-Ritchey-No-Serial-23-Inch-25.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/03/1980-Ritchey-No-Serial-23-Inch-25.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><em>John’s <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/1980-no-serial-ritchey/\" target=\"_blank\">1980 Ritchey</a> with a Cinelli 1A and high-rise moto bar…</em></p>\n<p>Unlike the popular Cinelli 1A stems of the era, which would shear off inside and sometimes crack steerer tubes due to the conical wedge creating an acute load on the thin-walled steerers, these “stub” Bullmoose bars were incredibly strong as they were clamped onto these stubs that extended into the steerer tubes a few inches, spreading out the load.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/10/1983-Ritchey-Everest-Mountain-Bike-202.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/10/1983-Ritchey-Everest-Mountain-Bike-202.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/10/1983-Ritchey-Everest-Mountain-Bike-202.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/10/1983-Ritchey-Everest-Mountain-Bike-202.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/10/1983-Ritchey-Everest-Mountain-Bike-200.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/10/1983-Ritchey-Everest-Mountain-Bike-200.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/10/1983-Ritchey-Everest-Mountain-Bike-200.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/10/1983-Ritchey-Everest-Mountain-Bike-200.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><em>The silver-soldered stub offered the most secure Bullmoose attachment point…</em></p>\n<p>Tom’s early Bullmoose bars used this system, although there are plenty of early “quill” style Bullmoose bars in his late 1970s and early 1980s bikes. <em>Most</em> of the 1981 through 1983 Ritchey Mountain Bikes utilized a stub design.

The only other alternatives of the time were road bike or BMX stems and high-rise motorcycle bars from Magura, Tomaselli, Inter-Am, and others. Eventually, Tom would license the design to Nitto, who would produce Bullmoose bars for brands like Specialized.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Stridsland-Bullship-Bar-Review-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Stridsland-Bullship-Bar-Review-1.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Stridsland-Bullship-Bar-Review-1.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Stridsland-Bullship-Bar-Review-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Stridsland Bullship Bar</h3>\n<p>Matias and I were chatting when I was working on my Everest restoration a few years ago. That spurred him into developing the Bullship Bar. He wanted a high-rise bar to go with his Beachcomber mountain bikes. We chatted about them being a great option for people wanting more rise from their cockpits.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Stridsland-Bullship-Bar-Review-8.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Stridsland-Bullship-Bar-Review-8.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Stridsland-Bullship-Bar-Review-8.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Stridsland-Bullship-Bar-Review-8.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The Bullship Bar works on all 1 1/8″ bikes, like vintage mountain bikes from the late 1990s and early 2000s, where the stack was low for racier fits. It also works really well on cargo bikes or city/commuter bikes, where you might want to ride more upright for visibility. I put them on the MONoPOLE mini cargo bike I’m reviewing.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Stridsland-Bullship-Bar-Review-7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Stridsland-Bullship-Bar-Review-7.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Stridsland-Bullship-Bar-Review-7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Stridsland-Bullship-Bar-Review-7.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Bullship Bar Quick Hits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Available in Black (880 <span>kr.)</span> or Raw (1.040 <span>kr.) </span></li>\n<li>Approx $82/$97 + shipping</li>\n<li>850 mm wide</li>\n<li>25° back sweep</li>\n<li>7° upsweep</li>\n<li>120 mm rise (160 mm to barends)</li>\n<li>45° stem angle</li>\n<li>1-1/8″ threadless</li>\n<li>Approx. 1000 g</li>\n<li>4130 Cr-Mo</li>\n<li>Post-weld heat-treated for stunts</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Stridsland-Bullship-Bar-Review-12.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Stridsland-Bullship-Bar-Review-12.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Stridsland-Bullship-Bar-Review-12.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Stridsland-Bullship-Bar-Review-12.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Finish Options</h3>\n<p>The black Bullship Bars are ED coated only, which is a thin, smooth layer of black paint factories in Taiwan applies to the inside of frames. Think of it like a lighter-duty primer, ready to be painted to match your bike with a product like <a href=\"https://spraybike.us/\" target=\"_blank\">Spray Bike</a> or just rattle can. You can run these bars “raw ED,” but they will form a patina over time. You can see this process happening to the clamping area on mine after the bike sat outdoors in the rain one afternoon locked up.</p>\n<p>Stridsland’s other finish for the Bullship Bar is “raw.” These bars are raw steel, polished, and clear powder-coated at the factory. When you clear coat over raw steel, it will eventually patina or oxidize, as the only thing that will keep steel from rusting is actual primer. Since the bars are heat-treated after they’re welded, you needn’t worry about any structural issues forming from light surface oxidation.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Stridsland-Bullship-Bar-Review-13.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Stridsland-Bullship-Bar-Review-13.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Stridsland-Bullship-Bar-Review-13.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Stridsland-Bullship-Bar-Review-13.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Stridsland-Bullship-Bar-Review-9.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Stridsland-Bullship-Bar-Review-9.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Stridsland-Bullship-Bar-Review-9.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Stridsland-Bullship-Bar-Review-9.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Stridsland-Bullship-Bar-Review-10.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Stridsland-Bullship-Bar-Review-10.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Stridsland-Bullship-Bar-Review-10.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Stridsland-Bullship-Bar-Review-10.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Geometrically Speaking</h3>\n<p>As a broad-shouldered rider, I love wide bars. Although 850 mm is very wide for most people. <span>My normal mountain bike bars are about 820 mm wide, and the Bullship Bar felt <em>very</em> wide comparatively.</span> Yet, I do think they make sense for me on a mini cargo bike like the MONoPOLE where the extra width allows for more leverage while steering a heavy load. You can always cut them down if you prefer a narrower grip width.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Stridsland_Bullship_bar_geo.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Stridsland_Bullship_bar_geo.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Stridsland_Bullship_bar_geo.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Stridsland_Bullship_bar_geo.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Where they are very appealing is their height and extension. While they extend 70 mm proud of the steerer, the 25º back sweep actually puts your hands behind the steering axis. I was struggling with getting the bars higher on this bike – which I’ll touch more on with my in-depth review of it – having tried PNW Components 50 mm riser bars before and still craving more bar height.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Stridsland-Bullship-Bar-Review-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Stridsland-Bullship-Bar-Review-3.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Stridsland-Bullship-Bar-Review-3.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Stridsland-Bullship-Bar-Review-3.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The Bullship Bar puts my grips higher than the saddle on the bike, which is overall just a more comfortable riding position in general. Paired with plentiful back sweep, they allow for my brake levers to avoid contact with big boxes I sometimes carry to postal carriers here in town.</p>\n<p>850 mm might be too wide for most, but remember, as you cut the bar width down, you are increasing the effective reach of the bar.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Stridsland-Bullship-Bar-Review-5.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Stridsland-Bullship-Bar-Review-5.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Stridsland-Bullship-Bar-Review-5.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Stridsland-Bullship-Bar-Review-5.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/1980_Ritchey_Bullmoose-04.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/1980_Ritchey_Bullmoose-04.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/1980_Ritchey_Bullmoose-04.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/1980_Ritchey_Bullmoose-04.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>A Unique Offering</h3>\n<p>Programmatically, these bars fix my intended fit issues with the MONoPOLE. As an added bonus, they also look the part. Especially on a bike that’s already super funky-looking! I have a few versions of modern Bullmoose bars and love how they add vintage flare to modern builds. You’ll have to wait for the full review to see the entire MONoPOLE bike, though — and the 1980 Ritchey, for that matter, too!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Stridsland-Bullship-Bar-Review-4.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Stridsland-Bullship-Bar-Review-4.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Stridsland-Bullship-Bar-Review-4.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/02/Stridsland-Bullship-Bar-Review-4.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>TL;DR</h3>\n<p>I love what Matias is doing with Stridsland, making disc brake modern bikes with vintage appeal. Depending on how well the Bullship Bar sells, I could see him making a lower-rise version one day. The heft of the bar, at 1000 grams, is immediately noticeable in hand. However, on a commuter/basket bike/cargo bike, that weight is fairly negligible.</p>\n<p>In summary, if you have a bike with a low stack, want to clean up the cockpit with a classic aesthetic, and don’t mind a 1000-gram handlebar, the Bullship Bar might be for you.</p>\n<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Super high-rise</li>\n<li>Super wide (can be cut down)</li>\n<li>This is the closest modern homage to the original Bullmoose yet!</li>\n<li>Very unique looking</li>\n<li>Works with any 1 1/8″ steerer</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Heavy at 1000 grams</li>\n<li>Ships from Denmark</li>\n<li>No US Distributor (yet)</li>\n<li>ED coating will oxidize (rust) if left uncoated</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<p>See more and order today at <a href=\"https://www.stridsland.com/shop/bullship-bar/\" target=\"_blank\">Stridsland</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/stridsland-bullship-bar-review/\">Stridsland Bullship Bar Review: A Proper Modern Bullmoose</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"71c5c551db43749d6c158c8ab827c3c2a465206a8f47440f2276be1deca751d2","category":"Cycling"}
