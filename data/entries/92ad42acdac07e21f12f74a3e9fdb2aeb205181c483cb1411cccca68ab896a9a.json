The new Segway eBike department is said to be an assembly of “bike-industry veterans”. They have a sales plan that will support independent dealers before launching their first two eBikes. First teased at CES 2024, the <a href=\"https://www.segway.com/e-bike-xafari-and-xyber-launch-page/\" target=\"_blank\">Xyber and Xafari</a> will be officially available in Q1 of 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Segway-Xafari-and-Xyber-eBikes-Nick-Howe-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Segway-Xafari-and-Xyber-eBikes-Nick-Howe-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Segway Xafari and Xyber eBikes Nick Howe\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Segway-Xafari-and-Xyber-eBikes-Nick-Howe-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Segway-Xafari-and-Xyber-eBikes-Nick-Howe-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Segway-Xafari-and-Xyber-eBikes-Nick-Howe-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Segway-Xafari-and-Xyber-eBikes-Nick-Howe-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Segway-Xafari-and-Xyber-eBikes-Nick-Howe-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Segway-Xafari-and-Xyber-eBikes-Nick-Howe-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Nick Howe (Photos / Segway)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>We’re committed to entering the e-bike market in a big way and doing it right</em>,” said Nick Howe, head of e-bike. “<em>This means doing something new and different with both our products and our sales model. We see an opportunity to redefine the e-bike and micromobility product categories and return to a true dealer-centric sales model in the process</em>“.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Segway Dealer Network</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For its new eBike division, Segway plans to grow a national dealer network in the US. The focus will be the IBD (Independent Bicycle Dealers) and the EBDs (Electric Bicycle Dealers). But they will also focus on what they are calling the OBDs (Other Bicycle Dealers). OBDs are shops that may not be “bike-specific” but may be a good fit for eBikes. These could include motorcycle, power sports, and outdoor retailers.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Segway-Xafari-and-Xyber-eBikes-head-to-head-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Segway-Xafari-and-Xyber-eBikes-head-to-head-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Segway Xafari and Xyber eBikes head to head\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Segway-Xafari-and-Xyber-eBikes-head-to-head-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Segway-Xafari-and-Xyber-eBikes-head-to-head-297x124.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Segway-Xafari-and-Xyber-eBikes-head-to-head-120x50.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Segway-Xafari-and-Xyber-eBikes-head-to-head-768x320.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>The Segway Xafari (left) and the Segway Xyber (right)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides purchasing directly through the dealer, Segway customers will be able to buy eBikes on their website, then shipped to their choice of local dealer for assembly. The receiving dealers will still earn a margin on these O2O (online to offline) purchases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Segway promises competitive retail pricing, industry-leading margins, and exceptional retailer access to parts, service, and support. Segway’s new Xchange app, which will be available on Apple’s App Store and Google Play, will help with access. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Segway-Xafari-and-Xyber-eBikes-xyber-top-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"720\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Segway-Xafari-and-Xyber-eBikes-xyber-top-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Segway Xafari and Xyber eBikes xyber top\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Segway-Xafari-and-Xyber-eBikes-xyber-top-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Segway-Xafari-and-Xyber-eBikes-xyber-top-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Segway-Xafari-and-Xyber-eBikes-xyber-top-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Segway-Xafari-and-Xyber-eBikes-xyber-top-768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Segway-Xafari-and-Xyber-eBikes-xyber-top-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Segway-Xafari-and-Xyber-eBikes-xafari-rear-side-jpeg.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"719\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Segway-Xafari-and-Xyber-eBikes-xafari-rear-side-jpeg.webp\" alt=\"Segway Xafari and Xyber eBikes xafari rear side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Segway-Xafari-and-Xyber-eBikes-xafari-rear-side-jpeg.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Segway-Xafari-and-Xyber-eBikes-xafari-rear-side-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Segway-Xafari-and-Xyber-eBikes-xafari-rear-side-120x67.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Segway-Xafari-and-Xyber-eBikes-xafari-rear-side-768x431.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Segway-Xafari-and-Xyber-eBikes-xafari-rear-side-1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The app is said to be a user-friendly, all-in-one mobile version of the Segway dealer portal. it’s designed to help retailers easily manage inventory, orders, warranties, test rides, service, and more. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What About the Bikes? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The first two eBikes to be released, the Xyber and Xafari, will feature what Segway calls the “Segway Intelligent Ride System”.
