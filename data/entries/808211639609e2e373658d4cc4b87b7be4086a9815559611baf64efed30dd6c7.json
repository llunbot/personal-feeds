{"title":"Nilay Patel’s iPhone 16 Pro Review Addresses the Nilay-Patel-iest of Questions: What Is a Photo?","link":"https://www.theverge.com/24247538/apple-iphone-16-pro-review","date":1727139584000,"content":"\n<p>Nilay Patel, writing at The Verge last week:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I asked Apple’s VP of camera software engineering Jon McCormack\nabout Google’s view that the Pixel camera now captures “memories”\ninstead of photos, and he told me that Apple has a strong point of\nview about what a photograph is — that it’s something that\nactually happened. It was a long and thoughtful answer, so I’m\njust going to print the whole thing:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Here’s our view of what a photograph is. The way we like to think\nof it is that it’s a personal celebration of something that\nreally, actually happened.</p>\n\n<p>Whether that’s a simple thing like a fancy cup of coffee that’s\ngot some cool design on it, all the way through to my kid’s first\nsteps, or my parents’ last breath, It’s something that really\nhappened. It’s something that is a marker in my life, and it’s\nsomething that deserves to be celebrated.</p>\n\n<p>And that is why when we think about evolving in the camera, we\nalso rooted it very heavily in tradition. Photography is not a\nnew thing. It’s been around for 198 years. People seem to like\nit. There’s a lot to learn from that. There’s a lot to rely on\nfrom that.</p>\n\n<p>Think about stylization, the first example of stylization that we\ncan find is Roger Fenton in 1854 — that’s 170 years ago. It’s a\ndurable, long-term, lasting thing. We stand proudly on the\nshoulders of photographic history.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That’s a sharp and clear answer, but I’m curious how Apple\ncontends with the relentless addition of AI editing to the\niPhone’s competitors. The company is already taking small steps in\nthat direction: a feature called “Clean Up” will arrive with Apple\nIntelligence, which will allow you to remove objects from photos\nlike Google’s Magic Eraser.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>McCormack’s response is genuinely thoughtful, and resonates deeply with my own personal take. But it’s worth noting that Apple is the <em>conservative</em> company when it comes to generative AI and photography — and yet they’re still shipping Clean Up. I’m not complaining about Clean Up’s existence. I’ve already used it personally. I’m just saying that even Apple’s stance involves significant use of generative AI.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/09/23/nilay-patel-iphone-16-pro-review\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"808211639609e2e373658d4cc4b87b7be4086a9815559611baf64efed30dd6c7","category":"Tech"}
