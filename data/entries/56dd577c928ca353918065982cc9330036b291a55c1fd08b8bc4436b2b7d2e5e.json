The Rift MTB is a five-day stage race for teams of two to ride through North Iceland’s most breathtaking locations on all kinds of surfaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll see fjords and forests, climbs and descents, open road and flowy singletrack with days ranging between 50 and 100km in length and 1,000 and 2,500m in elevation gain (and, importantly, elevation loss – aka, fun descents). It won’t be easy but it might just be the best thing you’ve ever done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you up for the challenge? Here’s what’s waiting for you…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>All-in adventure</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"546\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/rift-mtb-1-970x546.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/rift-mtb-1-970x546.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/rift-mtb-1-300x169.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/rift-mtb-1-768x432.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/rift-mtb-1-1536x864.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/rift-mtb-1-2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/rift-mtb-1-750x422.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/rift-mtb-1-1140x641.webp 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>How many opportunities do you get to spend five days riding in one of the world’s most beautiful (and still quiet) destinations? The Rift MTB offers an adventure like no other, and you still get to sleep in the same bed each evening as each day starts in the same place (with a shuttle taking riders to the race start on days where the riding doesn’t start there).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are three entry options, the cheapest being ‘Just Ride’, which is exactly what the name suggests, including transportation to the race start where applicable, as well as a drink and barbecue post-race. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next option is the All Inclusive Package, which includes a seven-night stay at the Hotel Akureyri, the home base for each day’s racing. It also includes breakfast and buffet dinners, airport transfers for riders and bikes and flights between Reykjavík and Akureyri.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final option is the Lauf Elja Ultimate Rift Experience, which we’ll get to later on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the long and short of all that is, you can forget about the logistics, embrace the adventure and get stuck in.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Nature is calling</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/rift-mtb-3-970x647.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/rift-mtb-3-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/rift-mtb-3-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/rift-mtb-3-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/rift-mtb-3-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/rift-mtb-3-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/rift-mtb-3-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/rift-mtb-3-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/rift-mtb-3-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/rift-mtb-3-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/rift-mtb-3-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Rift MTB is centred around Akureyri, the capital of North Iceland. It features plenty of accommodation, restaurants, cafes, shops, galleries and museums, but it’s also surrounded by natural wonders that have barely been seen or explored.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unsurprisingly given the nature of the race we’ve described above, there are mountains all around, with Arctic views everywhere you look, there’s also the beautiful Eyjafjörður fjord, one of Iceland’s longest fjords at about 60km, and a popular spot for whale watching. There are also waterfalls and natural baths, for some post-race relaxation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The race itself takes on the whole range of surfaces: road, gravel, mud, sand, dirt, rocks and river crossing, with gravel roads, remote birch forest trails, singletrack and technical and fast bikepark tracks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Fast or fun</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"777\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/rift-mtb-5-777x970.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/rift-mtb-5-777x970.webp 777w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/rift-mtb-5-240x300.webp 240w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/rift-mtb-5-768x958.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/rift-mtb-5-1231x1536.webp 1231w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/rift-mtb-5-1641x2048.webp 1641w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/rift-mtb-5-750x936.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/rift-mtb-5-1140x1422.webp 1140w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The most important thing is enjoying the landscape and the adventure. For many that includes pushing it and racing, for others that’s going a bit easier to take it all in. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With it done fully in pairs, it’s a chance to spend five days riding with your buddy. Does it get any better than that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who are looking to go all-out racing, the terrain offers a challenge that suits different strengths with those altering surfaces including plenty of climbing and descending on days ranging from 50km to 100km with total climbing and descending going all the way up to 2,500m.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The ultimate Rift MTB experience</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"645\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/rift-mtb-4-970x645.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/rift-mtb-4-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/rift-mtb-4-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/rift-mtb-4-768x511.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/rift-mtb-4-1536x1022.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/rift-mtb-4-2048x1363.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/rift-mtb-4-750x499.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/rift-mtb-4-1140x758.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/rift-mtb-4-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/rift-mtb-4-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/rift-mtb-4-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For the best possible Rift MTB, the top package is the Lauf Elja Ultimate Rift Experience, which combines the All Inclusive Package with the Lauf Elja Ultimate, the mountain bike that was designed specifically with this race in mind. It has full suspension, including Lauf’s innovative LSP rear suspension. It’s lightweight while having big tyre clearance and the capability to ride on any terrain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This course is its natural habitat, so it is truly the ultimate adventure to ride the Rift MTB on the Lauf Elja Ultimate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Register now or find out more at <a href=\"https://www.theriftmtb.bike/\" target=\"_blank\">theriftmtb.bike</a></p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/lauf-uthald\">The new Lauf Úthald road bike is built different</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/on-another-planet-going-off-road-in-iceland\">On another planet: Going off-road in Iceland</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/the-rift-mtb-iceland\">Iceland’s The Rift MTB is your new must-do adventure</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Will Strickson &#124; Website Editor","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"56dd577c928ca353918065982cc9330036b291a55c1fd08b8bc4436b2b7d2e5e","category":"Cycling"}
