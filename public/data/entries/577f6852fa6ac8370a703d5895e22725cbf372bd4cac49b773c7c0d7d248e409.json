In the parched north of the country, rivers are running dry and millions of livestock have perished due to lack of food. Around 4.4 million Kenyans don’t have enough to eat, and the situation will worsen if the <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/ethiopia/another-poor-rainy-season-forecast-drought-hit-horn-africa\">coming rainy season</a> fails like the previous five. “I’ve never seen it so bad. There’s nothing in the farms, the drought is too harsh,” says Daniel Magondo, a cotton and maize farmer in central Kenya.</p>\n<p>The record-breaking drought is forcing Kenya to confront a controversial topic: whether the country should grow genetically modified (GM) crops. These are plants that have had genes from another organism inserted into their DNA to give them a new trait, such as disease or drought resistance. Although GM crops are completely safe to eat and are <a href=\"https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/gm-plants/what-gm-crops-are-currently-being-grown-and-where/\">widely grown</a> in the US, Canada, Brazil, and India, governments in many parts of the world, including Europe and East Africa, have pushed back against them.</p>\n<p></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1921888#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1921888&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"577f6852fa6ac8370a703d5895e22725cbf372bd4cac49b773c7c0d7d248e409","category":"Tech"}
