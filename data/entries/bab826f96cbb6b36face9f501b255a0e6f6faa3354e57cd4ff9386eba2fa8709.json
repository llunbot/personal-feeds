We don’t know yet exactly which day, but we know September is likely to be the month because Apple has held a September event almost every year since the early 2000s, and every iPhone since 2012 has been launched in September (other than the iPhone 12-series in October 2020). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2023 Apple unveiled the iPhone 15-series and new Apple Watches on September 12, 2023. A similar date is likely to be chosen for the launch of the iPhone 16-series. Read on to find out when we think Apple will hold its September event. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s everything you need to know about Apple’s iPhone launch event for 2024, including the time it is likely to start where you are, and all the new products Apple might launch. You will be able to watch the event below once it starts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When is Apple’s iPhone event?</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>We expect that the 2024 iPhone event will take place on <strong>Tuesday 10 September, 2024.</strong> </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This prediction is based on the past few Apple September event dates:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>2023: Tuesday, September 12</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2022: Wednesday, September 7</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2021: Tuesday, September 14</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2020: Tuesday, September 15</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2019: Tuesday, September 10</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2018: Wednesday, September 12</li>\n\n\n\n<li>2017: Tuesday, September 12</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This is slightly later than in 2022, when Apple’s September event was held on Wednesday, September 7, but that was an earlier date than the annual iPhone event had been held in recent years—for example, in 2021 the event was held on Tuesday, September 14, and in 2020 it was even later, but 2020 was an unusual year due to Covid-19.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What time will the iPhone event start?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple Event’s usually start at 10 a.m. in California. Here’s what that translates to in other countries around the world:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>U.S.: 10 a.m. (PDT), 11 a.m. (MDT), 12 p.m. (CDT), 1 p.m. (EDT)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>U.K.: 6 p.m. (BST)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Europe: 7 p.m. (CEST) 8 p.m. (EEST)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Canada: 10 a.m. (PDT), 11 a.m. (MDT), 12 p.m. (CDT), 1 p.m. (EDT), 2 p.m. (ADT)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>India: 10.30 p.m. (IST)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Hong Kong, Singapore and China: The following day at 1 a.m.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Australia: The following day at 1 a.m. (AWST), 2.30 a.m. (ACST), 3 a.m. (AEST)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>New Zealand: The following day at 5 a.m. (NZST)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s September events are usually one to two hours long. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple will broadcast the event live on its website and on YouTube. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to watch the iPhone event live we explain <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673671/how-to-watch-apples-event.html\">how to watch the Apple Event</a> in a separate article.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Will the iPhone event be live?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple hasn’t held a truly live event since September 2019. Instead, it shows a prerecorded video at the time a live event would be and often holds a small hands-on area to showcase the new products. It is likely that this will once again be the case in 2024, with members of the press gathering at Apple Park to watch the same video Apple will show to the rest of the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What will Apple launch at the September event?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div><figcaption>Remind yourself of what Apple launched in September 2023 by watching the video above. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We expect the new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2007943/iphone-16-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max</a> to be the stars of the event, closely followed by the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, but other new products are also likely on the way including the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2157474/new-apple-watch-2024-release-date.html\">Apple Watch Series 10</a>, new Apple Watch SE, and Apple Watch Ultra 3. We may also see a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678361/ipad-mini-7-specs-design-processor-release.html\">new iPad mini</a> and the 11th gen iPad, and the long-rumored <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673885/airpods-pro-lite-release-date-price-specs-rumours.html\">AirPods Lite</a> may finally make an appearance with other updated AirPods.  We may also see new Apple Earpods with USB-C replace the Lightning versions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the iPhone event, Apple is also likely to announce the date when it will release the new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2221069/ios-18-ai-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 18</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362011/watchos-11-watch-faces-fitness-vitals-translate.html\">watchOS 11</a> operating systems, most likely a few days after the event. We may also get a download date for <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2377675/ipados-18-superguide-features-release.html\">iPadOS 18</a>, which is usually released at the same time as iOS, but sometimes the iPadOS launches a little later alongside the new macOS (<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2265062/macos-15-release-name-compatibility-features.html\">macOS Sequoia</a>). Apple is also likely to reveal when the next updates to tvOS and HomePod software will be available. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s everything we expect from Apple’s September event:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone 16, Plus, Pro, and Max </h3>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iPhone-15_review.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple iPhone 15 Pro in FineWoven Case\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iPhone-15_review.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iPhone-15_review.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iPhone-15_review.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iPhone-15_review.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iPhone-15_review.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iPhone-15_review.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iPhone-15_review.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Apple iPhone 15 Pro in FineWoven Case\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iPhone-15_review.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iPhone-15_review.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iPhone-15_review.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iPhone-15_review.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iPhone-15_review.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iPhone-15_review.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iPhone-15_review.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div><div><figure><img alt=\"Apple iPhone 15 Pro in FineWoven Case\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iPhone-15_review.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iPhone-15_review.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iPhone-15_review.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iPhone-15_review.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iPhone-15_review.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iPhone-15_review.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/iPhone-15_review.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry</p></div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t</div></figure><p>Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>It looks like we’ll be getting four new iPhones this year, a similar lineup to 2023, with a standard iPhone 16 and a larger Plus model and a more advanced iPhone 16 Pro and larger Max. There are rumors that the Max could become the Ultra. The rumors suggest the Pro models are the ones getting the majority of the new features, as usual, although it may be the case that the Max-sized model gets new features the Pro misses out on.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>iPhone 16:</strong> same 6.1-inch display, A17 processor, 8GB RAM, Action button</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPhone 16 Plus: </strong>same 6.7-inch display, A17 processor,  8GB RAM, Action button, </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPhone 16 Pro: </strong>larger 6.3-inch display, A18 processor, 8GB RAM, new 48Mp ultrawide lens, touch-sensitive “camera control” on the side, larger ‘stacked’ battery</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPhone 16 Pro Max (or Ultra): </strong>larger 6.9-inch display, A18 processor, 8GB RAM, new 48Mp ultrawide lens, touch-sensitive “camera control” on the side, super telephoto camera, larger ‘stacked’ battery</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Read the latest <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2007943/iphone-16-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">news about the iPhone 16 series</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apple Watch Series 10, Apple Watch Ultra 3, Apple Watch SE</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s more than one Apple Watch in the pipeline, it seems.
