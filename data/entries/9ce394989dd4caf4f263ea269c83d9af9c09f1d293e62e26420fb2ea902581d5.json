Today, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MHXH3AM-A-MagSafe-Charger/dp/B08L5NP6NG\">Amazon is selling Apple’s MagSafe Charger for $27</a>, a 31 percent discount from its $39 MSRP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s MagSafe charger is super tiny and immediately attaches itself to your device. The beauty of this one is that it won’t go anywhere when you move your phone around because it is magnetized to it. It will work with any MagSafe iPhone (12 and later) as well as some AirPods cases and other Qi2 charging-compatible devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This model delivers wireless charging of up to 15W, which is pretty much all you’re going to need for any of your compatible devices. This version has a 1m cable (about 3 feet) but if you want a 6-foot cable (2m), <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MagSafe-Charger-Capability-Compatible-dp-B0DGHHJXTC/\">you can get a newer model on sale for $39</a> ($10 off). That model charges iPhones up to 25W. (Note: There’s no power adapter included in this purchase, so you’ll need to bring your own that’s 20W or higher to get the fastest charging. We recommend this <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BJ6BB44D\">30W UGreen model that’s on sale for less than $12</a>.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don’t know how long this sale lasts, so hurry up and get this <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MHXH3AM-A-MagSafe-Charger/dp/B08L5NP6NG\">Apple MagSafe Charger for $27</a>, one of the best prices we’ve ever seen.</p>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MHXH3AM-A-MagSafe-Charger/dp/B08L5NP6NG\" target=\"_blank\">Buy it now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"9ce394989dd4caf4f263ea269c83d9af9c09f1d293e62e26420fb2ea902581d5","category":"Apple"}
