Apple this week debuted a number of new Accessibility options that will be coming later this year to honor Global Accessibility Awareness Day.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nThe first video, uploaded to Apple's main YouTube channel, shows off the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/13/macos-16-to-let-your-mac-zoom-with-an-iphone/\">Magnifier on Mac feature</a>. We saw this video Tuesday in Apple's newsroom post, but it's now easier to watch over on YouTube. In the spot, a woman uses an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> connected to her Mac in a classroom setting to zoom in on the chalkboard so she can better see the professor's notes and diagrams.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMagnifier on Mac uses the ‌iPhone‌ camera's zoom feature, beaming the feed to a Mac through Continuity Camera. There are options for creating multiple live session windows for tracking a presentation while also zooming in on a textbook, and each view can be customized with different brightness levels and color and contrast filters to suit individual needs. Magnifier on Mac is an extension of the existing Magnifier option on the ‌iPhone‌, which allows the ‌iPhone‌ to be used to zoom in on text and detect objects.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's second video was shared on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-music/\">Apple Music</a> YouTube channel, and it focuses on Music Haptics on ‌iPhone‌. Introduced as part of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, Music Haptics provides taps, textures, and vibrations to the audio of music that's playing, so that users who are deaf or hard of hearing can experience songs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nIn ‌iOS 19‌, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/13/ios-19-music-haptics-improvements/\">plans to expand Music Haptics</a>, adding new customization options. Users will be able to experience haptics for a whole song or for vocals only, and there will be settings to adjust the intensity of taps, textures, and vibrations.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-ads/\">Apple Ads</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/15/apple-videos-accessibility-features/\">Apple Highlights Magnifier on Mac and iPhone Music Haptics in New Videos</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-highlights-magnifier-on-mac-and-iphone-music-haptics-in-new-videos.2457142/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ae3b0d91ca28d895e93543dfc2841665d04aeb21078b7da293fa40f10a745f0e","category":"Apple"}
