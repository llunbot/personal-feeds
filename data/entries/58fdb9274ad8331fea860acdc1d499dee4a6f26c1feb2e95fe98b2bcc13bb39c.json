Now, for the first time, “LockBitSupp” has been unmasked by an international law enforcement team, and a $10 million bounty has been placed for his arrest.</p>\n<p>In an <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1350921/dl\">indictment</a> unsealed Tuesday, US federal prosecutors unmasked the flamboyant persona as Dmitry Yuryevich Khoroshev, a 31-year-old Russian national. Prosecutors said that during his five years at the helm of LockBit—one of the most prolific ransomware groups—Khoroshev and his subordinates have extorted $500 million from some 2,500 victims, roughly 1,800 of which were located in the US. His cut of the revenue was allegedly about $100 million.</p>\n<h2>Damage in the billions of dollars</h2>\n<p>“Beyond ransom payments and demands, LockBit attacks also severely disrupted their victims' operations, causing lost revenue and expenses associated with incident response and recovery,” federal prosecutors wrote. “With these losses included, LockBit caused damage around the world totaling billions of US dollars. Moreover, the data Khoroshev and his LockBit affiliate co-conspirators stole—containing highly sensitive organizational and personal information—remained unsecure and compromised in perpetuity, notwithstanding Khoroshev’s and his co-conspirators' false promises to the contrary.”</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022656#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2022656&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"58fdb9274ad8331fea860acdc1d499dee4a6f26c1feb2e95fe98b2bcc13bb39c","category":"Tech"}
