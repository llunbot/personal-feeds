There have also been \ncomplaints of emergency workers inconvenienced by false alert \ncalls related to events <a href=\"https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/10/09/rollercoaster-repeatedly-triggers-iphone-14s-crash-detection\">including roller coasters</a>, where \nthe user didn’t cancel the emergency call in time. </p>\n\n<p>But I literally have some skin in the game with this new feature \nbecause Crash Detection called in an emergency response for me as \nI was unconscious and bleeding on the sidewalk, alone and late at \nnight. According to calls it made, I was picked up and on my way \nto an emergency room within half an hour. </p>\n\n<p>Because my accident occurred in a potentially dangerous and \nsomewhat secluded area, I would likely have bled to death if the \ncall hadn’t been automatically placed. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Man, what a harrowing story. Best wishes to Dilger for a speedy recovery.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/11/07/dilger-crash-detection\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"4d3489fa7f401b6b9e0ee0267e61f02322e8f72eb2935ece7cee9a3bb09b4a81","category":"Tech"}
