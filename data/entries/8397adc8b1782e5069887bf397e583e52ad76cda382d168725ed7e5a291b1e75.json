John’s got a bit more to say about them so let’s check ’em out!</em><span></span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Show-114.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Show-114.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Show-114.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Show-114.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Yoshimura began making moto exhausts in Japan. If you’re into street bikes, then you know the brand’s legacy as a high-end manufacturer. Talking to the don Big E at the show, he busted out these new Worx cranks to show me with excitement. Worx is a new special ops branch of Yoshimura and the first project are these custom-coated eeWings cranks.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Show-113.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Show-113.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Show-113.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Show-113.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Cane Creek sells these cranks OE to Yoshimura and then the brand ships them to Japan to get the same coating as its fabled exhaust systems. It’s very hard to scratch this speciality coating. Even the DH bike on display, you could feel the rock rash but it didn’t mute the coloring at all. This isn’t cerakote, nor anodizing, nor paint of any kind. It attaches at a molecular level to the metal, tinting it.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Show-116.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Show-116.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Show-116.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/04/2025-Sea-Otter-Show-116.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Worx is on the way and expect these cranks to attract an upcharge from the standard eeWings but damn, do they look great. I was utterly gutted to find out that Cane Creek stopped making eeWings in 175 mm lengths. But you can expect these stunning cranks to come out in all available sizes this year.</p>\n<p>Follow along at <a href=\"https://yoshimuracycling.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Yoshimura</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/yoshimura-worx-eewing-cranks/\">The Yoshimura Worx Edition eeWing Cranks Are Kind of a Big Deal</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"8397adc8b1782e5069887bf397e583e52ad76cda382d168725ed7e5a291b1e75","category":"Cycling"}
