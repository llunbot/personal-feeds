It was the first fully ENVE-developed hub and drive system. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it was what’s inside that actually makes them stand out. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>By significantly increasing the diameter of their steel ratchet rings and shifting them into an oversized hub body, but sticking with the same standard 9° / 40T engagement, the ratchet teeth got bigger and thus stronger. Plus, the bigger ratchet diameter meant that ENVE could widen the space between the bearings in the freehub, aligning that ratchet over that big main bearing for reduced stress while ensuring smooth freewheeling and engagement.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ENVE-wheels-Innerdrive-upgrade-inner-workings.jpg\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"750\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ENVE-wheels-Innerdrive-upgrade-inner-workings.jpg\" alt=\"ENVE Innerdrive hubs inner workings with new bigger ratchets\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ENVE-wheels-Innerdrive-upgrade-inner-workings.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ENVE-wheels-Innerdrive-upgrade-inner-workings-297x149.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ENVE-wheels-Innerdrive-upgrade-inner-workings-120x60.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ENVE-wheels-Innerdrive-upgrade-inner-workings-768x384.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>While we only heard about a straight-pull version of Innerdrive last January for SES &amp; G series wheels, it seems ENVE already had traditional flanged hubs for J-bend spokes at the start of this year. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Same great ENVE Foundation price, just better Innerdrive hub engagement</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ENVE-Foundation-wheels-get-stronger-J-bend-Innerdrive-hub-upgrade_road-and-gravel-wheels.jpg\"><img width=\"2400\" height=\"1100\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ENVE-Foundation-wheels-get-stronger-J-bend-Innerdrive-hub-upgrade_road-and-gravel-wheels.jpg\" alt=\"ENVE Foundation wheels get a J-bend Innerdrive upgrade, gravel &amp; road wheels\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ENVE-Foundation-wheels-get-stronger-J-bend-Innerdrive-hub-upgrade_road-and-gravel-wheels.jpg 2400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ENVE-Foundation-wheels-get-stronger-J-bend-Innerdrive-hub-upgrade_road-and-gravel-wheels-297x136.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ENVE-Foundation-wheels-get-stronger-J-bend-Innerdrive-hub-upgrade_road-and-gravel-wheels-1536x704.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ENVE-Foundation-wheels-get-stronger-J-bend-Innerdrive-hub-upgrade_road-and-gravel-wheels-120x55.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ENVE-Foundation-wheels-get-stronger-J-bend-Innerdrive-hub-upgrade_road-and-gravel-wheels-768x352.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/ENVE-Foundation-wheels-get-stronger-J-bend-Innerdrive-hub-upgrade_road-and-gravel-wheels-2048x939.jpg 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>ENVE Foundation AG25, AG28, 56 &amp; 45 (<em>l-r</em>)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So now (and probably for the last several months) the more affordable $1400 carbon Foundation 45 &amp; 65 road and AG25 &amp; AG28 gravel wheels have already featured new Innerdrive tech inside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No price increase, just better performance.
