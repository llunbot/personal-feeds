Flo and Tine are the Berlin-based dynamic duo behind the brands Fern Fahrraeder and Gramm Tourpacking. With Berlin as my stopover between my home in the US and Bespoked in Dresden, they made my arrival infinitely more enjoyable by inviting me to sleep in their flat; providing desk space, meals, and bottomless Club-Mate (a yerba mate soda) in their workshop; and offering an immersive snapshot of their wonderful community with group meals and connections to the other folks I’ll introduce below.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-27.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-27.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-27.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-27.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-27.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-27.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-27.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-27.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-8.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-8.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-8.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-8.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-8.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-8.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-8.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-8.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-18.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-18.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-18.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-18.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-18.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-18.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-18.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-18.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>I’ve known Flo and Tine virtually now for a couple of years, as I <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/state-bicycle-4130-all-road-rival-xplr-etap-axs-review/\" target=\"_blank\">tested their Diamond Rack/Bag combo with my State All Road review</a> and we’ve coordinated a couple of other projects together. We’d had a professional rapport for a while leading up to my travels over to Germany but I do not think their welcoming attitude had much to do with my job as “bike media.” Rather, it is more consistent with stories I heard about their roles in the European cycling scene where they serve as seasoned mentors, role models, and community builders. But they are incredibly modest, so that’s where my job as media comes in. Let’s take a brief look at their operations, as we have more on the way from both Fern and Gramm in the coming months.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-32.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-32.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-32.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-32.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-32.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-32.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-32.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-32.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://fern-bicycles.myshopify.com/en-us\" target=\"_blank\">Fern Fahrraeder</a></h3>\n<p>It would be difficult for any appreciator of beautiful bicycles to not admire Florian’s work with <a href=\"https://fern-bicycles.myshopify.com/en-us\" target=\"_blank\">Fern</a>. For as long as drooling over bikes on Instagram has been a thing, Fern bikes have caused me to stop scrolling and have provided endless inspiration for my own projects. Even without that <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Cs17RYssjjB/?img_index=1\" target=\"_blank\">quintessential cracked plaster beige wall backdrop</a>, Fern’s comprehensive meshing of form, function, and style is instantly recognizable.</p>\n<p>Flo started building bikes back in 2012 and spent about two years honing his craft by making them for friends and family before taking custom frame commissions. In the years since he’s been looking for ways to make bike fabrication a sustainable lifestyle and living, undergoing multiple transformations and changes in order to survive what he describes as a “really hard business,” going on to add that:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Frame building looks great and super romantic in Instagram pictures, but in reality, this is a tough job which takes a lot of toll from you.”</p></blockquote>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-12.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-12.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-12.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-12.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-12.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-12.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-12.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-12.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Although the likeness is uncanny, Flo can’t get by on being a Leo DiCaprio doppelgänger alone to sell bikes. Instead, he takes a holistic approach to delivering a bicycle to his customers, one that utilizes “designs, parts, geometries, etc., for function and/or aesthetics, rather than just following the latest hype like everybody else does.” Fern bikes are also typically a team effort working in collaboration with Gramm Tourpacking and Velociao finishers to create a unique machine that’s as distinctive as its owner.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I see the bike’s frame, the components, the bags, paint and even the rider as one unit and so we try to design the perfect fitting package for them.” – Florian Haeussler, Fern Fahrraeder</p></blockquote>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-34.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-34.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-34.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-34.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-34.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-34.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-34.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-34.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Even with the success of Fern, Flo continues to look for ways to carve out his place in the cycling industry and make his work available to more folks. He started the sibling component brand <a href=\"https://www.allygn.de/\" target=\"_blank\">Allygn</a> as the demand grew for custom parts he was making with Fern. A mix of the words “ally” and “align,” the growing Allygn (pronounces “əˈlīn”) collection features racks, fenders, and soon-to-come carbon fork, all of which are being made in Asia. Additionally, Flo is experimenting with making bikes with set geometries and sizing under the Allygn umbrella. These bikes will be made in-house, but TIG-welded rather than brazed to speed up production.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-48.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-48.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-48.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-48.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-48.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-48.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-48.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-48.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-40-1.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-40-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-40-1.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-40-1.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-40-1.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-40-1.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-40-1.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-40-1.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-51.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-51.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-51.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-51.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-51.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-51.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-51.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-51.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>The “Beast of the East” is a prototype Flo had built up and featured at Bespoked.

Tine started making bike bags back in 2012 and, with a background in long-distance touring and randonneuring, her early bags were made of lightweight sailcloth and pack-cloth fabrics. At the time, this was in contrast to the heavier woven fabrics and PVC tarpaulins preferred in much of Europe for their notable water resistance and durability. Tine found the alternatives to be preferable in their high quality, ease of processing, and overall performance. Her focus on utilizing lighter materials organically resulted in adopting the name Gramm and, as she commented to me,”<em>Nomen est omen</em>, which is our guide post ever since.”</p>\n<p>In 2015, Tine went all in and made Gramm Tourpacking her full-time gig. From then on, she prototyped, tested, and rode everything that would eventually be sold from their Berlin workshop. As she told me, “If that means hard and long working days for so many years, developing and crafting bags and products is an integral part of our identity.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Gramm-Tourpacking-4.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Gramm-Tourpacking-4.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Gramm-Tourpacking-4.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Gramm-Tourpacking-4.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Gramm-Tourpacking-4.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Gramm-Tourpacking-4.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Gramm-Tourpacking-4.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Gramm-Tourpacking-4.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Gramm-Tourpacking-20.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Gramm-Tourpacking-20.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Gramm-Tourpacking-20.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Gramm-Tourpacking-20.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Gramm-Tourpacking-20.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Gramm-Tourpacking-20.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Gramm-Tourpacking-20.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Gramm-Tourpacking-20.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-36.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-36.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-36.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-36.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-36.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-36.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-36.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Fern-Bicycles-and-Gramm-Tourpacking-36.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Today, Gramm has expanded to include a few employees aside from Tine, as all prototyping and custom/made-to-measure frame bags are done in their workshop, which is a lot of work. Being able to bring on a core group of craftspeople has allowed Gramm to grow while still retaining the agility to weather downturns and turbulent times, like the kind many brands are experiencing now. They are currently planning to expand their business partners to include more global bike shops and continue working with Flo at Fern for even more innovative products in the coming months and years. As for Gramm’s established lineup of bags, including the popular Diamond Bag and Hip Bag Handlebar Roll, manufacturing takes place with a partner in Portugal. Or, as Tine frames it: “Our online shop gives us the chance to offer continuously a slightly larger range of bags to more people (one size fits most) whilst keeping our passion for making custom bags, currently frame bags, alive.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Drust-and-Akinn-6-1.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Drust-and-Akinn-6-1.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Drust-and-Akinn-6-1.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Drust-and-Akinn-6-1.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Drust-and-Akinn-6-1.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Drust-and-Akinn-6-1.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Drust-and-Akinn-6-1.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Drust-and-Akinn-6-1.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3><a href=\"https://drustcycles.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Drust</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/akinncycles/\" target=\"_blank\">Akinn Cycles</a></h3>\n<p>Each time we feature a bike built by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/drustcycles/\" target=\"_blank\">Konstantin Drust</a> it never fails to garner a lot of attention.

And it also speaks to the environment within Berlin and Germany. Following his studies in mechanical engineering at Technical University of Berlin, and learning basic metalworking, he took a job at Big Forest Frameworks. There, he participated in both sides of the business: producing custom frames and teaching the craft. Now running his own operation, he still occasionally offers instruction on a small scale.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I learned that the custom bicycle industry, or let’s say the community of builders, is a nice, friendly and welcoming niche, almost a subculture. Almost everybody is open to sharing information, processes and contacts. Its more common to compliment and appreciate others work and achievements than I have experienced elsewhere. I do enjoy being part of this and am happy that I slowly find my place here.”</p></blockquote>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Drust-Cycles-Gravel-6.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Drust-Cycles-Gravel-6.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Drust-Cycles-Gravel-6.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Drust-Cycles-Gravel-6.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Drust-Cycles-Gravel-6.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Drust-Cycles-Gravel-6.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Drust-Cycles-Gravel-6.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Drust-Cycles-Gravel-6.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Drust-Cycles-Gravel-2.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Drust-Cycles-Gravel-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Drust-Cycles-Gravel-2.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Drust-Cycles-Gravel-2.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Drust-Cycles-Gravel-2.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Drust-Cycles-Gravel-2.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Drust-Cycles-Gravel-2.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Drust-Cycles-Gravel-2.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Drust-Cycles-Gravel-13.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Drust-Cycles-Gravel-13.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Drust-Cycles-Gravel-13.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Drust-Cycles-Gravel-13.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Drust-Cycles-Gravel-13.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Drust-Cycles-Gravel-13.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Drust-Cycles-Gravel-13.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Drust-Cycles-Gravel-13.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Thus far, Drust’s customers have asked him to build bikes for long days in the saddle, from ATB/touring mountain bikes to drop-bar gravel framesets. A prime example of this would be the gravel bike built for a customer, who rode up to Bespoked where I was able to quickly photograph (shown above) the wild build. As the bikes he rides and is most excited about, this makes sense. In the future, though, expect to see more utility and commuter bikes from Drust.

His stash includes bikes and parts collected from Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, France, Austria and, of course, all around Germany, and have now been made (re)available to customers all over the world.

Robert is a humble guy but he’s one of the most in-demand painters in Europe and has a body of work to show for it. Nearly one-third of the bikes I documented at Bespoked were painted by Velociao and I wasn’t even being remotely intentional about it. Certainly not a representative example, Robert is <em>busy</em>.</p>\n<p>Closely connected to the local handmade and vintage scene, Velociao has a range of specialties from bespoke paintwork to full-on restorations of classic bikes. Even before becoming enmeshed in Berlin’s handmade scene, Robert was painting – he studied graphic design while also working in an auto paint shop. Then, after working as a computer programmer and traveling the world by bike (this was years before the term “digital nomad” existed), he stayed in Berlin to establish Velociao.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Velociao-3.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Velociao-3.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Velociao-3.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Velociao-3.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Velociao-3.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Velociao-3.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Velociao-3.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Velociao-3.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>While Velociao often paints for custom builders like Fern, Drust, Merglas, Bonanno, etc., they also get work from larger brands doing prototyping, world tour teams, and carbon production factories. But when it comes to art direction and implementation, Robert is happy to take as little or as much from his customers as they want to give:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Some [customers] have very strict designs in their minds and our job is to make it reality. With others, we work together to create a design. Sometimes it is very easy to get inspired, with some ideas you really have to fight hard. But I think the best designs you will not find at first try. In some rare occasions, we get a wildcard and we can try to do some art.”</p></blockquote>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Velociao-20.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Velociao-20.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Velociao-20.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Velociao-20.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Velociao-20.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Velociao-20.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Velociao-20.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Velociao-20.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Velociao-22.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Velociao-22.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Velociao-22.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Velociao-22.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Velociao-22.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Velociao-22.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Velociao-22.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Velociao-22.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Velociao-15.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Velociao-15.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Velociao-15.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Velociao-15.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Velociao-15.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Velociao-15.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Velociao-15.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Velociao-15.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>For some examples of this, look no further than <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Cy5vGlasJ86/\" target=\"_blank\">a custom-painted OPEN U.P. frameset</a> for a customer over in Leipzig, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Czdo7tEMzVB/?img_index=1\" target=\"_blank\">Konstantin Drust’s personal road bike,</a> or the Soft Touch finish on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2023-bespoked-gallery-3/\" target=\"_blank\">Fern’s Ultra Rando</a>.
