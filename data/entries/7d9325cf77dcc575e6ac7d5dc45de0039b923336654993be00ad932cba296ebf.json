But I wasn’t really sure it was worth <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/bike-touring-versus-bikepacking/\" target=\"_blank\">shooting myself in the foot again</a> with an op-ed piece. You know me: I have the potential to be a hammerer of semantics and am very opinionated about the bicycle industry, its faults, and the rock tumbler of a world we in bike media often find ourselves in, particularly when it comes to marketing terminology.</p>\n<p>My intent with this piece is more about getting some thoughts out of my head and jotting them down in true op-ed form. If you’re looking for quotes or statistics, this ain’t gonna be it (though I do name a few), but that doesn’t mean a larger piece isn’t in the works.</p>\n<p>To that extent, I’ll re-state the title, which is also the thesis for this Dust-Up:</p>\n<p><strong>(Most) All Bicycles Are Handmade</strong>!</p>\n<p><em>I figured if there’s any media outlet that could be a fitting home for this discussion, it’s the one that has dedicated as much time and energy to the framebuilding world as The Radavist has and I’ll do my best to stay on track here…</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div><span><span></span></span><span></span></div>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>First Off: Why “Most”</h3>\n<p>I include “most” in the title because machines do make <em>some</em> bicycle frames. If you watch the above video from VPIC, a manufacturer of bicycle welding machines, you can see a machine welding a bicycle frame. This process tends to happen at higher-volume production houses and is often used with aluminum frames, but there are machines that can weld steel frames too. Bikes built by machines like this are typically what you’ll find in department stores.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024_Tapei_Bike_Show-53.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024_Tapei_Bike_Show-53.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024_Tapei_Bike_Show-53.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024_Tapei_Bike_Show-53.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/03/2024_Tapei_Bike_Show-53.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><em>From our <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/taipei-cycle-show-2024/\" target=\"_blank\">Taipei Cycle Show 2024 coverage</a>…</em></p>\n<p>There is a difference between a human in a production line welding a bicycle frame and a machine doing all the welding with a human loading that machine, at least in terms of what “handmade” means for the sake of this discussion and for almost all of the bikes you’ll see documented here on The Radavist.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1333\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-15.jpg?fit=1200,2000&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-15.jpg?w=1333&amp;quality=75 1333w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-15.jpg?resize=1024,1536&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-15.jpg?resize=768,1152&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-15.jpg?resize=700,1050&amp;quality=75 700w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-18.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-18.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-18.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-18.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-18.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-18.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-18.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/03/BaphometBicycles-18.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://theradavist.com/balance-and-perfect-social-order-inside-taos-based-baphomet-bicycles/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Baphomet Bicycles</em></a></p>\n<h3>Conflating handmade with bespoke or custom-tailored</h3>\n<p>I’ve long documented <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/framebuilders/\" target=\"_blank\">framebuilders and framebuilding culture</a> in this weird little corner of the bike industry.

These bikes are stunning examples of how a simple machine like the bicycle can be adorned with glitz and glamour, resulting in what I jokingly like to call “<em>balleur.</em>”</p>\n<p><em>Documenting these bikes is a lifelong passion of mine. It is something I hold very dear and am honored to be in the position that I am in.</em></p>\n<p>However, I can’t help but notice there’s been a persistent disconnect between the “handmade” label that’s customarily attributed to these bespoke, or small-batch, show bicycles and bikes that are still made by hand overseas in Asia.</p>\n<p><em>Aren’t (most) bicycle frames made by hand? Regardless of whether they are done so in the US, the UK, Italy, Australia, Taiwan, or China?</em></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1334\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Bespoked-2.jpg?fit=1200,1334&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Bespoked-2.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Bespoked-2.jpg?resize=1024,683&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Bespoked-2.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Bespoked-2.jpg?resize=1800,1201&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Bespoked-2.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Bespoked-2.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/Bespoked-2.jpg?resize=1536,1025&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><em>We love Bespoke!</em></p>\n<p>Here’s where it gets tricky. Is the label “handmade” somehow implying a value-add over a production frame made in Taiwan or China? Are one-off bespoke frames better than frames made in Taiwan? Objectively or subjectively? From a quality standpoint, you’ll be hard-pressed to find a better-constructed bicycle than one that rolls out of Maxway.

But each of the above two bikes are still made by hand, albeit at a different pace and using different construction methods. The Coast was made by hand from start to finish with a higher grade of finishing; the Crust was made by hand(s) in a production run where lugs are still used but not filed down and thinned to the level of the Coast. They’re both exceptional bikes occupying different points along the manufacturing spectrum, and both offer a stunning example of a bicycle respective to their owners’ budgets.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1334\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/1983-Imron-Bright-Gold-Touring-Package-Ritchey-Everest-42.jpg?fit=1200,2000&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/1983-Imron-Bright-Gold-Touring-Package-Ritchey-Everest-42.jpg?w=1334&amp;quality=75 1334w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/1983-Imron-Bright-Gold-Touring-Package-Ritchey-Everest-42.jpg?resize=1024,1535&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/1983-Imron-Bright-Gold-Touring-Package-Ritchey-Everest-42.jpg?resize=768,1151&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/1983-Imron-Bright-Gold-Touring-Package-Ritchey-Everest-42.jpg?resize=700,1049&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/10/1983-Imron-Bright-Gold-Touring-Package-Ritchey-Everest-42.jpg?resize=1025,1536&amp;quality=75 1025w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1333\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/05/Johns-1982-Ritchey-Tamalpais-Mountain-Bike-15.jpg?fit=1200,2000&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/05/Johns-1982-Ritchey-Tamalpais-Mountain-Bike-15.jpg?w=1333&amp;quality=75 1333w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/05/Johns-1982-Ritchey-Tamalpais-Mountain-Bike-15.jpg?resize=1024,1536&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/05/Johns-1982-Ritchey-Tamalpais-Mountain-Bike-15.jpg?resize=768,1152&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2022/05/Johns-1982-Ritchey-Tamalpais-Mountain-Bike-15.jpg?resize=700,1050&amp;quality=75 700w\" /></p>\n<p><em>Ritchey <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/1983-ritchey-everest-restoration/\" target=\"_blank\">A Bike, Everest</a> left, Ritchey <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/1982-ritchey-tamalpais-review/\" target=\"_blank\">B Bike, Tam</a>, right: note the higher quality of the fillet-brazing finish on the Everest.</em></p>\n<p>Many production bikes often have details that aren’t as “finished.” Tom Ritchey had his A and B Bikes with the latter being less finely detailed.

Their bikes aren’t handmade…” To which I interjected, “Yes, they are. Handmade in Taiwan.”</p>\n<p>The brief exchange was the catalyst for me to write this Dust-Up.

So if you’re still reading, thank you! I decided to include an expanded section that explains my personal beliefs, and a slightly deeper dive into this subject. As you might guess, yes, it gets complicated. </em></p>\n<p>I realized that in the eighteen years I’ve been running this website, I’ve never made an official statement about why I like supporting framebuilders and makers. What better place for this statement than a Dust-Up article? Let me first say that buying products made in their country of design origin is expensive. A pair of made-in-the-USA jeans will be much more expensive than jeans made overseas. The same applies to a bicycle frame.</p>\n<p><strong>Here’s where I really have to tread lightly. Bear with me.

For one, they are made in the thousands. Like Henry Ford (<a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/henryford-antisemitism/\" target=\"_blank\">who wasn’t a great human</a>) first implemented, the assembly line made it easy for production to ramp up considerably.

To be clear, overseas workers are often being paid very well in their local currency, but the exchange rate still makes the production cost cheaper than if the frame were built in the country of the product’s design origin (in most cases, we’re talking about as compared to being made in the US; one Taiwanese dollar currently equals .032 USD). The average pay for a factory worker in Taiwan is 500,852 TWD a year and 241 TWD/hour (<a href=\"https://www.erieri.com/salary/job/factory-worker/taiwan#:~:text=Salary%20Recap-,The%20average%20pay%20for%20a%20Factory%20Worker%20is%20TWD%20500%2C852,TWD%20380%2C146%20and%20TWD%20582%2C991.\" target=\"_blank\">citation</a>). This equates to an annual wage of about $16,000 USD at $7/hour. Here’s a breakdown of the average cost of living in <a href=\"https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/country_result.jsp?country=Taiwan\" target=\"_blank\">Taiwan</a>.</p>\n<p>Is this labor exploitation? I am not sure. Is it neocolonialism? I would say so. The same thing happens with India and call centers. Brands use lower-priced labor in other countries to make bikes and other consumer products more affordable in their home country, which results in better profit margins. In my opinion, this is a version of neocolonialism at play.</p>\n<p>Yet, at what point will the cost of mass production catch up with the US minimum wage? What will happen then? We’re getting closer…</p>\n<p>US bike companies make their products overseas because it is possible to make thousands of bike frames, and it is cheaper to do so, yielding more profit, in general. Here’s where it feels like a knife twist: in doing so, companies are able to make exceptional bikes that are very affordable. Instead of spending $2500 on a frame, you can get a complete bicycle for that much.</p>\n<p>That’s the main reason why I was so excited to do our Taiwan-made <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/radavist-edition-sklar-super-something-gravel-bikes/\" target=\"_blank\">Radavist Edition Sklar SuperSomething bikes</a>; they felt “custom” but were half as expensive as a US-made batch would have been.</p>\n<p>Making bikes in Taiwan is very important for getting people on bikes and offering more affordable bike offerings. However, I’d present a question: What if the minimum wage in the USA had kept up with inflation? Would we be as reliant on overseas, i.e., cheaper production, if it had? Then you might not balk at a $100 pair of jeans or a $2000 frameset if you were making $52 an hour! That’s a yearly gross income of almost $100,000 on minimum wage.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/02/Chromag-Darco-Steel-29er-Full-Suspension-Review-31.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/02/Chromag-Darco-Steel-29er-Full-Suspension-Review-31.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/02/Chromag-Darco-Steel-29er-Full-Suspension-Review-31.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/02/Chromag-Darco-Steel-29er-Full-Suspension-Review-31.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/02/Chromag-Darco-Steel-29er-Full-Suspension-Review-31.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/02/Chromag-Darco-Steel-29er-Full-Suspension-Review-31.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/02/Chromag-Darco-Steel-29er-Full-Suspension-Review-31.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/02/Chromag-Darco-Steel-29er-Full-Suspension-Review-31.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/02/Chromag-Darco-Steel-29er-Full-Suspension-Review-30.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/02/Chromag-Darco-Steel-29er-Full-Suspension-Review-30.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/02/Chromag-Darco-Steel-29er-Full-Suspension-Review-30.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/02/Chromag-Darco-Steel-29er-Full-Suspension-Review-30.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/02/Chromag-Darco-Steel-29er-Full-Suspension-Review-30.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/02/Chromag-Darco-Steel-29er-Full-Suspension-Review-30.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/02/Chromag-Darco-Steel-29er-Full-Suspension-Review-30.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/02/Chromag-Darco-Steel-29er-Full-Suspension-Review-30.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p><em>The intricate fabrication of the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/chromag-darco-29er-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Chromag Darco</a>, built in Taiwan</em></p>\n<p>On the flip side, since so much production has moved to Taiwan, they were given an influx of capital to advance their production lightyears ahead of what mass-produced bicycle frames ever looked like in the US.

If everything we consume is made overseas, there is an inherent disconnect of what the adverse effects of industrialization bring these areas. The air quality in industrialized areas can be very poor. Taiwan’s AQI reaches unhealthy levels due to the industrialized nature of the country, primarily from power plants that run factories (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution_in_Taiwan\" target=\"_blank\">citation</a>). Not to mention, the 3% sulfur diesel fuel-burning ships transporting lots of consumer goods to the USA are not that great, either (<a href=\"https://www.cadmatic.com/en/resources/articles/does-one-ship-pollute-as-much-as-50-million-cars/#:~:text=The%20article%20claimed%20that%20%E2%80%9CCargo,million%20diesel%2Dburning%20cars.%E2%80%9D\" target=\"_blank\">citation</a>).</p>\n<p>Although, I don’t particularly think <a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/onpoint/2023/12/19/how-big-oil-helped-push-the-idea-of-a-carbon-footprint\" target=\"_blank\">weaponizing carbon offsets</a> is productive when it comes to making an argument, especially related to cyclists. We’re riding bikes around towns when most Americans drive. We’re already doing a lot more than most people! Anecdotally, when I go on a bike ride here in Santa Fe, I rarely see another human riding a bike or walking, yet I see hundreds of cars.</p>\n<p>Cyclists are inherently better at minimizing impact, especially when we commute or make our 3-mile inner city trips by bike. So please, don’t feel too complicit in the fossil fuel guilt spiral.</p>\n<p>Where I will point the blame in the bike industry is this infatuation with “model years” of bikes, which, in general, just creates more waste. A lot of these model year bikes are made from carbon fiber too, which will not last as long as a steel bike. The United States is a vehicle for consumption (as someone who owns a media company); it’s often a tenuous dance between consumption and re-use. It’s one I am conflicted with the most.</p>\n<p>This is why I have chosen a “made in the US”/bespoke label to act as a filter for my personal buying habits, or I’ll buy secondhand when I can. And it was a big reason why I wanted to launch our community marketplace to sell used goods, the <a href=\"https://radbazaar.theradavist.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Rad Bazaar</a>.</p>\n<p><em>I’d also argue with a bespoke frame; there’s a significant emphasis put on personalization, custom fit, and “preciousness” that perhaps encourages people to hold onto it for a longer time.

Yet, a <a href=\"https://crustbikes.com/products/evasion\" target=\"_blank\">Crust Bikes Evasion</a> would not break from the same riding. However, the Bruce Gordon (above) has a different ride feel, which is why I love it so much. It’s also painfully light due to its delicate tubing selection.</em></p>\n<p>Another reason I like the way US-made bikes ride is that they are more prone to breaking. Yes, you read that right. Bikes break. It happens. However, the way a bicycle rides without having to pass extensive consumer safety testing is drastically different. Also, when a steel frame breaks, it’s often just a crack, not a catastrophic failure like when a carbon frame breaks. And it can often be repaired.</p>\n<p>To further expand on this: When a bike is designed to be ridden on dirt, it has to pass MTB certification when it’s produced in Taiwan due to <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-16/chapter-II/subchapter-C/part-1512?toc=1\" target=\"_blank\">US CPSC laws</a>. We are a litigious society in the US. That means the thin and flexy US-made fork that you love the feel of would not pass those tests, and that is why those four-pound steel forks from Taiwan might not flex and “plane” as nicely but won’t break on ya…</p>\n<p>Now, good framebuilders will engineer a bike to withstand the customer’s riding style, and to be fair, broken US-made frames are not very common—no more than Taiwan-made frames. Bikes break, but it’s often due to engineering or design flaws, not construction technique or execution. Or you just ride too hard! ;-)</p>\n<p>For example, a frame might crack at the end of a butting line in the downtube because it didn’t have a proper butting spec or a head tube gusset. Or it might crack on an investment cast dropout design because the dropout design wasn’t engineered correctly.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2018/04/InsideSycip-60.jpg?fit=1200,1333&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2018/04/InsideSycip-60.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2018/04/InsideSycip-60.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2018/04/InsideSycip-60.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2018/04/InsideSycip-60.jpg?resize=1900,1266&amp;quality=75 1900w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2018/04/InsideSycip-60.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2018/04/InsideSycip-60.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w\" /></p>\n<p><em>Jeremy Sycip in his shop</em></p>\n<p><strong>I am privileged to be able to own bikes that have been built by my friends.</strong></p>\n<p>When given the option to support the overseas manufacturing system, which often feels complicated and sometimes icky in an exploitive, late-capitalist way, I’d rather opt to support the community I find myself in <em>because</em> I can afford to.
