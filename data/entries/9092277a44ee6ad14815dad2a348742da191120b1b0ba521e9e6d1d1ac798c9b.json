The full statement:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\"We are aware of a limited number of reports online claiming that excess voltage while overclocking may have damaged the motherboard socket and pin pads. We are actively investigating the situation and are working with our ODM partners to ensure voltages applied to Ryzen 7000X3D CPUs via motherboard BIOS settings are within product specifications. Anyone whose CPU may have been impacted by this issue should contact AMD customer support.\"</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Original story: </strong>Over the weekend, users on Reddit and YouTube <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12ubu7h/am5_asus_mobos_burndead_problems/\">began posting</a> about problems with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/review-amd-ryzen-7800x3d-is-the-cheapest-way-to-get-the-most-out-of-a-1500-gpu/\">AMD's newest Ryzen 7000X3D processors</a>. In some cases, the systems simply stopped booting. But <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/12tlk7s/7800x3d_just_killed_itself_and_my_mobo/\">in at least one instance</a>, a Ryzen 7800X3D became physically deformed, bulging out underneath and bending the pins on the motherboard's processor socket.</p>\n\n<p>In a separate post, motherboard maker MSI <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/MSI_Gaming/comments/12x5uaq/new_am5_series_motherboard_bios_implement_cpu/\">indicated</a> that the damage \"may have been caused by abnormal voltage issues.\" Ryzen 7000X3D processors already impose limits on overclocking and power settings, but new BIOS updates from MSI specifically disallow any kind of \"overvolting\" features that could give the CPUs more power than they were built to handle. You can still undervolt your CPU to attempt to reduce temperatures and energy usage by giving the CPU a bit less power than it was designed for.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1933839#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1933839&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9092277a44ee6ad14815dad2a348742da191120b1b0ba521e9e6d1d1ac798c9b","category":"Tech"}
