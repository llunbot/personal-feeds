Ari’s recently launched Superior Peak is indeed a downhill race bike, but it’s also designed to make a great freeride or bike park bike. The frame’s many adjustment points allow different wheel setups, plus suspension and geometry tuning options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This bike was initially developed as a passion project of Ari’s design team, but also to meet the needs of Ari’s factory racers and their pro freeriders Kurtis Downs and Kyle Strait. All those riders have helped hone the Superior Peak into its production-ready form.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ari Superior Peak – Frame Features:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ari-Superior-Peak-drive-side-Whistler-bike-park.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ari-Superior-Peak-drive-side-Whistler-bike-park.jpg\" alt=\"Ari Superior Peak, side, Whistler\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ari-Superior-Peak-drive-side-Whistler-bike-park.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ari-Superior-Peak-drive-side-Whistler-bike-park-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ari-Superior-Peak-drive-side-Whistler-bike-park-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ari-Superior-Peak-drive-side-Whistler-bike-park-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ari-Superior-Peak-drive-side-Whistler-bike-park-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ari-Superior-Peak-drive-side-Whistler-bike-park-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ari-Superior-Peak-drive-side-Whistler-bike-park-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Photo: Steve Fisher</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Superior Peak frame is made from airformed aluminum, and features a CNC machined rocker link. Behind the rocker link sits a brace that increases stiffness in the front triangle. The Superior Peak has 200mms of rear travel driven by Ari’s Tetra Link linkage. This bike can run a single crown fork for freeride or bike park builds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adjustability is a main feature of the Superior Peak. It offers 29” or MX wheel compatibility, many different geo configurations, two leverage rate settings, and even a removable brace that adjusts the stiffness of the rear triangle.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/6.-Mullet-Flip-Chip-1.gif\"><img width=\"1920\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/6.-Mullet-Flip-Chip-1.gif\" alt=\"Ari Superior Peak, MX wheel flip-chip gif\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Flip-chips in the seatstay/rocker link junction adapt the Superior Peak to either a 29” or 27.5” rear wheel (on all frame sizes). Buyers can choose a full 29” or mullet setup at the time of purchase. These flip-chips serve two purposes: With a 29” rear wheel, the chip can be used to adjust the BB height to Low or High positions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A removeable seatstay brace gives riders the ability to tune the frame’s rear-end stiffness. Beyond rider preference, a stiffer rear end could be better suited for rough race tracks or freeriding, while increasing the flex could offer optimal traction in slippery, wet race conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/4.-Front-Shock-Mount.gif\"><img width=\"1920\" height=\"1280\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/4.-Front-Shock-Mount.gif\" alt=\"Ari Superior Peak, shock mount gif\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The rear shock’s leverage rate can be adjusted via two different shock mounts, which do not have any effect on frame geometry. The two mounts offer a more linear or a more progressive ride. The mounts also allow riders to tune the bike for either air or coil rear shocks. Both mounts are provided with each bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another of the Superior Peak’s geometry adjustments is a flip-chip in the chainstay that provides +/-6mm settings.  Ari also built the frame with a 1.5” head tube so riders can add reach or angle adjust headsets.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Fitments:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ari-Superior-Peak-external-cable-routing-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ari-Superior-Peak-external-cable-routing-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Ari Superior Peak, external cable routing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ari-Superior-Peak-external-cable-routing-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ari-Superior-Peak-external-cable-routing-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ari-Superior-Peak-external-cable-routing-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ari-Superior-Peak-external-cable-routing-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ari-Superior-Peak-external-cable-routing-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ari-Superior-Peak-external-cable-routing-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Other frame details include race-ready external cable routing, a SRAM UDH derailleur hanger, and a 200mm brake post mount. For protection the frame gets both chainstay and lower down tube protectors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bottom bracket is a threaded 83mm BSA type, with an ISCG 05 mount. The rear end uses a Boost 148mm rear axle, and rear tire clearance maxes out at 29×2.5” or 27.5×2.6”.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Geometry:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ari-Superior-Peak-frame-geometry-chart-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"633\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ari-Superior-Peak-frame-geometry-chart-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Ari Superior Peak, frame geometry chart\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ari-Superior-Peak-frame-geometry-chart-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ari-Superior-Peak-frame-geometry-chart-297x157.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ari-Superior-Peak-frame-geometry-chart-120x63.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ari-Superior-Peak-frame-geometry-chart-768x405.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Superior Peak is available in three frame sizes: S1, S2, and S3. This size range is suitable for riders from 5’3” to 6’5”. As described above there are lots of adjustments possible with the Superior Peak. The above chart shows all measurements based on 29” wheels, with the chainstays in Long mode and the BB in its Low position.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the geometry varies quite a bit with the frame’s many adjustments, Ari’s website has a configurator to show all the numbers that can be achieved with the flip-chips and different wheel setups. There are far too many geo numbers to list here, so I’ll have to recommend going to the site to pore through the many possibilities. <em> </em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Model Lineup:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Superior Peak will be offered in two complete builds and as a frameset. For full build specs check out Ari’s website, but below is a quick rundown of the key components.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Superior Peak Elite: $6499</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ari-Superior-Peak-Elite-model-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"739\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ari-Superior-Peak-Elite-model-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Ari Superior Peak, Elite, side\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ari-Superior-Peak-Elite-model-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ari-Superior-Peak-Elite-model-297x183.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ari-Superior-Peak-Elite-model-120x74.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Ari-Superior-Peak-Elite-model-768x473.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Superior Peak Elite comes equipped with a RockShox Boxxer Ultimate fork and a Vivid Ultimate DH rear shock.
