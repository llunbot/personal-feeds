And while performance-focused sports nutrition brands like <a href=\"https://www.skratchlabs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Skratch Labs</a> have largely catered to the carb-counting crowds, the science of nutrition underpinning their products can still be applied outside of the controlled confines of racing—to bikepacking, randonneuring and other unsupported adventure riding—when nutrition goes rogue. Hailey sat down with Skratch Labs dietitian, Colette Vartanian, to talk about gas-station fueling strategies, the magic of chocolate milk and if drinking ‘Trash Juice’ is actually ok. Read on for an unconventional conversation about cycling nutrition.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/lebron-james-canyon-find-your-fr.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/lebron-james-canyon-find-your-fr.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/lebron-james-canyon-find-your-fr.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/lebron-james-canyon-find-your-fr.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>09: <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/lebron-james-canyon-find-your-freedom/\" target=\"_blank\">LeBron James and Canyon Are Making More Than Just a Bike Commercial</a></h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/name_and_number/\" target=\"_blank\">Travis Engel</a> looked at how LeBron James being featured in a Canyon Bicycles commercial has larger cultural implications: For lifers like us, it’s always kind of exciting when a celebrity is spotted riding a bike. And it’s an even more exciting when it’s a <i>nice</i> bike. Whose heart didn’t swell when they saw that photo of Conan O’Brien on his Serotta? Unfortunately, for every <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/bike-pervert/id1438054347?i=1000627814172\" target=\"_blank\">Conan O’Brien podcast with a Dutch frame builder</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/303325/bicycle-diaries-by-david-byrne/\">David Byrne book about urban cycle touring</a>, there are a dozen <a href=\"https://www.tmz.com/2020/08/09/simon-cowell-breaks-back-malibu-surgery-required/\">Simon Cowell injuries on overpowered e-bikes.</a> Especially in the U.S., we all too rarely see the people who drive mainstream culture putting bikes in a positive light. That’s why Canyon’s partnership with LeBron James is such a big deal.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/radavist-dust-up-27.2-seatposts.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/radavist-dust-up-27.2-seatposts.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/radavist-dust-up-27.2-seatposts.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/radavist-dust-up-27.2-seatposts.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>08: <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/dust-up-27-2-gravel-bike-dropper-seatposts/\" target=\"_blank\">Old Man Yells at 27.2 Seatposts</a></h3>\n<p>As mountain bikes cross breed with gravel bikes, it’s odd to see what traits remain. Non-boost spacing gets a pass but 27.2 seat posts? Why? In this <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/tag/the-dust-up/\" target=\"_blank\">Dust-Up</a>, <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/tag/travis-engel/page/2/\">Travis</a> claims 27.2 mm seatposts are symptoms of the gravel industry’s refusal to evolve. Turns out there’s more to it, but he’s still upset.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Home-7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Home-7.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Home-7.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Home-7.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>07: <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/crust-bikes-stupid-tourist-break-away-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">A Look at the Crust Bikes Australia Wheelhouse</a></h3>\n<p>John and Cari were in Australia in July, and since they were on the same continent as Matt and Cheech from <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/search/Crust+Bikes/\" target=\"_blank\">Crust Bikes</a>, they had to visit them at their home in New South Wales. While there, John documented a selection of bikes from their shed, including some prototypes and soon-to-be-released future cult classics.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/2012-Bruce-Gordon-Monster-Cross.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>06: <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/all-bicycles-are-handmade/\" target=\"_blank\">(Most) All Bicycles Are Handmade</a></h3>\n<p>This post resulted in a number of phone calls for John. And that’s always a good thing. It was this <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/tag/the-dust-up/\" target=\"_blank\">Dust-Up</a> opinion column where John brought up a controversial point about the disconnect between the “handmade” language surrounding bicycle <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/framebuilders/\" target=\"_blank\">framebuilder</a> showcases and Asian-produced bicycle frames. Hold onto your butts for this one!</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Dust-Up-SRAM-Transmission-Travis.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Dust-Up-SRAM-Transmission-Travis.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Dust-Up-SRAM-Transmission-Travis.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Dust-Up-SRAM-Transmission-Travis.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>05: <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/sram-transmission-compatiblity-udh/\" target=\"_blank\">I Will Never* Buy Another Bike That Isn’t SRAM Transmission Compatible</a></h3>\n<p>After spending a year going back and forth between bikes with and without SRAM Transmission, <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/tag/travis-engel/\" target=\"_blank\">Travis</a> came to a realization. In today’s <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/the-dust-up/\" target=\"_blank\">Dust-Up,</a> he writes about why Transmission compatibility will be mandatory on his next bike purchase, why that worries him, and why he needed that asterisk.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div><span><span></span></span><span></span></div>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>04: <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/camera-corner-wende-cragg-film-book-announcement/\" target=\"_blank\">Camera Corner: Wende Cragg Documents the Birth of Mountain Biking</a></h3>\n<p>Photographer <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/tag/wende-cragg/\" target=\"_blank\">Wende Cragg</a> has been a pillar of the cycling community since she began documenting road, cyclocross, and the early days of mountain biking in Marin County, California, and throughout the United States over 50 years ago. We are delighted to launch the trailer for our first feature-length documentary film, <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/camera-corner-documentary-wende-cragg/\" target=\"_blank\">Camera Corner: Wende Cragg Documents the Birth of Mountain Biking</a>. It profiles <a href=\"https://mmbhof.org/wende-cragg/\" target=\"_blank\">Wende’s work</a> and its lasting impact on the cycling industry.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/All-City-Cosmic-Stallion-Titaniu.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/All-City-Cosmic-Stallion-Titaniu.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/All-City-Cosmic-Stallion-Titaniu.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/All-City-Cosmic-Stallion-Titaniu.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>03: <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/all-city-cycles-cosmic-stallion-titanium/\" target=\"_blank\">If There Is a Gravel Heaven, All-City Cycles Is There</a></h3>\n<p>We lost a good brand last year. All-City Cycles’ parent company, Quality Bicycle Products, <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/all-city-cycles-closing/\" target=\"_blank\">announced they’d be closing down the brand in 2024</a>. After a heartfelt outpouring here on The Radavist, John penned an homage to the brand vis-à-vis some abstract photos of the <a href=\"https://allcitycycles.com/bikes/cosmic_stallion_titanium_frameset\" target=\"_blank\">All-City Cycles Cosmic Stallion Titanium</a> and includes a note from Saisha Harris, All-City’s creative director, and final closing thoughts by Jeff Frane, the brand’s founder. </p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Ritchey-Montebello-Randonneuring.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Ritchey-Montebello-Randonneuring.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Ritchey-Montebello-Randonneuring.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/12/Ritchey-Montebello-Randonneuring.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>02: <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/ritchey-montebello-randonneuring-bike-outback-p-29er-frames-and-more/\" target=\"_blank\">2024 Ritchey Catalog Preview</a></h3>\n<p>While on the road to Sea Otter, John swung through the <a href=\"https://ritcheydesign.pxf.io/m5MEDe\" target=\"_blank\">Ritchey</a> HQ in the South Bay and got to check out some new models that are coming out a bit early.

It’s something <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/tag/travis-engel/\" target=\"_blank\">Travis</a> knows all too well, juggling multiple cycling disciplines, piles of gear, and a smattering of trail-work tools. With the help of a very forgiving spouse, he fits it all in (and around) a rental unit that’s about the size of a two-car garage. Oh, and he doesn’t have a garage.<br />\n </p>\n<hr />\n<p> <br />\nLet us know what articles stood out to you the most in the comments, or perhaps what you’d like to see more of in 2025.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/top-ten-articles-2024/\">The Radavist’s Top Ten Articles of 2024</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"9346c4b04b53e0e35704a150a3d2cc9f9a2da26a2c34526af7f26711df746631","category":"Cycling"}
