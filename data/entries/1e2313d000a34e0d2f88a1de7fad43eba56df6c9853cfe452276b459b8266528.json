Now, it seems, the team is to benefit from a dedicated downhill bike that runs an all-new suspension design.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/norco-dh-bike-aluminum-prototype-6-bar-linkage-high-pivot.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/norco-dh-bike-aluminum-prototype-6-bar-linkage-high-pivot.jpg\" alt=\"norco dh bike prototype four-bar linkage design drive side view\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/norco-dh-bike-aluminum-prototype-6-bar-linkage-high-pivot.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/norco-dh-bike-aluminum-prototype-6-bar-linkage-high-pivot-297x186.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/norco-dh-bike-aluminum-prototype-6-bar-linkage-high-pivot-800x500.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/norco-dh-bike-aluminum-prototype-6-bar-linkage-high-pivot-120x75.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/norco-dh-bike-aluminum-prototype-6-bar-linkage-high-pivot-768x480.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/norco-dh-bike-aluminum-prototype-6-bar-linkage-high-pivot-1536x960.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption>It is possible this dropout design could allow the team to play around with different rear-center lengths; indeed, the letters “RC.4” suggest there are at least four possible lengths.

Between it and the rear shock, there are two links working together (pink and orange) to drive a very short yoke (dark blue), which is the final member involved in driving the rear shock. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Norco-prototype-upside-down-Horst-link-4-bar-DH-bike_suspension-diagram.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Norco-prototype-upside-down-Horst-link-4-bar-DH-bike_suspension-diagram.jpg\" alt=\"norco dh prototype rough schematic of four-bar linkage layout new high pivot suspension platform\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Norco-prototype-upside-down-Horst-link-4-bar-DH-bike_suspension-diagram.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Norco-prototype-upside-down-Horst-link-4-bar-DH-bike_suspension-diagram-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Norco-prototype-upside-down-Horst-link-4-bar-DH-bike_suspension-diagram-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Norco-prototype-upside-down-Horst-link-4-bar-DH-bike_suspension-diagram-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Norco-prototype-upside-down-Horst-link-4-bar-DH-bike_suspension-diagram-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Norco-prototype-upside-down-Horst-link-4-bar-DH-bike_suspension-diagram-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption>Image annotated by Cory Benson – Bikerumor.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We reached out to Norco for comment on the new linkage design. Richard Belson of the Norco Communications Team said, <em>“The new DH prototype uses a complete re-imagining of the High Virtual Pivot suspension design we introduced on the Range a couple years back – but optimized for DH racing. Custom linkages and suspension components allow fine-tuning of leverage curves and allow us nearly infinite control over every aspect of the suspension performance. The principal design goal was to give the Norco Factory Team the best equipment available to win races on and provide engineers with and unprecedented level of control over kinematics and fine-tuning every aspect of the suspension”.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, Norco is sticking with a high-pivot, seemingly very happy with the majority rearward axle path it delivers. An idler pulley looks to be positioned concentric to the upper pivot in order to route the chain in such a way as to reduce the negative effects of chain growth that would otherwise impinge upon the performance of this layout.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Norco-Downhill-prototype-aluminum-high-pivot-22-tooth-idler-pulley.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"2401\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Norco-Downhill-prototype-aluminum-high-pivot-22-tooth-idler-pulley.jpg\" alt=\"norco prototype downhill bike 4-bar high pivot linkage 22tooth idler pulley\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Norco-Downhill-prototype-aluminum-high-pivot-22-tooth-idler-pulley.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Norco-Downhill-prototype-aluminum-high-pivot-22-tooth-idler-pulley-200x300.jpg 200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Norco-Downhill-prototype-aluminum-high-pivot-22-tooth-idler-pulley-800x1200.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Norco-Downhill-prototype-aluminum-high-pivot-22-tooth-idler-pulley-80x120.jpg 80w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Norco-Downhill-prototype-aluminum-high-pivot-22-tooth-idler-pulley-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Norco-Downhill-prototype-aluminum-high-pivot-22-tooth-idler-pulley-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Norco-Downhill-prototype-aluminum-high-pivot-22-tooth-idler-pulley-1365x2048.jpg 1365w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The team are running a 22T idler pulley, which is very large by current industry standards.

Meanwhile, 2nd place <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/markwallacebike/\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Wallace</a>‘s bike was coil-sprung. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also noteworthy is that a Norco Development Engineer involved in the creation of this bike, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/kirkmcdowall/\" target=\"_blank\">Kirk McDowall</a>, filled third place on that same podium.
