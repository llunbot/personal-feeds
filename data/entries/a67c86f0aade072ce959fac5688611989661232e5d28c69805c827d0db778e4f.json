The feature <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/17/ios-17-personal-voice-feature/\">debuted on the iPhone with iOS 17</a>, and it will be getting even better on iOS 19.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/Personal-Voice-iPhone-Feature.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nApple today <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/13/apple-previews-ios-19-accessibility-features/\">announced</a> that Personal Voice will be faster and easier to use on iOS 19, thanks to advancements in on-device machine learning and artificial intelligence.
