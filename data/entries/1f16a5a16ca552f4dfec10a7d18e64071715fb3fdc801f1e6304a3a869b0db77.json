His mom handed us each a $20 bill for the change machine, and we were determined to stretch our quarters as far as we could.</p>\n<p>Scrolling brawlers like <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em> and <em>Final Fight</em> were our favorite games. We also loved squaring off in what I consider the first true fighting game, the buttonless, <em>Robotron</em>-style, twin-joysticked <em>Karate Champ</em>.</p>\n<p>When we came across a <em>Street Fighter II: The World Warrior</em> cab sitting in the middle of the arcade, we stopped dead in our tracks. Everything about it, from the six buttons per player to the large dynamic sprites and backgrounds, felt larger than life to our teenage brains.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1942080#p3\">Read 51 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1942080&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Aurich Lawson","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1f16a5a16ca552f4dfec10a7d18e64071715fb3fdc801f1e6304a3a869b0db77","category":"Tech"}
