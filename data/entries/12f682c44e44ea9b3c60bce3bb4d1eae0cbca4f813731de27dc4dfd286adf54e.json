Fully embracing the fact that modern adventure gravel bikes are pretty much just reworked old-school rigid mountain bikes, Baum goes full MTB with their latest drop bar bike. In other words… proper modern wide XC bike tire clearance, low gears to climb steep mountain grades, and a dropper to send it off sick jumps… even in the drops! </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Baum DBM titanium gravel bike is a drop bar mountain bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Baum-Cycles-DBM-titanium-gravel-bike-is-a-fully-rigid-drop-bar-mountain-bike_front.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Baum-Cycles-DBM-titanium-gravel-bike-is-a-fully-rigid-drop-bar-mountain-bike_front.jpg\" alt=\"Baum Cycles DBM titanium gravel bike is a drop bar mountain bike, front view\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Baum-Cycles-DBM-titanium-gravel-bike-is-a-fully-rigid-drop-bar-mountain-bike_front.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Baum-Cycles-DBM-titanium-gravel-bike-is-a-fully-rigid-drop-bar-mountain-bike_front-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Baum-Cycles-DBM-titanium-gravel-bike-is-a-fully-rigid-drop-bar-mountain-bike_front-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Baum-Cycles-DBM-titanium-gravel-bike-is-a-fully-rigid-drop-bar-mountain-bike_front-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Baum-Cycles-DBM-titanium-gravel-bike-is-a-fully-rigid-drop-bar-mountain-bike_front-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Baum-Cycles-DBM-titanium-gravel-bike-is-a-fully-rigid-drop-bar-mountain-bike_front-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Baum-Cycles-DBM-titanium-gravel-bike-is-a-fully-rigid-drop-bar-mountain-bike_front-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Baum)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Baum Cycles calls their latest DBM “a gravel bike with MTB DNA”. Founder and CEO, Darren Baum loves riding the inevitably steep local powerline tracks from Baum’s HQ southwest of Melbourne, Australia. But those steep climbs and downhills are also more technically demanding than most gravel bikes can handle, so he wanted ever-wider tires to maintain grip and control.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Baum-Cycles-DBM-titanium-gravel-bike_wet-gravel-riding.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Baum-Cycles-DBM-titanium-gravel-bike_wet-gravel-riding.jpg\" alt=\"Baum Cycles DBM titanium gravel bike is a drop bar mountain bike, wet riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Baum-Cycles-DBM-titanium-gravel-bike_wet-gravel-riding.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Baum-Cycles-DBM-titanium-gravel-bike_wet-gravel-riding-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Baum-Cycles-DBM-titanium-gravel-bike_wet-gravel-riding-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Baum-Cycles-DBM-titanium-gravel-bike_wet-gravel-riding-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Baum-Cycles-DBM-titanium-gravel-bike_wet-gravel-riding-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Baum-Cycles-DBM-titanium-gravel-bike_wet-gravel-riding-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Baum-Cycles-DBM-titanium-gravel-bike_wet-gravel-riding-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“I normally ride in the Brisbane Ranges along McLean’s highway. Whoever McLean was, he didn’t know what a highway was. It’s got 20%+ pinches in it. I’ve wanted a bike to handle that kind of ride for a long time…. We’ve been doing it for the last 20 years.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>His solution is 29″ x 2.25″ or 2.4″ mountain bike tires and a proper wide-range 1x MTB drivetrain with a UDH. And instead of trying to just squeeze that into an existing bike, Baum created the new DBM from the ground up for maximum off-road capability. He kind of Frankensteined an XC rear end onto a gravel front triangle, then tweaked the geometry to balance the handling of the bigger tires.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“I did the working design drawings for this bike 8 years ago – I actually designed it at the same time as the Orbis [Baum’s disc brake road bike].”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>“Plus-Size” Gravel Tires</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Baum-Cycles-DBM-titanium-gravel-bike_front-end-view.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Baum-Cycles-DBM-titanium-gravel-bike_front-end-view.jpg\" alt=\"Baum Cycles DBM titanium gravel bike is a drop bar mountain bike, fat XC front tire\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Baum-Cycles-DBM-titanium-gravel-bike_front-end-view.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Baum-Cycles-DBM-titanium-gravel-bike_front-end-view-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Baum-Cycles-DBM-titanium-gravel-bike_front-end-view-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Baum-Cycles-DBM-titanium-gravel-bike_front-end-view-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Baum-Cycles-DBM-titanium-gravel-bike_front-end-view-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Baum-Cycles-DBM-titanium-gravel-bike_front-end-view-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Baum-Cycles-DBM-titanium-gravel-bike_front-end-view-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Baum says lightweight XC race tires work best, and low-profile treads still feel fast like a “plus-size” gravel tire.

Or go for a Boost-spaced 12x148mm DBM and get 2.4″ clearance like most modern XC or even trail bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Baum-Cycles-DBM-titanium-gravel-bike_chainstay-yoke.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Baum-Cycles-DBM-titanium-gravel-bike_chainstay-yoke.jpg\" alt=\"Baum Cycles DBM titanium gravel bike is a drop bar mountain bike, chainstay yoke\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Baum-Cycles-DBM-titanium-gravel-bike_chainstay-yoke.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Baum-Cycles-DBM-titanium-gravel-bike_chainstay-yoke-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Baum-Cycles-DBM-titanium-gravel-bike_chainstay-yoke-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Baum-Cycles-DBM-titanium-gravel-bike_chainstay-yoke-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Baum-Cycles-DBM-titanium-gravel-bike_chainstay-yoke-768x576.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They created a new wider T47 bottom bracket shell and 3D-printed chainstay yoke to set the chainstays and chainline wider for the bigger tires. That does also mean you end up with MTB cranks instead of road/gravel cranks. But there’s still room for up to a 44T 1x chainring, so top-end speed is still there with a 10T cog out back and the larger circumference of the bigger MTB tires.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>“Plus-Size” Gravel Geometry</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Baum-Cycles-DBM-titanium-gravel-bike-is-a-drop-bar-mountain-bike_plus-size-gravel-geometry.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Baum-Cycles-DBM-titanium-gravel-bike-is-a-drop-bar-mountain-bike_plus-size-gravel-geometry.jpg\" alt=\"Baum Cycles DBM titanium gravel bike is a drop bar mountain bike, plus-size gravel geometry\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Baum-Cycles-DBM-titanium-gravel-bike-is-a-drop-bar-mountain-bike_plus-size-gravel-geometry.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Baum-Cycles-DBM-titanium-gravel-bike-is-a-drop-bar-mountain-bike_plus-size-gravel-geometry-297x165.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Baum-Cycles-DBM-titanium-gravel-bike-is-a-drop-bar-mountain-bike_plus-size-gravel-geometry-1536x853.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Baum-Cycles-DBM-titanium-gravel-bike-is-a-drop-bar-mountain-bike_plus-size-gravel-geometry-120x67.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Baum-Cycles-DBM-titanium-gravel-bike-is-a-drop-bar-mountain-bike_plus-size-gravel-geometry-768x427.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>The DBM’s geometry is specifically designed to deliver a road-oriented riding position, ideal for grinding over long distances. Therefore, the DBM has more bottom bracket drop (~80 mm) than a MTB because there is not the same need for obstacle clearance.

That then also gets the same rigid carbon fork choice, stem &amp; seatpost, plus a SRAM GX Eagle AXS Transmission wireless build and alloy DT Swiss G1800 wheels. Plus, Baum has a full range of other pre-configured complete builds and individual upgrades to adapt the dropbar mountain bike to your style of riding (and bigger budgets).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No official word from Baum about how long it will take to get a DBM for you. Still, they simply say that <em>“lead time is subject to demand and availability</em>“.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://baumcycles.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>BaumCycles.com</em></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/baum-dbm-ti-gravel-bike-drop-bars-the-mountain-like-its-hot/\">Baum DBM Ti Gravel Bike Drop Bars the Mountain Like It’s Hot</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"12f682c44e44ea9b3c60bce3bb4d1eae0cbca4f813731de27dc4dfd286adf54e","category":"Cycling"}
