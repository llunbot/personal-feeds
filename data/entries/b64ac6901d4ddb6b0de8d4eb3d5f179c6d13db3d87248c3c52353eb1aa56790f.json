In the second quarter 2025, Apple posted revenue of $95.4 billion, a 5 percent increase year over year and its second-best March quarter behind 2022’s $97.3 billion. Quarterly earnings per diluted share were $1.65, up 8 percent year over year and a second-quarter record. The company reported $24.8 billion in profit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple beat the analysts’ predicted revenue of $94.68 billion and $1.63 diluted earnings per share. However, the stock took a tumble in Friday trading as investors weighed the current sales figures against the tariff turmoil. CEO Tim Cook made a statement during the Apple earnings call that the company expects an estimated charge of $900 million due to the tariffs next quarter, but he noted the situation is volatile and likely to change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPad led the charge this quarter with a 16 percent increase year-over-year. Apple released the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2595313/ipad-air-2025-release-date-specs-display-size-price-processor.html\">M3 iPad Air</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2646985/ipad-a16-review.html\">11th-generation iPad</a> in March, giving its sales numbers a boost. Services also had a double-digit quarter, posting an 11 percent increase over the same quarter a year ago for a record high. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This quarter saw the release of the much-anticipated second season of <em>Severance</em> on Apple TV+, which may have positively affected Apple’s Services division. The Mac saw a 6 percent increase, thanks to the release of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2631068/15-inch-macbook-air-m4-review.html\">M4 MacBook Air</a>. iPhone sales were up just 2 percent in a quarter that saw the release of the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2630661/iphone-16e-review.html\">iPhone 16e</a>. Wearables sales saw a small dip. Cook stated that Apple doesn’t believe that the threat of tariffs influenced buyer behavior for this past quarter.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><div>\n<p>How the quarter ended year-over-year for Apple:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>iPhone: </strong>$47 billion (up from $46 billion)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPad: </strong>$6.4 billion (up from $5.6 billion)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Mac:</strong> $8 billion (up from $7.5 billion)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Wearables:</strong> $7.5 billion (down from $7.9 billion)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Services:</strong> $27 billion (up from $24 billion)</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>“Our March quarter business performance drove EPS growth of 8 percent and $24 billion in operating cash flow, allowing us to return $29 billion to shareholders,” said Kevan Parekh, Apple’s CFO. “And thanks to our high levels of customer loyalty and satisfaction, our installed base of active devices once again reached a new all-time high across all product categories and geographic segments.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple declared a cash dividend of $0.26 per share of common stock payable on May 16 to shareholders of record at the close of business on May 12, 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The earnings call comes hours after a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2769359/court-orders-apple-to-allow-external-purchase-links-in-apps.html\">U.S. court orders Apple to allow external purchase links in apps</a> and a <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-gb/money/technology/apple-must-pay-optis-502-million-lump-sum-in-uk-patent-dispute-court-rules/ar-AA1DZmBR\">U.K. court ruled against Apple in a patent lawsuit</a>.
