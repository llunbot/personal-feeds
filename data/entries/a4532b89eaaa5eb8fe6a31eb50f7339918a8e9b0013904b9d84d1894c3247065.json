The negotiations center around allowing Tencent to accept payments in WeChat mini-games through Apple's payment system, potentially resolving a long-standing point of contention.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith nearly 1.4 billion users in China, WeChat serves as a ubiquitous platform for various services, including bill payments and ticket bookings. While many of these transactions are exempt from Apple's fees, in-app content and online entertainment, such as mini-games, remain subject to Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> policies.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe rise of mini-games within WeChat has led to developers seeking ways to monetize their creations by selling in-game items. Some have resorted to \"steering\" practices, guiding players to make payments outside of Apple's ecosystem to avoid fees and improve their profit margins. Apple has been pushing Tencent to close these loopholes, viewing them as violations of its ‌App Store‌ policies.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has also warned ByteDance, the company behind TikTok, about in-app spending policies. However, these aggressive actions reportedly risk alienating content creators in a crucial market at a time when Apple's business practices are under increased global scrutiny.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUnlike in the US, Apple holds a smaller market share in China, failing to make the top five in smartphone sales last quarter. Meanwhile, Chinese companies like Tencent and ByteDance maintain significant control over online content, including games and video platforms. Apple's challenges in the Chinese market were underscored by a 6.5% decline in Greater China revenue for the June quarter.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/\">China</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wechat/\">WeChat</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/06/apple-approves-iphone-16-wechat-update/\">Apple Approves WeChat Update for iPhone 16 Amid Ongoing Revenue-Sharing Negotiations</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-approves-wechat-update-for-iphone-16-amid-ongoing-revenue-sharing-negotiations.2435198/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a4532b89eaaa5eb8fe6a31eb50f7339918a8e9b0013904b9d84d1894c3247065","category":"Apple"}
