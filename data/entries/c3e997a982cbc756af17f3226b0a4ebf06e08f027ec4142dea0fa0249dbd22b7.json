Gurman noted that Apple is keenly interested in the reasons why customers who choose to return the first-generation Vision Pro headset do so, ultimately passing feedback from retail stores to the company's headquarters to help perfect the next version of the device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe tidbit effectively rules out the idea of the Vision Pro receiving annual updates like the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> or Apple Watch, suggesting that it is likely to follow a longer refresh cycle that could even surpass that of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> and market research firm Omdia have <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/low-cost-vision-pro-canceled/\">previously mentioned</a> a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/28/vision-pro-rumored-to-gain-brighter-displays/\">2027 launch time frame</a> for the second-generation Vision Pro headset. It is said that there could be no hardware updates for the Vision Pro until then, meaning that the Vision Pro might go up to 54 months without a refresh from the announcement of the first generation to the second. Meanwhile, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/low-cost-vision-pro-canceled/\">could launch a more affordable Vision headset</a> around 2025, according to both <em>The Information</em> and <em>Bloomberg</em>.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro\">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/19/gurman-apple-vision-pro-2-at-least-18-months-away/\">Gurman: Apple Vision Pro 2 at Least 18 Months Away</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-apple-vision-pro-2-at-least-18-months-away.2419845/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c3e997a982cbc756af17f3226b0a4ebf06e08f027ec4142dea0fa0249dbd22b7","category":"Apple"}
