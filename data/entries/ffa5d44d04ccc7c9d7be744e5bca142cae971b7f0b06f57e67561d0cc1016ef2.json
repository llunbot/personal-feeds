Cook later posted about the event <a href=\"https://weibo.com/timcook\">on Weibo</a> with a short video, saying that \"the energy tonight was off the charts!\" Cook then visited a Yucheng elementary school to see how students use the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> to support local culture.\r<br />\n \r<br />\nThe appearance comes just a day after two <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-16/iphone-15-china-sales-disappoint-as-huawei-rises-jefferies-says\">Counterpoint Research studies</a> claimed that ‌iPhone 15‌ sales are down 4.5% versus last year's ‌iPhone 14‌ lineup in China, causing Apple's share price to fall. As a result, Cook's visit is being widely associated with concern about ‌iPhone 15‌ sales in China across various mainstream media outlets.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCook's posts on Weibo during the trip have also aroused a usual amount of ire. For example, Cook shared a photo of Chengdu at night shot on an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a> Max. The post was then \"flooded with complaints\" about the ostensibly poor quality of the image and unfavorable comparisons to pictures from Chinese devices like Huawei's recently Mate 60 Pro.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/\">China</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/counterpoint/\">Counterpoint</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15\">iPhone 15 (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-15-Pro\">iPhone 15 Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/17/cook-visits-china-amid-reports-of-iphone-15-sales/\">Apple CEO Tim Cook Visits China Amid Reports of Lower iPhone 15 Sales</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-ceo-tim-cook-visits-china-amid-reports-of-lower-iphone-15-sales.2407825/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ffa5d44d04ccc7c9d7be744e5bca142cae971b7f0b06f57e67561d0cc1016ef2","category":"Apple"}
