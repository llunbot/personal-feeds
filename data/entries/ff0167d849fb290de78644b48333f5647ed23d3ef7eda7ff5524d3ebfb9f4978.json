That’s not how things are supposed to work on the Mac, which has a policy of data siloing, or sandboxing, so that each app is unable to see other apps’ data without explicit permission.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As The Verge reports, the flaw was patched with an update shortly after it raised the issue with OpenAI. But doubts concerning the service’s trustworthiness may remain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And not just for OpenAI. Apple has long trumpeted its own pro-security and pro-privacy credentials, and only last month announced that OpenAI would be the first and highest-profile partner for the new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362804/apple-intelligence-faq-features-release-date-hardware-support.html\">Apple Intelligence</a> project. When this AI feature launches later this year, most tasks will be handled by Apple’s own systems, but certain tasks will be handed off to third-party bots… with the user’s permission. Apple says ChatGPT in Apple Intelligence will obscure IP addresses and requests won’t stored.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google Gemini and other third-party AI assistants are also expected to join Apple Intelligence, but ChatGPT is the only confirmed chatbot for now.</p>\n\nMacOS</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"ff0167d849fb290de78644b48333f5647ed23d3ef7eda7ff5524d3ebfb9f4978","category":"Apple"}
