While the software update is a relatively minor one, it still includes a handful of new features, changes, and bug fixes for iPhones.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/iOS-18.3-Apple-Intelligence-Color-Palette-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nBelow, we recap everything new in iOS 18.3.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Notification Summary Changes</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/bbc-news-apple-intelligence-summaries-clean-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nApple Intelligence notification summaries for news apps are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/16/ios-18-3-news-notifications-removed/\">temporarily unavailable on iOS 18.3</a>, after the feature <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/06/bbc-calls-out-apple-ai-creating-fake-news-titles/\">inaccurately summarized some news stories</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nStarting with iOS 18.3, notifications that have been summarized have italicized text, which makes them stand out visually compared to regular notifications. Apple also promised that improvements to notification summaries are coming in a future iOS update.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLast, iOS 18.3 lets you easily manage settings for notification summaries from the Lock Screen.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Visual Intelligence Upgrades</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/12/Visual-Intelligence-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nAll four iPhone 16 models are equipped with a Camera Control button that enables Visual Intelligence, a new feature that can provide information about items or places in a person's surroundings. For example, Apple says users can click and hold the Camera Control to bring up the hours or ratings for a restaurant that they pass by.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 18.3 includes <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/21/ios-18-3-new-visual-intelligence-features/\">a few Visual Intelligence upgrades</a> for all iPhone 16 models. First, you can now add an event to the Calendar app from a poster or flyer. Second, Visual Intelligence can now identify animals and plants.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nVisual Intelligence is not available on any other iPhone models.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Calculator App Enhancement</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/07/iOS-18-Calculator-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\niOS 18.3 reintroduces a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/21/ios-18-3-calculator-app/\">small but useful Calculator app function</a> that had been removed in an earlier software update. Now, when you tap the equals sign a second time, the Calculator app repeats the last mathematical operation. This functionality is useful for calculating compound interest or other repeat operations.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Black Unity (Possibly)</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/01/Apple-Watch-Black-Unity-Band-2024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1960\" height=\"1102\" />\r<br />\nIn the tvOS 18.3 Release Candidate for the Apple TV, <a href=\"https://x.com/aaronp613/status/1882223043889758219\"><em>MacRumors</em> contributor Aaron Perris uncovered</a> a \"UNITY25\" reference in the update's code. In each of the past four years, Apple announced a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/17/apple-watch-black-unity-band-2024/\">Black Unity campaign</a>, and this has typically included a new Apple Watch band, watch face, and a matching iPhone wallpaper.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt is unclear what Apple may be planning for Black Unity in 2025. While the tvOS 18.3 code suggests something might be coming, the iOS 18.3 Release Candidate notes did not mention anything. An announcement is likely by next week, if one is made.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>More</h2>\r<br />\niOS 18.3 fixes these two bugs related to Siri and Apple Music:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<ul><li>Fixes an issue where the keyboard might disappear when initiating a typed Siri request</li>\r<br />\n<li>Resolves an issue where audio playback continues until the song ends even after closing Apple Music</li></ul>Apple also added references to robot vacuum support in the Home app to iOS 18.3's code, but it seems this functionality never went live. Apple's website says the feature is coming in a future update, so perhaps we will see it with iOS 18.4.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe previously shared Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/21/ios-18-3-release-notes/\">full iOS 18.3 release notes</a>.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/23/ios-18-3-expected-to-be-released-next-week/\">Apple Expected to Release iOS 18.3 Next Week With These New Features</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-expected-to-release-ios-18-3-next-week-with-these-new-features.2447961/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"fa0a5835c4ee658f1987263c9902c4e7aecc1febf557adb97ec6eb77ba160f72","category":"Apple"}
