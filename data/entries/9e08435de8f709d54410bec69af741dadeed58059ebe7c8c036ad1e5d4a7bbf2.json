Windows 10 users with supported PCs have been offered the Windows 11 upgrade plenty of times before. But now Microsoft is apparently making a fresh push to get users to upgrade, sending them full-screen reminders recommending they buy new computers.</p>\n<p>The reminders, which users have seen within the last few days, all mention the end of Windows 10 support but otherwise seem to differ from computer to computer. My Ars colleague Kyle Orland got one focused on Windows 11's gaming features, while <a href=\"https://x.com/femceIs/status/1858314837845229737\">posters</a> on <a href=\"https://x.com/RealJMcAfreak/status/1859181138746704108\">X</a> (formerly Twitter) got screens that <a href=\"https://x.com/JustinWhang/status/1859033492367307108\">emphasized</a> the ease of migrating from old PCs to new ones and other Windows 11 features. One specifically recommended <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/microsofts-copilot-ai-pc-requirements-are-embarrassing-for-intel-and-amd/\">upgrading to a Copilot+ PC</a>, which supports a handful of extra AI features that other Windows 11 PCs don't, but other messages didn't mention Copilot+ specifically.</p>\n<p>None of the messages mention upgrading to Windows 11 directly, though Kyle said his PC meets Windows 11's requirements. These messages may be intended mostly for people using older PCs that can't officially install the Windows 11 update.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/microsoft-pushes-full-screen-ads-for-copilot-pcs-on-windows-10-users/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/microsoft-pushes-full-screen-ads-for-copilot-pcs-on-windows-10-users/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9e08435de8f709d54410bec69af741dadeed58059ebe7c8c036ad1e5d4a7bbf2","category":"Tech"}
