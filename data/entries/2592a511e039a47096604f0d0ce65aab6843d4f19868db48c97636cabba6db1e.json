update will feature connectivity for power meters and can turn your iPhone into a head unit.</p>\n<p>The new update will enable Apple Watch users to connect to Bluetooth-enabled cycling accessories such as speed and cadence sensors, heart rate monitors and power meters.</p>\n<p>Apple announced the software update at its World Wide Developers Conference, and it’s likely a production version of the update will be available to download in September.</p>\n<p>The Bluetooth connectivity will also work on some stationary bikes using Apple’s GymKit, which shares fitness data with compatible gym equipment.</p>\n<h2>iPhone head unit</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Apple-WWDC23-watchOS-10-cycling-Live-Activity-230605_inline.jpg.large\"

screen.</p>\n<p>When tapped, the workout will open into a full-screen view, effectively turning your iPhone into a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-computers/\">bike computer</a> when mounted to the handlebars.</p>\n<p>This full-screen view will display your current and average speed, distance and heart rate, as well as any data collected from connected devices such as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-power-meters/\">power meters</a>.</p>\n<p>Apple says it will use power data to estimate your <a

topographic maps with contour lines and enable users to search for nearby trailheads.</p>\n<p>The new mapping will also drop a pin at the last location where you had a cellular signal and another where you can make an SOS call using any network provider, which may come in handy when out on the trails.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\"

accelerometers to determine if you have had a crash and will alert emergency services if you don’t get up after a minute.</p>\n<p>With the software only just being released to developers, we are yet to see what apps such as Strava and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/guide-to-using-komoot/\">Komoot</a> will do with the added functionality, but we can expect them to incorporate the new connectivity.</p>","author":"Nick
