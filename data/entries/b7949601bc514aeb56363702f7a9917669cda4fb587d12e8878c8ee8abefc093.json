The post was earlier reported <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/4/24287574/apple-approved-illegal-streaming-app-univer-note\">by <em>The Verge</em></a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/01/iOS-App-Store-General-Feature-JoeBlue.jpg\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" />\r<br />\nWhile the so-called <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/univer-note/id6677022888\">\"Univer Note\" app</a>'s description says that it \"can easily help you record every day's events and plan your time,\"  it actually lets you stream movies that are still playing in theaters, like <em>Smile 2</em> and <em>Venom: The Last Dance</em>. You can also watch shows from streaming services like Netflix, Disney+, and even Apple TV+. Oops!\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt appears that the French-language app has been available in the App Store since September. Apple's App Review team clearly made a mistake here, and the app should be removed from the App Store promptly after receiving news coverage.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/04/apple-approves-pirated-movie-tv-show-app/\">Apple Accidentally Lets Pirated Movies and TV Shows App Into App Store</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-accidentally-lets-pirated-movies-and-tv-shows-app-into-app-store.2441972/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"b7949601bc514aeb56363702f7a9917669cda4fb587d12e8878c8ee8abefc093","category":"Apple"}
