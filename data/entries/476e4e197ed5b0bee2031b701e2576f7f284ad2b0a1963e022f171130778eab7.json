Nevertheless, the launch machine is running at full speed and I have plenty to share with you today. Let’s dive in and take a look!</p> \n<p><span><strong>Last Week’s Launches</strong></span><br /> Here are some launches that caught my eye:</p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/\">Amazon Redshift</a></strong> – Amazon Redshift ML can now make use of an integrated connection to <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/forecast/\">Amazon Forecast</a>. You can now use SQL statements of the form <code>CREATE MODEL</code> to create and train forecasting models from your time series data stored in Redshift, and then use these models to make forecasts for revenue, inventory, demand, and so forth. You can also define probability metrics and use them to generate forecasts.

The workflows can perform build, test, and deployment operations, and can be triggered when the pull requests in the linked repositories are opened, revised, or closed. To learn more, read <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecatalyst/latest/userguide/extensions-github.html\">Using GitHub Repositories with CodeCatalyst</a>.</p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/lex\">Amazon Lex</a></strong> – You can now use the Analytics on Amazon Lex dashboard to review data-driven insights that will help you to improve the performance of your Lex bots. You get a <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lexv2/latest/dg/analytics-overview.html\">snapshot</a> of your key metrics, and the ability to drill down for more. You can use <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lexv2/latest/dg/conversation-dashboard.html\">conversational flow visualizations</a> to see how users navigate across intents, and you can review individual conversations to make qualitative assessments.
