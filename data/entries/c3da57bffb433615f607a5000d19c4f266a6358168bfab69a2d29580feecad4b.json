As such the California-based brand doesn’t make a training version, no race version, no pro version. Instead, they focus on one bib, perfected. The Solution Bibs ($255) are made in California and are the result of 13 months of rigorous research, design, development, and field testing. They’re designed for versatility and performance regardless of your riding style and they’re finally back in stock.
