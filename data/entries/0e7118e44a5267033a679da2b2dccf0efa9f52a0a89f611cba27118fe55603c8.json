The leaker did not mention a specific hertz (Hz) rating, but previous rumors have suggested Apple plans to use 120Hz, or the \"ProMotion\" rate historically limited to the Pro versions of its iPhone lineup.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to use <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/iphone-17-always-on-promotion-displays/\">low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) panels</a> for all iPhone 17 models, which is what enables ProMotion due to its superior power efficiency. The current iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus use low-temperature polycrystalline silicon (LTPS) panels, which are capped at a maximum 60Hz refresh rate.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nProMotion enables refresh rates ranging from 1Hz to 120Hz. At the low end, ProMotion allows for always-on functionality, which means always-on time, widgets, and notifications that have been available on Pro models' Lock Screens for some time now. Meanwhile, at the high end, 120Hz enables smoother scrolling and video content. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nRoss Young of Display Supply Chain Consultants has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/20/iphone-17-and-17-air-120hz-promotion-rumor/\">claimed</a> that both the standard iPhone 17 and a slimmer model that we are calling the \"iPhone 17 Air\" will both feature ProMotion. With all four iPhones slated to get ProMotion displays in 2025, higher refresh rates will no longer be a feature that sets the Pro iPhone models apart. Perhaps more importantly, it will also see Apple's flagship lineup finally ditch 60Hz displays – something most other premium smartphone brands left behind quite a while ago.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDigital Chat Station accurately revealed that the ‌iPhone 15‌ and ‌iPhone 15‌ Plus would feature a slightly <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/27/iphone-15-still-to-have-smaller-sensor-than-pros/\">smaller 48-megapixel sensor</a> than the ‌iPhone 15‌ Pro and ‌iPhone 15‌ Pro Max last year, as well as the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/07/27/5-4-inch-iphone-12-display-images/\">display panel design</a> of the ‌iPhone‌ 12 back in 2020.
