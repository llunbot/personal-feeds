{"title":"Gone Racing – Lachy’s Alt Tour de France","link":"https://cyclingtips.com/2021/10/rapha-gone-racing-the-alt-tour/","date":1635200410000,"content":"<div><div><p>It’s late October and Lachlan Morton has just finished the 2020 Giro d’Italia when his team principal Jonathon Vaughters calls. “What do you think about riding another Grand Tour next season?” he asks. Lachlan’s not sure. “Don’t worry,” comes the reply. “This isn’t going to be like anything you’ve done before. We’ve got something else planned. You in?”</p><p>The Alt Tour. Every stage and every transfer of the 2021 Tour. 5,550km from Brest to Paris with over 65,000 metres of climbing and just 23 days to cover the distance. No teammates to shelter behind, no mechanics and no rest days. This was a challenge made for Lachlan Morton. Of course he was in but could he last out?</p><p>If you followed Lachlan’s dot in July, then this is the film you’ve been waiting for. The latest episode of Rapha Gone Racing takes you inside Lachlan’s ambitious attempt to complete the Alt Tour, beat the peloton back to Paris and raise funds for World Bicycle Relief.</p><p><strong>Supporting World Bicycle Relief</strong></p><p>As well as riding for a fresh perspective on road racing, Lachlan rode the Alt Tour with a powerful new purpose. To make every kilometre really count, Rapha and EF Education First combined to donate 1,000 bikes to World Bicycle Relief before inviting those following Lachlan to support the cause. With help from fans around the world, Lachlan managed to raise over £500,000 and counting. If you’re inspired by Lachlan’s challenge, you can still donate to WBR and help provide even more people with the bikes they need to access an education, healthcare or employment.</p><p><a href=\"https://give.worldbicyclerelief.org/campaign/ef-rapha-for-wbr/c329966\" target=\"_blank\">Donate Now</a></p><div><h2>WHAT IS ‘FROM THE SOURCE’?</h2><p>When you see an article containing ‘From the source’ label on the homepage or with the headline in blue, note that this is content directly from the brand and it has been vetted by our Editors and deemed worthy of your attention.
