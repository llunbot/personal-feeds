You’ll ride across the Shimanami Kaido suspension bridges, through gorges, and climb Western Japan’s highest peak, Mt. Ishizuchi while passing ancient mountainside villages. Throughout, you’ll follow parts of the pilgrimage of Buddhist priest Kuka’s (aka Kobo-Daishi) 88 temples.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ride-and-seek-japan-samurai-cycling-tour-mt-fuji-Ryuganbuchi.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ride-and-seek-japan-samurai-cycling-tour-mt-fuji-Ryuganbuchi.jpg\" alt=\"mt fuji seen from Japanese cycling tour  by ride and seek\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ride-and-seek-japan-samurai-cycling-tour-mt-fuji-Ryuganbuchi.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ride-and-seek-japan-samurai-cycling-tour-mt-fuji-Ryuganbuchi-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ride-and-seek-japan-samurai-cycling-tour-mt-fuji-Ryuganbuchi-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ride-and-seek-japan-samurai-cycling-tour-mt-fuji-Ryuganbuchi-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ride-and-seek-japan-samurai-cycling-tour-mt-fuji-Ryuganbuchi-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ride-and-seek-japan-samurai-cycling-tour-mt-fuji-Ryuganbuchi-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ride-and-seek-japan-samurai-cycling-tour-mt-fuji-Ryuganbuchi-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The bonus stage lets you cycle around Mt. Fuji for incredible views of the iconic Japanese mountain from the Fuji 5 Lakes, with the option of riding up the volcano.
