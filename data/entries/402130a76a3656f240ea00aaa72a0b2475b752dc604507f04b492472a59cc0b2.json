Now the Haul LT, Long Tail is here, promising 50% more pannier carrying capacity thanks to 2x the rear rack space. That means room for up to three passengers, making this ebike a real family hauler…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Specialized Globe Haul LT long tail cargo ebike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Globe-Haul-LT-long-tail-cargo-ebike_side-view.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Globe-Haul-LT-long-tail-cargo-ebike_side-view.jpg\" alt=\"Specialized Globe Haul LT long tail cargo ebike, side view\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Globe-Haul-LT-long-tail-cargo-ebike_side-view.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Globe-Haul-LT-long-tail-cargo-ebike_side-view-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Globe-Haul-LT-long-tail-cargo-ebike_side-view-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Globe-Haul-LT-long-tail-cargo-ebike_side-view-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Globe-Haul-LT-long-tail-cargo-ebike_side-view-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Globe-Haul-LT-long-tail-cargo-ebike_side-view-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption><em>all c.

A 700w rear hub motor, and the same 772Wh battery powers the Haul LT cargo ebike. That means up to 60 miles of Class 3 ebike pedal-assist at up to 28mph. Apparently, there’s also an optional plug-in throttle adapter. Now that should help you zip around town up to 20mph without needing to pedal. On the one hand, that effectively turns the Haul into a low-speed electric motor scooter. But it also improves rideability when heavily loaded.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Globe-Haul-LT-long-tail-cargo-ebike_rear-end.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Globe-Haul-LT-long-tail-cargo-ebike_rear-end.jpg\" alt=\"Specialized Globe Haul LT long tail cargo ebike, rear end\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Globe-Haul-LT-long-tail-cargo-ebike_rear-end.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Globe-Haul-LT-long-tail-cargo-ebike_rear-end-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Globe-Haul-LT-long-tail-cargo-ebike_rear-end-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Globe-Haul-LT-long-tail-cargo-ebike_rear-end-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Globe-Haul-LT-long-tail-cargo-ebike_rear-end-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Globe-Haul-LT-long-tail-cargo-ebike_rear-end-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Globe-Haul-LT-long-tail-cargo-ebike_rear-end-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Spec-wise the LT is <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/specialized-globe-haul-st-e-cargo-bike-gets-official-and-fast/\" target=\"_blank\">almost exactly the same as the ST</a>. Globe builds it up the same down to the components, brass bell, built-in LED lighting, and MIK rack accessory compatibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Globe-Haul-LT-long-tail-cargo-ebike_loaded-down.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Globe-Haul-LT-long-tail-cargo-ebike_loaded-down.jpg\" alt=\"Specialized Globe Haul LT long tail cargo ebike, loaded down\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Globe-Haul-LT-long-tail-cargo-ebike_loaded-down.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Globe-Haul-LT-long-tail-cargo-ebike_loaded-down-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Globe-Haul-LT-long-tail-cargo-ebike_loaded-down-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Globe-Haul-LT-long-tail-cargo-ebike_loaded-down-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Globe-Haul-LT-long-tail-cargo-ebike_loaded-down-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Globe-Haul-LT-long-tail-cargo-ebike_loaded-down-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Globe-Haul-LT-long-tail-cargo-ebike_loaded-down-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet, thanks to the bigger, beefier &amp; longer frame, the LT bumps up carrying capacity to 200kg / 441lb (including ebike, rider &amp; gear). That’s up 22lbs from the ST. The LT rear rack itself can now haul up to 80kg / 176lb of gear or passengers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Globe Haul LT – Pricing, options &amp; availability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Globe-Haul-LT-long-tail-cargo-ebike_cartoon.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Globe-Haul-LT-long-tail-cargo-ebike_cartoon.jpg\" alt=\"Specialized Globe Haul LT long tail cargo ebike, cartoon\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Globe-Haul-LT-long-tail-cargo-ebike_cartoon.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Globe-Haul-LT-long-tail-cargo-ebike_cartoon-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Globe-Haul-LT-long-tail-cargo-ebike_cartoon-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Globe-Haul-LT-long-tail-cargo-ebike_cartoon-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Globe-Haul-LT-long-tail-cargo-ebike_cartoon-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Specialized-Globe-Haul-LT-long-tail-cargo-ebike_cartoon-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new extended Globe Haul LT long tail cargo ebike is now available from your local US Specialized dealer. Pricing starts from $3500, before you start accessorizing. Specialized backs the Haul LT with the same lifetime frame warranty &amp; 2-year ebike system protection as the ST. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thus, that should reassure your shift into alternate transport. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can almost infinitely customize it. Pick from optional pannier adapters, a front platform rack, basket &amp; pannier buckets, kids’ seats, a bigger Crew Cab rear passenger seat, new huge rear adjustable cargo rails for the 31″ long rear rack, extra long 30″ rear side bags, and now full-length running boards for multiple rear passengers, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stock is limited of both the new Globe Haul LT and the original ST, according to Specialized. So, act fast if you are feeling like one less car is in your immediate future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.specialized.com/us/en/globe/c/globe\" target=\"_blank\">Specialized.com/Globe</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/specialized-globe-haul-lt-cargo-ebike-extends-a-long-tail-to-haul-more/\">Specialized Globe Haul LT Cargo eBike Extends a Long Tail to Haul More Passengers</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"402130a76a3656f240ea00aaa72a0b2475b752dc604507f04b492472a59cc0b2","category":"Cycling"}
