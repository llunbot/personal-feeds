Lululook's bands are ideal for ‌Apple Watch Ultra‌ owners who are looking for a band option that is refined enough for the office and other situations where sportier bands don't quite work.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLULULOOK-Titanium-Compatible-Apple-iWatch%2Fdp%2FB0BP1KSRHN%2F\">Lululook Retro Titanium Band</a>, priced at $40, has a classic look that's similar in style to the Submariner band from Rolex. It offers a multi-link design with a secure clasping mechanism. There is a folding buckle and double buttons to lock the strap on the wrist, preventing the Apple Watch from coming loose.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/lululook-retro-band.jpg\" alt width=\"1698\" height=\"1032\" />\r<br />\nLululook's <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0C4H44HQK%2F\">Timeless Titanium Band</a> is the closest match to Apple's stainless steel Link bracelet, but in a color that works better with the ‌Apple Watch Ultra‌. The band has a secure closing mechanism, and at $70, it's much more affordable than the Link bracelet.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/lululook-timeless-band.jpg\" alt width=\"900\" height=\"600\" />\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLULULOOK-Titanium-Compatible-Apple-iWatch%2Fdp%2FB0C1GJLN9R\">Modern Titanium Band</a> from Lululook is the company's most unique, and Lululook says that it was inspired by Iron Man. Available for $46, this is the band that stands out the most of the bunch, so if you want a modern version of a titanium band it's worth checking out.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/lululook-modern-band.jpg\" alt width=\"1700\" height=\"1700\" />\r<br />\nAll of the bands from Lululook are made from a lightweight titanium material that is comfortable on the wrist and able to hold up to heavy use. Lululook says that the bands are waterproof and sweatproof, and because of the low weight of the titanium, the bands work for all-day use.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe bands are 200mm in length and are adjustable by removing links, so Apple Watch owners can get a perfect fit. Titanium is lighter than steel, so Lululook says that these bands are lighter than Apple's own Link band, and that the material will resist scratches and corrosion. Lululook's full range of Apple Watch bands can be <a href=\"https://www.lululook.com/collections/apple-watch-bands\">found on the Lululook website</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/lululook-retro-2.jpg\" alt width=\"2872\" height=\"1616\" />\r<br />\nWe have one ‌Apple Watch Ultra‌ and Lululook band to give away to a <em>MacRumors</em> reader.
