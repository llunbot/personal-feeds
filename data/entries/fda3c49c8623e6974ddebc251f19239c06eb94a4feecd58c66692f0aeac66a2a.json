It’s an unapologetic, thoroughbred race machine that has stuck to its roots in the Cannondale lineup for over a decade. For 2022, the Scalpel returns with a fresh new design – look at that paint! – and new geometry with a slacker front end of 66.5º across all sizes. Complete with HollowGram cranks and a mix of high-end Shimano components, the new Scalpel HT Hi-MOD 1 as pictured here has a retail of $5000.
