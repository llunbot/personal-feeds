Apple last updated the ‌Mac Studio‌ and ‌Mac Pro‌ with M2-series chips at WWDC in 2023, meaning that they could go around 24 months without an update, even though the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a> now contains the M4 chip.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll other Macs with the exception of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a> should be available with the M4 chip by the end of 2024, but Gurman does not anticipate any new models being unveiled at WWDC in June. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<strong>More to follow...</strong><div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-studio/\">Mac Studio</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/mac-pro/\">Mac Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac-Studio\">Mac Studio (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Mac_Pro\">Mac Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-studio.237\">Mac Studio</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-pro.1\">Mac Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/05/19/no-new-mac-studio-and-mac-pro-until-mid-2025/\">Gurman: No New Mac Studio and Mac Pro Until Mid-2025</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-no-new-mac-studio-and-mac-pro-until-mid-2025.2426840/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"df2f158a4dca6287dc1a83b5989cc298425feae3c7ac894fc224fdb03aa8418a","category":"Apple"}
