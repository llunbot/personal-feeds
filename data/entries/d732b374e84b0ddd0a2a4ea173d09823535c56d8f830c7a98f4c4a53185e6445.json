Now, the only constraints to launch are technical issues with the rocket or its ground systems. SpaceX is expected to hold a final readiness review this weekend before deciding to proceed with a launch attempt.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1931432#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1931432&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d732b374e84b0ddd0a2a4ea173d09823535c56d8f830c7a98f4c4a53185e6445","category":"Tech"}
