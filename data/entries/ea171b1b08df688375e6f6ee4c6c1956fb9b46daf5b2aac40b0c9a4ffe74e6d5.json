(Note that they are for the regular iPhone 16 models, not the Pro variants.) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see, the most remarkable part of the image is that the camera cutout is a vertical “pill” shape, rather than a square. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2007943/iphone-16-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">Previous rumors</a> claimed that the non-pro iPhone 16 models, which will still only have two cameras (Wide and Ultrawide), would arrange them vertically rather than diagonally. This early case, if accurate, would corroborate those claims.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cases make the iPhone 16 look similar to the iPhone X, which introduced the vertical rear camera arrangement. Previously, iPhones had either single camera holes or horizontal camera arrays with two cameras. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s worth mentioning that it is still <em>very</em> early for iPhone 16 cases to make an appearance. Yes, certain case manufacturers do get some dimensions from Apple in order to make properly fitting cases and have them on shelves in time for the iPhone launch, but we generally see those leak out a month or two before Apple’s unveiling in September. This image was posted on March 28, which is <em>very</em> early to see cases for a September release, and as such you should view this image with a healthy dose of skepticism. </p>\n\niPhone</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"ea171b1b08df688375e6f6ee4c6c1956fb9b46daf5b2aac40b0c9a4ffe74e6d5","category":"Apple"}
