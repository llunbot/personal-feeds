The court document for the case's dismissal does not provide any specific details about the agreement, but Aude issued a public apology on the same day.  \r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn a <a href=\"https://x.com/andyaude1/status/1887639465574998500\">post</a> on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, Aude said leaking information was a \"profound and expensive mistake.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAude's full apology:<blockquote>I spent nearly eight years as a software engineer at Apple. During that time, I was given access to sensitive internal Apple information, including what were then unreleased products and features. But instead of keeping this information secret, I made the mistake of sharing this information with journalists who covered the company. I did not realize it at the time, but this turned out to be a profound and expensive mistake. Hundreds of professional relationships I had spent years building were ruined. And my otherwise successful career as a software engineer was derailed, and it will likely be very difficult to rebuild it. Leaking was not worth it. I sincerely apologize to my former colleagues who not only worked tirelessly on projects for Apple, but work hard to keep them secret. They deserved better.</blockquote>Aude joined Apple in 2016, to work on optimizing battery performance, and the company fired him in 2023 after learning of his wrongful disclosures.
