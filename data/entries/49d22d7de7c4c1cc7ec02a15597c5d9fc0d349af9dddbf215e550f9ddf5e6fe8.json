And it’s the bike model customers keep begging for in titanium. Who can argue with a ti trail bike that could last a lifetime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, Canfield went back to the drawing board and cooked up the limited edition Ti Nimble 9. It had to be special – just as burly and all-mountain capable as the standard <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/canfield-nimble-9-steel-hardtail-returns-for-2024/\" target=\"_blank\">chromoly N9</a>, just prettier and fancier!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Canfield-Ti-Nimble-9-limited-edition-29er-titanium-trail-hardtail_dropping-in-Sedona.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Canfield-Ti-Nimble-9-limited-edition-29er-titanium-trail-hardtail_dropping-in-Sedona.webp\" alt=\"2025 Canfield Ti Nimble 9 limited edition 29er titanium trail hardtail, dropping in Sedona, AZ\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Canfield-Ti-Nimble-9-limited-edition-29er-titanium-trail-hardtail_dropping-in-Sedona.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Canfield-Ti-Nimble-9-limited-edition-29er-titanium-trail-hardtail_dropping-in-Sedona-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Canfield-Ti-Nimble-9-limited-edition-29er-titanium-trail-hardtail_dropping-in-Sedona-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Canfield-Ti-Nimble-9-limited-edition-29er-titanium-trail-hardtail_dropping-in-Sedona-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Canfield-Ti-Nimble-9-limited-edition-29er-titanium-trail-hardtail_dropping-in-Sedona-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>“I wanted to take a great bike and make it even better. I really wanted to create something special with the Nimble Ti. And after riding it, I can confidently say we’ve done just that… We know our riders and they ride hard.  Just because it’s a Ti hardtail doesn’t mean it’s a wimpy XC bike.”</p>\n<cite><em> – Lance Canfield</em></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s new?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Canfield-Ti-Nimble-9-limited-edition-29er-titanium-trail-hardtail_frame-angled.webp\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"1100\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Canfield-Ti-Nimble-9-limited-edition-29er-titanium-trail-hardtail_frame-angled.webp\" alt=\"2025 Canfield Ti Nimble 9 limited edition 29er titanium trail hardtail, angled frame\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Canfield-Ti-Nimble-9-limited-edition-29er-titanium-trail-hardtail_frame-angled.webp 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Canfield-Ti-Nimble-9-limited-edition-29er-titanium-trail-hardtail_frame-angled-297x218.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Canfield-Ti-Nimble-9-limited-edition-29er-titanium-trail-hardtail_frame-angled-120x88.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Canfield-Ti-Nimble-9-limited-edition-29er-titanium-trail-hardtail_frame-angled-768x563.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Titanium is known for its light weight, durability, and more compliant ride compared to steel. This new Ti N9 does shave over 1.5lb of the chromoly N9. But Canfield wanted to ensure that this titanium hardtail was every bit as tough as the steel original, so it gets built from a burly oversized Ti-3AL-2.5V tubeset with extra reinforcements throughout. So you get a toptube gusset at the headtube, an extra brace at the seatstays, and a big machined chainstay yoke &amp; brace tied into ISCG tabs around the bottom bracket.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Canfield-Ti-Nimble-9-limited-edition-29er-titanium-trail-hardtail_rear-angled-detail.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Canfield-Ti-Nimble-9-limited-edition-29er-titanium-trail-hardtail_rear-angled-detail.webp\" alt=\"2025 Canfield Ti Nimble 9 limited edition 29er titanium trail hardtail, angled detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Canfield-Ti-Nimble-9-limited-edition-29er-titanium-trail-hardtail_rear-angled-detail.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Canfield-Ti-Nimble-9-limited-edition-29er-titanium-trail-hardtail_rear-angled-detail-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Canfield-Ti-Nimble-9-limited-edition-29er-titanium-trail-hardtail_rear-angled-detail-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Canfield-Ti-Nimble-9-limited-edition-29er-titanium-trail-hardtail_rear-angled-detail-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Canfield-Ti-Nimble-9-limited-edition-29er-titanium-trail-hardtail_rear-angled-detail-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Canfield Ti Nimble 9 carries over the key geometry of the steel N9, meaning a 66° head angle when built with a 150mm travel fork, and moderately long frame Reach figures.
