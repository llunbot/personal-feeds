Meta this week told employees to quit working on the device following a product review meeting that involved Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/09/meta-quest-3.jpg\" width=\"1385\" height=\"779\" />\r<br />\nThe now-canceled device was slated for launch in 2027, and it was meant to be equipped with high-resolution micro OLED displays, which is what Apple used for the Vision Pro. Meta was aiming to sell the device for under $1,000, but that was not going to be possible with the high cost of the displays.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMeta is continuing development on the Quest 4, a successor to the Quest 3, and that headset could come out in 2026. The Quest 3 is priced at $500, which is also the likely target price point for its successor. Meta is also focusing on software rather than hardware, and it <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/22/meta-expands-vr-operating-system/\">announced a Horizon OS platform</a> for third-party hardware makers earlier this year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen the Vision Pro launched, Meta was hoping that the device would <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/29/meta-optimistic-vision-pro-launch/\">reinvigorate the headset market</a> and validate Zuckerberg's major push into the AR/VR space. Instead, Apple has struggled with consumer appeal, and interest in the Vision Pro has waned over time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEnthusiasm about the Vision Pro <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/22/apple-vision-pro-customer-interest-dying-down/\">started dying down</a> just a month after it launched, and fewer customers visited Apple retail stores for demonstrations. Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/23/apple-cuts-vision-pro-shipments/\">cut Vision Pro shipments</a> in April, and the company is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/11/apple-vision-pro-under-500000-sales-this-year/\">unlikely to sell</a> even 500,000 of the headsets in 2024. As a result, Apple has stopped work on a second-generation high-cost Vision Pro and is instead focusing on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/18/apple-suspends-work-on-vision-pro-2/\">creating a lower-cost model</a> with fewer features and a price closer to high-end iPhones.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/23/meta-cancels-high-end-headset/\">Meta Cancels High-End Mixed Reality Headset After Apple Vision Pro Struggles</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/meta-cancels-high-end-mixed-reality-headset-after-apple-vision-pro-struggles.2434241/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ea3f9d629c2de4e23232253bea788dc004652c8e9e9fada7e1d0039ca8f182e1","category":"Apple"}
