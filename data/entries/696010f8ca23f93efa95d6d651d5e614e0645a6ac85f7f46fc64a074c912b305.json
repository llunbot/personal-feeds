The menu is expected to show an iPad battery's maximum remaining capacity and cycle count.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA sample of the code strings added in the iPadOS 17.5 beta:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<ul><li>\"iPad must be regularly used while not connected to power to show maximum capacity.\"</li>\r<br />\n<li>\"This is the number of times iPad has used your battery's capacity.\"</li>\r<br />\n<li>\"The iPad battery is performing as expected.\"</li>\r<br />\n<li>\"iPad batteries, like all rechargeable batteries, have a limited lifespan and may eventually need to be serviced or replaced.\"</li>\r<br />\n<li>\"The original battery was designed to retain X capacity at X cycles under ideal conditions. Actual battery performance depends on a number of variables, including how iPad is used and charged regularly. The one-year warranty includes service for defective batteries in addition to rights provided under local consumer laws.\"</li></ul>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere is no visible Battery Health menu on any existing iPad models on the first iPadOS 17.5 beta, leading us to believe that the menu may be limited to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/28/new-ipad-models-may-launch/\">new iPad Pro and iPad Air models that are rumored to launch in May</a>, and likely other new iPads released in the future. Apple has shown battery capacity information on iPhones for many years, but cycle count information is currently <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/20/iphone-15-shows-battery-cycle-count/\">limited to the latest iPhone 15 series</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple will likely release iPadOS 17.5 to the public in May. Given this is a code finding in a beta, we cannot guarantee that a Battery Health menu will be added to the iPad, but it is certainly something that Apple has been working on.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-air/\">iPad Air </a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Air\">iPad Air (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#11-iPad-Pro\">11\" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#12-9-iPad-Pro\">12.9\" iPad Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/03/ipados-17-5-beta-battery-health-code/\">iPadOS 17.5 Beta Hints at Battery Capacity and Cycle Count Menu on Upcoming iPads</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipados-17-5-beta-hints-at-battery-capacity-and-cycle-count-menu-on-upcoming-ipads.2423459/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"696010f8ca23f93efa95d6d651d5e614e0645a6ac85f7f46fc64a074c912b305","category":"Apple"}
