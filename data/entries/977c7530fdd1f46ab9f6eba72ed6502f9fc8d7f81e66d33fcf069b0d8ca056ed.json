On August 10, the California Public Utilities Commission <a href=\"https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/news-and-updates/all-news/cpuc-approves-permits-for-cruise-and-waymo-to-charge-fares-for-passenger-service-in-sf-2023\">voted</a> to allow Google’s Waymo and GM’s Cruise to begin charging customers for driverless taxi rides across the city.
