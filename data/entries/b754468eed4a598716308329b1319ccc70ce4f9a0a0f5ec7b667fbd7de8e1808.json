We’ve seen a lot. But one\nobservation stands out: The best ideas — the ones that launch\nmeaningful companies — need to seem crazy and stupid at first.</p>\n\n<p>Amazon, Google and Facebook are among the most powerful companies\nin the world today, but each of them seemed absolutely\npreposterous when launched. When Jeff Bezos started Amazon as an\nonline bookstore 30 years ago, most didn’t even know what the\ninternet was. Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded Google in 1998\nwhen most believed search was going nowhere. In the 2000s, Mark\nZuckerberg bet Facebook could fundamentally change the way\nbillions of people used the internet — to share <em>everything</em> back\nwhen most were terrified about sharing <em>anything</em>.</p>\n\n<p>It’s this messianic belief in a vision that makes many\nentrepreneurs so quirky — and so interesting. It takes a unique\npersonality to spend years saying “I’m right” when most around you\nsay “That’s wrong.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Love this statement of purpose.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/09/crazy-stupid-tech\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b754468eed4a598716308329b1319ccc70ce4f9a0a0f5ec7b667fbd7de8e1808","category":"Tech"}
