Given that the two models are expected to be identical apart from their size difference, the latter possibility seems most likely. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis is the first rumor we have received about potential colors for the standard iPhone 16 models, and the leaker has an unproven track record for accurate leaks, so the colors given await corroboration from other sources before we can consider them to be correct. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs for the iPhone 16 Pro models, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/26/iphone-16-pro-new-space-black-rose-colors/\">rumors suggest</a> they could come in new \"space black\" and \"rose\" titanium colors. The Blue Titanium color that iPhone 15 Pro models are currently available in will allegedly be dropped from the iPhone 16 Pro lineup in favor of the new rose color. Meanwhile, \"space black,\" which is said to be similar to the iPhone 14 Pro color of the same name, will replace Black Titanium.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Natural and White Titanium colors are also rumored to be slightly different on the iPhone 16 Pro models. Natural Titanium is said to be returning, but with more of a gray tint to it. Meanwhile, White Titanium will appear more like a \"silver white\" color, which is also said to be similar to the silver version of the iPhone 14 Pro.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe iPhone 16 lineup is expected to be announced in the fall.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/fixed-focus-digital/\">Fixed Focus Digital</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/10/iphone-16-plus-rumored-to-come-in-these-7-colors/\">iPhone 16 Plus Rumored to Come in These 7 Colors</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16-plus-rumored-to-come-in-these-7-colors.2423918/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4e6a311cb22dc805e1bb197f6c751afad85523f3fae2ea754f306599992b116a","category":"Apple"}
