Apple also does not plan to sell a gold ‌iPhone 15 Pro‌ or Pro Max this year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGold has long been one of the colors that Apple has made available for the Pro iPhones due to the color's popularity in places like China.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to <em>9to5Mac</em>, the standard <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> models will come in black, green, blue, yellow, and pink, which are colors that we have seen rumored previously.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWe'll get a first look at the color options for the ‌iPhone 15‌ lineup in September, with rumors suggesting that Apple will hold an event on Tuesday, September 12.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/24/apple-iphone-15-pro-colors/\">iPhone 15 Pro to Come in Blue and Gray Titanium, No Gold Expected</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-15-pro-to-come-in-blue-and-gray-titanium-no-gold-expected.2399547/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"92ed0b253b5b81108de6b760aa3fddc8f58a3b814544833a334a24d71e55d45d","category":"Apple"}
