The Linux hardware firm isn't targeting only its customers with its GNOME replacement; it also hopes to get distro maintainers and app makers on board with its Rust-built, UX-focused desktop.</p>\n<p>While the Cosmic desktop will be built into <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/review-system76-pangolin-is-a-solid-15-inch-slab-of-linux-with-a-few-quirks/\">the Linux vendor's Pop!_OS</a> (which is also in the alpha ISO), it's also available to other systems, as you might expect. System76 provides drop-in instructions for Fedora and Arch Linux installs, among others.</p>\n<p>System76 says it is \"excited to see COSMIC integration elevate Linux as a whole,\" along with what results \"from making UX-building more accessible.\" By building Cosmic natively in the Rust language, System76 also intends to provide a more stable and memory-safe environment for apps.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041716#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2041716&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fc3859b221b7483cf4edaa303e44ca08f49643b9b0a431dd95098fb1bdc20d39","category":"Tech"}
