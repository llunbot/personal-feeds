He finished 39 minutes down, just inside the time cut, but fortunately looks to be in better spirits now.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/rating-all-tour-de-france-teams\">Rating all 22 Tour de France teams on paper</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/blue-tour-de-france-jerseys\">All the blue Tour de France jerseys ranked</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-climbs-2024\">The key climbs of the 2024 Giro d’Italia</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/how-to-watch-and-live-stream-the-tour-de-france\">How to watch the Tour de France 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\">Men’s Tour de France 2024: Route, how to watch and all you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Visma-Lease a Bike’s ‘Control Room’ banned from Tour de France </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"529\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Control-Room-970x529.webp\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Control-Room-970x529.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Control-Room-300x163.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Control-Room-768x419.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Control-Room-1536x837.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Control-Room-750x409.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Control-Room-1140x621.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/Control-Room.webp 1701w\" /><figcaption>Visma-Lease a Bike</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/jumbo-visma\" target=\"_blank\">Visma-Lease a Bike</a> introduced their ‘Control Room’ before the Tour de France, which is a van filled with equipment that they say ‘will act as a central collection point of real-time data’ for the race. The van would be available to show the team directors weather information, race radio and TV footage, as well as live data and technology integrated with the footage that shows exactly where particular riders are in the group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UCI issued a statement on the same day, which said, ‘Our priority is to maintain the integrity of the sport, ensuring sporting fairness, equitable access to technology and the primacy of man over machine. The UCI is committed to upholding these principles and will take appropriate measures based on the findings of the investigation.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Control Room has been banned from any Tour de France ‘premises’ by the ASO, but that doesn’t stop it operating elsewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Bora-Hansgrohe are now Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Red-Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe-Tour-de-France-team-2024-970x647.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Red-Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe-Tour-de-France-team-2024-970x646.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Red-Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe-Tour-de-France-team-2024-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Red-Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe-Tour-de-France-team-2024-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Red-Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe-Tour-de-France-team-2024-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Red-Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe-Tour-de-France-team-2024-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Red-Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe-Tour-de-France-team-2024-750x500.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Red-Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe-Tour-de-France-team-2024-1140x760.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Red-Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe-Tour-de-France-team-2024-465x310.jpeg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Red-Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe-Tour-de-France-team-2024-620x413.jpeg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/06/Red-Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe-Tour-de-France-team-2024-350x233.jpeg 350w\" /><figcaption>Joerg Mitter</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/bora-hansgrohe\" target=\"_blank\">Bora-Hansgrohe</a> have now officially become Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe, with their new look debuting at the Tour de France. The green kit has been replaced with a sponsor-laden dark kit as Red Bull becomes a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pro-cycling-sponsors\" target=\"_blank\">main sponsor</a> of the team.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Red Bull has previously sponsored individual riders such as Wout van Aert and Tom Pidcock but have now branched out into full team sponsorship. Given its prominent association with successful teams in other sporting disciplines such as the dominant Formula 1 team, will Red Bull-Bora-Hansgrohe have the same success? Only time will tell, though it certainly increases the team’s budget. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Kasia Niewiadoma extends with Canyon-SRAM</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Kasia-Niewiadoma-2023-Tour-de-France-Femmes-970x646.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Kasia-Niewiadoma-2023-Tour-de-France-Femmes-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Kasia-Niewiadoma-2023-Tour-de-France-Femmes-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Kasia-Niewiadoma-2023-Tour-de-France-Femmes-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Kasia-Niewiadoma-2023-Tour-de-France-Femmes-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Kasia-Niewiadoma-2023-Tour-de-France-Femmes-2048x1364.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Kasia-Niewiadoma-2023-Tour-de-France-Femmes-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Kasia-Niewiadoma-2023-Tour-de-France-Femmes-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Kasia-Niewiadoma-2023-Tour-de-France-Femmes-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Kasia-Niewiadoma-2023-Tour-de-France-Femmes-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/Kasia-Niewiadoma-2023-Tour-de-France-Femmes-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Charly Lopez</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/kasia-niewiadoma-interview\" target=\"_blank\">Kasia Niewiadoma</a> has signed a two-year contract extension with Canyon-SRAM that takes her through to the end of 2026.

He admitted to Remco Evenepoel (Soudal-QuickStep) after the race that he tried to drop off the group to let someone else take the jersey to avoid the responsibilities that come with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See you next week.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/rating-all-tour-de-france-teams\">Rating all 22 Tour de France teams on paper</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/blue-tour-de-france-jerseys\">All the blue Tour de France jerseys ranked</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-climbs-2024\">The key climbs of the 2024 Giro d’Italia</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/how-to-watch-and-live-stream-the-tour-de-france\">How to watch the Tour de France 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\">Men’s Tour de France 2024: Route, how to watch and all you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pro-cycling-tour-de-france-2024\">Pro Log: Visma-Lease a Bike’s ‘Control Room’ controversy, Red Bull joins the peloton, Kasia Niewiadoma extends with Canyon-SRAM and Tour de France delight</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Robyn Davidson &#124; Editorial Assistant","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"b7d228f615efec6a4e638a16834ab2d8edd8b856b845e1168ceefe2f2b1b6d3a","category":"Cycling"}
