Apple Pay Later is available in the U.S. and requires iOS 16.4 and iPadOS 16.4.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/Apple-Pay-Later-screenshots.jpeg\" alt width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nApple Pay Later will be expanded to all eligible iPhone users over the age of 18 in the U.S. in the \"coming months,\" according to Apple.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAnnounced at WWDC 2022 last June, Apple Pay Later is a \"buy now, pay later\" financing option that lets qualifying customers in the U.S. split a purchase made with Apple Pay into four equal payments over six weeks, with no interest or fees to pay. Users can apply for Apple Pay Later loans of $50 to $1,000 to be used towards online and in-app purchases made with Apple Pay on the iPhone and iPad, according to Apple.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niPhone users can apply for a loan in the Wallet app with no impact to their credit. After entering the amount they would like to borrow and agreeing to the Apple Pay Later terms, a soft credit check will be initiated during the application process. After a user is approved, Apple Pay Later will be available as an option when using Apple Pay. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple Pay Later is built into the Wallet app on the iPhone, allowing users to view, track, and manage loans in one place. Users can view upcoming payments on a calendar and choose to receive upcoming payment notifications via the Wallet app and email. Users must link a debit card as their loan repayment method, with credit cards not accepted.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple Pay Later credit assessment and lending is handled by Apple Financing LLC, a subsidiary of Apple. The service is based on the Mastercard Installments program, so merchants that accept Apple Pay do not need to do anything to implement it.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's corporate and retail employees were <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/07/apple-store-employees-testing-apple-pay-later/\">already able to use Apple Pay Later</a> prior to today's announcement, as part of early testing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has shared a <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213626\">support document</a> with additional details about Pay Later.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-pay/\">Apple Pay</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-music-apple-pay-card-icloud-fitness.134\">Apple Music, Apple Pay/Card, iCloud, Fitness+</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/28/apple-pay-later-early-access/\">Apple Pay Later Available on Limited Basis Starting Today, Launching Widely in Coming Months</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-pay-later-available-on-limited-basis-starting-today-launching-widely-in-coming-months.2385090/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5b3880ee41302c614073dd25c7180fb83b286e64e9459e57f345fb134886a34f","category":"Apple"}
