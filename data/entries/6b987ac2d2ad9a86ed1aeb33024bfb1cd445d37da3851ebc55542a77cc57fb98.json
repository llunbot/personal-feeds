{"title":"Editorial: Mammoth de-extinction is bad conservation","link":"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/editorial-mammoth-de-extinction-is-bad-conservation/","date":1743851137000,"content":"<p>The start-up Colossal Biosciences aims to use gene-editing technology to bring back the woolly mammoth and other extinct species. Recently, the company achieved major milestones: last year, they <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/03/de-extinction-company-manages-to-generate-first-elephant-stem-cells/\">generated stem cells</a> for the Asian elephant, the mammoth’s closest living relative, and this month they published photos of genetically modified mice with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/03/wooly-mice-a-test-run-for-mammoth-gene-editing/\">long, mammoth-like coats</a>. According to the company’s founders, including Harvard and MIT professor George Church, these advances take Colossal a big step closer to their goal of using mammoths to combat climate change by restoring Arctic grassland ecosystems. Church also <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/03/06/1235944741/resurrecting-woolly-mammoth-extinction\">claims</a> that Colossal’s woolly mammoth program will help protect endangered species like the Asian elephant, saying “we’re injecting money into conservation efforts.”</p>\n<p>In other words, the scientific advances Colossal makes in their lab will result in positive changes from the tropics to the Arctic, from the soil to the atmosphere.</p>\n<p>Colossal’s Jurassic Park-like ambitions have captured the imagination of the public and investors, bringing its latest valuation to <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00684-1#:~:text=De%2Dextinction%20company%20Colossal%20mixed,create%20a%20shaggy%2Dhaired%20rodent.&amp;text=A%20company%20that%20has%20raised,the%20creation%20of%20hairier%20mice.\">$10 billion</a>. And the company’s research does seem to be resulting in some technical advances. But I’d argue that the broader effort to de-extinct the mammoth is—as far as conservation efforts go—incredibly misguided. Ultimately, Colossal’s efforts won’t end up being about helping wild elephants or saving the climate. They’ll be about creating creatures for human spectacle, with insufficient attention to the costs and opportunity costs to human and animal life.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/editorial-mammoth-de-extinction-is-bad-conservation/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/editorial-mammoth-de-extinction-is-bad-conservation/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Nitin Sekar","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6b987ac2d2ad9a86ed1aeb33024bfb1cd445d37da3851ebc55542a77cc57fb98","category":"Tech"}
