The ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2 firmware has a build number of 7A305, up from the 7A302 firmware <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/18/apple-airpods-pro-2-firmware-7a302/\">released earlier in September</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/AirPods-Pro-Firmware-Feature.jpg\" width=\"2322\" height=\"1306\" />\r<br />\nThere is no word yet on what's included in the firmware, but Apple is planning to add hearing aid and hearing test features to the ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2 in the not too distant future.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe firmware update could potentially lay the groundwork for those capabilities ahead of when the full feature set comes out in an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a> update. Apple has already received FDA approval for the hearing aid functionality for the ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple doesn't have a way to manually upgrade AirPods software, but firmware is generally installed over-the-air when the AirPods are in a charging case and connected to an iOS device or Mac.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro\">AirPods Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/26/apple-releases-new-airpods-pro-2-firmware-7a305/\">Apple Releases New AirPods Pro 2 Firmware</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-new-airpods-pro-2-firmware.2438264/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a67e3dfbe826bde5e01ff75dd1cdcd89c2fc67e9435cbe2fb9570dcea8fe475f","category":"Apple"}
