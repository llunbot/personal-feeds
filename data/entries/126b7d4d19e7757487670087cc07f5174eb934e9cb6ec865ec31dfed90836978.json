How will it change the way we perceive the world — and its risks — when the pandemic finally subsides? I have a memory from May of this year, taking my 17-year-old son to the Javits Center in Manhattan for his first vaccine, followed by a shopping trip to pick out a tie for his (masked, outdoor) senior prom. At some point waiting in line, I made a halfhearted joke about how we were embarking on the classic father-son ritual of heading out to the mass vaccination site to protect him from the plague. I meant it ironically, but the truth is that for my son’s generation, proms <em>and</em> plagues will be part of the rituals of growing up.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There’s no question in my mind that growing up, right now, is going to lead more kids to focus their careers on science and medicine. The worst thing that happened in early 2020 was a sort of worldwide collective denial. A sort of “OK, fine, there’s a bad virus going around Asia, we’ve heard this story before — it’s not going to be a major issue <em>here</em>” mindset. I certainly thought like that. It’s human nature. The fact that we hadn’t had a major worldwide pandemic in a century led us to believe — not so much through reason, but more through gut feeling — that we <em>couldn’t</em> have one. Not like this.</p>\n\n<p>Today’s youth will never grow up feeling like that. For them, the next pandemic will always loom on the horizon.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/12/02/covid-19-progress\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"126b7d4d19e7757487670087cc07f5174eb934e9cb6ec865ec31dfed90836978","category":"Tech"}
