{"title":"Classic Marathon Is Now on Steam","link":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2398450/Classic_Marathon/","date":1715380342000,"content":"\n<p>Even <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/manual/2398450\">the user manual</a> brings back memories. (“This manual contains sarcastic language that some readers might find condescending.”) From the “Performance Notes” section:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>For Power Mac Users</em> <br />\nIf you need more speed, you better call the Apple Dealer where you\nbought your computer, ’cuz he probably sold you a Centris in a\nPower Mac case. Keep in mind however, that as of System 7.5 the\nsound drivers in the Power Mac are still running under emulation.\nYou will, therefore, see speed gains by decreasing the number of\nsound channels Marathon uses. [...]</p>\n\n<p><em>For 68020 Mac Users (Mac II, LC, LCII)</em> <br />\nUnfortunately you are at the bottom of the food chain here. You\nwill probably want to run in low res at 50% screen size with no\nfloor or ceiling textures, no music, one channel sound, and with\nthe every other scan line option selected. In all honesty though,\nyou’ll probably want to run on a Power Mac. Look on the bright\nside, Apple just lowered their prices again...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I owned an LC at the time, but played all my Marathon at <a href=\"https://www.thetriangle.org/\">the Drexel student newspaper</a> on Power Macs. They really shouldn’t have even claimed it ran at all on 68020 Macs.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/05/10/classic-marathon\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"8b46433b53df3d7168fb540fc465f1575b47c26ad89639c1a2ff61e2895ad873","category":"Tech"}
