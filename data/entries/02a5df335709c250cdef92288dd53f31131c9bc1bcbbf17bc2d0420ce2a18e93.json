[...]</p>\n\n<p>On Wednesday, some of the people who posted about the gift card\nsaid that when they went to redeem the offer, they got an error\nmessage saying the voucher had been canceled. When TechCrunch\nchecked the voucher, the Uber Eats page provided an error message\nthat said the gift card “has been canceled by the issuing party\nand is no longer valid.”</p>\n\n<p>CrowdStrike spokesperson Kevin Benacci confirmed to TechCrunch\nthat the company sent the gift cards. “We did send these to our\nteammates and partners who have been helping customers through\nthis situation. Uber flagged it as fraud because of high usage\nrates,” Benacci said in an email.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’d say the odds are pretty high that CrowdStrike renames itself, like <a href=\"https://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1914815_1914808_1914788,00.html\">ValuJet</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/16/business/philip-morris-to-change-name-to-altria.html\">Philip Morris</a> did. That’ll solve the problem.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/07/26/crowdstrike-uber-eats-10-bucks\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"02a5df335709c250cdef92288dd53f31131c9bc1bcbbf17bc2d0420ce2a18e93","category":"Tech"}
