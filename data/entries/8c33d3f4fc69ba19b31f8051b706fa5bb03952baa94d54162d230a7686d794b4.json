That means <em>Fortnite-</em>maker Epic Games and other developers in Apple's App Store will still be barred from pointing customers to outside purchase points to avoid Apple's commission.</p>\n<p>Justice Elena Kagan, who handles emergency petitions for California and other states, turned down Epic's request, as seen on <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/23a78.html\">the case's Supreme Court page</a> (and initially <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-supreme-court-refuses-epic-bid-let-app-store-order-take-effect-apple-case-2023-08-09/\">reported by Reuters</a>, among others). Epic's application stems from a complex series of rulings related to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/08/epic-gives-fortnite-players-discounts-for-skirting-apple-google-fees/\">Epic's initial 2020 lawsuit</a>. Apple had largely won in decisions from <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/injunction-apple-must-open-up-app-store-payments-in-90-days/\">a district court in 2022</a>, and then <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/apples-ios-walled-garden-doesnt-break-antitrust-laws-appeals-court-affirms/\">the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in April</a>. Those decisions found that Apple's policies that iOS apps only be available through its App Store, and those apps only use its own in-app payment systems, did not violate antitrust rules.</p>\n<p>The 9th Circuit court did, however, affirm a lower-court decision that there was anti-steering language in Apple's developer agreement. Prohibiting developers from pointing to outside purchase methods violated California's Unfair Competition Law, the courts ruled. The 9th Circuit allowed an injunction <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/injunction-apple-must-open-up-app-store-payments-in-90-days/\">prohibiting Apple from enforcing its anti-steering language</a> to remain in place but put a stay on it until a potential Apple appeal to the Supreme Court had run its course.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1959938#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1959938&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8c33d3f4fc69ba19b31f8051b706fa5bb03952baa94d54162d230a7686d794b4","category":"Tech"}
