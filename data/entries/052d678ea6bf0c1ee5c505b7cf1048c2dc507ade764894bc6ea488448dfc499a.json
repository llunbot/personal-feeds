In an email to Ars, Robert Nott, the communications director for the New Mexico Department of Health, said that as of today, the department has not confirmed a connection between the nine cases and any of the confirmed cases in Texas.</p>\n<p>However, all nine of the cases are in Lea County, New Mexico, which sits at the border with Gaines County, Texas, the epicenter of the outbreak. Of Texas' 90 cases, 57 are in Gaines, which has a vaccination rate among kindergartners of just 82 percent this school year. The lack of a clear connection between the Texas and New Mexico cases may be yet more worrying because it suggests undetected community spread and a heightened risk of transmission in Lea, <a href=\"https://www.nmhealth.org/publication/view/general/9115/\">the health department noted in an alert last week</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/02/texas-measles-outbreak-may-have-spread-to-new-mexico-total-cases-near-100/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/02/texas-measles-outbreak-may-have-spread-to-new-mexico-total-cases-near-100/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"052d678ea6bf0c1ee5c505b7cf1048c2dc507ade764894bc6ea488448dfc499a","category":"Tech"}
