Trump are\nmirror images in many ways. Jack Smith’s federal document <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/04/us/politics/trump-indictment-jack-smith-charges.html\">filed\nin Washington</a> was spare almost to the point of being an\ninky line drawing, whereas <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/08/15/us/politics/trump-georgia-indictment-annotated.html\">Fani Willis’ Georgia filing</a> is\nrich and detailed and pointillist. Smith targeted one defendant\nonly, whereas Willis went after 19 defendants on 41 counts. Smith\nmentions a handful of co-conspirators; Willis notes 30 unindicted\nco-conspirators. As <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/15/opinion/trump-indictment-georgia-fani-willis.html?searchResultPosition=1\">Norm Eisen and Amy Lee Copeland</a> point\nout, Smith’s case will likely be blacked out for television and\naudio audiences, whereas Willis’ suit will most likely become\nmust-see TV for weeks on end. Jennifer Rubin argues that the D.C.\ntrial <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/08/15/fani-willis-trump-indictment-georgia/\">will happen quickly</a>, while the Georgia case may face\nmonths of wrangling, flipping, bargaining with conspirators, and\nlengthy pretrial shenanigans. <a href=\"https://clairepotter.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share\">Claire Potter points out</a>\nthat Willis can seize Trump’s assets under Georgia’s RICO law. And\n<a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2023/08/fulton-county-indictment-vs-jack-smith-trump-case.html\">Rick Hasen observes</a> that Fani Willis has centered race and\nracialized vote suppression in a fashion that is far more explicit\nthan the federal analogue.</p>\n\n<p>Jack Smith as a literary character is tight-lipped and spare;\nWillis has been more voluble and open.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/08/16/lithwick-trump-two-indictments\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"4a8ed5d5dc830d65e1ad876cd5a175d4d59e9d6e4d5eefa9d8ba5513a5a5f148","category":"Tech"}
