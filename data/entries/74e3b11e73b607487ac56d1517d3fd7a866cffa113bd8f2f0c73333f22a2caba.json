The word immediately set the Internet ablaze, as it captured the growing malaise regarding how almost everything about the web seemed to be getting worse.</p>\n<p>\"It’s my theory explaining how the Internet was colonized by platforms, why all those platforms are degrading so quickly and thoroughly, why it matters, and what we can do about it,\" Doctorow explained in a <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6fb1602d-a08b-4a8c-bac0-047b7d64aba5\">follow-up article</a>. \"We’re all living through a great enshittening, in which the services that matter to us, that we rely on, are turning into giant piles of shit.
