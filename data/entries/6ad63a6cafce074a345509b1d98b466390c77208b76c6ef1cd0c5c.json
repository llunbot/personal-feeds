Removing the security response may fix this,\" reads Apple's wording.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere are also rollback alerts that can let users know if there's an issue with an RSR release. \"Possible iOS Security Response Issue,\" is the text that users could see in the future.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple has <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/06/apple-releases-ios-16-4-rsr-b/\">released several</a> Rapid Security Response updates, with the first having <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/16/rapid-security-response-ios-16-2-beta/\">come out in November</a>. So far, all of these updates have been limited to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> users running betas, and they seem to have been provided in a test capacity.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple appears to be still working on perfecting the RSR process, and it does not look like any of the releases have included security fixes as of yet, based on Apple's <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/HT201222\">security support document</a>. This document outlines all updates that have vulnerability fixes, and no RSR releases are listed.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNo RSRs have been provided to the general public as of yet, which also suggests that Apple is not yet ready to use the option as a stop-gap between software updates.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAnnounced as part of ‌iOS 16‌, ‌iPadOS 16‌, and ‌macOS Ventura‌, Rapid Security Response updates are meant to allow Apple to provide security fixes to users without a complete iOS update. Rapid Security Responses can be installed quickly, and they can be rolled back if it becomes necessary, as the iOS 16.4 code suggests.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-16/\">iOS 16</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-16/\">iPadOS 16</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-16.238\">iOS 16</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/07/apple-ios-16-4-rsr-improvements/\">Apple Continues Building Out Rapid Security Response Feature in iOS 16.4 Beta</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-continues-building-out-rapid-security-response-feature-in-ios-16-4-beta.2383049/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6ad63a6cafce074a345509b1d98b466390c77208b76c6ef1cd0c5c","category":"Apple"}
