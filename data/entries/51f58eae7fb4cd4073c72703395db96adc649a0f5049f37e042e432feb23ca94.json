So after your browsing sessions, you only need to visit the app and follow these steps to quicky delete it:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Tap your account icon in the top right corner.</li><li>In the list of options, tap <em>Delete last 15 mins</em>.</li><li>If you change your mind, you’ll be able to tap <em>Undo</em> in the box that appears.</li></ul><div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-delete-search-history.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" /></figure><p>IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Changes won’t be immediate and could take a few minutes to show depending on the browser you’re using and how fast everything syncs. This will only delete your searches, however, and won’t scrub sites that you visited. For that, you’ll need to go into your browser’s search history and delete individual results. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also opt to automatically delete all of your web activity after three months, 18 months, or 36 months. To do that, tap the Search history button in your account, then <em>Auto-delete</em>, and finally, choose options your want in the <em>Auto-delete activity older than </em>drop-down menu.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as always, you should use Incognito or Private mode if you want to keep all of your browsing history hidden.</p>\n</div>","author":"Michael Simon","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"51f58eae7fb4cd4073c72703395db96adc649a0f5049f37e042e432feb23ca94","category":"Apple"}
