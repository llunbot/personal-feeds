It can transfer contacts, calendar events, photos, and videos, and it includes reminders to turn off iMessage to swap to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/\">RCS</a>/SMS.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGoogle has also changed some of the wording on its Switch to Android website to reflect the new app name. The Switch to Android site walks through some of the common concerns that ‌iPhone‌ users might have about switching platforms, such as texting, sharing files, making video calls, and transitioning accessories.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith ‌RCS‌, Google says Android users can text ‌iPhone‌ users with no issues, and the company recommends Google Meet as an alternative to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a>. There's no Android to ‌iPhone‌ replacement for AirDrop, but Google says that Quick Share can be used to share files with Android, ChromeOS, and Windows PC devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAside from design updates and a new look for the app, the basic functionality of the Android Switch app appears to be the same as before.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/android/\">Android</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/\">Google</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/19/google-rebrands-android-switcher-app/\">Google Rebrands Switcher App to Lure iPhone Users to Android</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-rebrands-switcher-app-to-lure-iphone-users-to-android.2443484/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"bb74736f66f12c8e1ced09f59115e67f335996cd840e4f82162a545fd1de3fc5","category":"Apple"}
