{"title":"OpenAI and Sam Altman Ripped Off Scarlett Johansson’s Voice, Supposedly Using an Unnamed Soundalike Voice Actress","link":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/20/24161253/scarlett-johansson-openai-altman-legal-action","date":1716249339000,"content":"\n<p>Scarlett Johannson, in a statement released to several media outlets:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Last September, I received an offer from Sam Altman, who wanted to\nhire me to voice the current ChatGPT 4.0 system. He told me that\nhe felt that by my voicing the system, I could bridge the gap\nbetween tech companies and creatives and help consumers to feel\ncomfortable with the seismic shift concerning humans and AI. He\nsaid he felt that my voice would be comforting to people.</p>\n\n<p>After much consideration and for personal reasons, I declined the\noffer. Nine months later, my friends, family and the general\npublic all noted how much the newest system named “Sky” sounded\nlike me.</p>\n\n<p>When I heard the released demo, I was shocked, angered and in\ndisbelief that Mr. Altman would pursue a voice that sounded so\neerily similar to mine that my closest friends and news outlets\ncould not tell the difference. Mr. Altman even insinuated that the\nsimilarity was intentional, tweeting a single word “her” - a\nreference to the film in which I voiced a chat system, Samantha,\nwho forms an intimate relationship with a human.</p>\n\n<p>Two days before the ChatGPT 4.0 demo was released, Mr. Altman\ncontacted my agent, asking me to reconsider. Before we could\nconnect, the system was out there.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At 11:30pm PT last night, <a href=\"https://x.com/OpenAI/status/1792443575839678909\">OpenAI tweeted</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We’ve heard questions about how we chose the voices in ChatGPT,\nespecially Sky. We are working to pause the use of Sky while we\naddress them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They’ve “heard questions”.</p>\n\n<p>This plays into every bad stereotype about Silicon Valley “tech bros”. I mean, if they had never contacted Johansson and simply hired an actress who sounds like her, to some degree, that’d be one thing. But to negotiate with her to provide her voice officially, and go ahead with a soundalike after she turned down the offer? Some choice: work with them or get ripped off. How in the world did Sam Altman expect to get away with this? One can only presume Altman expected Johannson to roll over, but why would he expect that? She’s the highest-grossing actress in the history of Hollywood, and Hollywood talent isn’t known for rolling over.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/05/20/openai-johansson-voice-ripoff\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"116b69ab664386ecc139d70e0b59514f3c8a5e7e02bc864976e94091b1be77be","category":"Tech"}
