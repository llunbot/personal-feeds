The way he is racing at the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/vuelta-a-espana\">Vuelta a Espana</a>, it feels like he was never away.</p>\n<p>On Stage 8 in La Manga del Mar Menor, he was the fastest sprinter. It wasn't even close. Leaving <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/deceuninck-quickstep\">Deceuninck-QuickStep</a> teammate Florian Sénéchal's wheel in the final 200m, it was immediately clear nobody had the speed to round him. Raising his arms in the air over the line, Team DSM's Alberto Dainese and Alpecin-Fenix's Jasper Philipsen rolled through second best. It was textbook. </p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/news/2104/vuelta-a-espana-route-race-reports-tv-guide-and-all-you-need-to-know\">Vuelta a Espana 2021: Route, start list, live TV guide and all we know so far</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/10010/gallery-jakobsen-doubles-up-at-the-vuelta-a-espana\">Gallery: Jakobsen doubles up at the Vuelta a Espana</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/news/913/tour-of-britain-route-riders-live-tv-guide-all-you-need-to-know\">Tour of Britain 2021: Route, teams and all you need to know</a></div>    </div></div><p>\n'The team did a perfect job,' Jakobsen said at the finish.</p>\n<p>'They kept the speed high and even though I lost them a little bit I was still in a good position. I launched my sprint just in the corner at 200 to go and I was the fastest, I think. It was about being strong, fast, and it's about timing, I think. In a finish like this you need to be on time. I've been twice too late and this time I was perfectly right, and I could do a full sprint to the line.</p>\n<p>'It means that – two years ago I won twice. I'm just extremely happy and grateful to be here. I'd like to thank the team again. [Team boss] Patrick Lefevere is here today and I'm sure he's happy. This is what we'll keep on doing – try to win sprints.'</p>\n<p>To be disecting race wins with such clarity is testament to Jakobsen and how, despite being so young, he has been able to return to the top of the sport in such a short space of time. It's remarkable, really. </p>\n<p>Below, Chris Auld's images from the finish:</p>\n<p></p><div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/10009/vuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-8-gallery#2\"><p><span>Image 3 of</span> 20</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/08/cauldphoto-vuelta-stage8-3.jpg?itok=zFsHi3Zv\" /></a></div>\n<p><span>Image 3 of </span>20</p>\n</div> <p></p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div>\n<div>\n\n          &lt;&gt;<span><a href=\"/in-depth/10009/vuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-8-gallery\">Vuelta a Espana 2021 Stage 8 gallery</a></span>&lt;/&gt;\n      \n  \n  <div>\n\n    \n    \n    <div><span>\n      <span><a href=\"/in-depth\">In-depth</a></span>\n  </span><div>  \n  <div>      <div><span>22 Aug 2021</span></div>    </div></div><div>\n        <div><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F10009%2Fvuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-8-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>facebook</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/home?status=Vuelta%20a%20Espana%202021%20Stage%208%20gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F10009%2Fvuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-8-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>twitter</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=Vuelta%20a%20Espana%202021%20Stage%208%20gallery%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F10009%2Fvuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-8-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n      \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>google+</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n<li><a href=\"mailto:?subject=Vuelta%20a%20Espana%202021%20Stage%208%20gallery&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Fin-depth%2F10009%2Fvuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-8-gallery\">\r\n  <span>\r\n      \r\n          \r\n        \r\n  </span>\r\n  <span>email</span>\r\n</a>\r\n</li>\n</ul></div>  </div>\n</div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><div>\n  <a href=\"/in-depth/10009/vuelta-a-espana-2021-stage-8-gallery#0\"><p><span>Image 1 of</span> 20</p><img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/gallery_adv/public/2021/08/cauldphoto-vuelta-stage8-1.jpg?itok=eL8G1wjB\" /></a></div>\n</div>    </div></div>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>    </div></div><div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"jrobinson","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"6ba09da0e43692b4a49ea585bdff5cca9cf7188b482dcc553211f27563931b9b","category":"Cycling"}
