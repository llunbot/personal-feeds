The vent usually supports animal life that survives using chemical energy from the vent fluid, but those creatures were almost entirely wiped out.

After a month or so of activity, an underwater eruption of unprecedented scale from the Hunga volcano blasted ash up through the water column and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/09/hunga-tonga-eruption-put-over-50b-kilograms-of-water-into-the-stratosphere/\"><span>more than 30 miles into the air</span></a>, where it quickly spread out in a billowing plume spanning hundreds of miles.</p>\n<p>The blast was so powerful that it rang Earth like a bell; it produced a shockwave that circled the globe multiple times and released a sonic boom heard as far away as Alaska. The eruption also triggered a tsunami that affected coastlines across the Pacific Ocean and made waves recorded in Japan, North and South America, and Antarctica.</p>\n<p>Quite by surprise, scientists discovered that the eruption also had an underwater aftermath, recently described in a paper published in the journal <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s43247-024-01411-w\"><i><span>Nature Communications Earth and Environment</span></i></a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046659#p3\">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046659&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ed592eabd32d9ae1422552ad7366b1585bd0e380702d4bc2098bba1fcb925d9b","category":"Tech"}
