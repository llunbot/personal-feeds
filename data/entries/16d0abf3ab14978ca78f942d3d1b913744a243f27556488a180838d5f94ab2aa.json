{"title":"In the Works – AWS Region in Taiwan","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/in-the-works-aws-region-in-taiwan/","date":1718161969000,"content":"<p>Today, we’re announcing that a new AWS Region will be coming to Taiwan by early 2025. The new AWS Asia Pacific (Taipei) Region will consist of three Availability Zones at launch, and will give AWS customers in Taiwan the ability to run workloads and store data that must remain in Taiwan.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/06/07/2024-aws-asia-pachfic-taiwan-region.jpg\" width=\"1200\" height=\"583\" /></p> \n<p>Each of the Availability Zones will be physically independent of the others in the Region – close enough to support applications that need low latency, yet sufficiently distant to significantly reduce the risk that an event at an Availability Zone level might impact business continuity.</p> \n<p>The Availability Zones in this Region will be connected together through high-bandwidth, low-latency network connections over dedicated, fully redundant fiber. This connectivity supports applications that need synchronous replication between Availability Zones for availability or redundancy. You can take a peek at the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/\">AWS Global Infrastructure</a> page to learn more about how we design and build Regions and Availability Zones.</p> \n<p>We are currently working on Regions in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/in-the-works-aws-region-in-malaysia/\">Malaysia</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-aws-region-in-mexico-is-in-the-works/\">Mexico</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/in-the-works-aws-region-in-new-zealand/\">New Zealand</a>, the <a href=\"https://press.aboutamazon.com/2024/3/aws-to-launch-an-infrastructure-region-in-the-kingdom-of-saudi-arabia\">Kingdom of Saudi Arabia</a>, <a href=\"https://press.aboutamazon.com/2022/10/aws-to-launch-an-infrastructure-region-in-thailand\">Thailand</a>, and the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/in-the-works-aws-european-sovereign-cloud/\">AWS European Sovereign Cloud</a>. The AWS Cloud operates 105 Availability Zones within 33 AWS Regions around the world, with announced plans for 21 more Availability Zones and seven more Regions, including Taiwan.</p> \n<p><strong><u>AWS in Taiwan</u></strong><br /> AWS has been investing and supporting customers and partners in Taiwan for more than 10 years. To support our customers in Taiwan, we have business development teams, solutions architects, partner managers, professional services consultants, support staff, and various other roles working in our <a href=\"https://www.amazon.jobs/en/locations/taiwan\">Taipei office</a>.</p> \n<p>Other AWS infrastructure includes two <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/04/amazon-cloudFront-launches-a-third-edge-location-in-singapore-and-second-edge-location-in-taipei/\">Amazon CloudFront edge locations</a> along with access to the AWS global backbone through multiple redundant submarine cables. You can access any other AWS Region (except Beijing and Ningxia) from <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2018/02/new-aws-direct-connect-sites-land-in-paris-and-taipei/\">AWS Direct Connect locations</a> in Taipei, operated by Chief Telecom and Chunghwa Telecom. With AWS Direct Connect, your data that would have previously been transported over the internet is delivered through a private network connection between your facilities and AWS.</p> \n<p>You can also use <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/06/announcing-availability-of-aws-outposts-in-nine-additional-countries-in-africa-asia-pacific-latin-america-and-middle-east/\">AWS Outposts</a> in Taiwan, a family of fully managed solutions delivering AWS infrastructure and services to virtually any on-premises or edge location for a truly consistent hybrid experience. With <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-local-zones-expansion-taipei-and-delhi/\">AWS Local Zones</a> in Taipei, you can deliver applications that require single-digit millisecond latency to end users.</p> \n<p>AWS continues to invest in upskilling students, local developers and technical professionals, nontechnical professionals, and the next generation of IT leaders in Taiwan through offerings like <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/training/awsacademy/\">AWS Academy</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/\">AWS Educate</a>, and <a href=\"https://skillbuilder.aws/\">AWS Skill Builder</a>. Since 2017, AWS has trained more than eight million people across the Asia Pacific-Japan region on cloud skills, including more than 100,000 people in Taiwan.</p> \n<p>To learn more, join <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/tw/events/taiwan/2024-aws-summit-taipei/\">AWS Summit 2024 Taiwan</a> in July; in-person events that bring the cloud computing community together to connect, collaborate, and learn about AWS.</p> \n<p><strong><u>AWS customers in Taiwan</u></strong><br /> AWS customers in Taiwan have been increasingly moving their applications to AWS and running their technology infrastructure in other AWS Regions around the world. With the addition of this new AWS Region, customers will be able to provide even lower latency to end users and use advanced technologies such as generative artificial intelligence (generative AI), Internet of Things (IoT), mobile services, and more, to drive innovation. This Region will give AWS customers the ability to run their workloads and store their content in Taiwan.</p> \n<p>Here are some examples of customers using AWS to drive innovation:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/case-study-cht/\"><strong>Chunghwa Telecom</strong></a> is the largest integrated telecom provider in Taiwan. To improve AI data security and governance, they use <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\">Amazon Bedrock</a> for a variety of generative AI applications, including automatically generating specifications documents for the software development lifecycle and crafting custom marketing campaigns. With Amazon Bedrock, Chunghwa Telecom is saving developer hours and has also developed an immersive, interactive virtual English teacher for the first time.</p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/gamania-training-certification-case-study/\">Gamania Group</a></strong> is a leader in the development and publication of online games in Taiwan. To maximize the value of running on AWS, they worked with <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/training/\">AWS Training and Certification</a> to enhance AWS skills across all of its departments, such as <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/training/classroom/\">AWS Classroom</a> training, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/\">AWS Well-Architected</a> Framework, and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/gameday/\">AWS GameDay</a> events. As a result, they reduced the time needed to make critical operational decisions by 50 percent, lowered its time-to-market by up to 70 percent, and accelerated the launch of new games.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=a2f7b41f-16f3-4e15-859f-49138616be8d\"><strong>KKCompany Technologies</strong></a> is a multimedia technology group building a music streaming platform, AI-powered streaming solution, and cloud intelligence service in Taiwan.
