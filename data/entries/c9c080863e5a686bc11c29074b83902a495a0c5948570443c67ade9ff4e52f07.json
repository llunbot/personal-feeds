Trying not to be distracted by AI robots, body scanners, and a spoon that supposedly makes your food taste better, we walked the miles of halls to find the best new Mac- and iPhone-friendly accessory products announced at this year’s CES.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Anker 140W Charger</h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Anker-140W-four-port-charger-CES.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Anker 140W-four port charger CES\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Anker-140W-four-port-charger-CES.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Anker-140W-four-port-charger-CES.jpg?resize=300%2C255&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Anker-140W-four-port-charger-CES.jpg?resize=768%2C653&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Anker-140W-four-port-charger-CES.jpg?resize=1200%2C1020&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Anker-140W-four-port-charger-CES.jpg?resize=1536%2C1306&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1020\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone who buys an iPhone needs to bring their own USB-C wall charger, and while they’ve gotten smaller and more powerful over the years, they still look pretty ugly and ungainly plugged into your wall. Anker’s new compact and powerful four-port 140W USB-C Charger helps restore some of your home or office aesthetics by placing all four of its ports on the underside so that the cables hang down vertically. This should also make the cables and the charger itself less prone to falling out of the power socket if pulled or knocked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a maximum 140W output, it can fast-charge PD 3.1 laptops such as the 16-inch MacBook Pro. There are three USB-C ports and one legacy USB-A for older cables. It also offers a color smart display that showcases real-time power output and remaining power for each port. It costs <a href=\"https://www.anker.com/products/a2697-anker-charger-140w-4-port?variant=44320558088342\">$90</a>/<a href=\"https://www.anker.com/uk/products/a2697-anker-charger-140w-4-port?variant=55120801661302\">£90</a> and is available now in either silver or gray.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Ugreen Nexode 500W 6-Port GaN Desktop Charger</h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ugreen-500W-Charger-CES.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Ugreen 500W Charger CES\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ugreen-500W-Charger-CES.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ugreen-500W-Charger-CES.jpg?resize=300%2C171&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ugreen-500W-Charger-CES.jpg?resize=768%2C437&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ugreen-500W-Charger-CES.jpg?resize=1200%2C683&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Ugreen-500W-Charger-CES.jpg?resize=1536%2C875&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"683\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Simon Jary / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>USB-C wall chargers are small and powerful but when you need a lot of power you require a desktop charger with a proper power supply. In the past we have reviewed a desktop charger with a maximum power output of 300W, but Ugreen has now trumped that and some with its announcement of the world’s first 500W GaN charger at CES.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The top USB-C port can output at a mighty 240W (PD 3.1), again a first in the hands of Macworld reviewers. It can charge up to six devices simultaneously, and Ugreen claims that this charger is powerful enough even for power-hungry devices such as e-bikes. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Plugable UD-7400PD Docking Station</h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Plugable-UD-7400PD-at-CES-2025.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Plugable UD-7400PD dock at CES 2025\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Plugable-UD-7400PD-at-CES-2025.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Plugable-UD-7400PD-at-CES-2025.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Plugable-UD-7400PD-at-CES-2025.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Plugable-UD-7400PD-at-CES-2025.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Plugable</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>It might seem greedy to connect five external displays to your MacBook, but some Mac users might actually need it. For those people, it’s now possible—Plugable has released the world’s first five-screen DisplayLink docking station for your MacBook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, you don’t have to connect five displays, the dock is suitable for two or three extra independent screens as well, with a mix of ports that gives flexible solutions for video, data, and power. The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2570777/this-docking-station-lets-you-connect-five-screens-to-your-macbook.html\" target=\"_blank\">Plugable UD-7400PD</a> has two HDMI ports and three 10Gbps USB-C ports that can handle video connections, as well as another 30W USB-C port, two 10Gbps USB-A ports, 2.5Gb Ethernet, and an audio socket.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As it uses DisplayLink software even the usually display-shy plain (non-Pro/Max) M1 and M2 MacBooks can take over your working space with quintuple monitors.

But to make full use of Thunderbolt 5’s bidirectional data-transfer speeds of up to 80Gbps and 120Gbps display bandwidth, you need some devices that support it, and Ugreen showed off its forthcoming Thunderbolt 5 docking station at CES.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Revodok Max 2131 Thunderbolt 5 Docking Station supports single-screen 8K resolution at 60Hz or dual-screen 4K at 144Hz. It features 13 ports including three Thunderbolt 5 ports: one upstream to the computer and two downstream for extra devices.

Apple rectified its front-port oversight when it released its latest M4 Mac mini with front-facing USB-C ports, but Satechi has created a new matching hub that adds back three legacy USB-A ports (two at 10Gbps and one 480Mbps) and an SD Card reader.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This time Satechi has fixed a different problem—the M4 hub features a cutout that enables easy access to the mini’s power switch. It also raises the mini slightly with bottom heat-dissipating vents and a recessed top area for optimal cooling. The new <a href=\"https://satechi.net/landing/ces-2025-announcements\">Satechi M4 Stand &amp; Hub</a> also includes an SSD enclosure supporting up to 4TB of NVMe storage, so you can add fast storage without having an external drive hogging one of the Mac’s ports. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Satechi Mac Mini M4 Stand &amp; Hub with SSD Enclosure will be available for $100 in February.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>ESR HaloLock MagMouse Wireless Mouse</h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ESR-HaloLock-MagMouse-Wireless-Mouse-CES.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"ESR HaloLock MagMouse Wireless Mouse CES\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ESR-HaloLock-MagMouse-Wireless-Mouse-CES.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ESR-HaloLock-MagMouse-Wireless-Mouse-CES.jpg?resize=300%2C204&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ESR-HaloLock-MagMouse-Wireless-Mouse-CES.jpg?resize=768%2C523&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ESR-HaloLock-MagMouse-Wireless-Mouse-CES.jpg?resize=1200%2C818&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ESR-HaloLock-MagMouse-Wireless-Mouse-CES.jpg?resize=1536%2C1047&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"818\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Simon Jary / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>We have to admit, we weren’t expecting to see a mouse that can magnetically clamp to the top of your laptop at CES.

This new 20000mAh power bank from Belkin can recharge your MacBook and/or your phone and other USB-C or Thunderbolt devices without needing to bring along a separate cable, as it comes with its own built in cable that tidily tucks away when not in use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are additional USB-C and USB-A ports that allow for charging up to three devices simultaneously. The BoostCharge Power Bank 20K can charge at 30W, which is perfect for the newest iPhones. It’s a little slow—although still usable—for a MacBook Pro but fine for a MacBook Air.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will be available in April in a range of colors—black, white, blue, and pink—and has its casing made with 90 percent recycled plastics.
