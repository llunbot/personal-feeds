Instead of the higher fidelity options previously enjoyed for no additional fee, Prime Video is streaming in HDR10 with Dolby Digital 5.1. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThat is, unless you pay $2.99 extra for Prime Video's ad-free service, in which case you can retain the higher quality audio experience. The change was confirmed to <em>The Verge</em> by Amazon. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos capabilities are only available on the ad free option, on relevant titles,\" said an Amazon spokesperson.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMost Prime Video viewers will be Amazon Prime members, which costs $14.99 per month, or $139 per year if you pay annually. Prime Video is also available as a $9.99-per-month standalone subscription, or $12.99-per-month if you add on the Dolby Vision HDR or Dolby Atmos surround sound surcharge. Ads were introduced across basic Prime Video subscriptions in the United States on January 29.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor comparison, Disney+ costs $9.99 with ads, while Netflix can be had for $6.99 per month with ads, although content is streamed in 1080p. Meanwhile, an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/\">Apple TV+</a> membership costs $9.99, up from the previous $6.99. Apple introduced the increase on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-services-price-increases/\">October 25</a>, but there are no limits on streaming quality.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/amazon-prime-video/\">Amazon Prime Video</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/amazon-prime/\">Amazon Prime</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/13/amazon-prime-video-dolby-vision-atmos/\">Amazon Prime Video's Ads Tier Loses Dolby Vision HDR and Dolby Atmos</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/amazon-prime-videos-ads-tier-loses-dolby-vision-hdr-and-dolby-atmos.2419316/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"bf06508357544a5711b6c372ab19af1fda3f5c058e85a630803bed82772ce935","category":"Apple"}
