Having a dropper post lever with plenty of adjustability will help you get it there – something like the new Wolf Tooth ReMote Pro. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTC-new-remote-Pro-dropper-post-lever-1.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTC-new-remote-Pro-dropper-post-lever-1-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Wolf Tooth Components Remote Pro Dropper post lever\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTC-new-remote-Pro-dropper-post-lever-1-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTC-new-remote-Pro-dropper-post-lever-1-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTC-new-remote-Pro-dropper-post-lever-1-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTC-new-remote-Pro-dropper-post-lever-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTC-new-remote-Pro-dropper-post-lever-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTC-new-remote-Pro-dropper-post-lever-1-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTC-new-remote-Pro-dropper-post-lever-1.jpg 2000w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Wolf Tooth Components already offered one of our favorite dropper post levers on the market, but now they’ve kicked it up a notch (or two). One of the most notable changes comes from the adjustable lever starting position that is <em>independent </em>of cable tension. According to Wolf Tooth, this is an industry first. There are other levers that allow for some adjustment of the starting position of the lever, but not without making changes to the cable and cable clamp. The ReMote Pro offers 48º of lever starting point rotation, without having to adjust anything else.  </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Wolf-Tooth_ReMote-Pro_JAN-2023_2-Large.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Wolf-Tooth_ReMote-Pro_JAN-2023_2-Large-800x534.jpeg\" alt=\"Wolf Tooth Components Remote Pro Dropper post lever\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Wolf-Tooth_ReMote-Pro_JAN-2023_2-Large-800x534.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Wolf-Tooth_ReMote-Pro_JAN-2023_2-Large-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Wolf-Tooth_ReMote-Pro_JAN-2023_2-Large-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Wolf-Tooth_ReMote-Pro_JAN-2023_2-Large-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Wolf-Tooth_ReMote-Pro_JAN-2023_2-Large-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Wolf-Tooth_ReMote-Pro_JAN-2023_2-Large.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Combine that with 12mm of horizontal adjustment, plus the vertical adjustment of the eight different clamp options and you have a lever that should be ideally suited to your needs. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTC-new-remote-Pro-dropper-post-lever-2.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTC-new-remote-Pro-dropper-post-lever-2-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Wolf Tooth Components Remote Pro Dropper post lever compared to original\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTC-new-remote-Pro-dropper-post-lever-2-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTC-new-remote-Pro-dropper-post-lever-2-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTC-new-remote-Pro-dropper-post-lever-2-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTC-new-remote-Pro-dropper-post-lever-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTC-new-remote-Pro-dropper-post-lever-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTC-new-remote-Pro-dropper-post-lever-2-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTC-new-remote-Pro-dropper-post-lever-2.jpg 2000w\" /></a><figcaption>ReMote LA (Left) vs. ReMote Pro (right). <br />Wooden backdrop photos c.

Unlike those original levers though, the Pro gets a variable leverage (oval) cam. This provides more leverage at the start of the lever throw to make it easier to actuate. The leverage then drops to a level between the ReMote and ReMote Light Action toward the middle of the stroke. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It should also be mentioned that the new design makes it much easier to change the bar clamp, or to install the round bar. That’s due to the fact that the original levers used one bolt through the bearing which then threads into the bar clamp. The new Pro model holds the bearing assembly together with a chainring bolt, so the bar clamp attaches to one of three separate threaded holes. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTC-new-remote-Pro-dropper-post-lever-3.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTC-new-remote-Pro-dropper-post-lever-3-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Wolf Tooth Components Remote Pro Dropper post lever compared to original\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTC-new-remote-Pro-dropper-post-lever-3-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTC-new-remote-Pro-dropper-post-lever-3-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTC-new-remote-Pro-dropper-post-lever-3-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTC-new-remote-Pro-dropper-post-lever-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTC-new-remote-Pro-dropper-post-lever-3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTC-new-remote-Pro-dropper-post-lever-3-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/WTC-new-remote-Pro-dropper-post-lever-3.jpg 2000w\" /></a><figcaption>ReMote LA lever (top) with ReMote Pro lever underneath</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new ReMote Pro lever is more rounded at the edges and is still machined from aluminum at Wolf Tooth HQ in Minnesota. An all-metal construction includes a machined lever, cable pulley, base, and clamp; three stainless steel bolts; and a chainring bolt to hold it all together (which we assume will allow some color options down the road). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While that durable metal construction means it’s unlikely you’ll need to replace any parts, the lever is part of the Wolf Tooth Right To Repair which means each individual part can be purchased separately if you do manage to mangle it. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Wolf-Tooth_ReMote-Pro_JAN-2023_2-Large.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Wolf-Tooth_ReMote-Pro_JAN-2023_2-Large-800x534.jpeg\" alt=\"Wolf Tooth Components Remote Pro Dropper post lever\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Wolf-Tooth_ReMote-Pro_JAN-2023_2-Large-800x534.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Wolf-Tooth_ReMote-Pro_JAN-2023_2-Large-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Wolf-Tooth_ReMote-Pro_JAN-2023_2-Large-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Wolf-Tooth_ReMote-Pro_JAN-2023_2-Large-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Wolf-Tooth_ReMote-Pro_JAN-2023_2-Large-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Wolf-Tooth_ReMote-Pro_JAN-2023_2-Large.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The ReMote Pro weighs in at 39g without the clamp, and will sell for $69.95 with bar clamp options to fit Shimano, SRAM, Magura, Hope Tech, and Hayes brakes plus round bars. ReMote Pros are avaialable now through WTC direct, or stocking dealers, and the ReMote and ReMote Light Action prices have been reduced to $54.95 and will continue to be offered. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.wolftoothcomponents.com/products/remote-pro\" target=\"_blank\">wolftoothcomponents.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wolf-tooth-remote-pro-most-adjustable-dropper-post-lever/\">New Wolf Tooth ReMote Pro Has Ground-Breaking Adjustability at the Lever</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"a353e013a38331af6cccd4dbeed3598f55cc29fdc3398e59c55b71e8268fcb56","category":"Cycling"}
