His stunt sequences and fight choreography have influenced everything from <em>The Matrix</em> and <em>Kill Bill</em> to the John Wick franchise and <em>Kung Fu Panda</em> (in which he voiced Master Monkey).</p>\n<p>Born on April 7, 1954, Chan studied acrobatics, martial arts, and acting as a child at the Peking Opera School's China Drama Academy and became one of the Seven Little Fortunes. Those skills served him well in his early days as a Hong Kong stuntman, which eventually landed him a gig as an extra and stunt double on Bruce Lee's 1972 film, <em>Fist of Fury</em>. He also appeared in a minor role in Lee's <em>Enter the Dragon</em> (1973).</p>\n<p>Initially, Hong Kong producers, impressed by Chan's skills, wanted to mold him into the next Lee, but that just wasn't Chan's style. Chan found his milieu when director Yuen Woo-ping cast him in 1978's kung fu comedy <em>Snake in the Eagle's Shadow</em> and gave Chan creative freedom over the stunt work. It was <em>Drunken Master</em>, released that same year, that established Chan as a rising talent, and he went on to appear in more than 150 movies, becoming one of Hong Kong's biggest stars.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/04/our-top-10-jackie-chan-movies/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/04/our-top-10-jackie-chan-movies/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"9fecc7325f610fddbb0a518db7e941f085d70c53c741e9d8068a9a5ee090f9e4","category":"Tech"}
