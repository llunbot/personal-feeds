But even as Netflix, Amazon, Disney+, HBO Max, and others have rolled out HDR support for some content, Hulu hasn't. That finally changed, with a <a href=\"https://help.hulu.com/s/article/video-quality#HDR\">support page</a> on Hulu's website announcing HDR support for select shows and devices.</p>\n<p>These are the devices on which Hulu says it now offers HDR streaming:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul><li>Roku (HDR compatible models)</li>\n<li>Fire TV, Fire TV Stick, Fire TV Cube devices (HDR compatible models with Fire OS 7 or later)</li>\n<li>Apple TV 4K (Gen 5 or later)</li>\n<li>Vizio (HDR compatible models)</li>\n<li>Chromecast Ultra (HDR-compatible models)</li>\n</ul></blockquote>\n<p>Hulu says that the supported formats include HDR-10, HDR-10+, and Dolby Vision. Content that supports HDR will carry a special badge so viewers know what they're getting.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1789417#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1789417&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e43249d02a41f7bd3f00c831be9e9b2351e82d78bbe2845283a0f34322241a44","category":"Tech"}
