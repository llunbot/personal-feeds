Again, and again, and again?</p>\n<p>That's what happened to people who relied on YouTube TV to watch last night's game. The worst part is, the game <em>never came back online. </em><a href=\"https://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2023/05/18/heat-celtics-youtube-tv-fail-ripped-by-nba-fans\">Sports Illustrated</a> reported that \"many fans saw the same ad starting and stopping for what felt like an endless amount of time.\"<br />\n</p><div><blockquote><p>this was my YouTube TV screen for the last 5 minutes of the NBA game <a href=\"https://t.co/nfX75pLrjA\">pic.twitter.com/nfX75pLrjA</a></p>— alex (@highIightheaven) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/highIightheaven/status/1659032181702815745?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 18, 2023</a></blockquote></div>\n<p>YouTube's <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube\">support Twitter page</a> tweeted about the issue as it was happening, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1659026855494578176\">telling</a> users that \"if you have an issue watching the Miami Heat vs. Boston Celtics game on TNT, we’re aware of it &amp; our team is working on a fix - thx so much for your patience!\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1940138#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1940138&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"19a7751804074872a0cdd72fff9b79e66a27ad975547e012a2e9a8802403c7ac","category":"Tech"}
