Qualcomm shares surged on the news.</p>\n\n<p>The new pact will cover “smartphone launches in 2024, 2025 and 2026,” Qualcomm said in a statement Monday. The companies’ agreement had been set to end this year, and the latest iPhone — due on Tuesday — was expected to be one of the last to rely on the Qualcomm modem chip. […]</p>\n\n<p>“This agreement reinforces Qualcomm’s track record of sustained leadership across 5G technologies and products,” the San Diego-based chipmaker said. Though the financial terms of the new deal weren’t disclosed, Qualcomm said it was similar to the previous arrangement signed in 2019.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Funny how they announced this today, and even funnier that there’s no quote from anyone at Apple. Qualcomm, seemingly, has Apple over the barrel on these 5G modems. </p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/11/qualcomm-apple-5g\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"7317ae0c9a9144902e88ac6dc65ebd6e93b58556a68e2ed71541816a9e0c9797","category":"Tech"}
