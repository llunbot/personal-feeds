Some of the biggest names in pro cycling were rolling on ENVE’s U.S.-made carbon wheels, and it appears that was just the start. Now, ENVE has announced that their <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/enve-melee-road-bike-chassis/\">Melee road bike</a> is headed to the pro peloton in a partnership with Team TotalEnergies. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Already riding ENVE wheels, Team TotalEnergies was apparently intrigued by the potential of the complete ENVE package. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TOTAL-ENERGIES-MELEE-SHIMANO-BLACK.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TOTAL-ENERGIES-MELEE-SHIMANO-BLACK-800x450.jpg\" alt=\"Team TotalEnergies ENVE Melee road bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TOTAL-ENERGIES-MELEE-SHIMANO-BLACK-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TOTAL-ENERGIES-MELEE-SHIMANO-BLACK-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TOTAL-ENERGIES-MELEE-SHIMANO-BLACK-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TOTAL-ENERGIES-MELEE-SHIMANO-BLACK-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TOTAL-ENERGIES-MELEE-SHIMANO-BLACK-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TOTAL-ENERGIES-MELEE-SHIMANO-BLACK-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TOTAL-ENERGIES-MELEE-SHIMANO-BLACK-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Expanding the Partnership</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>“We already knew their wheels, defined as the best in the world, and it made us very curious. October was full in discussions with their engineers at the Team headquarters. Our technicians and riders were impressed by the responsiveness of ENVE. The tests conducted by our riders were more than positive and everyone, unanimously, recognized the very high technology of the bikes,” states Team TotalEnergies Manager Jean-René Bernaudeau.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bernaudeau continues, “I am delighted to associate our team with this innovative brand. We have many things to learn from our structures and have the same motivation to get great results through important R&amp;D work. Between our two companies, this collaboration will contribute to future victories. It is a beautiful and ambitious collaboration which is starting. ENVE lives in modernity and innovation like us. I’m sure that we will write a beautiful story. Our performance division and their Research and Development sector will work together over the next two seasons. I cannot wait to start the season.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Riding ENVE to New Heights</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>General Manager of ENVE Mike Stimola said, “Having the opportunity to partner with TotalEnergies, a team with so much history in the sport, is an honor for us. We’ve earned a reputation as the leader in wheel and component technology, and to now add ENVE bicycles to the professional peloton with TotalEnergies is an important step as a performance brand. We are always proud to see our products used at the highest level of the sport, in the biggest races, and this collaboration will allow us to introduce ENVE the bicycles brand to a far-reaching audience.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Melee_Details_grey_030-1-scaled.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Melee_Details_grey_030-1-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"Team TotalEnergies ENVE Melee road bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Melee_Details_grey_030-1-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Melee_Details_grey_030-1-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Melee_Details_grey_030-1-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Melee_Details_grey_030-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Melee_Details_grey_030-1-1536x1153.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Melee_Details_grey_030-1-2048x1537.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TOTAL-ENERGIES-Melee-Panel-Render-scaled.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TOTAL-ENERGIES-Melee-Panel-Render-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"Team TotalEnergies ENVE Melee road bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TOTAL-ENERGIES-Melee-Panel-Render-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TOTAL-ENERGIES-Melee-Panel-Render-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TOTAL-ENERGIES-Melee-Panel-Render-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TOTAL-ENERGIES-Melee-Panel-Render-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TOTAL-ENERGIES-Melee-Panel-Render-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/TOTAL-ENERGIES-Melee-Panel-Render-2048x1536.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the Melee frame and the ENVE wheels, the team will also run ENVE bars. Riders will choose the one-piece or two-piece ENVE SES Aero Road bar and SES AR bar. Riders will have the ENVE 2.3, 3.4, 4.5, and 6.7 SES wheels available to them. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What About Other Bikes?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What will the team be riding for time trials and other specialized races and/or stages? That’s a great question and one that we’ve asked ENVE’s PR team. The Melee offers up to 35mm tire clearance, so it seems that it would be a good option for cobbled classics. And at 850g for the claimed frame weight, the Melee should be a strong climber as well. However, it seems unlikely that Team TotalEnergies would be willing to use this as a platform for time trials. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps we’ll see a mix of two different bike brands for the same team? Or maybe we’ll end up seeing some ENVE prototypes down the road? Only the ENVE Melee and <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/enve-builds-the-complete-carbon-package-with-new-custom-road-bikes-built-to-order/\" target=\"_blank\">AR</a> are listed under the UCI-approved frame list at this time. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>ENVE in the Peloton</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to Team TotalEnergies, you’ll continue to see ENVE SES wheels and bars under UAE Team Emirates. Ivan Basso and Alberto Contador’s project, Team Polti Kometa will also continue running ENVE through the 2024 season. </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/enve-melee-pro-peloton-road-bike-team-totalenergies/\">The ENVE Melee Joins the Pro Peloton Under Team TotalEnergies</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"5594d1b0b8055a5ed9de906b1733e3d4c82d46622c92812321add8a7a19b6671","category":"Cycling"}
