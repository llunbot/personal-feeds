But, back up a word here, then finish: \"GPU kernel modules.\"</p>\n<p>So, Nvidia has \"achieved equivalent or better application performance with our open-source GPU kernel modules,\" and added some new capabilities to them. And now most of Nvidia's modern GPUs will default to using open source GPU kernel modules, starting with driver release R560, with dual GPL and MIT licensing. But Nvidia has moved most of its proprietary functions into a proprietary, closed-source firmware blob. The parts of Nvidia's GPUs that interact with the broader Linux system are open, but the user-space drivers and firmware are none of your or the OSS community's business.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037900#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037900&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ae3060953e4ddf231e227ad57e40a04041adeb2d9e663ad21ef17617c995a96c","category":"Tech"}
