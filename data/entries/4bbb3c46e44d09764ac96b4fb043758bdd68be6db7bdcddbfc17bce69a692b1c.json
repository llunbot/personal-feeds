Disney said SharePlay is available globally for the entire Disney+ catalog of content from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, National Geographic, and more.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOnce everyone has joined the FaceTime call, any user can start SharePlay by opening the Disney+ app and tapping play on the content that you want to watch. SharePlay sessions offer shared playback controls like play, pause, fast forward, and rewind.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSharePlay sessions can include up to 32 people and offer each participant in the FaceTime call the ability to choose audio and subtitles in their preferred language, Disney said <a href=\"https://dmedmedia.disney.com/news/disney-plus-shareplay-now-available-for-apple-tv-iphone-ipad\">in a press release</a> announcing the update. Disney also said its native GroupWatch co-viewing feature will continue to be available globally to subscribers.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSharePlay support requires the latest version of the Disney+ app that is <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/-/id1446075923\">rolling out now on the App Store</a> for the iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV. SharePlay is also available on the Mac starting with macOS 12.1, but Disney+ does not offer a Mac app.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOther apps that support SharePlay include Apple TV+, Apple Music, TikTok, Twitch, Paramount+, SHOWTIME, the NBA app, and more. Last month, Apple said SharePlay support was also coming to BET+, ESPN, HBO Max, Hulu, MasterClass, Pantaya, Pluto TV, and Starz.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div></div><div><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/macrumors?sub_confirmation=1\">Subscribe to MacRumors on YouTube</a></em></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/disney-plus/\">Disney Plus</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/shareplay/\">SharePlay</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/15/disney-plus-shareplay/\">Disney+ Gains SharePlay Support for Watching With Friends on FaceTime Calls</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/disney-gains-shareplay-support-for-watching-with-friends-on-facetime-calls.2327712/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=UxO9ldccKu0:YWggn6wk_mc:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=UxO9ldccKu0:YWggn6wk_mc:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4bbb3c46e44d09764ac96b4fb043758bdd68be6db7bdcddbfc17bce69a692b1c","category":"Apple"}
