The much-anticipated second season is set to debut this fall, and we finally have an official trailer. Good news: S2 promises to be just as much fun as the first, if the trailer is any indication.</p>\n<p><strong>(Major spoilers for the first season below.)</strong></p>\n<p>It has been a couple of years, so let's briefly recap. As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/06/review-our-favorite-trickster-god-is-charismatic-as-ever-in-loki-premiere/\">reported previously</a>, the launching point for <em>Loki</em> S1 was that scene in <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/avengers-endgame-is-three-of-marvels-best-films-rolled-into-one/\"><em>Avengers: Endgame</em></a> when a 2012 version of Loki snagged the tesseract containing the Space Stone and vanished through a portal. Our trickster soon encountered a team of armed guards who \"arrested\" him on behalf of an entity known as the Time Variance Authority (TVA), the \"custodians of chronology\" in the MCU, monitoring violations of the Sacred Timeline. Catch the TVA's attention by trying to change history, and you just might meet the wrong end of the Retroactive Cannon (Ret Con) and have your entire history deleted from the historical timeline. </p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1957682#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1957682&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"aee0c87a84648c54ecdc1fd912973df498f45055ad2664aeaace0dabe83bec54","category":"Tech"}
