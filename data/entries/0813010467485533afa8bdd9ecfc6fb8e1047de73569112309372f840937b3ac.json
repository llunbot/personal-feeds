The Specialized Aethos Comp now costs £4,250 / $4,500 / €4,800.</p>\n<p>The new Aethos 9r frameset retains the same ‘traditional’ silhouette as the existing Aethos 10r and S-Works framesets, but increases the weight.</p>\n<p>While Specialized hasn’t revealed the weight of the 9r frame specifically, the Aethos Sport comes in at a claimed 7.8kg for a size-56cm bike, while the Aethos Comp now weighs a claimed 7.5kg.</p>\n<h2>Re-introducing the Aethos</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"The new Specialized S-Works Aethos\" title=\"The new Specialized S-Works Aethos\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The S-Works Aethos was first introduced in October 2020.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Specialized</i></span></div>\n<p>The Specialized S-Works Aethos was <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2021-specialized-s-works-aethos/\">originally launched in October 2020</a>, following the release of the Tarmac SL7</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/specialized-s-works-tarmac-sl7-review/\">Tarmac SL7</a> combined Specialized’s race bikes into one platform, with the long-standing Tarmac – historically a lightweight/all-round race bike – getting an aero makeover, and the brand’s dedicated aero bike, the Venge, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2021-specialized-tarmac/\">being discontinued</a>.</p>\n<p>With that, the Aethos arrived as something of an antidote to the aero tubes and integrated routing now found on pretty much every race bike.</p>\n<p>While the cables/hydraulic hoses run internally through the frame, they remain external from the two-piece cockpit. The Aethos’ tubes are also round and the seatpost clamp is external. Oh, and the S-Works frame came in at a claimed 585g in a size 56cm.</p>\n<p>If you wanted a performance-focused bike that harked back to the 2010s, the Aethos was it, but it came at a cost – from £10,750 / $12,500 at the time of launch.</p>\n<h2>Trickling down</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Specialized Aethos Sport road bike with Shimano 105\" title=\"Specialized Aethos Sport road bike with Shimano 105\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Specialized Aethos Sport comes with a Shimano 105 groupset for £3,000.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Specialized</i></span></div>\n<p>As is usually the case with new releases, Specialized followed the S-Works Aethos launch with the introduction of a second-tier Aethos frame, with the 10r increasing the weight from 585g to a claimed 699g.</p>\n<p>That 10r frame is now being offered by Specialized as a frameset-only option for £3,500 / $3,000 / €4,000.</p>\n<p>The new 9r frame brings a third tier to the Aethos line-up and lowers the entry point to the range.</p>\n<p>While the 10r was the original basis of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/specialized-aethos-comp-review/\">Specialized Aethos Comp</a> we reviewed in 2021, that model will be based around the 9r chassis for 2024, dropping the price from £5,000 in the UK to £4,250 ($4,500 / €4,800).</p>\n<p>Indeed, if you wanted to buy an Aethos in the UK in 2023, the existing Aethos Comp was the lowest-priced option at £5,000, while, at the other end, the range sky-rockets all the way up to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/specialized-s-works-aethos-campagnolo-srw/\">£15,000 S-Works Aethos Campagnolo Ltd</a>.</p>\n<p>At £3,000, the new Aethos Sport is the most affordable Aethos yet – and may appeal to riders who want an uncomplicated bike that still has an element of modernity – but we can hear you at the back: ‘Three grand for a road bike with a third-tier groupset?!’.</p>\n<p>While we don’t need to tell you again about <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/long-reads/pandemic-brexit-bike-prices/\">price rises across the industry over the past couple of years</a>, the Aethos Sport is, broadly speaking, in the right ballpark currently.</p>\n<p>The Giant TCR Advanced Disc 2, also with mechanical Shimano 105, costs £2,499, though we’d bet the TCR is due an update. Trek’s Emonda SL 5 Disc, also with 12-speed mechanical 105, was priced at £2,700 <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/trek-emonda-sl-5-disc-review/\">when we reviewed it last year</a>.</p>\n<p>Entering its fourth year, the Aethos frameset may also be due an overhaul, though where Specialized takes this one next is anyone’s guess.</p>","author":"George Scott","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"0813010467485533afa8bdd9ecfc6fb8e1047de73569112309372f840937b3ac","category":"Cycling"}
