(credit: Coffee Stain Publishing)</p>  </figure>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<div><a name=\"page-1\"></a></div>\n<p>There are games for which I have great admiration, pleasant memories, and an entirely dreadful set of skills and outcomes. <em>Heroes of Might &amp; Magic III </em>(or <em>HoMM 3</em>) has long been one of those games.</p>\n<p>I have played it on just about every PC I've owned, ever since it chipped away at my college GPA. I love being tasked with managing not only heroes, armies, resources, villages, and battlefield positioning but also time itself. If you run around the map clicking to discover every single power-up and resource pile, using up turn after turn, you will almost certainly let your enemy grow strong enough to conquer you. But I do this, without fail. I get halfway into a campaign and the (horse cart) wheels fall off, so I set the game aside until the click-to-move-the-horsey impulse comes back.</p>\n<p>With the release of <em>Songs of Conquest</em> in 1.0 form on PC today (<a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/867210/Songs_of_Conquest/?utm_source=Landing_page\">Steam</a>, <a href=\"https://www.gog.com/game/songs_of_conquest\">GOG</a>, <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/store/p/songs-of-conquest\">Epic</a>), I feel freed from this loop of recurrent humbling. This title from Lavapotion and Coffee Stain Publishing very much hits the same pleasure points of discovery and choice as <em>HoMM 3</em>. ButÂ <em>Songs of Conquest</em> has much easier onboarding, modern resolutions, interfaces that aren't too taxing (to the point of being Verified on Steam Deck), and <a href=\"https://www.gamespace.com/all-articles/news/songs-of-conquest-ai-update/\">granular difficulty customization</a>. More importantly for most, it has its own stories and ideas. If you love fiddling with stuff turn by turn, it's hard to imagine you won't find something in <em>Songs of Conquest</em> to hook you.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025391#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2025391&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e2dcdf56188bf87ade59c76821f21eff8d7183a69237148eaf1ca57294591d8c","category":"Tech"}
