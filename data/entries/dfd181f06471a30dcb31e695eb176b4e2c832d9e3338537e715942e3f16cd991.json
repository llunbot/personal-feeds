{"title":"Announcing HashiCorp Boundary 0.5","link":"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/announcing-hashicorp-boundary-0-5","date":1628611200000,"content":"<p>Today we’re announcing the release of <a href=\"https://www.boundaryproject.io/\">HashiCorp Boundary</a> 0.5 and Boundary Desktop 1.2.1. This latest release includes a new event-logging system for operators to gain more fine-grained visibility into running Boundary clusters, CRUD capabilities for credential stores and credential libraries in the administrative console, and enhancements to session cleanup.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"#event-logging\">»</a><a></a>Event Logging</h2>\n<p>Boundary’s new event logging system is a milestone on our observability roadmap, giving operators greater visibility into system information in a well-defined, structured format. When enabled, event logs are the only type of logging Boundary performs, meaning standard system information and debug logs will no longer appear in <code>stdout</code>.</p>\n<p>The new structured event logs are filterable by event type and other expressions that users define. Because event logging is a big change to our product, we are also still supporting our legacy HCLog output through a user-configurable setting.</p>\n<p>For more about event logging usage, see our <a href=\"https://www.boundaryproject.io/docs/configuration/events/overview\">documentation</a>.</p>\n<h2><a href=\"#credential-crud-for-administrative-console\">»</a><a></a>Credential CRUD for Administrative Console</h2>\n<p>In 0.4, we released the <a href=\"https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/announcing-hashicorp-boundary-0-4\">Vault integration</a> for credential brokering, allowing operators to configure Vault integration via the CLI. The 0.5 release enables administration to configure these resources through the administrative console.</p><img src=\"https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1628529769-config-vault-int-boundary-target.png\" /><p><em>Configuring Vault Integration for a Boundary Target.</em></p><img src=\"https://www.datocms-assets.com/2885/1628529829-cred-stores-via-vault.png\" /><p><em>Establishing Credential Stores via Vault.</em></p>\n<h2><a href=\"#upgrade-details\">»</a><a></a>Upgrade Details</h2>\n<p>Boundary 0.5 introduces significant new functionality and is available for <a href=\"https://www.boundaryproject.io/downloads\">download now</a>.
