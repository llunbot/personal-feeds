You can check it out a bit early in a beta that will feel pretty robust to most users.</p>\n<p>Thunderbird, maintained by the Mozilla Foundation subsidiary MZLA, acquired the source code and naming rights to K-9 Mail, as <a href=\"https://blog.thunderbird.net/2022/06/revealed-thunderbird-on-android-plans-k9/\">announced in June 2022</a>. The group also brought K-9 maintainer Christian Ketterer (or \"cketti\") onto the project. Their initial goals, before a full rebrand into Thunderbird, involved importing Thunderbird's automatic account setup, message filters, and mobile/desktop Thunderbird syncing.</p>\n<p>At the tail end of 2023, however, Ketterer wrote on K-9's blog that the punchlist of items before official Thunderbird-dom was <a href=\"https://k9mail.app/2023/12/28/When-will-Thunderbird-for-Android-be-released\">taking longer than expected</a>. But when it's fully released, Thunderbird for Android will have those features. As such, beta testers are asked to <a href=\"https://blog.thunderbird.net/2024/09/help-us-test-the-thunderbird-for-android-beta/\">check out a specific list of things</a> to see if they work, including automatic setup, folder management, and K-9-to-Thunderbird transfer. The beta will not be \"addressing longstanding issues,\" Thunderbird's blog post notes.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/thunderbird-android-client-is-k-9-mail-reborn-and-its-in-solid-beta/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/thunderbird-android-client-is-k-9-mail-reborn-and-its-in-solid-beta/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c52e1718c0e0c1a28cd0c671f4a42089881e7b48074d03117471993655d3b738","category":"Tech"}
