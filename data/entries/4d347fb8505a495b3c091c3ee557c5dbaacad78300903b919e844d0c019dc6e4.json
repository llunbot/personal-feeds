30-mile ride is on traffic-free roads and passes through central London up to Essex and is ideal for people of all riding abilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also a FreeCycle event that takes place on

takes place in May, which should hopefully dictate a crisp, relatively warm sunny day but thanks to the gloriously unpredictable British weather this is by no means guaranteed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Assess the weather forecast on the day, and bear in mind you may be riding for the best part of five hours or more so will need a few layers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A pair of padded shorts, base layer (<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/should-you-still-wear-a-base-layer-in-the-summer\" target=\"_blank\">although this is up for debate</a>), jersey, good socks, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-sports-bras-cycling\" target=\"_blank\">sports bra for the ladies</a>, and a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-the-best-packable-cycling-jackets\" target=\"_blank\">lightweight packable waterproof jacket</a> should be your starting point, as well as a pair of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-cycling-sunglasses\" target=\"_blank\">sunglasses</a> should that big and beautiful ball of plasma show its face on the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will likely be cold in the morning so you might want to consider <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-arm-warmers-reviewed\" target=\"_blank\">arm warmers</a>, which are easily stashable, and/or a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyer-s-guide-best-cycling-neckwarmers\" target=\"_blank\">buff</a> for your neck or ears too.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"634\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/BQ105217-970x634.jpg\" alt=\"Riders in the Ford RideLondon-Essex

make sure you have the right spares, a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-mini-pump\" target=\"_blank\">mini pump</a> or CO2 cannister, plus a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-cycling-multitool\" target=\"_blank\">multitool</a> and tyre levers, and a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-puncture-repair-kits\" target=\"_blank\">puncture repair kit</a>.  If you are running tubeless then you will need to plug the puncture so will need a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-tubeless-repair-kit\" target=\"_blank\">tubeless puncture repair kit</a>.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But where are you going to put all this stuff?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jersey back pockets are an option, as is a top tube bag or a <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-handlebar-bag\" target=\"_blank\">handlebar bag</a>. These bags, which attach directly onto the bike, are also useful if you want to pack a few snacks to help you on your way and prefer your pockets unstuffed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Do I have to raise money?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"643\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/AW406652-970x643.jpg\" alt=\"Riders in the Ford RideLondon-Essex 100 pass through the Essex countryside during Ford RideLondon on Sunday 28th May 2023.\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/AW406652-970x643.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/AW406652-300x199.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/AW406652-768x509.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/AW406652-750x498.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/AW406652-1140x756.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/AW406652-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/01/AW406652.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>\n</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can ride RideLondon simply for the joy of it or you can complete the ride and <a href=\"https://www.ridelondon.co.uk/charity-info/ride-for-charity\" target=\"_blank\">raise money for a good cause</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are plenty of <a href=\"https://www.ridelondon.co.uk/charity-info/ride-for-charity/i-need-a-charity-place\" target=\"_blank\">charity places</a> available for the Ford RideLondon-100 and 60 challenge, including for Cancer Research UK, Alzheimer’s Society and Mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Charity places cost a small fee, which the charity sets (usually around £30), plus a fundraising target (around £500). The cost and fundraising target varies between charities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A charity place is a great way of securing your place on the start line, adding motivation and doing good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ready to take on the challenge?
