Suspecting skullduggery, the New Zealand squad called the local police, and <em>gendarmes</em> located and then detained the nearby drone operator. He turned out to be one Joseph Lombardi, an \"unaccredited analyst with Canada Soccer\"—and he was apparently spying on the New Zealand practice and relaying information to a Canadian assistant coach.</p>\n<p>On July 23, the New Zealand Olympic Committee <a href=\"https://olympic.org.nz/news/nzoc-statement\">put out a statement</a> saying it was \"deeply shocked and disappointed by this incident, which occurred just three days before the sides are due to face each other in their opening game of Paris 2024.\" It also complained to the official International Olympic Committee integrity unit.</p>\n<p>Early today, July 24, the Canadian side issued its own <a href=\"https://olympic.ca/press/coc-statement-on-canada-soccer/\">statement</a> saying that it \"stands for fair-play and we are shocked and disappointed. We offer our heartfelt apologies to New Zealand Football, to all the players affected, and to the New Zealand Olympic Committee.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039027#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039027&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Nate Anderson","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"09b7ba1b22583b8bdbfcd9d8f97b53ee8c5af63a34bbf7f41cf615bf0c37e3b8","category":"Tech"}
