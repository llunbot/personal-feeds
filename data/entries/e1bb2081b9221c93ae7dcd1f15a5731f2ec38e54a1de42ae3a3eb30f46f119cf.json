We <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/review/activity-awards-magnets/\">reviewed Activity Awards</a> last year and were impressed with their design and functionality.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/activity-awards-6.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Apple Watch and the Fitness app have inspired many people to work out and get fit, and Activity Awards make a great self reward if you've been working hard. They serve as a physical representation of a fitness achievement to remind you of what you've accomplished.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/activity-awards-7.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition to being useful motivation for yourself, Activity Awards can also make a great gift for someone who has put a lot of effort into fitness activities with the Apple Watch. The designs in general are also eye-catching and look great on a whiteboard or refrigerator.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/activity-awards-8.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe grand prize winner of the ‌giveaway‌ will receive a 41mm or 45mm aluminum GPS-only ‌Apple Watch Series 7‌ in a color of their choice, and they will be able to pick six Activity Awards.
