All we really know is it’s designed around a 100mm fork, is compatible with <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-dropper-posts/\">dropper posts</a> and features a one-piece integrated handlebar and stem with internal cable routing.</p>\n<p>Does the new Dogma prove there’s life in the old hardtail yet?

Jenny Rissveds rode the Exie to a host of World Cup podiums in 2022.</p>\n<p>Ibis claims the Exie is a bike that flat-out shreds and, with geometry that wouldn’t look out of place on a downcountry or trail bike, we can start to see why.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\"

Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>With a 67.2-degree head angle and a rangy 478mm reach on a size large, the Exie can certainly claim to have some of the most progressive numbers of any XC race bike out there.</p>\n<p>Using a 120mm fork as standard, to go with 100mm of travel out back and short seat tube lengths for longer <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-dropper-posts/\">dropper posts</a>, only emphasises Ibis’s fast but fun intentions for this bike.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n

down.</p>\n<p>If your budget doesn’t stretch to the $7,999 XT-equipped Exie USA, let alone the $12,299 XX SL range-topper, Ibis offers a Vietnam-made Exie Deore for $4,999.</p>\n<h2>Scott

href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/2022-nino-schurter-scott-spark-rc/\">Scott’s Spark</a>.</p>\n<p>Originally introduced in the 2000s, the current iteration of the Spark is still doing the business under Nino Schurter, close to two-and-a-half years after its release.</p>\n<p>With its attention-grabbing hidden-shock frame design, progressive geometry and Scott’s signature TwinLoc system, the Spark ticks all the boxes the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cross-country-bikes/\">best cross-country bikes</a> should.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n

cross-country bikes designed around today’s rougher, more technical courses, the Spark RC features <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/how-much-suspension-travel-do-i-need-on-my-mountain-bike/\">120mm of travel</a> front and rear, and progressive geometry to give riders such as Schurter the confidence to charge head-first into descents and jumps.</p>\n<p>With an adjustable head angle to tailor the geometry to a rider’s preference, room for two <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cycling-water-bottles/\">water bottles</a> in the front triangle, and space for big 2.4in rubber, it’s also a versatile machine that can be used outside the race tape as well, making it a popular choice with privateer racers.</p>\n<p>You can use the sub-2kg weight of the lightest frame option to go full Dangerholm and build one of the lightest bikes on the starting line.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\"

price tag either, with the range-topping RC SL costing £14,999/$14,999.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, with the RC range starting at £4,299 for the base Comp model, you don’t have to have quite such deep pockets to get your hands on a Spark.</p>\n<h2>Specialized Epic World Cup</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n

href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/specialized-s-works-epic-world-cup/\">Specialized Epic World Cup</a>.</p>\n<p>The Brain-equipped full-suspension Epic has been around even longer than the Spark, and has racked up multiple wins over the years.</p>\n<p>Indeed, Specialized’s proprietary Brain rear shocks, and later forks, have been key features throughout its lifespan.</p>\n<p>For 2023, though, the Epic treads a new path.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n

Specialized has had a rethink on the Brain suspension technology.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Nick Clark / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>It had already ditched Specialized’s famed FSR Horst-link pivot for flexstays with the previous generation, and the new bike takes things to the next level as – shock horror – the Brain is now dead… in the rear shocks at least.</p>\n<p>Not only that, the SIDLuxe WCID rear shock, co-developed with RockShox, moves into, rather than under the top tube.</p>\n<p>The integrated shock has no form of on-the-fly external pedal adjustment like other shocks on the market.</p>\n<p>Instead, you adjust the negative air pressure in the shock to provide your pedal platform.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n

/>\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> There are three settings for the integrated shock.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Thomas Maheux / SWpix.com</i></span></div>\n<p>Specialized says there are three settings; No Gulp, the firmest, most efficient mode; Half Gulp, a balance of efficiency and traction; and Full Gulp, the softest setting for soaking up the roughest descents.</p>\n<p>Unlike the Supercaliber though, where the extended seatstays actuate the shock, the Epic still uses a small rocker link, so is arguably more of a full-suspension bike than a softtail.</p>\n<p>Whereas other bikes, such as the Spark, are getting bumps up in travel, the Epic World Cup has less travel out back than its predecessor, sporting just 75mm of bounce, down 25mm from the previous model.</p>\n<p>It does see a boost in fork travel though,  now sporting a custom 110mm Rockshox SID SL fork up-front.</p>\n<p>If you want to know about the new bike, be sure to check out our <a
