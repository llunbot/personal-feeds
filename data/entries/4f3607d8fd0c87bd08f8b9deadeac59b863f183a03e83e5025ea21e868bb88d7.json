The process gave them an unusual and distinctive appearance, according to <a href=\"https://publicera.kb.se/csa/article/view/10726\">a paper</a> published in the journal Current Swedish Archaeology. Along with evidence that the Viking men from the island may have deliberately filed their teeth, the discovery sheds light on the role body modification may have played in Viking culture</p>\n<p>When people hear about Viking body modification, they probably think of Viking tattoos, particularly since the History Channel series <em><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/01/gruesome-viking-blood-eagle-ritual-is-anatomically-possible-study-finds/\">Vikings</a></em> popularized that notion. But whether actual Vikings <a href=\"https://www.medievalists.net/2018/05/tattooed-vikings-a-look-at-medieval-body-art/\">sported tattoos</a> is a matter of considerable debate. There is no mention of tattoos in the few Norse sagas and poetry that have survived, although other unusual physical characteristics are often mentioned, such as scars.</p>\n<p>The only real evidence comes from a 10th century travel account by an Arab traveler and trader named Ahmad Ibn Fadlan, whose travel account, <em>Mission to the Volga</em>, describes the Swedish Viking traders (\"Rusiyyah\") he met in the Middle Volga region of Russia. \"They are dark from the tips of their toes right up to their necks—trees, pictures, and the like,\" Ibn Fadlan wrote. But the precise Arabic translation is unclear, and there is no hard archaeological evidence, since human skin typically doesn't preserve for centuries after a Viking burial.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014895#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2014895&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"4f3607d8fd0c87bd08f8b9deadeac59b863f183a03e83e5025ea21e868bb88d7","category":"Tech"}
