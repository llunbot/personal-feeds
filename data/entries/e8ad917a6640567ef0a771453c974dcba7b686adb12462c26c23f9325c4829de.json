Matt cut his teeth racing track and road, but now pedals his trade in the crit racing scene. A former national crit champ and multiple Tour series winner, Matt now races all over the globe. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this episode Matt discusses growing up on the Isle of Man with Mark Cavendish’s old mentor for help, throwing elbows in the States against crit superstars Legion (and winning), and why he’ll never turn to gravel. Ever. Maybe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later, Will and James also get into a very lengthy chat about the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/tour-de-france\" target=\"_blank\">Tour de France</a>, because hey, it’s the best race in the world and it’s just finished. So stick with us for insights into Pogačar, Biniam Girmay, Victor Campanaerts, whether Cav’s record is beatable, plus the truth behind team radios.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interview begins at 1.04.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow Ribble Rebellion’s ongoing success by searching ‘ribble rebellion’ online and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ribble_rebellion/\" target=\"_blank\">on Instagram</a>.
