Will it resemble the existing Valve Index, complete with a \"frunk\" and giant, hovering speakers? And will it ever launch at retail? Those details remain unclear, but our reporting suggests something that features Oculus Quest-like \"standalone\" operability.

The best information in the wild right now seems to be coming from Valve itself: data-mining discoveries and patent applications are adding up to something that looks like a brand-new Valve VR system with some form of built-in wireless functionality.</p>\n<p>Sources familiar with matters at Valve have confirmed to Ars that information in the wild is legitimate—at least in terms of products being <em>made</em> within Valve's headquarters, even if those products don't ultimately see retail launches.</p>\n<h2>A new, unclear “ism”</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp42lQYVzwo\">This week's information roundup</a> comes courtesy of VR industry reporter and YouTube channel host Brad Lynch, who received a tip after tracking months of Valve patent applications. The tip came in the form of a device code-named \"Deckard,\" which is mentioned in SteamVR's publicly available branches from as far back as January. Ars can confirm the legitimacy of \"Deckard\" as a code-named device worked on inside of Valve's headquarters.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1799079#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1799079&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Sam Machkovech","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8a9da3d8e6a6fa50c32cb1bd47fd2141c0115b347b2ae52dabaeb2650282ead9","category":"Tech"}
