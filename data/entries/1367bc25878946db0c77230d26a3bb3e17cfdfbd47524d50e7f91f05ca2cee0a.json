It’s MagSafe-compatible for the iPhone side, which means it can charge at 7.5W rather than the certified Made for MagSafe 15W.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MagSafe works with the iPhone 12 and later (but not the SE). The Qi charging pad is rated at 3W for Apple AirPods (2nd and 3rd generation AirPods, and all AirPods Pro).</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Journey-SWIV-3-in-1-Foldable-Wireless-Charging-Station-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Journey SWIV 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Station flat flipped\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Journey-SWIV-3-in-1-Foldable-Wireless-Charging-Station-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Journey-SWIV-3-in-1-Foldable-Wireless-Charging-Station-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Journey-SWIV-3-in-1-Foldable-Wireless-Charging-Station-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Journey-SWIV-3-in-1-Foldable-Wireless-Charging-Station-1.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" /></figure><p>Journey</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Design</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While there are faster and more flexible 3-in-1 charging stations, such as the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2073921/twelve-south-hirise-3-deluxe-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Twelve South HiRise 3 Deluxe</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2135180/otterbox-3-in-1-charging-station-review-wirelessly-fast-charge-all-your-mobile-devices.html\" target=\"_blank\">OtterBox 3-in-1 Charging Station with MagSafe</a>, neither is portable like the Journey SWIV 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Station is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The SWIV can be laid flat to take on all its charging duties but is also easily folded for transit. The MagSafe pad folds back onto the Watch charging module and magnetically snaps shut.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a really neat design and the best travel-friendly folding charger that we’ve tested.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can place your Apple Watch in Nightstand mode or flat on the base as the charging module can flip up to your preference.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Journey-SWIV-3-in-1-Foldable-Wireless-Charging-Station-2-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Journey SWIV 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Station\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Journey-SWIV-3-in-1-Foldable-Wireless-Charging-Station-2-1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Journey-SWIV-3-in-1-Foldable-Wireless-Charging-Station-2-1.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Journey-SWIV-3-in-1-Foldable-Wireless-Charging-Station-2-1.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Journey-SWIV-3-in-1-Foldable-Wireless-Charging-Station-2-1.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" /></figure><p>Journey</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s made of aluminum with a vegan leather material base and has a small-footprint design—taking up less space on your desk than an iPhone Pro: 8.3 x 2.9 x 0.5 inches (21 x 7.4 x 1.3cm) when open, and 5.2 x 2.9 x 1 inches (13.3 x 7.4 x 2.5cm) closed. It weighs just 5.2oz (147g), and is available in just one color: white</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn’t ship with a power adapter, so you’ll need at least a 20W USB-C charger, though Journey does supply a 5-foot (1.5m) USB-C cable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BXLDPRMF?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">ESR’s HaloLock 3-in-1 Travel Wireless Charging Set</a> is also great for portability in a smart case, but it doesn’t offer fast charging for the Watch and comes in multiple parts, unlike the one-piece Journey SWIV.
