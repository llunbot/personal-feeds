This will likely be Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/17/iphone-18-pro-c2-modem-rumor/\">C2 modem</a>. The current cellular iPad Pro models are equipped with Qualcomm modems.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's first C1 modem <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-unveils-c1/\">debuted in the iPhone 16e</a> last month.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA new iPad Pro generation typically launches every 18 months or so. The current models were released in May 2024, and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/30/m5-ipad-pro-macbook-pro-later-this-year/\">next models with the M5 chip will likely launch in October</a> this year. If this trend continues, the iPad Pro models with the M6 chip and an Apple-designed 5G modem would likely be released in the first half of 2027.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman did not say when the new entry-level iPad and MacBook Air models will launch, but 2026 is a safe bet.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAt this point, no other major changes have been rumored for these devices.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-pro/\">iPad Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad\">iPad (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad-Pro\">iPad Pro (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air\">15\" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">13\" MacBook Air (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/30/ipad-pro-with-apple-5g-modem/\">iPad Pro With Apple's 5G Modem, iPad 12, and More Already Rumored</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-pro-with-apples-5g-modem-ipad-12-and-more-already-rumored.2454326/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"319e7aa8e38809d3ad52eb8b94c71a8d1a398f5908e0270371a5d8067e560960","category":"Apple"}
