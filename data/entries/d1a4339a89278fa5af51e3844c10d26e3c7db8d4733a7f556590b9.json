Kyle Wiggers, reporting for TechCrunch:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In December, <a href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchstorage/news/252528650/Microsoft-reportedly-acquires-DPU-maker-Fungible\">reports</a> suggested that Microsoft had acquired\nFungible, a startup fabricating a type of data center hardware\nknown as a data processing unit (DPU), for around $190 million.\nToday, Microsoft <a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/01/09/microsoft-announces-acquisition-of-fungible-to-accelerate-datacenter-innovation/\">confirmed</a> the acquisition but not the\npurchase price, saying that it plans to use Fungible’s tech and\nteam to deliver “multiple DPU solutions, network innovation and\nhardware systems advancements.” [...]</p>\n\n<p>Fungible was launched in 2016 by Bertrand Serlet, a former Apple\nsoftware engineer who sold a cloud storage startup, Upthere, to\nWestern Digital in 2017, alongside Krishna Yarlagadda and Juniper\nNetworks co-founder Pradeep Sindhu. Fungible sold DPUs that relied\non two operating systems, one open source and the other\nproprietary, and a microprocessor architecture called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIPS_architecture\">MIPS</a>\nto control flash storage volumes.</p>\n\n<p>“The Fungible DPU was invented in 2016 to address the most\nsignificant problems in scale-out data centers: the inefficient\nexecution of data-centric computations within server nodes,”\nFungible wrote in a <a href=\"https://www.fungible.com/2023/01/09/microsoft-acquires-fungible/\">statement</a> on its website. “We are\nproud to be part of a company that shares Fungible’s vision and\nwill leverage the Fungible DPU and software to enhance its storage\nand networking offerings.”</p>\n\n<p>The Fungible team will join Microsoft’s data center infrastructure\nengineering teams, Bablani said.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Bertrand Serlet at Microsoft — albeit quietly — is an outcome I certainly wouldn’t have imagined circa 2006, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-2C2gb6ws8\">when he skewered the then-still-in-beta Windows Vista</a> on stage at WWDC. Maybe the funniest 4 minutes of an Apple keynote ever.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/08/serlet-microsoft\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"5dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"d1a4339a89278fa5af51e3844c10d26e3c7db8d4733a7f556590b9","category":"Tech"}
