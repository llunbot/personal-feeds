Gemini in Gmail will soon be able to search through your entire backlog of emails and show a summary in a sidebar.</p>\n<p>That's simple to describe but solves a huge problem with email: even searching brings up a list of email subjects, and you have to click-through to each one just to read it. Having an AI sift through a bunch of emails and provide a summary sounds like a huge time saver and something you can't do with any other interface.</p>\n<p>Google's one-minute demo of this feature showed a big blue Gemini button at the top right of the Gmail web app. Tapping it opens the normal chatbot sidebar you can type in. Asking for a summary of emails from a certain contact will get you a bullet-point list of what has been happening, with a list of \"sources\" at the bottom that will jump you right to a certain email. In the last second of the demo, the user types, \"Reply saying I want to volunteer for the parent's group event,\" hits \"enter,\" and then the chatbot instantly, without confirmation, sends an email.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024267#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2024267&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8954d1577d82951885905882df664afb8db75920ff5cdd162104fca71f3fc858","category":"Tech"}
