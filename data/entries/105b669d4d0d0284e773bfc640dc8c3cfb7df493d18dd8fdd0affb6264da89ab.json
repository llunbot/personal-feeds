It combines a library of immersive cycling workouts with strength training, yoga and mental training, to help you get stronger on and off the bike.</p>\n<p>There’s no aimless pedaling or bum-numbing <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/base-training-cycling/\">base training</a> rides. Everything in SYSTM is there for a purpose – to take the guesswork out of your training so it’s as effective and rewarding as possible.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at five key features of SYSTM that can help you achieve your goals faster.</p>\n<h2>1. It’s based on sports science that gets results</h2>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Wahoo’s 4DP® power profile is designed to provide a complete picture of what you’re capable of on the bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Wahoo</i></span></div>\n<p>The most crucial aspect of any training plan is that it works.</p>\n<p>With limited time to train, athletes with ambitious goals need to know they can make the most of every minute on the bike. In fact, SYSTM’s tagline is ‘maximise every moment’.</p>\n<p>Every workout and training plan is designed by the coaches and scientists at the Wahoo Sports Science Division, led by renowned endurance coach Neal Henderson.</p>\n<p>SYSTM uses Four-Dimensional Power® (4DP) to get a complete picture of what you’re capable of on the bike. The app then uses the results to personalise all of your workouts and training plans so they’re as effective as possible. You’ll find out what kind of rider you are, what your strengths are, and where you should focus your efforts.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Based on your 4DP® data, Wahoo SYSTM outlines your rider type, and your strengths and weaknesses. That information then feeds into your personalised training plan.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Wahoo Fitness</i></span></div>\n<p>This means every minute spent on the bike, whether it be indoors on a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-smart-trainer/\">smart trainer</a> or out on the roads or trails, can be optimised to provoke the ideal training stimulus and better prepare you for your target events.</p>\n<p>If you don’t have a smart trainer, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/indoor-bikes/\">smart bike</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-power-meters/\">power meter</a>, you can calculate virtual power for most non-smart turbo trainers if you have a speed sensor paired with the app. Plus, all workouts have heart rate and rate of perceived exertion (RPE) targets.</p>\n<p>If you need professional support or advice, SYSTM offers a coach-lead forum (called the SYSTM Forum), where you can join a community of like-minded athletes.</p>\n<h2>2. You can fully customise your training plan</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> You can customise your training plan based on your preferred riding discipline, training focus and the amount of time you have available.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Wahoo Fitness</i></span></div>\n<p>Designed to cater to all levels, from beginners to experienced athletes, SYSTM takes the guesswork out of creating a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/cycling-training-plan/\">training plan</a>.</p>\n<p>Whether you have unlimited time to train or just a few hours per week, SYSTM’s powerful training plan builder offers the tools to quickly and easily create a custom training schedule.</p>\n<p>By selecting your discipline (e.g. road cycling or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advertising-feature/what-is-gravel-riding/\">gravel riding</a>), training focus, training volume and more, SYSTM can build a powerful yet easy-to-follow training plan.</p>\n<p>Start and end dates can be adjusted to suit your goals, and it’s even possible to layer key off-the-bike sessions for things like <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/strength-training-cycling/\">strength training</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/8-stretches-to-improve-your-flexibility-and-cycling-performance/\">yoga</a> and mental training.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> SYSTM isn’t only for cyclists – you can build in cross-training workouts, too.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Wahoo Fitness</i></span></div>\n<p>If you’re a multi-discipline athlete, you can incorporate <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/cross-training/\">cross-training</a> elements into your training plan, too.</p>\n<p>With more than 600 training plans, there’s something to match every athlete, their chosen discipline and their objectives.</p>\n<h2>3.
