As <a href=\"https://xboxera.com/2021/08/12/a-revitalized-edition-of-quake-to-be-announced-at-quakecon-per-the-now-scrubbed-description-of-the-lets-talk-quake-event/\">noticed by Xbox Era</a> (and still visible in <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210812154929/https://quakecon.bethesda.net/en/schedule/\">this archived version</a>), the schedule initially included a description for a \"Let's talk <em>Quake</em>\" session that mentioned participants will \"discuss the additional content MachineGames have contributed <em>to this revitalized edition</em> [emphasis added].\"</p>\n<p>That line was scrubbed from <a href=\"https://quakecon.bethesda.net/en/schedule/\">the live version of the schedule</a> sometime in the last 24 hours, implying that someone jumped the gun in mentioning the new \"revitalized\" edition. But the current listing still mentions that \"Quake is back,\" which suggests we might hear an official announcement at the \"QuakeCon Digital Welcome + Celebrating 25 Years of Quake with id Software and MachineGames\" opening session on Thursday, August 19.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1787166#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1787166&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"945173aa21659de9e4b2322994250617d105996cfef584ac33d856afb1973fdf","category":"Tech"}
