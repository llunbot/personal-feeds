Threads can import data from Instagram, including behavioral and advertising information.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to sources who spoke to <em>WSJ</em>, Meta will comply with the regulations by giving EU users a choice of using Threads purely for consumption, without a profile that allows them to make their own posts.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe change coincides with recent comments by Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram, who said the platform was rolling out a way to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/14/delete-threads-profile-keep-instagram-account/\">delete or deactivate a Threads profile separately</a> while leaving the associated Instagram account intact.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe large market expansion should see Threads' user numbers take a jump. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on a company earnings call last month that Threads now has \"just under\" 100 million monthly users. Since its launch earlier this year it has gained a web app, an ability to search for posts, and a post editing feature.   \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe expansion comes after several major advertisers, including Apple and Disney, suspended ad spending on Threads rival X (formerly Twitter) after Elon Musk posted controversial comments from his account. Musk on Wednesday said the post in question was a \"mistake,\" and anyone trying to \"blackmail\" him over advertising money could \"go fâ€“yourself,\" while also admitting the loss of ad revenue could end the social media platform.\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/14/delete-threads-profile-keep-instagram-account/\">Delete Your Threads Profile and Stay on Instagram - Here's How</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nAs mentioned above, Threads integrates with Instagram, so it continues to have a strong user base for such a new app. <a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@macrumors\"><em>MacRumors</em> is on Threads</a>, and all of our content is posted there for those who would like to follow us outside of Twitter and Facebook.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/european-union/\">European Union</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/threads/\">Threads</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/30/threads-to-launch-eu-in-december/\">Threads Is Coming to the EU in December</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/threads-is-coming-to-the-eu-in-december.2412453/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5695da0603886b515765790858279b0b653942a521a2a54f0d2b5b97764f643f","category":"Apple"}
