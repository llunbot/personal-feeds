They’re continually adding more spots, and say the price will increase as more options are added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It includes a digital pass, held in their app, where you can also book or reserve shuttles and lift tickets. Or just show the pass at the ticket window to get your day pass. The price gets you other discounts and perks at some spots, too, and a physical pass is available for $20 more and includes stickers and other fun stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.loampass.com\" target=\"_blank\">LoamPass.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/loam-pass-bike-park-season-ticket/\">Loam Pass is your Season Ticket to Bike Parks Everywhere!</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"7cc80379f972dab1ff6e30e8072419b7dc4dc3f0664d58dfe93215117a1dd9c7","category":"Cycling"}
