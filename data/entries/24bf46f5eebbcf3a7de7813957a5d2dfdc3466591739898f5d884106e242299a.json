And while this anxiety tends to be a bit overblown—lots of first- and third-party testing of cards <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/nvidias-399-4060-ti-comes-with-no-price-hike-but-mild-performance-improvements/\">like the GeForce 4060 Ti</a> shows that just a handful of games benefit when all you do is boost GPU memory from 8GB to 16GB—there's still a market for less-expensive GPUs with big pools of memory, whether you're playing games that need it or running compute tasks that benefit from it.</p>\n<p>That's the apparent impetus behind AMD's sole GPU announcement from its slate of CES news today: the $329 Radeon RX 7600 XT, a version of last year's $269 RX 7600 with twice as much memory, slightly higher clock speeds, and higher power use to go with it.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th></th>\n<th>RX 7700 XT</th>\n<th>RX 7600</th>\n<th>RX 7600 XT</th>\n<th>RX 6600</th>\n<th>RX 6600 XT</th>\n<th>RX 6650 XT</th>\n<th>RX 6750 XT</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Compute units (Stream processors)</th>\n<td>54 (3,456)</td>\n<td>32 (2,048)</td>\n<td>32 (2,048)</td>\n<td>28 (1,792)</td>\n<td>32 (2,048)</td>\n<td>32 (2,048)</td>\n<td>40 (2,560)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Boost Clock</th>\n<td>2,544 MHz</td>\n<td>2,600 MHz</td>\n<td>2,760 MHz</td>\n<td>2,490 MHz</td>\n<td>2,589 MHz</td>\n<td>2,635 MHz</td>\n<td>2,600 MHz</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Memory Bus Width</th>\n<td>192-bit</td>\n<td>128-bit</td>\n<td>128-bit</td>\n<td>128-bit</td>\n<td>128-bit</td>\n<td>128-bit</td>\n<td>192-bit</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Memory Clock</th>\n<td>2,250 MHz</td>\n<td>2,250 MHz</td>\n<td>2,250 MHz</td>\n<td>1,750 MHz</td>\n<td>2,000 MHz</td>\n<td>2,190 MHz</td>\n<td>2,250 MHz</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Memory size</th>\n<td>12GB GDDR6</td>\n<td>8GB GDDR6</td>\n<td>16GB GDDR6</td>\n<td>8GB GDDR6</td>\n<td>8GB GDDR6</td>\n<td>8GB GDDR6</td>\n<td>12GB GDDR6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>Total board power (TBP)</th>\n<td>245 W</td>\n<td>165 W</td>\n<td>190 W</td>\n<td>132 W</td>\n<td>160 W</td>\n<td>180 W</td>\n<td>250 W</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The core specifications of the 7600 XT remain the same as the regular 7600: 32 of AMD's compute units (CUs) based on the RDNA3 GPU architecture and the same memory clock speed attached to the same 128-bit memory bus. But RAM has been boosted from 8GB to 16GB, and the GPU's clock speeds have been boosted a little, ensuring that the card runs games a little faster than the regular 7600, even in games that don't care about the extra memory.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1994234#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1994234&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"24bf46f5eebbcf3a7de7813957a5d2dfdc3466591739898f5d884106e242299a","category":"Tech"}
