I was growing concerned that I was leaning on her a bit too heavily, not exploring the deeper tactical offerings of <em>BG3</em>'s combat.</p>\n<p>\"Ha!\" the game retorted. \"Ha, ha!\" That's what it sounded like to me, anyway. Lae'zel led the charge into the last decrepit corner I had yet to explore inside the goblin camp, eager to take out the third and final leader of the tribe. After ending her turn on a wooden bridge, a nearby goblin boss, Skrut, ran toward her. I wasn't concerned until, a few seconds later, the action log in the lower-right corner delivered the news: \"Lae'zel perished in a chasm.\"</p>\n<p>Skrut had leaned into something I had forgotten about since <em>BG3</em> first introduced it: the Shove action. It was initially suggested as a way to get a character out of your melee range. If you shoved an enemy and it landed a long way down, they may even take damage and end up lying prone and vulnerable. But now I understood why the game showed you the text \"Chasm\" when you moused over a seemingly endless pit, the kind drawn into many games for pure environment. You can't click to walk your characters into a chasm, but they sure can be pushed into one.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1960409#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1960409&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d7ad0ef924e84eb0ace0e6d5bc2c7cfcdede6f7a78364210e2acf76fd20ec2a0","category":"Tech"}
