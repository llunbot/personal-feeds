Starting with iOS 17.4, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-alternative-app-marketplaces-eu/\">allows alternative app marketplaces</a> on the iPhone in the EU, as part of its compliance with the Digital Markets Act.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn a press release, Epic Games said that Apple terminating the Swedish developer account is a \"serious violation\" of the Digital Markets Act, and \"shows Apple has no intention of allowing true competition on iOS devices.\" \r<br />\n\r<br />\nEpic Games:<blockquote>In terminating Epic's developer account, Apple is taking out one of the largest potential competitors to the Apple App Store. They are undermining our ability to be a viable competitor and they are showing other developers what happens when you try to compete with Apple or are critical of their unfair practices.</blockquote>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEpic Games believes that Apple suspended its Swedish developer account in part due to Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney's public criticism of Apple's proposed Digital Markets Act compliance plans. Epic Games shared a letter it received from the App Store's chief Phil Schiller, who said that Sweeney's \"colorful criticism\" of Apple's plans, coupled with Epic's history of \"intentionally violating contractual provisions with which it disagrees,\" strongly suggest that Epic Games does not intend to follow the rules.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe legal battle between the two companies <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/\">began in 2020</a>, after Apple removed Fortnite from the App Store on the iPhone due to Epic Games introducing a direct payment option in the app for the in-game currency V-Bucks, in defiance of the App Store rules. In what appears to have been an orchestrated move, Epic Games promptly filed a lawsuit against Apple, accusing the company of anti-competitive behavior.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple had already terminated another Epic Games developer account in 2020 after the company violated the App Store's rules with its Fortnite stunt.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/\">Epic Games</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/\">Epic Games vs. Apple</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/03/06/apple-explains-terminating-epic-games-account/\">Apple Explains Why It Terminated Epic's Latest Developer Account</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-explains-why-it-terminated-epics-latest-developer-account.2421220/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1f41f16236f9dff52576e77e04808610a3d0cc3ea269e0e2a79b3e7b7d1b69a9","category":"Apple"}
