Affected devices were manufactured between October 2020 and April 2021. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n‌iPhone 12‌ and 12 Pro owners who have a device that does not emit sound from the receiver when making or receiving phone calls may be eligible for free service. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12 mini</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12-pro/\">iPhone 12 Pro Max</a> models are not affected and are not part of the service program. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThose who have an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> experiencing issues can make an appointment at an Apple retail location, or find an Apple Authorized Service Provider. Apple Support can also be contacted to arrange a mail-in repair. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n‌iPhone 12‌ or 12 Pro models that have damage that impairs the ability to complete the repair, like a cracked screen, will need to have that issue fixed prior to receiving service. Apple says the repair program covers affected ‌iPhone 12‌ or 12 Pro devices for two years after the first retail sale of the device. <div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12-pro/\">iPhone 12 Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-12\">iPhone 12 (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-12-Pro\">iPhone 12 Pro (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/27/apple-repair-program-no-sound/\">Apple Launches 'No Sound' Repair Program for iPhone 12 and 12 Pro Models</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-launches-no-sound-repair-program-for-iphone-12-and-12-pro-models.2308961/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=9-IK7Qkug50:E3l35KOdpZg:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=9-IK7Qkug50:E3l35KOdpZg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/9-IK7Qkug50\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2abb697041a29bce6ba7c54ed18f47afac87da78e5160f32afcbecfa830d4f64","category":"Apple"}
