It's also increasingly popular among home craft brewers since it's relatively easy to make. Those in search of a unique challenge, however, are turning to a special kind of medieval mead called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bochet\">bochet</a>. The only known detailed recipe for bochet dates back to the late 14th century and was lost for centuries, until it was rediscovered around 2009.</p>\n<p>Fermentation in general has been around for millennia, and mead (\"fermented honey drink\") in particular was brewed throughout ancient Europe, Africa, and Asia. Perhaps the earliest known reference to such a beverage (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soma_(drink)\"><em>soma</em></a>) is found in a sacred Vedic book called the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigveda\">Rigveda</a>, circa 1700-1100 BCE. Mead was the drink of choice in ancient Greece; Danish warriors in the Old English epic poem <em>Beowulf</em> cavort in King Hrothgar's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mead_hall\">mead hall;</a> the Welsh bard <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taliesin\">Taliesin</a> (circa 550 CE) is credited with composing a \"Song of Mead\"; and mead features heavily in Norse mythology.</p>\n<p>There are many different varieties of mead from all over the world. But bochet is a special variety because it calls for caramelized honey; additional spices are optional. This makes it attractive to craft brewers looking for something a little bit different—brewers like Gemma Tarlach, who <a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/how-to-make-medieval-mead-bochet\">recently detailed her experiments</a> making bochet in a fascinating article for Atlas Obscura.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1788923#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1788923&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"df6d6bef3827fd23d3a0337fcd96de4fa91e10fb65848db73aaf24e1c619fc0a","category":"Tech"}
