Coffees dispatched, we pedal off down the promenade, past leathery men out running and women walking dogs too brittle for this world. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pedestrianised path joins the main road, which, despite hugging Como’s scenic shores, is remarkably quiet. The faster SS36 inland is to thank, taking the less dawdling traffic away from the lake, but unfortunately this corniche utopia stops short at Mandello del Lario. There the SS36 swings back to the water to become the only way down to Lecco.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"694\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-04-694x970.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride 157 Lake Como\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-04-694x970.jpg 694w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-04-215x300.jpg 215w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-04-768x1074.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-04-1099x1536.jpg 1099w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-04-1465x2048.jpg 1465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-04-360x504.jpg 360w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-04-750x1048.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-04-1140x1593.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-04.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>The stairs down to the harbour at Corenno are as treacherous as they are picturesque, and what goes down…</figcaption><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Unlike a lot of <em>Strada Statale</em> this road is technically rideable, but it contains a long tunnel whose reduced speed limits aren’t always adhered to – this is Italy. Many riders do go this way, but there is an alternative: the ferry from Bellano.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To imagine it, picture Lake Como as an upside-down Y. Colico, where we started, is at the top; Lecco is at the bottom of the right leg, Como bottom left. The ferry cuts off that right leg by landing at Bellagio, the lake’s most visited town and the layman’s geographical crotch.</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s one of the lovely things about Lake Como. There are dozens of <em>batelli</em> that run back and forth, and for less than a spritzer they’ll take you wherever you wish to go (bike space permitting, but you’re unlikely to be turned away). But before we reach our boat, we stop in at Corenno.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-05-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride 157 Lake Como\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-05-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-05-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-05-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-05-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-05-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-05-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-05.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>The Madonna del Ghisallo climb starts in earnest.</figcaption><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The tourist guides will tell you Varenna, a few kilometres further south, is the lake’s prettiest town, but according to Emanuela, Corenno is where it’s at. I shoulder my bike and teeter down a long, cobbled stairway to a tiny harbour. Dressed in flowers and protecting a few bobbing boats, it couldn’t be more lovely if you painted it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emanuela points to one boat – wooden, with a covered wagon-type roof – and explains this is the iconic <em>batèll</em>, a kind of all-purpose fishing boat. They’re ubiquitous as gondolas in Venice, and are better known to tourists as Lucia boats, after <em>I Promessi Sposi</em>’s star-crossed lover uses one to flee the evil clutches of Don Rodrigo.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Boats and chapels</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The ferry takes just under an hour, and proves a lovely way of spying on the super-rich in their shoreside villas. On board, I’m struck by one of those brilliantly weird slogan T-shirts worn by rich foreign children – ‘My best option: play, sleep, travel as much as you can (never stop trying)’. You might be seven, but yours is a wonderful life my friend.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-06-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride 157 Lake Como\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-06-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-06-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-06-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-06-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-06-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-06-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-06-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-06-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-06.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Just one of the many gorgeously sweeping bends en route to the top of the Ghisallo.</figcaption><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Just off the boat in Bellagio we bump into Emanuela’s tour-guiding colleague, and with him is Alberto Elli who, as a professional cycling journalist, I absolutely recognise and know to have worn the yellow jersey for four days in the 2000 Tour de France. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We push our bikes past porticoed shops selling glass swans and ornate chess sets, and remount at the foot of Como’s most famous climb, the Madonna del Ghisallo.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-07-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride 157 Lake Como\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-07-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-07-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-07-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-07-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-07-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-07-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-07-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-07-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-07.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>A climb, a lake and a Vespa.

At 9.4km long and 6% average gradient it might not sound like much, but 1.5km of downhill near the top skews that reality into something much harder, the kind with highs of 15%. I’ve ridden the Ghisallo once before, but I’m amazed at how hard I didn’t remember it being, and how edifying.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-08-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride 157 Lake Como\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-08-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-08-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-08-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-08-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-08-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-08-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-08-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-08.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>The chapel at the top of the Ghisallo, built on the site of a vision of the Virgin.</figcaption><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The road is a beautiful twist up the hillside, at first under trees then breaking free to preside over the lake. The Madonna del Ghisallo <em>chiesa</em> waits at the top, a tiny chapel chock-full of cycling memorabilia. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next to that sits a huge bronze of Fausto Coppi and Gino Bartali duking it out on the climb; and next to that is a bicycle museum. If there is a cycling Mecca, this is it. By the time the chapel’s square tower rises out of the horizon I’m ready to pay as many respects in it as I can, before we scarper across to the museum to worship in its aircon.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-10-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride 157 Lake Como\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-10-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-10-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-10-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-10-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-10-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-10-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-10-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-10-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-10.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>The Muro di Sormano, 17% average and height markers all the way up, just to rub it in.</figcaption><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The Museo del Ghisallo is an immense collection of bikes and memorabilia set up by Italian champion Fiorenzo Magni, he who broke his collarbone in the 1956 Giro only to ride on with an inner tube tied to his bars and gripped in his teeth to steer. It’s the kind of place where a genuine Coppi Bianchi rubs shoulders with a Moser Hour record bike and a pair of Pantani’s bibshorts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On our way round I hear an American with his bored-looking kids say to their tour guide, ‘The guy had 27 tumours on his brain, so at the end of the day I think you’ve gotta give him the benefit of the doubt.’ The guide smiles wryly, weighing up his morals against a possible tip.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Bring on the Wall</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s six blissful kilometres down then a couple more up before we reach the foot of Il Lombardia’s most infamous climb, the Muro di Sormano. At a mere 1.6km, infamous might sound like a misnomer, but the Sormano averages 16.6%, maxes out at 23% and presents a screw-turning 200m at 19% just before the top. <em>Muro</em> translates as ‘wall’.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-11-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride 157 Lake Como\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-11-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-11-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-11-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-11-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-11-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-11-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-11-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-11-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-11.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>The turn-off for the Muro di Sormano, which is a bike-only path.</figcaption><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Its story deserves a short book (you can read about it in issue 131, or online at cyclist.co.uk/sormano if you’re a subscriber), but here’s the condensed version: Il Lombardia’s race director Vincenzo Torriani discovered this climb – back then a donkey track – while holidaying in the Italian lakes, and decided it presented an ideal way to spice up his race. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It did, so much so that it lasted just three editions from 1960 to 1962 – the riders simply refused to ride it. But cycling loves pain, so the Muro returned to Il Lombardia 50 years on, risen anew in pristine, bike-only tarmac and painted in numbers that mark your ascent, metre by cruel vertical metre.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"646\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-12-646x970.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride 157 Lake Como\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-12-646x970.jpg 646w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-12-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-12-768x1153.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-12-1023x1536.jpg 1023w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-12-1364x2048.jpg 1364w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-12-750x1126.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-12-1140x1711.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-12.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>The names of Muro champions, with their winning times.</figcaption><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>A big red arrow proclaiming ‘Muro di Sormano’ points us left and we dutifully leave the main road.

Precisely the kind of feeling that keeps us coming back, over and over again.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-09-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride 157 Lake Como\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-09-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-09-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-09-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-09-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-09-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-09-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-09-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-09-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-09.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Inside the chapel, which is full of cycling memorabilia.

So the legend goes, the Count of Ghisallo was chased to this spot – back in the 11th century a mere shrine – by bandits, whereupon the Virgin appeared and saved him from certain death. That made this spot a very holy site indeed, and a chapel was eventually built, but it wasn’t until cycle-loving Father Ermelindo Vigano took custody of the chapel in the 1940s that its modern-day notoriety began.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a landmark on the annual Giro di Lombardia, as well as a natural pause for anyone making the climb, his chapel had become iconic amongst cyclists, to the point Father Ermelindo felt compelled to lobby the church to recognise it. He dispatched Lombardia favourites and personal friends Fausto Coppi and Gino Bartali with a petition to the Pope to have Madonna del Ghisallo recognised as the patroness of cycling, and this little chapel the ultimate cycling shrine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1949 the Pope said yes, and a flame of commemoration was carried back from Vatican City, which still burns (in electric form) in the middle of the chapel today. Many decades on, all manner of cycling memorabilia has gravitated to this tiny chapel, given by professionals and fans alike as a kind of offering, and displayed on its walls. You’ll see Coppi’s yellow jerseys, club pendants, hundreds of tiny photos of deceased cycling dignitaries and, perhaps most poignant of all, the bike Fabio Casartelli was riding when he died in a crash on the Col de Portet d’Aspet in the 1995 Tour de France.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-18-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Big Ride 157 Lake Como\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-18-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-18-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-18-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-18-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-18-1365x2048.jpg 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-18-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-18-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/big-ride-157-como-18.jpg 1536w\" /><figcaption>Ride over, beers in, it’s all smiles.</figcaption><figcaption>Mike Massaro / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>How we did it</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Travel</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>How cool would it be to get the train to Lake Como? Well, you can. A return costs around £470 (cheaper the further in advance you book), with a typical route involving changes at Paris, Strasbourg and Basel before arriving in Lugano ten and a half hours later. Stay overnight in Lugano, then in the morning take a one-hour bus ride (€10) to Colico on the northeast side of Lake Como (see <a href=\"https://www.rome2rio.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Rome2Rio.com</a> for more info). It’s possible to do all this with a bike, however it’s probably much easier to rent one when you get there. Bike it! Bellagio has a fleet of top-end Bianchis to choose from (<a href=\"https://bikeitbellagio.com/\" target=\"_blank\">bikeitbellagio.com</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Accommodation and food</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We stayed at Locanda Capolago in Colico (<a href=\"https://www.locandacapolago.com/\" target=\"_blank\">locandacapolago.com</a>), a five-minute walk from Colico’s main square and harbourside. Prices start from around £110 for a double, depending on the time of year. We ate at L’Ontano (<a href=\"https://ontano.net/\" target=\"_blank\">ontano.net</a>), reasonably priced and with lots of outdoor seating and lake views, and Pizzeria Il Faro (<a href=\"https://www.ristoranteilfaro.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">ristoranteilfaro.eu</a>), whose staff were wonderfully accommodating of our late arrival. Go to Il Gelato del Vecio for best gelato (say the locals) and Coco Beach for cheap, chilled, lakeside drinks and food.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Thanks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Huge thanks to Silvia Angelini and Camillo Bertolini from travel marketing agency Days Off Outdoor Vision (<a href=\"https://www.daysoffoutdoor.com/\" target=\"_blank\">daysoffoutdoor.com</a>), who organised every detail of our trip right down to the gelato flavours, and local guide Emanuela Vola from Bike it! Bellagio, who treated us to her expert guiding and unbridled levels of enthusiasm, which were much needed for the Muro di Sormano. Finally, <em>grazie mille</em> to the guys at local event organisers Pro Loco Colico, who made us feel incredibly welcome in their town (see <a href=\"https://prolocolario.it/\" target=\"_blank\">prolocolario.it</a> for more details).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>• This article originally appeared in issue 157 of Cyclist magazine. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to </a><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\">subscribe</a></em></strong></p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/venice-italy-cycling\">Big Ride: The Mountain of Venice</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/passo-dello-spluga-cycling\">Big Ride: The Giro’s new star in the Alps</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/stelvio-pass-italy-cycling\">Big Ride: The Stelvio Pass: the world’s most stunning road climb</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/italy-lombardia-como-cycling\">Big Ride: An ode to Lombardia</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"mdonlevy","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"5d7c534b8fa20644cfe3a1ed4404610ba1bf420765abd5d9307bd9b9e8f32adb","category":"Cycling"}
