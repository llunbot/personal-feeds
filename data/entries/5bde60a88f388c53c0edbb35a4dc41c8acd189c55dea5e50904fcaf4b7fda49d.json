It is unclear how widespread the problem is, and other iPhone models do not appear to be affected, including the regular iPhone 16.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOne affected user said the issue has persisted even after updating the iPhone 16e to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/11/apple-releases-ios-18-3-2/\">iOS 18.3.2</a>, released earlier this week. It is unclear if the issue is or will be resolved in iOS 18.4, which is currently in beta and will be released in April.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSome affected users said the issue appears to arise when the iPhone 16e is connected to multiple Bluetooth accessories simultaneously.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGiven that some of the affected users have contacted Apple's support representatives about this issue, hopefully the company is aware of the problem and working on a fix, which should arrive in a future software update.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/\">iPhone 16e</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16e\">iPhone 16e (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/13/iphone-16e-bluetooth-audio-problem/\">iPhone 16e Has a Bluetooth Audio Problem</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-16e-has-a-bluetooth-audio-problem.2453051/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5bde60a88f388c53c0edbb35a4dc41c8acd189c55dea5e50904fcaf4b7fda49d","category":"Apple"}
