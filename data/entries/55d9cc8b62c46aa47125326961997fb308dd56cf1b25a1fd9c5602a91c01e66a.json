Intel said in a statement to <a href=\"https://zdnet.co.kr/view/?no=20240408160200\">ZDNet Korea</a> (via <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/9/24125036/intel-game-crash-13900k-14900k-fortnite-unreal-engine-investigation\">The Verge</a>) that it's looking into the problems, escalating it from an \"isolated issue\" to something that may be more widespread and could require a more systemic fix.</p>\n\n<p>Related CPUs like the i9-13900KF, i9-14900KF, i9-13900KS, and i9-14900KS may be affected, too, since they're all the same basic silicon. Some user reports have also indicated that the i7-13700K and i7-14700K series may also be affected.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015702#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2015702&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"55d9cc8b62c46aa47125326961997fb308dd56cf1b25a1fd9c5602a91c01e66a","category":"Tech"}
