They say about 12.7 million tons of marine debris is formed annually, and about 640,000 tons of that comes from fishing gear. Called “ghost fishing gear”, it can damage reefs, kill sealife, and generally pollute.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/maxxis-seawaste-x-recycled-fishing-nets-tire-casings-02.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/maxxis-seawaste-x-recycled-fishing-nets-tire-casings-02-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"nylon pellets made from seawastex recycling fishing nets\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/maxxis-seawaste-x-recycled-fishing-nets-tire-casings-02-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/maxxis-seawaste-x-recycled-fishing-nets-tire-casings-02-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/maxxis-seawaste-x-recycled-fishing-nets-tire-casings-02-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/maxxis-seawaste-x-recycled-fishing-nets-tire-casings-02-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/maxxis-seawaste-x-recycled-fishing-nets-tire-casings-02-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/maxxis-seawaste-x-recycled-fishing-nets-tire-casings-02.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The plastic nets are collected and cleaned, then turned into fresh nylon plastic pellets. Seawastex says their process, performed with Formosa Chemical &amp; Fibre Corporation, creates a product with the same tensile strength, impact resistance, and weather resistance as virgin material. They provide recycling collection methods to help prevent the waste from getting left in the ocean in the first place, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/maxxis-seawaste-x-recycled-fishing-nets-tire-casings-03.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/maxxis-seawaste-x-recycled-fishing-nets-tire-casings-03-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"nylon thread made from seawastex recycling fishing nets\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/maxxis-seawaste-x-recycled-fishing-nets-tire-casings-03-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/maxxis-seawaste-x-recycled-fishing-nets-tire-casings-03-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/maxxis-seawaste-x-recycled-fishing-nets-tire-casings-03-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/maxxis-seawaste-x-recycled-fishing-nets-tire-casings-03-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/maxxis-seawaste-x-recycled-fishing-nets-tire-casings-03-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/maxxis-seawaste-x-recycled-fishing-nets-tire-casings-03.jpg 1600w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Those are melted and extruded into yarn, which is then woven into the casings. Effectively, it should work just like virgin nylon, but Maxxis is doing long-term testing to ensure the performance characteristics are the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/maxxis-seawaste-x-recycled-fishing-nets-tire-casings-04.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/maxxis-seawaste-x-recycled-fishing-nets-tire-casings-04-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"maxxis green eco tires with seawastex recycled nylon casing made from fishing nets\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/maxxis-seawaste-x-recycled-fishing-nets-tire-casings-04-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/maxxis-seawaste-x-recycled-fishing-nets-tire-casings-04-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/maxxis-seawaste-x-recycled-fishing-nets-tire-casings-04-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/maxxis-seawaste-x-recycled-fishing-nets-tire-casings-04-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/maxxis-seawaste-x-recycled-fishing-nets-tire-casings-04-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/maxxis-seawaste-x-recycled-fishing-nets-tire-casings-04.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, the casing is laid up with other materials to form the tire’s carcass before being heat molded into shape, forming the tread patterns and bonding everything together to create a ride-able tire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.maxxis.com\" target=\"_blank\">Maxxis.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/maxxis-adding-eco-friendly-tire-casings-from-seawastex-recycled-fishing-nets/\">Maxxis adding eco-friendly tire casings from Seawastex recycled fishing nets</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"28448877d9a7770134494f0cc34c2f19cf654c3b8e0b504fefa372011415c2a8","category":"Cycling"}
