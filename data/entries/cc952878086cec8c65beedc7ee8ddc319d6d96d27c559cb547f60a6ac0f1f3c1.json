White Industries actually makes both hubs, as Astral is now a sister brand since the component manufacturer <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/white-industries-buys-rolf-prima-astral-combining-rim-hub-wheel-brands/\" target=\"_blank\">acquired both Astral and Rolf Prima</a> earlier this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astral-luna-carbon-all-road-wheels-4.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1609\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astral-luna-carbon-all-road-wheels-4.jpg\" alt=\"astral luna carbon all-road wheels\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astral-luna-carbon-all-road-wheels-4.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astral-luna-carbon-all-road-wheels-4-297x239.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astral-luna-carbon-all-road-wheels-4-800x644.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astral-luna-carbon-all-road-wheels-4-120x97.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astral-luna-carbon-all-road-wheels-4-768x618.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astral-luna-carbon-all-road-wheels-4-1536x1236.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The rims measure 25mm internal, 31mm external, and 40mm deep, and weigh 420g each. Built with their Approach hubs, claimed wheelset weight is 1600g with Sapim CX Speed bladed spokes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CLD hub-equipped wheels come in at 1520g (695g/825g) with Sapim CX Ray bladed spokes. The key differences between hubs are the CLD’s titanium freehub body (versus heat treated steel) and a bit more machining on the hub shell. Internals are the same on both, including the Enduro steel bearings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both can with 12/15mm thru axle front, 12mm thru axle rear, and 9mm quick release versions. And, because the CLD hub comes in boost sizes, too, those wheels are available with standard and boost widths.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astral-luna-carbon-all-road-wheels-6.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1963\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astral-luna-carbon-all-road-wheels-6.jpg\" alt=\"astral luna carbon all-road wheels shown on a bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astral-luna-carbon-all-road-wheels-6.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astral-luna-carbon-all-road-wheels-6-275x300.jpg 275w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astral-luna-carbon-all-road-wheels-6-800x872.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astral-luna-carbon-all-road-wheels-6-110x120.jpg 110w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astral-luna-carbon-all-road-wheels-6-768x838.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astral-luna-carbon-all-road-wheels-6-1408x1536.jpg 1408w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Lunas only come in 700c sizes, designed to fit tires from 28mm up to 50mm wide.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astral-luna-carbon-all-road-wheels-3.jpg\"><img width=\"1820\" height=\"876\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astral-luna-carbon-all-road-wheels-3.jpg\" alt=\"astral luna carbon all-road wheels\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astral-luna-carbon-all-road-wheels-3.jpg 1820w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astral-luna-carbon-all-road-wheels-3-297x143.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astral-luna-carbon-all-road-wheels-3-800x385.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astral-luna-carbon-all-road-wheels-3-120x58.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astral-luna-carbon-all-road-wheels-3-768x370.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astral-luna-carbon-all-road-wheels-3-1536x739.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That tire allowance lets you run them for anything from road to gravel. At just 24 spokes per wheel, they look like a great option for both, but Astral told us they’d be awesome for smooth gravel and dirt roads, but might be a little stiff for really rough terrain or singletrack.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astral-luna-carbon-all-road-wheels-7.jpg\"><img width=\"1820\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astral-luna-carbon-all-road-wheels-7.jpg\" alt=\"astral luna carbon all-road wheels\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astral-luna-carbon-all-road-wheels-7.jpg 1820w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astral-luna-carbon-all-road-wheels-7-297x184.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astral-luna-carbon-all-road-wheels-7-800x495.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astral-luna-carbon-all-road-wheels-7-120x74.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astral-luna-carbon-all-road-wheels-7-768x475.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/astral-luna-carbon-all-road-wheels-7-1536x949.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They’re available with your choice of XDR, HG, or Microspline freehub bodies for both, with Campy’s standard and N3W versions on the CLD builds.
