The comments came just days after TikTok <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/19/tiktok-is-working-again/\">briefly went offline</a> in the United States following Supreme Court action.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe social media platform, which boasts 170 million American users, temporarily shut down for about 12 hours on Saturday after the Supreme Court upheld <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/17/tiktok-january-19-ban-imminent/\">legislation</a> requiring Chinese company ByteDance to divest its US TikTok operations. Trump subsequently issued an executive order providing a 75-day pause on the ban's enforcement.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDuring the White House event, where Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison was also present, Trump floated the idea of a 50-50 ownership split between any acquiring company and the U.S. government. \"They'll have something that's actually more valuable because they have the ultimate partner,\" Trump explained.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTrump specifically mentioned both Musk and Ellison as potential buyers during the event. Oracle already plays a significant role in TikTok's operations, hosting most of the platform's servers.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTrump originally <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/15/tiktok-90-days/\">supported banning</a> the short-form video app over national security concerns, but his thinking has U-turned since winning the US presidential election for a second time. \"We won the young vote. I think I won it through TikTok,\" Trump told reporters. \"So I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok.\"<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tiktok/\">TikTok</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/22/trump-backs-elon-musk-possible-tiktok-buyer/\">Trump Backs Elon Musk as Possible TikTok Buyer</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/trump-backs-elon-musk-as-possible-tiktok-buyer.2447885/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c24e44914b06c6a8f614844f164d350f227809bb6b11e0d45afd7df8197a82ba","category":"Apple"}
