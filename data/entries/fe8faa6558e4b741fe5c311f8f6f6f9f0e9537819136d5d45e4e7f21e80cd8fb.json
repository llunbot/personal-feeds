Support for Windows has been a top-requested feature for quite some time, primarily from Apple users who have the need to use Windows for work, software availability, or other reasons, so Flexibits has spent the past three years building Fantastical for Windows from the ground up for a fully native experience.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/10/fantastical-windows.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nWhile Apple's Calendar app has improved significantly in recent years, multi-award-winning Fantastical has remained popular as a third-party option due to its support for natural language parsing, the ability to manage tasks and reminders from Google Tasks, Microsoft 365, and Todoist, scheduling features like Openings that let you open up calendar time slots for others to book and Proposals that let organizers poll potential attendees to determine the best time for an event, glanceable weather information tied to event location, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div></div>\r<br />\nFantastical for Windows arrives as part of Fantastical 4.0, which is available for free with limited features across Windows, Mac, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a>.
