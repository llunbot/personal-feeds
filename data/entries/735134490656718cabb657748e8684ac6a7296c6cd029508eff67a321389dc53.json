The top platform accepts any MIK-compatible accessory, from baskets to bags, rated for loads up to 16 kg (so, probably no kid’s seats). Or click or strap pannier bags to the sides, or mount all those things for bigger trips.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SKS-infinity-universal-rear-bike-rack-mik-compatible-03.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SKS-infinity-universal-rear-bike-rack-mik-compatible-03-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"SKS infinity universal rear rack with MIK-compatible accessories shown on display\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SKS-infinity-universal-rear-bike-rack-mik-compatible-03-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SKS-infinity-universal-rear-bike-rack-mik-compatible-03-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SKS-infinity-universal-rear-bike-rack-mik-compatible-03-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SKS-infinity-universal-rear-bike-rack-mik-compatible-03-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SKS-infinity-universal-rear-bike-rack-mik-compatible-03-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SKS-infinity-universal-rear-bike-rack-mik-compatible-03.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>SKS will offer its own accessories to outfit it too, including fender sets for both gravel- and MTB-size tires and frames, a tail light that straps into the rear but includes an adapter to strap around your seatpost when the rack’s not in use, and a water-resistant bag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Infinity Universal rack runs €110 and is available now.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SKS-rennkompressor-nxt-classic-floorpump-with-digital-gauge-01.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"845\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SKS-rennkompressor-nxt-classic-floorpump-with-digital-gauge-01-800x845.jpg\" alt=\"new SKS Rennkompressor NXT floor pump with folding legs and digital gauge\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SKS-rennkompressor-nxt-classic-floorpump-with-digital-gauge-01-800x845.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SKS-rennkompressor-nxt-classic-floorpump-with-digital-gauge-01-284x300.jpg 284w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SKS-rennkompressor-nxt-classic-floorpump-with-digital-gauge-01-114x120.jpg 114w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SKS-rennkompressor-nxt-classic-floorpump-with-digital-gauge-01-768x811.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SKS-rennkompressor-nxt-classic-floorpump-with-digital-gauge-01-1454x1536.jpg 1454w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SKS-rennkompressor-nxt-classic-floorpump-with-digital-gauge-01.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The SKS Rennkompressor claims to be the world’s first floor pump, saving cyclists from having to use a hand pump every time they inflate their tires. It’s remained largely unchanged save for updated materials over its decades in existence, but now it gets a digital counterpart.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SKS-rennkompressor-nxt-classic-floorpump-with-digital-gauge-02.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SKS-rennkompressor-nxt-classic-floorpump-with-digital-gauge-02-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"New SKS Rennkompressor NXT floor pump with folding legs and digital gauge\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SKS-rennkompressor-nxt-classic-floorpump-with-digital-gauge-02-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SKS-rennkompressor-nxt-classic-floorpump-with-digital-gauge-02-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SKS-rennkompressor-nxt-classic-floorpump-with-digital-gauge-02-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SKS-rennkompressor-nxt-classic-floorpump-with-digital-gauge-02-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SKS-rennkompressor-nxt-classic-floorpump-with-digital-gauge-02-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SKS-rennkompressor-nxt-classic-floorpump-with-digital-gauge-02.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The SKS Rennkompressor NXT gets a large digital gauge that switches between psi and bar. A tall shaft and long hose with separate Presta and Schrader ports and a big lock lever make it easy to pump tires with a bike in the workstand or on a car rack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also gets two feet with rubberized pads, which fold up against the pump. The beechwood handle can be quickly threaded off too, making it more travel friendly. A non-digital version with a standard analog gauge is also available, and both pump up to 230 psi (16 bar). MSRP from €100-110, available in Q2 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SKS-AirSpy-bicycle-tire-pressure-monitor-01.jpg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SKS-AirSpy-bicycle-tire-pressure-monitor-01-800x600.jpg\" alt=\"SKS AirSpy wireless digital tire pressure monitor for tubeless bicycle tires\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SKS-AirSpy-bicycle-tire-pressure-monitor-01-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SKS-AirSpy-bicycle-tire-pressure-monitor-01-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SKS-AirSpy-bicycle-tire-pressure-monitor-01-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SKS-AirSpy-bicycle-tire-pressure-monitor-01-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SKS-AirSpy-bicycle-tire-pressure-monitor-01-1536x1153.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/SKS-AirSpy-bicycle-tire-pressure-monitor-01.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new SKS AirSpy TL (on right) is a new tubeless compatible version of its wireless tire pressure monitor and has a wide range of valve stem heights to fit more of the high-performance wheelsets for road, gravel, MTB, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It pairs via Bluetooth with its app to show you real-time tire pressure on either its app or Garmin cycling computers, so you can monitor as you ride (possibly confirming that nagging feeling that you’re slowly losing air). It can measure up to 120 psi (8.3 bar)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sold as a set for under $100, valve lengths are 60/67/74/81 mm, and they’re as light as 17 g.
