No fewer than 4,519 incidents have been reported of the cranksets separating in the US alone.</p>\n<p>We’ve now learnt <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/shimano-crankset-recall/\">2.8 million cranksets are covered globally</a>, affecting the brand’s Ultegra 6800/R8000 and Dura-Ace 9000, R9100 and R9100-P models. Is simply inspecting them and not replacing them until they show signs of damage enough?</p>\n<p>Outside of crankgate, we were treated to managing editor Gary Walker’s review of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/accessories/sony-linkbuds-wireless-headphones-review/\">Sony LinkBuds wireless headphones</a>. The former music journalist came away very impressed by their light weight and clear sound, while facilitating safe cycling.</p>\n<p>In a complete 180 from banging beats, digital writer Jack Evans took one for the team and sampled a cocktail of the latest <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-energy-drinks-for-cycling/\">energy drinks</a>, picking out his top choices he thinks you should spend your hard-earned cash on.</p>\n<p>Jack’s stomach must be made of hardy stuff, because he’s also recently partaken in a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/nutrition/sodium-bicarbonate-cycling/\">sodium bicarbonate trial</a>, and didn’t suffer any after-effects.</p>\n<p>A new <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2024-liv-devote/\">Liv Devote</a> was unveiled this week, a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-womens-road-bikes/\">women’s gravel bike</a> with integrated down-tube storage and a flip chip at the dropout to alter the now-racier geometry.</p>\n<p>Finally, senior technical editor Ashley Quinlan brought us news and some first impressions of the new <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/specialized-creo-2/\">Specialized Creo 2</a>. The bike has shifted further into the gravel genre, with clearance for 57mm/2.2in <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-tyres/\">gravel bike tyres</a> and inherits the Future Shock 3.0, which debuted on the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/road-bikes/specialized-s-works-roubaix-sl8-first-ride-review/\">Roubaix SL8</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>POC Elicit Ti glasses</h2>\n<ul>\n    <li>\n    </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Oscar Huckle modelling POC Elicit Ti glasses\" title=\"Oscar Huckle modelling POC Elicit Ti glasses\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> You’ll be sure to make a statement if you rock up to a club ride with these sunnies.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>POC’s Elicit Ti is a 3D-printed titanium version of its frameless Elicit sunglasses that are its lightest shades yet by a whole gram (yes, you read that correctly).</p>\n<p>Weighing in at a feathery 22g, the Sweden-manufactured, non-folding <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/\">cycling glasses</a> are constructed from recovered medical-grade titanium – or in plainer speak, waste generated in making surgical tools.</p>\n<p>The brand says it wanted to combine “sustainable thinking with a strong focus on performance”.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"POC Elicit Ti sunglasses behind held by a cyclists' hand\" title=\"POC Elicit Ti sunglasses behind held by a cyclists' hand\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The arms are made from recovered medical-grade titanium.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>POC says the titanium starts as a large powder block and after the temples are solidified, the rest is blown away and reformulated into another block that can be used again. The open lattice-like design of the temples is claimed to promote rigidity and reduce weight over what POC calls the ‘Grilamid plastic’ used on the standard Elicits.</p>\n<p>Outside of the titanium trinkets, you won’t find too many differences from the Elicits. The Elicit Tis come with a Violet Silver Mirror lens, as well as a spare clear option in the box.</p>\n<p>The large, frameless lenses are curved to enhance coverage and two sizes of nosepiece are provided to customise fit. The lens is treated with POC’s RiPel coating, which is claimed to protect them from dirt, water, sweat and other contaminants, as well as an anti-scratch treatment.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"POC Elicit Ti glasses on a set of weighing scales\" title=\"POC Elicit Ti glasses on a set of weighing scales\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> True to POC’s word, the glasses weigh 22g on our Scales of Truth.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Our Media </i></span></div>\n<p>The Elicit Tis are a rather decadent purchase, retailing for £130 more than the standard Elicits.

The brand has recently branched out into mountain biking and has sent us three options that encompass all seasons.</p>\n<p>Bridgedale says it wanted its range of foot-specific socks to provide suitable levels of warmth, a precise fit, reduce underfoot vibration and protect the ankle and Achilles tendon.</p>\n<p>Do they deliver? These socks are destined for senior technical editor Tom Marvin’s tootsies, who will no doubt put them through their paces in the autumnal and winter slop.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bridgedale MTB Winter Weight T2 socks –</strong> £25</li>\n<li><strong>Bridgedale MTB Mid-Season Weight T2 socks –</strong> £24</li>\n<li><strong>Bridgedale MTB Summer Weight T2 socks –</strong> £21</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>","author":"Oscar Huckle","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"bd5c0a7bb51a40dce4700022fa03f983929f93f60eea64380e3654f77a4fec30","category":"Cycling"}
