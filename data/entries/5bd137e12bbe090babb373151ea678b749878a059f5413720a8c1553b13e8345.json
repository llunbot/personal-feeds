That identifier is used by both the A18 and A18 Pro chips, and given the iPhone SE is a lower-end device, it is very likely that the device will be equipped with the A18 chip out of those two options.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/11/iPhone-SE-4-Single-Camera-Thumb.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThe account also said the next iPad Air models <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/20/new-ipad-air-models-with-m3-chip-leak/\">will have an M3 chip</a>, and that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/22/ipad-11-with-a16-chip-identifier-leak/\">iPad 11 will have an A16 chip</a> instead of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/12/ipad-11-rumored-specs/\">previously-rumored A17 Pro chip</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe account has a good track record of sharing iOS-related information, but it has had some occasional misses.

Rumored features for the device include a 6.1-inch OLED display, Face ID, a USB-C port, a single 48-megapixel rear camera, and the first Apple-designed 5G modem. With the A18 chip, and a rumored 8GB of RAM, the device is also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/01/new-iphone-se-and-ipad-air-early-2025-rumor/\">expected to support Apple Intelligence</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe current iPhone SE looks similar to the iPhone 8, with outdated features such as a Touch ID button, Lightning port, and thick bezels around the display. The current iPhone SE has an A15 Bionic chip, so the A18 would be a significant upgrade. Pricing starts at $429, but at least a slight price increase seems probable for the next model.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE\">iPhone SE (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/22/iphone-se-4-a18-chip-identifier-leak/\">iPhone SE 4 Again Rumored to Feature A18 Chip</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-se-4-again-rumored-to-feature-a18-chip.2447908/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5bd137e12bbe090babb373151ea678b749878a059f5413720a8c1553b13e8345","category":"Apple"}
