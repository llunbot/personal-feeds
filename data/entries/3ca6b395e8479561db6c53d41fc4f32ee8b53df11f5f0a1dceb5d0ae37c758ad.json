Now, six years later, it turns out that's a lot of work. <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/long-term-support-for-linux-kernel-to-be-cut-as-maintainence-remains-under-strain/\">ZDNet</a> reports that at the Open Source Summit Europe this week (videos will be out in a few weeks), <a href=\"https://lwn.net/\">Linux Weekly News</a> executive editor Jonathan Corbet announced the Linux kernel will return to two years of LTS support.</p>\n<p>The plan to cut back down to two years isn't instant. The Linux community is still honoring the <a href=\"https://www.kernel.org/category/releases.html\">current end-of-life timelines</a>, so 6.1, 5.15, 5.10, 5.4, 4.19, and 4.14 are still six years, but new kernels will only get two years. Even this six-year window was supposed to be an optional thing when it started, with the release page FAQ saying, \"Each new longterm kernel usually starts with only a 2-year projected EOL that can be extended further if there is enough interest from the industry at large to help support it for a longer period of time.\" The reality was that everything received a six-year life span, and now that will no longer be the case.</p>\n<p>Corbet cited a mix of lack of use and a lack of support as the reasons Linux is cutting back on LTS kernels. Corbet says, \"There's really no point to maintaining [old kernels] for that long because people are not using them.\" The other big problem is the burnout from maintainers, which are often unpaid and could use a lot more support from the billion-dollar companies that benefit from using Linux.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1969634#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1969634&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3ca6b395e8479561db6c53d41fc4f32ee8b53df11f5f0a1dceb5d0ae37c758ad","category":"Tech"}
