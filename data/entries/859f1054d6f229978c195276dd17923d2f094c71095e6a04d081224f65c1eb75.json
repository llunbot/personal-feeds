The software update should be widely released in September, and it is compatible with the iPhone XS and newer.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBelow, we outline everything new in the Messages app on iOS 18, including some smaller changes that Apple's website does not mention.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Schedule Messages</h2>\r<br />\niMessages can now be scheduled to be sent at a later date and time in both individual and group conversations. As of the first iOS 18 beta, you can schedule a message to be sent up to 14 days later. After scheduling a message, it becomes visible to you in a dotted-line bubble, with edit, delete, and reschedule options.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iMessage-Send-Later-iOS-18.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nTo access this feature, tap the plus sign to the left of the text field, tap More, and tap Send Later.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Tapback Changes</h2>\r<br />\n<h3>Redesigned Tapbacks</h3>\r<br />\nThe classic set of Tapback icons are now colorful, including the heart, thumbs up, thumbs down, HA HA, exclamation marks, and question mark.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iMessage-iOS-18-2.jpeg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\n<h3>Emoji Tapbacks</h3>\r<br />\nYou can now use any emoji or sticker as a Tapback.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/06/iMessage-iOS-18-4.jpeg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\n<h3>Improved Visibility</h3>\r<br />\nIt is now easier to view multiple Tapback reactions on a single message.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Text Formatting and Effects</h2>\r<br />\nBold, italics, underline, and strikeout formatting is finally available for iMessages.
