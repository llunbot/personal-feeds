Both front and rear have a modern 30mm internal rim width, but a shallow 22mm depth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weight savings come from using UD carbon fiber spokes that weigh just 2.7g each, but Hunt says they’re 30% stronger than a comparable steel spoke, which allowed them to reduce the spoke count to just 20 in the front and 24 in the rear. Front wheel weight is just 552g, rear is 702g with XD Driver Body.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hunt-proven-race-XC-UD-carbon-spoke-MTB-wheels-1.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1201\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hunt-proven-race-XC-UD-carbon-spoke-MTB-wheels-1.jpg\" alt=\"hunt proven carbon race XC UD wheels\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hunt-proven-race-XC-UD-carbon-spoke-MTB-wheels-1.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hunt-proven-race-XC-UD-carbon-spoke-MTB-wheels-1-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hunt-proven-race-XC-UD-carbon-spoke-MTB-wheels-1-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hunt-proven-race-XC-UD-carbon-spoke-MTB-wheels-1-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hunt-proven-race-XC-UD-carbon-spoke-MTB-wheels-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hunt-proven-race-XC-UD-carbon-spoke-MTB-wheels-1-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hunt-proven-race-XC-UD-carbon-spoke-MTB-wheels-1-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet they’re user friendly, using the same replaceable, true-able design as standard spokes thanks to a “Taperlock” design that places an alloy sleeve around the hub end and a threaded steel mandrel at the rim’s end that has a square shape so you can hold it in place (preventing rotation) while truing it like normal with standard nipples.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The front rim is tuned for compliance and traction, while the rear is a bit stiffer for better impact durability and responsive acceleration. There’s a 21g difference between rims thanks to those different layups.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hunt-proven-race-XC-UD-carbon-spoke-MTB-wheels-4.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2030\" height=\"849\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hunt-proven-race-XC-UD-carbon-spoke-MTB-wheels-4.jpg\" alt=\"hunt proven carbon race XC UD wheels with quick engagement hubs\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hunt-proven-race-XC-UD-carbon-spoke-MTB-wheels-4.jpg 2030w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hunt-proven-race-XC-UD-carbon-spoke-MTB-wheels-4-297x124.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hunt-proven-race-XC-UD-carbon-spoke-MTB-wheels-4-800x335.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hunt-proven-race-XC-UD-carbon-spoke-MTB-wheels-4-120x50.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hunt-proven-race-XC-UD-carbon-spoke-MTB-wheels-4-768x321.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hunt-proven-race-XC-UD-carbon-spoke-MTB-wheels-4-1536x642.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new S_RapidEngage hubs have a snappy 2-degree engagement angle, and with 30% less “stretch” from the carbon spokes, they say the wheels accelerate very quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hunt-proven-race-XC-UD-carbon-spoke-MTB-wheels-action-randr.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hunt-proven-race-XC-UD-carbon-spoke-MTB-wheels-action-randr-800x534.jpg\" alt=\"hunt proven carbon race XC UD wheels being raced at World Cup event\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hunt-proven-race-XC-UD-carbon-spoke-MTB-wheels-action-randr-800x534.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hunt-proven-race-XC-UD-carbon-spoke-MTB-wheels-action-randr-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hunt-proven-race-XC-UD-carbon-spoke-MTB-wheels-action-randr-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hunt-proven-race-XC-UD-carbon-spoke-MTB-wheels-action-randr-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hunt-proven-race-XC-UD-carbon-spoke-MTB-wheels-action-randr-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hunt-proven-race-XC-UD-carbon-spoke-MTB-wheels-action-randr-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/hunt-proven-race-XC-UD-carbon-spoke-MTB-wheels-action-randr.jpg 1800w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They’ve been racing them in prototype form on the UCI World Cup circuit for two full seasons, garnering a podium spot and proving the lightweight design was up to the task.
