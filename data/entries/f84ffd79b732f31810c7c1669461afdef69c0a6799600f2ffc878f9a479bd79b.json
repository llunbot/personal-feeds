{"title":"E.U. Regulators Are at It Again","link":"https://www.sueddeutsche.de/wirtschaft/eu-apple-google-amazon-apple-1.5471370","date":1637719771000,"content":"\n<p>Von Björn Finke, reporting for Süddeutsche Leitung (original in German; I’m quoting here from Safari 15’s translation to English):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For example, these powerful companies must no longer prefer their\nown services in search results, as Google did in the 2.4 billion\ncase. You may also not collect business data from independent\nmerchants on the platform and use it for your own offers, as\nAmazon is accused of. And they must allow mobile phone users to\ninstall other app stores and thus get more choice in mobile phone\nprograms. This will hurt Apple a lot. In the event of violations,\nthe Commission can intervene directly in the future without having\nto prove market power and harmful consequences in long\ninvestigations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Misguided, to say the least.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Parliament expanded the list of platforms to be viewed and\nincludes, for example, Internet-enabled TVs or voice assistants\nsuch as Alexa. On the other hand, MEPs increased the thresholds\nfor sales to eight billion euros and the market value to 80\nbillion euros. This means that only Booking.com should be able to\nfall under the law from Europe for the foreseeable future. MEP\nSchwab argues that it is better for the Commission to focus on the\nreally large companies in the implementation and control of the\nlegal act. Critics warn, however, that the US government could\nconsider it an unfriendly act if the groundbreaking law hits\nalmost only American companies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>European regulations that are targeted, almost exclusively, at U.S. companies. You think that might be perceived here as “unfriendly”? <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-dma-zalando-silicon-valley-european-tech-vestager/\">You don’t say</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Another important addition to the Commission draft is that\nParliament wants to force gatekeepers to allow exchanges between\nrival messenger services and social media. Then, for example, a\nuser could send a message from WhatsApp to the competitor Signal — this opening should also stimulate competition.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This nugget is under a sub-head that was translated to “Send a message from WhatsApp to Signal? No problem”. No problem at all. Probably will only take a few lines of code to get all the world’s messaging systems — including those using end-to-end encryption like Signal and WhatsApp (and iMessage) — talking to each other.</p>\n\n<p>They should do another draft that mandates the invention of personal jet packs and flying cars, too.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/11/23/eu-regulators-at-it-again\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f84ffd79b732f31810c7c1669461afdef69c0a6799600f2ffc878f9a479bd79b","category":"Tech"}
