It was previously thought that lightning might have supercharged the formation of amino acids. However, Kensei Kobayashi of Yokohama National University in Japan, along with astrophysicist Vladimir Airapetian of NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center and a team of researchers from both institutions, have found another possibility: The young Sun’s superflares probably helped give rise to the stuff of life.</span></p>\n<p><span>“[Galactic cosmic rays] and [solar energetic particle] events from the young Sun represent the most effective energy sources for the prebiotic formation of biologically important organic compounds,” the researchers said in a study recently published in </span><a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2075-1729/13/5/1103\"><span>Life</span></a><i><span>. </span></i></p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1940978#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1940978&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"05d67fdc38d8011ede370008c07b686e16b1a42b9f3a182fd504e36d9484c6f2","category":"Tech"}
