In a plea agreement, Kramer said he published an app on GitHub for creating AI-generated art. The program contained malicious code that gave access to computers that installed it. Kramer operated using the moniker NullBulge.</p>\n<h2>Not the ComfyUI youâ€™re looking for</h2>\n<p>According to researchers at <a href=\"https://www.vpnmentor.com/news/comfyui-malicious-custom-node/\">VPNMentor</a>, the program Kramer used was ComfyUI_LLMVISION, which purported to be an extension for the legitimate <a href=\"https://comfy.icu/\">ComfyUI</a> image generator and had functions added to it for copying passwords, payment card data, and other sensitive information from machines that installed it. The fake extension then sent the data to a Discord server that Kramer operated. To better disguise the malicious code, it was folded into files that used the names OpenAI and Anthropic.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/man-pleads-guilty-to-using-malicious-ai-software-to-hack-disney-employee/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/man-pleads-guilty-to-using-malicious-ai-software-to-hack-disney-employee/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d1b716a203e6d08ed9c480d0aa0bcf71ee8dc2af27fdbdf814649b9aad297ab2","category":"Tech"}
