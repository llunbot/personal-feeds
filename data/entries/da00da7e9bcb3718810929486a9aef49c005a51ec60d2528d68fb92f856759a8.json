When private sync is used, all data stays securely encrypted throughout the syncing process, since the unique key needed to decrypt it is stored only on the devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBackup &amp; Sync also enables users to migrate bookmarks and passwords to a new device, and sync their Email Protection account between devices. (DuckDuckGo Email Protection is a free email forwarding service that removes hidden email trackers and lets users create unique private email addresses on the fly.)\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to DuckDuckGo, the new feature works across most Windows, Mac, Android, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> devices, and can be found in the browser's Settings (Sync &amp; Backup ‚ûù Sync With Another Device). Those only working with one device can choose Sync and Back Up This Device from the Single-Device Setup section. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/duckduckgo.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nAfter setup, the browser generates a Recovery PDF document that contains the user's unique, locally generated Recovery Code, which can be used to gain access to synced data if the associated devices are lost or damaged.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDuckDuckGo's browser offers more than a dozen privacy protections, including ad tracker blocking and cookie pop-up removal. It is available for <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/duckduckgo-private-browser/id663592361?platform=iphone\">iOS devices on the App Store</a> and for Mac on the <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/duckduckgo-private-browser/id663592361\">Mac App Store</a> and <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/mac\">DuckDuckGo website</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/duckduckgo/\">DuckDuckGo</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/15/duckduckgo-browser-password-sync/\">DuckDuckGo Browser Gets Encrypted Bookmark and Password Syncing</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/duckduckgo-browser-gets-encrypted-bookmark-and-password-syncing.2419502/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"da00da7e9bcb3718810929486a9aef49c005a51ec60d2528d68fb92f856759a8","category":"Apple"}
