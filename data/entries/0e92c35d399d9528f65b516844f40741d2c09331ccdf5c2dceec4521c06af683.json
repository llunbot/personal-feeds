Replies on the kernel mailing list asked about this \"very vague\" patch.

Employees of companies on the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (<a href=\"https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/\">OFAC SDN</a>), or connected to them, will have their collaborations \"subject to restrictions,\" and \"cannot be in the MAINTAINERS file.\" \"Sufficient documentation\" would mean evidence that someone does not work for an OFAC SDN entity, Bottomley wrote.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/10/russian-coders-removed-from-linux-maintainers-list-due-to-sanction-concerns/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/10/russian-coders-removed-from-linux-maintainers-list-due-to-sanction-concerns/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0e92c35d399d9528f65b516844f40741d2c09331ccdf5c2dceec4521c06af683","category":"Tech"}
