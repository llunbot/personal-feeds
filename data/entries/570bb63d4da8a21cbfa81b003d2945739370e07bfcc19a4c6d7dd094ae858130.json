Late last year, Microsoft <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/microsoft-discontinues-lackadaisically-updated-surface-studio-all-in-one-desktop/\">discontinued the Surface Studio all-in-one desktop</a>, which was never updated consistently and started at a whopping $4,300. But it provided one of the few alternatives to the basic \"monitor with a computer inside it\" all-in-one design template. Now, The Verge <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/667664/surface-laptop-studio-2-end-of-life-notepad\">reports</a> that Microsoft stopped manufacturing the Surface Laptop Studio 2 earlier this month and that the PC will disappear after current retail stock is sold.</p>\n<p>Microsoft reportedly plans to officially announce the end-of-life status of the Laptop Studio 2 in June. The company will support the Laptop Studio with driver and firmware updates as necessary through at least October of 2029, in accordance with <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/surface-driver-firmware-lifecycle-support\">its six-year support lifecycle</a> for Surface hardware.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/report-microsofts-experimental-laptop-studio-is-vanishing-without-a-replacement/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/report-microsofts-experimental-laptop-studio-is-vanishing-without-a-replacement/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"570bb63d4da8a21cbfa81b003d2945739370e07bfcc19a4c6d7dd094ae858130","category":"Tech"}
