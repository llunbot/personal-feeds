You have to arrange flights, figure out whether to transport or hire a bike and what hoops you need to jump through either way, book accommodation… the list goes on. But what about a cycling trip abroad that takes you out and back in a single day, ending with you home in your own bed, basking in the memories of an epic ride on foreign roads?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sound too good to be true? Well, in the May 2024 issue of Cyclist we prove you wrong, as we get into the spirit of the spring Classics with a one-day pilgrimage to the cobbles of Flanders, ticking off some of the region’s most famous climbs and rubbing shoulders with WorldTour pros before heading back to the UK, all in a single day. Read all about it in this issue’s Big Ride.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pro-log-tadej-pogacar-catalunya\">Pro Log: Is there anything Tadej Pogačar can’t do?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/aston-martin-j-laverack-road-bike\">Aston Martin and J.Laverack collaborate on ‘visually boltless’ road bike</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-classics-monuments-cobbles\">Cycling spring Classics 2024: Race dates, Monuments, cobbles and live TV guide</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>Speaking of the WorldTour, the past week saw Tadej Pogačar utterly dominate the Volta a Catalunya in Spain, winning four out of seven stages, even taking a sprint finish on the final day. His first win came on Stage 2, where he set a new record on the final climb of Vallter 2000. But he wasn’t quick enough to stop us getting there first, as this issue’s Classic Climb testifies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Switching gears, how well do you know the world of bottom brackets? Considering how pivotal the BB is to any bike, probably not as well as you should. In which case we’re here to help – our deep dive into bottom bracket tech has everything you need to know about the history and development of BBs, the different standards and what they mean, and where the industry is heading going forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll admit bottom brackets aren’t the most emotive of subjects, but we challenge any heart not to skip a beat or two when presented with the exquisite J.Laverack Aston Martin .1R. And yes, it’s very much one of those bikes where if you have to ask the price…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also in the May 2024 issue, we speak to rising British star Pfeiffer Georgi, take a closer look at Middle East investment in cycling, take on the multi-day Pan Celtic Ultra race and test new bikes from Colnago, Basso and Lauf.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a
