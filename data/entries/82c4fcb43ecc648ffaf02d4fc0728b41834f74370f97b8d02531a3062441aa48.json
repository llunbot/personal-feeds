The researchers corrected for the bias by calibrating those models with observations of the longest annual dry spells between 1998 and 2018.</p>\n<p>By the end of this century, they found that the average longest periods of drought could be 10 days longer than previously projected. Trouble spots included North America, Southern Africa, and Madagascar, where the newly calibrated models showed that the increase in the longest annual dry spell could be about twice what the older models predicted.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050909#p3\">Read 23 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2050909&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Inside Climate News","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"82c4fcb43ecc648ffaf02d4fc0728b41834f74370f97b8d02531a3062441aa48","category":"Tech"}
