The first, from the summer of 2021, was in a 28-year-old pregnant woman who had no recent international travel history, no underlying medical conditions, and no known contact with anyone who had a similar rash. The case suggests that the fungus is quietly spreading in the community.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1939016#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1939016&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"276e15eb2ffcf502ad6f9dc4f1f4e0d0d71da0e82ab6e42bc0b51fb5390d7821","category":"Tech"}
