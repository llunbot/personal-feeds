Sonos is still positioning the device as a lower-cost and far more compact alternative to its <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/05/the-sonos-arc-is-the-long-awaited-playbar-update-with-dolby-atmos-support/\" target=\"_blank\">higher-end Arc soundbar</a>, one that’s better suited to smaller rooms or secondary TVs. It‘s virtually the same size as before (25.63 x 3.94 x 2.72 in. and 6.2 lbs.) with a near-identical minimalist design, though the fabric-coated front of the first-gen model has been stripped away in favor of a naked, perforated plastic grille that wraps around the device. Sonos says the latter will be easier to clean over time.</p>\n<p>The big addition here is support for <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/11/spatial-audio-is-the-most-exciting-thing-to-happen-to-pop-music-since-stereo/\" target=\"_blank\">Dolby Atmos virtual surround sound</a>. Notably, the Beam (Gen 2) uses the same internal acoustic architecture as before—including five class-D amplifiers, four mid-woofers, three passive radiators, and a center tweeter, but no up-firing speakers to physically create the illusion of audio “height” Atmos promises. But Sonos says the new model is equipped with a faster CPU, allowing it to improve the software that coordinates the soundbar’s audio output and steer it around a room. There are two new virtual \"speaker arrays\" for height and surround audio information as a result, with the idea being that this will help Atmos content still sound as if it’s <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/12/dolby-atmos-home-guide-samsung-hw-k950/\" target=\"_blank\">coming from above and around your head</a> in addition to the usual left, center, and right channels.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1794396#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1794396&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jeff Dunn","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"baf47ab42e7b25db3cbda5f4edbafbdae2c0bee27770f0267578588a8d558730","category":"Tech"}
