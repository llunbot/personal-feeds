Users can now respond to messages with quick emoji reactions by holding down on a message and selecting from common options like hearts, thumbs up, and laughing faces. For those wanting more expression, the three-dot menu provides access to a full emoji keyboard.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe app's search page has also been completely revamped and renamed \"Explore.\" This new discovery hub prominently displays trending topics labeled with tags like \"Hot\" or \"New,\" along with timestamps showing when topics started gaining traction.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/bluesky-emoji-reactions.jpg.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"523\" />\r<br />\nBeyond trends, the Explore page now recommends accounts to follow across various interest categories such as Art, Sports, Music, and Politics. Users can also personalize their experience by selecting specific interests that inform what appears on their Explore page.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/bluesky-explore.jpg.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"804\" height=\"754\" />\r<br />\nMeanwhile, for newcomers, Bluesky has added curated \"Starter Packs,\" or pre-made lists of accounts focused on specific topics that users can follow with a single tap.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/04/bluesky-explore-page-2.jpg.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"804\" height=\"886\" />\r<br />\nThe features are designed to make the transition easier for users migrating from other platforms while improving content discovery within Bluesky.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBluesky has over 34 million active users, according to the company.
