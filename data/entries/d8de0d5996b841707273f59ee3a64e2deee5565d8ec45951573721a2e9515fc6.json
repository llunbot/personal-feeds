Its arrival has been ridiculed online, however, because it generates images of humans in a way that seems like a step backward from other state-of-the-art image-synthesis models like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/01/a-crazy-update-midjourney-v6-upgrade-heaps-on-ai-generated-detail/\">Midjourney</a> or <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/from-toy-to-tool-dall-e-3-is-a-wake-up-call-for-visual-artists-and-the-rest-of-us/\">DALL-E 3</a>. As a result, it can churn out wild anatomically incorrect visual abominations with ease.</p>\n\n<p>A thread on Reddit, titled, \"<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1de7lbg/is_this_release_supposed_to_be_a_joke_sd32b/\">Is this release supposed to be a joke? [SD3-2B],</a>\" details the spectacular failures of SD3 Medium at rendering humans, especially human limbs like hands and feet. Another thread, titled, \"<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1de85nc/why_is_sd3_so_bad_at_generating_girls_lying_on/\">Why is SD3 so bad at generating girls lying on the grass?</a>\" shows similar issues, but for entire human bodies.</p>\n<p>Hands have traditionally been a challenge for AI image generators due to lack of good examples in early training data sets, but more recently, several image-synthesis models <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/ai-imager-midjourney-v5-stuns-with-photorealistic-images-and-5-fingered-hands/\">seemed to have overcome the issue</a>. In that sense, SD3 appears to be a huge step backward for the image-synthesis enthusiasts that gather on Redditâ€”especially compared to recent Stability releases like <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/11/stable-diffusion-turbo-xl-accelerates-image-synthesis-with-one-step-generation/\">SD XL Turbo</a> in November.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031050#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2031050&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d8de0d5996b841707273f59ee3a64e2deee5565d8ec45951573721a2e9515fc6","category":"Tech"}
