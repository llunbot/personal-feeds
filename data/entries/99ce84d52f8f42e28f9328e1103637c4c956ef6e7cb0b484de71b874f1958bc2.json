This time it’s pastel again, as the Logitech Pop Icon Keys and mouse come in the subtle colors Graphite &amp; Green, Graphite &amp; White, Lilac &amp; Off-White, Off-White &amp; Orange and Rose &amp; Off-White. There should be a suitable color for every setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The keyboard and mouse feature a rounded design, which is carried through on the keys. Overall, the look is high-quality and a real eye-catcher, especially in the workplace. The keyboard is also slightly raised and therefore has some ergonomic benefits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has a slightly glossy feel, aside from the matte keys, and those color choices really make a difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mouse is somewhat different, as it is rather plain and small. This is not for large hands or people who complain of wrist pain during prolonged use. Looked at a different way, the mouse is small and handy thanks to its round, flat shape and at least offers a slightly raised end for the palm.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>See how the POP Icon keyboard and POP mouse compare to other <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668394/the-best-keyboards-for-mac.html\">keyboards</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668496/best-mouse-for-macbook-and-mac.html\">mice</a> in our round-up of the best. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Logitech-Pop-Icon-Farben.png?w=1200\" alt=\"Logitech Pop Icon Farben\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Logitech-Pop-Icon-Farben.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Logitech-Pop-Icon-Farben.png?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Logitech-Pop-Icon-Farben.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Logitech-Pop-Icon-Farben.png?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Logitech-Pop-Icon-Farben.png?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Logitech-Pop-Icon-Farben.png?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Logitech-Pop-Icon-Farben.png?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Logitech can certainly do great colors.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Logitech</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Typing feel</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We particularly like the contoured, flat keys of the POP Icon keyboard during the test. These feel very comfortable when typing and ensure that you always find the right input and don’t slip. They respond quickly via Bluetooth and are very quiet, which is, of course, less of an attraction for fans of mechanical keyboards—if you prefer the clickety-clack, look to Logitech’s $99 <a href=\"https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/keyboards/pop-keys-wireless-mechanical.920-010708.html\" target=\"_blank\">Pop Keys mechanical models</a>, pictured below.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Logitech-Pop-Keys-3-Colors.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Logitech Pop Keys Colorful keyboards\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Logitech-Pop-Keys-3-Colors.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 800w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Logitech-Pop-Keys-3-Colors.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Logitech-Pop-Keys-3-Colors.jpg?resize=768%2C430&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Logitech-Pop-Keys-3-Colors.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"800\" height=\"448\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Logitech</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you prefer it quiet, you’ll get exactly the right sound with the Pop Icon keyboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to its slim design, the Pop Icon keyboard is also easy to position and has all the keys you need. However, the layout is also a little “cramped” as some important keys are close together. However, you will get used to this over time if you have previously used a larger keyboard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Pop Icon keyboard also offers all the usual shortcut key combinations, such as for muting, an emoji menu or taking a screenshot. The four action keys can be customized using the Logi Options application, which is available to download free of charge.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Logitech-Pop-Icon-Combo-keyboard-and-mouse-lilac.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Logitech Pop Icon Combo keyboard and mouse lilac\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Logitech-Pop-Icon-Combo-keyboard-and-mouse-lilac.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Logitech-Pop-Icon-Combo-keyboard-and-mouse-lilac.jpg?resize=300%2C108&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Logitech-Pop-Icon-Combo-keyboard-and-mouse-lilac.jpg?resize=768%2C278&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Logitech-Pop-Icon-Combo-keyboard-and-mouse-lilac.jpg?resize=1200%2C434&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Logitech-Pop-Icon-Combo-keyboard-and-mouse-lilac.jpg?resize=1536%2C555&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"434\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Logitech</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Smart clicking</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the keyboard, the Pop Icon Combo also includes the Bluetooth Pop Mouse, which is also comfortable to use. The SmartWheel wheel ensures precise navigation and allows fast scrolling, while the mouse sensor also reacts quickly and smoothly to movements. This makes the mouse very comfortable to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the keyboard, the mouse has two action buttons that can be used to easily set specific commands. For example, you can open several applications by clicking on the mouse wheel, which can be particularly useful when starting work. Or you can define completely different Smart Actions that are frequently used in everyday life, for example, to minimize all applications.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Logitech-Pop-Icon-keys.png?w=1200\" alt=\"Logitech Pop Icon Keys\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Logitech-Pop-Icon-keys.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Logitech-Pop-Icon-keys.png?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Logitech-Pop-Icon-keys.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Logitech-Pop-Icon-keys.png?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Logitech-Pop-Icon-keys.png?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Logitech-Pop-Icon-keys.png?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Logitech-Pop-Icon-keys.png?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Think pink!</p></figcaption></figure><p>IDG / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Smart functions and personalization</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Both the Logitech Pop Icon Keys and the Pop Mouse are compatible with multiple operating systems and devices and can be connected to up to three devices simultaneously. This means you can switch between different laptops with a single click, which is very practical.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the manufacturer, the keyboard has a battery life of up to 36 months, while the mouse lasts up to 24 months. So you practically never have to charge the two devices, which is lucky as it uses standard batteries rather than being recharged via USB.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Logitech-Pop-Icon-Keys-Options-setup-AI.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Logitech Pop Icon Keys function settings\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Logitech-Pop-Icon-Keys-Options-setup-AI.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1500w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Logitech-Pop-Icon-Keys-Options-setup-AI.jpg?resize=300%2C165&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Logitech-Pop-Icon-Keys-Options-setup-AI.jpg?resize=768%2C422&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Logitech-Pop-Icon-Keys-Options-setup-AI.jpg?resize=1200%2C660&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Logitech-Pop-Icon-Keys-Options-setup-AI.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"660\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Also practical: Logitech’s “Logi Options” app, which can be installed and used free of charge, not only provides the Smart Actions already described. An AI Prompt Builder is also directly integrated, which is currently based on ChatGPT 4. This allows texts to be copied automatically and reworded, shortened or suitable responses formulated using preset commands.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Logitech-Pop-Icon-AI-ChatGPT-function.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Logitech Pop Icon Keys AI ChatGPT function\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Logitech-Pop-Icon-AI-ChatGPT-function.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 650w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Logitech-Pop-Icon-AI-ChatGPT-function.jpg?resize=300%2C189&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w\" width=\"650\" height=\"409\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Verdict</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Logitech Pop Icon Combo offers a successful overall package consisting of a high-quality keyboard and a small but fine mouse that is easy and pleasant to use. The workmanship is high quality and the smart functions that Logitech provides here are, for once, not a marketing gimmick but a real relief in everyday life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the keyboard alone is available for <a href=\"https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/keyboards/pop-icon-keys.html\" target=\"_blank\">$49.99</a> or <a href=\"https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/products/keyboards/pop-icon-keys.html\" target=\"_blank\">£49.99</a>, the mouse costs <a href=\"https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/pop-wireless-mouse.html\" target=\"_blank\">$29.99</a> or <a href=\"https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/products/mice/pop-wireless-mouse.html\" target=\"_blank\">£24.99</a> and the combo set only has cost of <a href=\"https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/combos/pop-icon-combo.920-013043.html\" target=\"_blank\">$69.99</a> or <a href=\"https://www.logitech.com/en-gb/products/combos/pop-icon-combo.html\" target=\"_blank\">£69.99</a>, the set offers a good deal and price-performance ratio. However, if you tend to suffer from pain in your hand, you should opt for an ergonomic mouse such as the <a href=\"https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/lift-vertical-ergonomic-mouse.html\" target=\"_blank\">Logitech Lift (for Mac)</a>, as the small pop-icon mouse is not ideal for prolonged use. However, there is hardly anything to criticize about the keyboard, regardless of the application.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"99ce84d52f8f42e28f9328e1103637c4c956ef6e7cb0b484de71b874f1958bc2","category":"Apple"}
