The update comes after Apple released the first beta on December 12, 2023. A public beta should be coming in the next few days.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS Sonoma 14.3: New features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has not made any announcements as to the contents of 14.3. There aren’t any major new features that haven’t already been released so 14.3 will likely be heavy on fixes and security patches.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>macOS Sonoma 14.3 beta 2 developer release notes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The following are the <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-14_3-release-notes&amp;xcust=1-1-2170985-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">developer release notes for beta 2</a>. These notes are different from the version released to the general public since it addresses developer-specific issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The macOS 14.2 SDK provides support to develop apps for Mac computers running Sonoma 14.3 beta 2. The SDK comes bundled with Xcode 15.1, available from the Mac App Store. For information on the compatibility requirements for Xcode 15.1, see <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Xcode-Release-Notes/xcode-15_1-release-notes&amp;xcust=1-1-2170985-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Xcode 15.1 Release Notes</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>StoreKit</h3>\n\n\n\n<h3>Resolved Issues</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Resolved an issue where APIs which provide Transaction values would unexpectedly fail when the purchase price of the transaction is a very large number. (118883880)</li>\n</ul>\n<cite><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://developer.apple.com/documentation/macos-release-notes/macos-14_3-release-notes&amp;xcust=1-1-2170985-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">macOS Sonoma 14.3 Beta 2 Release Notes</a></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2> macOS Sonoma 14.3: How to install the beta</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Developer betas are available to anyone who has enrolled in Apple’s Developer Program. Apple usually issues a public beta a day or two after the developer beta has been released. We have a complete <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671123/how-to-install-macos-beta.html\">guide to downloading and installing the Sonoma betas</a> if you are interested.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While betas give early access to fixes and features to the operating system, they are issued with the idea that users will test the software and check for bugs. This means that the betas have some instability to them and may cause issues with your Mac. If you can’t afford to take the risk of a possible crash or a disruption of usability, you should not run the beta and wait for the release to the general public.</p>\n\nMacOS</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"0e2faf7dfe73154f5fa2ca89313e9d0d026e82b43d597c7cd709ff7343fc1c54","category":"Apple"}
