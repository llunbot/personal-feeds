{"title":"AT&T Only Learned of Massive 2022 Data Breach This April; Delayed Revealing It at the Request of U.S. Law Enforcement","link":"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/07/hackers-steal-phone-sms-records-for-nearly-all-att-customers/","date":1720829913000,"content":"\n<p>Brian Krebs:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In a written statement shared with KrebsOnSecurity, the FBI\nconfirmed that it asked AT&amp;T to delay notifying affected\ncustomers.</p>\n\n<p>“Shortly after identifying a potential breach to customer data and\nbefore making its materiality decision, AT&amp;T contacted the FBI to\nreport the incident,” the FBI statement reads. “In assessing the\nnature of the breach, all parties discussed a potential delay to\npublic reporting under Item 1.05(c) of the SEC Rule, due to\npotential risks to national security and/or public safety. AT&amp;T,\nFBI, and DOJ worked collaboratively through the first and second\ndelay process, all while sharing key threat intelligence to\nbolster FBI investigative equities and to assist AT&amp;T’s incident\nresponse work.”</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/12/att-phone-records-stolen-data-breach/\">Techcrunch quoted</a> an AT&amp;T spokesperson saying the customer data\nwas stolen as a result of a still-unfolding data breach involving\nmore than 160 customers of the cloud data provider Snowflake.</p>\n\n<p>Mark Burnett is an application security architect, consultant and\nauthor. Burnett said the only real use for the data stolen in the\nmost recent AT&amp;T breach is to know who is contacting whom and how\nmany times.</p>\n\n<p>“The most concerning thing to me about this AT&amp;T breach of ALL\ncustomer call and text records is that this isn’t one of their\nmain databases; it is metadata on who is contacting who,” Burnett\nwrote on Mastodon. “Which makes me wonder what would call logs\nwithout timestamps or names have been used for.”</p>\n\n<p>It remains unclear why so many major corporations persist in the\nbelief that it is somehow acceptable to store so much sensitive\ncustomer data with so few security protections. For example,\nAdvance Auto Parts said the data exposed included full names,\nSocial Security numbers, drivers licenses and government issued ID\nnumbers on <a href=\"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/advance-auto-parts-data-breach-impacts-23-million-people/\">2.3 million</a> people who were former employees or job\napplicants.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/07/12/att-data-breach-rcs\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"0f8cabf977d07247f6ed37dc62a527316bd6320ac7bb2aa372a4127ea00b668a","category":"Tech"}
