Hell, I was one of the first kids in my neighborhood to have a <em><a href=\"https://harobikes.com/pages/history\" target=\"_blank\">Haro Factory Plate</a> </em>on my Webco. So, when I walked up to Haro’s booth at this year’s Sea Otter Classic, I was happy to see some new offerings in the <a href=\"https://harobikes.com/collections/performance-road\" target=\"_blank\">Rivette</a> road bike and soon-to-be-released <a href=\"https://harobikes.com/collections/gravel\" target=\"_blank\">Buzzard</a> gravel race bike. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the past few years, it seemed that the adult bikes that Haro Bikes were offering were a bit dated and lacked any real zest. Well, it seems that Haro has blown everything up and started fresh. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s take a look. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Haro Rivette</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SOC-Coverage-Haro-new-Rivette-and-Buzzard-drop-bar-bikes-full-bike-e1714756133790.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"648\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SOC-Coverage-Haro-new-Rivette-and-Buzzard-drop-bar-bikes-full-bike-e1714756133790.jpeg\" alt=\"SOC Coverage Haro new Rivette and Buzzard drop bar bikes full bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SOC-Coverage-Haro-new-Rivette-and-Buzzard-drop-bar-bikes-full-bike-e1714756133790.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SOC-Coverage-Haro-new-Rivette-and-Buzzard-drop-bar-bikes-full-bike-e1714756133790-297x150.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SOC-Coverage-Haro-new-Rivette-and-Buzzard-drop-bar-bikes-full-bike-e1714756133790-120x61.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SOC-Coverage-Haro-new-Rivette-and-Buzzard-drop-bar-bikes-full-bike-e1714756133790-768x389.jpeg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/Ron Frazelle)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Haro calls their commitment to drop bar performance bikes, their “new obsession”. Although they are brand new to the drop bar space, Haro has accumulated years of experience as riders and product developers to bring you the Rivette, their “race-ready all-arounder”. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SOC-Coverage-Haro-new-Rivette-and-Buzzard-drop-bar-bikes-Rivette-tt-logo.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SOC-Coverage-Haro-new-Rivette-and-Buzzard-drop-bar-bikes-Rivette-tt-logo.jpeg\" alt=\"SOC Coverage Haro new Rivette and Buzzard drop bar bikes Rivette tt logo\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SOC-Coverage-Haro-new-Rivette-and-Buzzard-drop-bar-bikes-Rivette-tt-logo.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SOC-Coverage-Haro-new-Rivette-and-Buzzard-drop-bar-bikes-Rivette-tt-logo-297x223.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SOC-Coverage-Haro-new-Rivette-and-Buzzard-drop-bar-bikes-Rivette-tt-logo-120x90.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SOC-Coverage-Haro-new-Rivette-and-Buzzard-drop-bar-bikes-Rivette-tt-logo-768x576.jpeg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/The Lunch Ride)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Rivette is crafted from carbon fiber in size-specific layups for a blend of stiffness and feathery weight (<em>size 56cm raw frame with metal parts is 750g)</em>.
