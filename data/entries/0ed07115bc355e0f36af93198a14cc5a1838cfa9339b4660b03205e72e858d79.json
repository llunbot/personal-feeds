That's a pretty substantial boost over current SD cards, which tend to top out around 80MB or 90MB per second (for cheap commodity cards) and around 250MB per second for the very fastest UHS-II-compatible professional cards.</p>\n<p>As Samsung points out, that 800MB/s figure puts these tiny SD Express cards well above the speeds possible with older SATA SSDs, which could make these cards more useful as primary storage devices for PCs or single-board computers that can support the SD Express standard (more on that later).</p>\n<p>Samsung is currently sampling a 256GB version of the SD Express card, and \"will be available for purchase later this year.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2006687#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2006687&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0ed07115bc355e0f36af93198a14cc5a1838cfa9339b4660b03205e72e858d79","category":"Tech"}
