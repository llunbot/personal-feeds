Fortunately I’m accompanied by someone who knows exactly what’s coming. Sitting opposite is Daniele Schena, otherwise known as Stelvio Man, who – as his nickname suggests – is very familiar with today’s main climb.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we pump tyres and double-check supplies, I settle my own flutters with some gentle humour: ‘<em>Ti senti nervos</em>o?’ I say in my best GCSE Italian.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having ridden it multiple times a week for years, and more than 600 times in total, if the Stelvio still makes Daniele nervous then his expression masks it well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Er, no,’ he replies.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-02-970x647.webp\" alt=\"Passo dello Stelvio\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-02-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-02-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-02-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-02-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-02-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-02-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-02-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-02-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-02.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>The road immediately rises sharply out of Bormio en route to the Umbrail and Stelvio Passes, tacking up the incline in a series of switchbacks.</figcaption><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>Borm ready</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sitting at around 1,200m altitude, Bormio is a bustling Alpine town at the head of a valley that’s surrounded by mountains on all sides. Even in mid-July, snow is settled on the surrounding peaks, which reach well above 3,000m.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We roll out of town, following the River Adda upstream, and settle into a steady climbing tempo. We will head up towards the summit of the Stelvio, but before we get there we’ll branch to the north at around 2,400m to go over the Passo Umbrail before descending into Switzerland and doing a large clockwise loop to take us to the other side of the Stelvio so we can take on its most iconic ascent.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-03-647x970.webp\" alt=\"Passo dello Stelvio\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-03-647x970.webp 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-03-200x300.webp 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-03-768x1152.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-03-1024x1536.webp 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-03-1365x2048.webp 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-03-750x1125.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-03-1140x1710.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-03.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>This is as low as we will be all ride in altitude terms, but that’s still 1,200m above sea level.</figcaption><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>With a 7% average for 17.2km, the Umbrail is no cakewalk, but the gradient never strays beyond 8% so it acts as reasonable preparation for the main event. At least today is warm and dry, something that wasn’t the case when the Giro d’Italia tried to take in the Swiss ascent of the Umbrail in 2024. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With lashing rain in the valley and snow higher up, the peloton collectively decided to down tools and demand a reroute. In classically diplomatic terms, Australian rider Ben O’Connor called it ‘one of the worst organised races’ run by ‘a bunch of dinosaurs’.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-04-970x647.webp\" alt=\"Passo dello Stelvio\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-04-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-04-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-04-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-04-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-04-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-04-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-04-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-04-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-04.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>Where it hasn’t been possible to safely carve out an entire road, the engineers have constructed chilly tunnels, dripping with mountain run off, which provide welcome respite from the heat.</figcaption><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>There’s little chance of us suffering frostbite today. As the morning heats up I find myself hugging the barrier to dodge the sun’s rays. To our left the almost 3,000m, tree-flecked granite slabs of Monte Radisca and Monte Pedenolo peer down fraternally on my glacial progress, while up ahead Stelvio Man has already realised he’s going to have a pretty leisurely day on the pedals.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-05-970x647.webp\" alt=\"Passo dello Stelvio\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-05-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-05-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-05-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-05-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-05-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-05-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-05-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-05-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-05.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>Alongside the almost ever-present switchbacks runs the river Braulio, which is part of a hydroelectric power system tagged onto the river Adda.</figcaption><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The higher we go, the less interrupted these views become. At the mouth of the valley I can see the road disappearing over the scree-fringed horizon, having jumped 200m in 14 switchbacks. Alongside this tight wiggle of tarmac is a roaring waterfall and an invitation to gaze east along the banister of road that plots our journey so far.</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The kilometres completed don’t appear to have registered with Daniele, who looks for all the world like a man waiting for the climbing to begin. He tells me a few stories that crystallise the sobering connection with World War Two. Italian residents would clamber up Passo Umbrail hoping to slip into neutral Switzerland at the crest, but fascist soldiers patrolled the area and many people were intercepted and arrested within sight of freedom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Daniele’s story effectively stems any complaints I might have about how hard I’m finding the climb.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/italy-switzerland-stelvio-cycling\">Big Ride: Three times up the Stelvio</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/passo-dello-stelvio-cycling\">Classic climb: Passo dello Stelvio, the world’s greatest climb</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/shadow-of-the-stelvio-bormio-gravel-ride\">Shadow of the Stelvio: Bormio gravel ride</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/stelvio-pass-italy-cycling\">Big Ride: The Stelvio Pass: the world’s most stunning road climb</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>The weight of history</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re nearing the summit of the Umbrail Pass now, and the higher we climb the more history asserts itself on the landscape.

Burbling streams branch off the milky waters of the Muranzina river, flanked by lush trees and tumbling scree. The Stelvio seems to have hoovered up all the traffic so it’s just Daniele, me and the occasional shifty-looking marmot.

Franz Josef I of Austria commissioned famed engineer Carlo Donegani for the project, which would require 2,500 workers and five years to complete. Today there’s just two of us, and I’m hoping we’ll be a good bit quicker.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It might be one of the most photogenic climbs on the planet but the Stelvio certainly makes you work for it.

The Stelvio was pulled from the Giro last year when part of the road opened up like a conker in early May, while teetering snowbanks also increased the risk of avalanche. It has also been scratched in 1984, 1988 and 2013.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On occasion, even when the Stelvio has remained open, chaos has still reigned. On Stage 16 of the 2014 Giro, organisers mistakenly neutralised the descent of the Stelvio to some teams and not to others, only to then de-neutralise it after the fact.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-13-970x647.webp\" alt=\"Passo dello Stelvio\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-13-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-13-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-13-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-13-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-13-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-13-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-13-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-13-350x233.webp 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-13.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>Keeping the Stelvio in decent shape is the job of ANAS, the Italian road agency, which usually manages to get the road open by late May, before closing it at the start of November.</figcaption><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>We don’t have to worry about a blizzard, but there’s still nothing like 500m of vertical ascent in just over 5km to focus the mind. While tucked as closely onto Daniele’s wheel as possible – you can draft at 9%, right? – I try to imagine the Stelvio as it once was, free of the stone ramparts that suspend the road, just a scarcely climbable face of gravel, rock and ice. Thinking of the herculean efforts of builders and engineers that have allowed me to ride up here somehow makes things easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By now the altitude is above 2,500m and my lungs are feeling the effects of the thin air, although remarkably my legs don’t feel too sorry for themselves considering the 3,000m of climbing clanking around in their veins.

Researchers believe it was inhabited by Austro-Hungarian troops, and in the shelter they found an incredibly well-preserved barracks stocked with ammunition, lanterns, books, mounds of hay for mattresses, and even seeds that were subsequently planted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It adds to a growing list of slowly thawing discoveries, including uniformed corpses, animal bones and the letters and diaries of soldiers trapped inside what must have been one of the most inhospitable places on Earth.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-16-647x970.webp\" alt=\"Passo dello Stelvio\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-16-647x970.webp 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-16-200x300.webp 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-16-768x1152.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-16-1024x1536.webp 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-16-1365x2048.webp 1365w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-16-750x1125.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-16-1140x1710.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/big-ride-stelvio-16.webp 1536w\" /><figcaption>The bitter chill of the tunnels has gone from refreshing to shiver-inducing as we power our way back towards Bormio.</figcaption><figcaption>Juan Trujillo Andrades / Cyclist</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>How we did it</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Travel </h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Cyclist</em> flew from Gatwick to Milan Bergamo. Direct flights are also available from Birmingham, Liverpool, Edinburgh and Manchester. In Milan we hired a car and drove the 150km to Bormio in around three hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Accommodation </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We stayed at Hotel Funivia in Bormio, which is ideal for cyclists as it has a dedicated garage and workspace underneath the reception, boasting every tool you can shake a cassette at. Plus Daniele Schena – aka Stelvio Man, our guide for the trip – runs bike tours from here and the hotel will equip you with packed lunches and an inclusive laundry service. For the times when you’re not riding, the hotel is located by the river Adda and just a short walk from the medieval town centre and its charming main piazza. Double rooms start from €200 per night.
