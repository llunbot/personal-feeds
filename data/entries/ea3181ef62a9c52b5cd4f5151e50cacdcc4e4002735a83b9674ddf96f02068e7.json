Even within a species, some are bolder and better at solving problems than others. We have found this to be <a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/epdf/10.1098/rsos.211781\">true</a> in the case of the <a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/22710912/183006359\">critically endangered</a> Bali myna, a rare bird found only on the island of Bali in Indonesia.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/22710912/129874226\">Fewer than 50 adult</a> Bali mynas remain in their native dry forest and savanna on the island. Conservationists are trying, with mixed results, to reintroduce more birds to boost the wild population.</p>\n<p>Understanding how each animal perceives, processes, stores, and acts upon information (what scientists describe as “cognition”) could determine how successful these efforts are. In fact, the future of many threatened species could depend upon it.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1946718#p3\">Read 24 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1946718&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"The Conversation","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ea3181ef62a9c52b5cd4f5151e50cacdcc4e4002735a83b9674ddf96f02068e7","category":"Tech"}
