{"title":"DJI Air 3S Lidar vs The Gauntlet: ActiveTrack Sports Follow-Me Testing","link":"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/10/dji-air-3s-review-gauntlet-activetrack-testing.html","date":1729066817000,"content":"<p><span>﻿</span><span>﻿</span></p>\n<p>We’re finally seeing some technical progress from DJI in the ActiveTrack realm. Their just-released DJI Air 3S is their first consumer drone to include forward-facing LIDAR, which uses lasers to determine what’s in front of it. This allows it to avoid obstacles in pitch-black conditions, as well as more mundane low-light forest conditions. Not only that, the company says they’ve improved the four cameras that previously existed for 360° obstacle avoidance.</p>\n<p>Obviously, I set out to put that to the test, as always.</p>\n<p>In this video I put my newly purchased Air 3S through The Gauntlet and its five stages, to see how well it handles. It’s notable to see how this compared to the <a href=\"https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2024/09/dji-neo-gauntlet-activetrack-testing.html\">tiny little $199 DJI Neo from just a month ago</a>, on this same course. Both in terms of obstacle avoidance (and crashes), as well as image quality.</p>\n<p>To see how well this drone holds up, hit the play button up above. Even if you don’t care about drones, I suspect you’ll find it entertaining.</p>\n<p>Thanks for watching!</p>","author":"Ray Maker","siteTitle":"DC Rainmaker","siteHash":"32f541eec2062fbf675b0daf837db78b41cd6160cf993de3c4b5e9b44a978706","entryHash":"9cfdd7d54a548c987cff201ac7645f60a608c55da3d13fd81e618f524d508e52","category":"Cycling"}
