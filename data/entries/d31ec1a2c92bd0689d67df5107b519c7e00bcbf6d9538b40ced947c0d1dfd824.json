With a maximum brightness of 1,600 nits (1,000 nits sustained when viewing HDR content), it’s the brightest screen on an Apple laptop. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What is it good for?</strong> If you have a heavy workload, the MacBook Pro has the power to handle it, no sweat. Video production, graphics and animation, serious data crunching—you name it, the MacBook Pro is built for it. The MacBook Pro is even strong enough to serve as your only computer—it’s more powerful than some of the lower configurations of the Intel-based Mac Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All this processing prowess comes at a price—the MacBook Pro is Apple’s priciest laptop. And it’s also its heaviest, with the 16-inch models weighing 4.5 pounds. That may not sound like a lot, but imagine yourself on the road, meeting with people, working remotely. The weight wears on you as the day goes on.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/14-inch-MacBook-Pro-2.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" /><figcaption>The 14-inch MacBook Pro has tremdous power and good looks.</figcaption></figure><p>IDG</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Macworld’s buying advice:</strong> Picking a MacBook Pro is a little complicated, not just because of the size differences, but the differences between the features offered within each size category.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 16-inch $3.499 MacBook Pro is the laptop with all the bells and whistles. It’s the one for the most demanding users, who will like the high-end M1 Max processor and its 32-core GPU. The $2,499 14-inch MacBook Pro is a nice compromise of size and performance—it has an M1 Pro, which doesn’t have the GPU power that the M1 Max does, but you can upgrade to a 24-core GPU for $200, or to an M1 Pro Max with a 32-core GPU for $400.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros priced at $2,499. They have the same M1 Pro, but the 14-inch model (which has a smaller screen, obviously) has a 1TB SSD, while the 16-inch model has a 512GB SSD. So keep that in mind if you’re choosing between those two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re looking at the $1,999 14-inch MacBook Pro with an 8-core M1 Pro, think about the 10-core upgrade for $200. Depending on the work you do, you’ll appreciate having more processing power. You can also upgrade it to a 10-core CPU with a 16-core GPU for $300.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because the new MacBook Pros rely on Thunderbolt, you’re going to need to stock up on adapters to connect items like an external display, hard drive, and more.

Each model is available in Silver or Space Gray. You can customize each model, but adding features will increase the price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What are the prices for the MacBook Pro?</strong> The standard configurations are priced at $1,299 and $1,499.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What are the MacBook Pro specifications?</strong> The 13-inch MacBook Pro has an 8-core M1 chip (four performance cores, four efficiency cores), an 8-core GPU. a 16-core Neural Engine, and 8GB of memory.

It doesn’t have the 120Hz refresh support like the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro. It’s still a good display, just not as high-end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What’s it good for? </strong>Its design is built to better handle CPU heat better than the MacBook Air, so it can sustain faster speeds for a longer period of time. The 13-inch MacBook Pro is ideal for users who do a lot of work in consumer creative apps, such as iMovie, GarageBand, or Photos. It can handle pro apps, too, just not as efficiently as the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro. It’s also the last remaining laptop with a Touch Bar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Macworld’s buying advice: </strong>If you’re looking for a laptop with a combination of size, processing power, and price, the 13-inch MacBook Pro is the way to go.

If these features don’t seem necessary for you, consider the MacBook Air.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why should you choose the 14- or 16-inch MacBook Pro over the 13-inch MacBook Pro?
