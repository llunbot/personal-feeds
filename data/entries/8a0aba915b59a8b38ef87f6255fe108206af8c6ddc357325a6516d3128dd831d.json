In all, the reports outline 69 violations just between the dates of August 1, 2023, and August 2, 2024.</p>\n<p>The findings in the reports reveal the perfect conditions for the company's meat to become contaminated with the germ behind the deadly outbreak, <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em>. This is a hardy germ that is ubiquitous in the environment, including in soil and water, and it spreads among people via the fecal-oral route. In healthy people, it usually only causes gastrointestinal infections. But for older people, newborns, and the immunocompromised, it can cause a life-threatening invasive infection with a fatality rate of around 17 percent. It's also a significant danger to pregnant people, causing miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery, and life-threatening infections in newborns.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046499#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046499&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8a0aba915b59a8b38ef87f6255fe108206af8c6ddc357325a6516d3128dd831d","category":"Tech"}
