This time it was Wilier, with its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2022-wilier-rave-slr/\">Rave SLR</a>. Unusually, it straddles the line between road and gravel bike, and is “unashamedly high end, with superbike pricing to match”.</p>\n<p>For those who want a high performance to value ratio from their mountain bike, Specialized announced its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2022-specialized-stumpjumper-evo-alloy/\">2022 Stumpjumper Evo Alloy</a>. After all, carbon is cool, but alloy is still a great material for performance bikes, especially for those shopping on a limited budget.</p>\n<p>Now, let’s take a look at some of the latest tech to land at BikeRadar headquarters this week.</p>\n\n<h2>Endura GV500 gravel kit</h2>\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Endura’s GV500 Reiver bib shorts

number of pieces designed to handle the coming colder, wetter months of the year.</p>\n<p>Developed in collaboration with James Hayden, a two-time winner of the Transcontinental Race (an ultra-endurance bike race across Europe), Endura’s GV500 range focuses on packability and simplicity.</p>\n<p>Designed in Scotland, the GV500 range has seen its fair share of bad weather testing in the run-up to its release and Endura is confident the range can stand up to everything keen adventurers can throw at it.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Endura’s GV500
