Google Chrome remains in first place with a dominant 66.13 percent share, and Mozilla's Firefox stands in fourth with 5.65 percent.

In Q4 2022, half of Mac buyers were new to the product line, giving macOS and Apple's default Safari browser significantly more exposure. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nDespite Safari's surge, it has made virtually no progress in catching up to first-placed Google Chrome, which retains an iron-clad grip on the market, with its share down just 0.51 percent compared to the previous year. Chrome's popularity on both macOS and Windows platforms continues largely unabated.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/safari/\">Safari</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/edge/\">Edge</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/02/safari-overtakes-edge-popular-browsers/\">Apple's Safari Again Overtakes Microsoft Edge as Second Most Popular Desktop Browser</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-safari-again-overtakes-microsoft-edge-as-second-most-popular-desktop-browser.2388405/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"89fe58d1c57c35a6e2af1ae39726db1c3a6c91ccd894a3c66791c5ee7d3217a9","category":"Apple"}
