Facebook, long a primary driver of clicks to the\npublication, had turned away from news.

And the impact for a\nmid-sized news site was immediate, putting the Beast on track to\nmake between $3-4 million in revenue this year from Apple News\nalone — more than its own standalone subscription program, and\nwithout much additional cost.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Apple News+ is yet another example of Apple successfully playing long games, with patience and determination.
