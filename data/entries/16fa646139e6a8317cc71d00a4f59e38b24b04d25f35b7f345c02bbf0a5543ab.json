Olympian, has announced her retirement from professional cycling at aged 31. Speaking on her lengthy career, she told the BBC: ‘I always knew deep down that I would know when the right time was. I have had an absolute blast but now is the time for me to hang that bike up. It’s been in my head a little while.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kenny’s star is stratospheric, having won 17 European titles, seven World Championships, six Olympic medals and a National Road Race Championship. Her career spans the three Olympic Games of London 2012, Rio 2016 and the delayed Tokyo 2020, with five golds in track cycling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kenny’s announcement comes prior to the Paris Olympics this summer. She had not returned to Team GB training following the birth of her second child last July and had suffered a miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy after the Tokyo Games.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her last medal on the track came from the scratch race at the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham. On her future, she said: ‘It’s time to move on but stay following for the next chapter.’</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Mathieu van der Poel signs 10-year contract with Canyon</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"637\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Mathieu-van-der-Poel-CX-World-Championships-2024-970x637.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Mathieu-van-der-Poel-CX-World-Championships-2024-970x637.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Mathieu-van-der-Poel-CX-World-Championships-2024-300x197.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Mathieu-van-der-Poel-CX-World-Championships-2024-768x505.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Mathieu-van-der-Poel-CX-World-Championships-2024-750x493.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/Mathieu-van-der-Poel-CX-World-Championships-2024.jpeg 1134w\" /><figcaption>UCI Cyclocross</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/mathieu-van-der-poel\" target=\"_blank\">Mathieu van der Poel</a> (Alpecin-Deceuninck) signed a 10-year contract with Canyon Bicycles, the longest-known contract in modern cycling.

It came down to a bunch sprint after over six hours in the saddle, won on the line by Jasper Philipsen (Alpecin-Deceuninck) just ahead of Michael Matthews (Jayco AlUla). Tadej Pogačar (UAE Team Emirates) completed the podium, finishing third ahead of Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek).</p>\n\n\n\n<div><blockquote><p>\"𝑨𝒎𝒐 𝒆𝒔𝒕𝒂 𝒆𝒓𝒂 𝒅𝒆𝒍 𝒄𝒊𝒄𝒍𝒊𝒔𝒎𝒐\"<br /><br /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f618.png\" alt=\"😘\" /> El mensaje de Pogacar y su buen rollo con Philipsen en el podio de la Milán-San Remo.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MilanoSanremo?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">#MilanoSanremo</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/zvUHaJyPKf\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/zvUHaJyPKf</a></p>— Eurosport.es (@Eurosport_ES) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Eurosport_ES/status/1769332874904268947?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">March 17, 2024</a></blockquote> </div>\n\n\n\n<p>The post-race scenes were a delight to watch, with hugs between rivals and celebratory pictures flooding social media. It was also nice to see Matthews on the podium again. It’s not that he hasn’t experienced some big wins throughout his career, victorious on multiple Grand Tour stages, but he has not had the same consistency of success as some of his rivals, even contemplating leaving the sport last year. I’m really glad he’s still here.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Lidl-Trek win Trofeo Alfredo Binda for fourth year running</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Trofeo-Alfredo-Binda-2024-via-Getty-970x647.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Trofeo-Alfredo-Binda-2024-via-Getty-970x646.jpeg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Trofeo-Alfredo-Binda-2024-via-Getty-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Trofeo-Alfredo-Binda-2024-via-Getty-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Trofeo-Alfredo-Binda-2024-via-Getty-1536x1025.jpeg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Trofeo-Alfredo-Binda-2024-via-Getty-750x500.jpeg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Trofeo-Alfredo-Binda-2024-via-Getty-1140x760.jpeg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Trofeo-Alfredo-Binda-2024-via-Getty-465x310.jpeg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Trofeo-Alfredo-Binda-2024-via-Getty-620x413.jpeg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Trofeo-Alfredo-Binda-2024-via-Getty-350x233.jpeg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/03/Trofeo-Alfredo-Binda-2024-via-Getty.jpeg 2048w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Elisa Balsamo (Lidl-Trek) won Trofeo Alfredo Binda this weekend, beating Lotte Kopecky (SD Worx-Protime) in a sprint finish after 140.5km.
