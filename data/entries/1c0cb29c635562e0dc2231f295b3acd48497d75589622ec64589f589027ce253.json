As a young mom, she has risen to the top of three male-dominated sports. The 10 Barrel/Red Bull athlete is a pro motocross racer, MTB rider, and surfer. Follow along with shredding three ways in this new film by 10 Barrel.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Interview from <a href=\"https://10barrel.com\" target=\"_blank\">10 Barrel Brewing</a></h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When you were a kid, what did you want to be when you grew up?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tarah Gieger: </strong>I always just wanted to be an athlete really. Every sport I was doing, I pictured myself as a professional. Even when I played baseball with all boys, I wanted to be the first girl playing in the major leagues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Was there a point in your life when you aspired to be a Red Bull athlete?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tarah Gieger: </strong>I am lucky enough to have been with Redbull for 17 years. So when I got signed on it wasn’t what it is today. But I still knew it was a huge accomplishment in my career and they have been the most amazing part of it all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When did you first realize that motocross could be your full-time career?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tarah Gieger: </strong>I think I realized I was going to be a professional motocross racer when each year it just kept getting better and better. Going to college and getting a “real job” just kept getting further and further in the rear view.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What’s it like leading the charge for women in a male-dominated sport? Does that even cross your mind or does it all just feel normal?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tarah Gieger: </strong>When I first started riding motocross in Puerto Rico when I was a kid there were no other girls doing it on the island. But I also came from surfing with all boys and playing baseball with all boys. So it was never something I saw as being different from the norm. Now as I’ve been through it all and look back I know all the girls I was racing with and the things we were able to accomplish in our sport had a big impact on younger girls getting involved in all forms of traditionally male-dominated action sports.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Outside of participating in the sports that you do; how do you keep yourself in shape?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tarah Gieger: </strong>I love being super active everyday if I can. I find a lot of enjoyment in somewhat mundane activities too. I really enjoy swimming laps in a pool, riding my road bike for miles, or even just putting time in the gym when I get a chance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You’re an expert surfer, endurocross racer, and mountain biker. Do you feel that the skills you’ve learned from each help you excel in the other sports?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tarah Gieger: </strong>All those sports are so unique to themselves I think but being able to adapt to a lot of different things really translates across the board. Just figuring it out as you go is a great skill as well. Which I find myself having to do a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What have been some of the biggest challenges with balancing your athletic career and being a parent? How has that adjusted your attitude and expectations in the field?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tarah Gieger: </strong>Finding time to be present in each thing has been really hard. Trying to split my time between it all but being 100 percent in the moment is a thing I’ve found myself having to figure out. I went from having all day to do the things I needed for myself to having a very small amount of time for myself. I wouldn’t want it any other way though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>On a given day, how do you decide which to do?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tarah Gieger: </strong>Thankfully in central Oregon you don’t really have to decide. You can pretty much do it all any day you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you could only do one for the rest of your life, what would it be?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tarah Gieger: </strong>I would have to pick surfing as a sport I would do forever. It’s a little easier on the body than two-wheel sports.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What was the most physically challenging single athletic feat of your life, and why?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tarah Gieger: </strong>There have been numerous races that have pushed me physically but I would have to say that the past year of being a professional racer and raising a child has been the most demanding. There were no off days or recovery days. It was back from the races straight into chasing around a toddler. He didn’t care how tired or sore I was. He was full throttle and I just had to keep up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Now that you’re a mom, do we need to get you a sidecar?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tarah Gieger: </strong>My son would love that! He is crazy about bikes. ‘Bike’ was actually one of his first words.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Now that you’re a parent, how do you feel about encouraging your son to take on the sports that you hold near and dear?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tarah Gieger: </strong>I will fully support anything he is passionate about. I want him to try it all but if he finds something that he wants to be in 100 percent I’m ready to be there no matter what it is. Obviously, I think we already do the most fun sports out there but it will be exciting to see what fuels his fire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You’re technically retired, but something tells us you’re not planning to slow down much. What’s next?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tarah Gieger: </strong>I definitely intend to keep doing the sports I love as much as I can. Hopefully, some more filming projects I have had to put on hold because of my racing career. Now I’m hoping to have more chances to say yes to fun things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nature Calls, APOC or Profuse Juice … do you have a go-to favorite?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tarah Gieger: </strong>Nature Calls all day. I love that stuff!</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/from-puerto-rico-to-red-bull-tarah-gieger-shreds-it-all-along-the-way/\">From Puerto Rico to Red Bull: Tarah Gieger Shreds it All Along the Way</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Staff","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"1c0cb29c635562e0dc2231f295b3acd48497d75589622ec64589f589027ce253","category":"Cycling"}
