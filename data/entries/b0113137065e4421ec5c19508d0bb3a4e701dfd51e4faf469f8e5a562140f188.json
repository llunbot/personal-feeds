It was tantalizing but a bit light on details. Now we have a full-length trailer that reunites several fan favorites and also gives us our first peek at the live-action version of Grand Admiral Thrawn, whose rumored return will fuel much of the plot for <em>Ahsoka</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>(Some spoilers for <em>Star Wars: Rebels</em> below.)</strong></p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/star-wars-fans-rejoice-heres-the-first-teaser-for-ahsoka-series/\">previously reported</a>, the Jedi Padawan of Anakin Skywalker, Ahsoka, was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahsoka_Tano\">introduced</a> as a supporting character in 2008's animated film <em>Star Wars: The Clone Wars</em> and the subsequent animated series (voiced by Ashley Eckstein). The character returned in the sequel series <i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Rebels\">Star Wars Rebels</a></i> (2014-2018) as a member of the Rebel Alliance, operating under the codename Fulcrum, and made numerous other cameo appearances in the extended Star Wars universe. Rosario Dawson's live-action version made her debut in <em>The Mandalorian</em>'s second season. We last saw Ahsoka briefly in <em><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/review-the-book-of-boba-fett-is-lots-of-fun-but-its-really-the-mandalorian-2-5/\">The Book of Boba Fett</a> </em>when she passed on a gift of chain mail to Grogu after warning Mando/Din Djarin that his presence would distract from Grogu's Jedi training. We all know how that turned out: Din and Grogu reunited and went on to share even more adventures in <em>The Mandalorian</em> S3.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1952878#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1952878&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b0113137065e4421ec5c19508d0bb3a4e701dfd51e4faf469f8e5a562140f188","category":"Tech"}
