There is, however, support for Alexa and Google voice control.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhen activated, the glass in the door is able to change from clear to privacy, which is a more opaque look. The glass is laminated for energy efficiency, and the door itself is made from fiberglass filled with high density polyurethane foam. It is unpainted, so it can be painted to match a home.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere are several models with different amounts of glass, with pricing that starts at $800. The doors will be available in select Home Depot stores starting on October 28.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/home-deport/\">Home Deport</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/01/home-depot-smart-glass-doors/\">Home Depot Launches Smart Glass Doors That Turn From Clear to Opaque</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/home-depot-launches-smart-glass-doors-that-turn-from-clear-to-opaque.2438850/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"54e6357ea0712fdff0d858055be128eaf19b28a9e9650a73fa2d950bd443b1bb","category":"Apple"}
