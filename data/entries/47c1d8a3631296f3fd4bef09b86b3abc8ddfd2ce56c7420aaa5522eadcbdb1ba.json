In steel bikes, they call it  PAT.P (<em>Plate Absorber Technology Pressed</em>), developed to reduce vibration before it gets to the rider, without compromising overall frame rigidity &amp; performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Titici Strada steel road bike</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Titici-Sessanta-Strada-steel-road-bike_made-in-Italy_complete.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Titici-Sessanta-Strada-steel-road-bike_made-in-Italy_complete.jpg\" alt=\"Titici Progetto Sessanta Strada modern steel road bike, handmade-in-Italy, complete\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Titici-Sessanta-Strada-steel-road-bike_made-in-Italy_complete.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Titici-Sessanta-Strada-steel-road-bike_made-in-Italy_complete-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Titici-Sessanta-Strada-steel-road-bike_made-in-Italy_complete-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Titici-Sessanta-Strada-steel-road-bike_made-in-Italy_complete-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Titici-Sessanta-Strada-steel-road-bike_made-in-Italy_complete-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Titici-Sessanta-Strada-steel-road-bike_made-in-Italy_complete-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The road-going Strada is the lighter of the two, made from custom-shaped, triple-butted and super-thin Columbus Spirit tubing created exclusively for Titici.
