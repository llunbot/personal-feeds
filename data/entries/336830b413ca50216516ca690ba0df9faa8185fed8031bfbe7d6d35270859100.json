Over the past week, a Reddit employee has posted to subreddits with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/reddit-mods-allowed-porn-as-protest-the-company-nuked-their-mod-badges/\">ousted mods</a>, asking for new volunteers. But in its search, the company has failed to address the intricacies involved in moderating distinct and, in some cases, well-known subreddits. And it doesn't look like the knowledge from the previous moderators is being passed down.</p>\n<p>Redditors were enraged over <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/reddits-api-pricing-results-in-shocking-20-million-a-year-bill-for-apollo/\">suddenly high</a> API access pricing, and the social media platform's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/the-reddit-protests-are-winding-down-so-whats-next/\">subsequent responses</a> to protests and feedback have beleaguered Reddit for weeks. A two-day blackout of over 8,000 subreddits, for example, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/api-pricing-protests-caused-reddit-to-crash-for-3-hours/\">shut Reddit </a><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/api-pricing-protests-caused-reddit-to-crash-for-3-hours/\">down </a><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/api-pricing-protests-caused-reddit-to-crash-for-3-hours/\">for three hours</a> in June. Protestors complicated matters further with moves like suddenly making subreddits not-safe-for-work (NSFW), all about John Oliver, or focusing on some unhelpful tweak of its original topic (like r/malefashionadvice only allowing posts related to the stylings of the 18th century).</p>\n<h2>It's a tough job...</h2>\n<p>Reddit's response has included threatening to remove moderators who are engaging in protests to actually removing them. Recently, efforts to replace the departed volunteers who were booted or quit have picked up steam. A Reddit employee going by ModCodeofConduct (Reddit has refused to disclose the real names of admins representing the company on the platform) has posted to numerous subreddits over recent days, including <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/IRLEasterEggs/comments/15b2fwf/new_moderators_needed_comment_on_this_post_to/\">r/IRLEasterEggs</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/donthelpjustfilm/comments/15b274o/new_moderators_needed_comment_on_this_post_to/\">r/donthelpjustfilm</a>,<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ActLikeYouBelong/comments/15b2az3/new_moderators_needed_comment_on_this_post_to/\"> r/ActLikeYouBelong</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/155ny6y/new_moderators_needed_comment_on_this_post_to/\">r/malefashionadvice</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/AccidentalRenaissance/comments/155nyrd/new_moderators_needed_comment_on_this_post_to/\">r/AccidentalRenaissance</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1957407#p3\">Read 27 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1957407&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"336830b413ca50216516ca690ba0df9faa8185fed8031bfbe7d6d35270859100","category":"Tech"}
