It’s fairly easy to warm your feet up a bit, depending on conditions, by adding a slightly thicker pair of summer <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-cycling-socks-for-summer\" target=\"_blank\">cycling socks</a>, swapping them out for warmer <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-best-winter-cycling-socks\" target=\"_blank\">winter cycling socks</a> (although this can affect the shoe’s fit and potentially reduce blood circulation to your toes, exacerbating cold feet), adding <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-cycling-overshoes\" target=\"_blank\">overshoes </a>or, once it gets proper cold, investing in a pair of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-cycling-shoes-for-winter-buyers-guide\" target=\"_blank\">winter road cycling shoes</a>. If you’re <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cycling-in-hot-weather-advice\" target=\"_blank\">cycling in hot weather</a> though, good ventilation will keep your feet much more comfortable and help stop them from swelling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dial closures have more-or-less taken over on top flight road shoes too, although Velcro still makes an appearance due to its lower weight. Lace-up shoes also keep weight down, but at the expense of adjustability while riding. Still, if they’re good enough for Tadej Pogačar…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Reviews of the best road cycling shoes </h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Specialized Torch 3.0 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-torch-3-0-shoes-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Rapha Pro Team – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/rapha-pro-team-shoes-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Shimano S-Phyre RC903 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/shimano-s-phyre-rc903-shoes-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>DMT KR4 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/dmt-kr4-road-cycling-shoes-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Van Rysel RCR – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/van-rysel-rcr-shoes-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Canyon Tempr CFR – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/canyon-tempr-cfr-road-cycling-shoes-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Lake CX333 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/lake-cx333-road-cycling-shoes-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Fizik Vento Infinito Carbon 2 – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/fizik-vento-infinito-carbon-2-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Giro Regime – <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/giro-regime-road-cycling-shoes-review\" target=\"_blank\">Read our full review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Why trust Cyclist’s advice?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/di-luca-killer-slr2-review-13-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"Di Luca Killer SLR2 bike\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/di-luca-killer-slr2-review-13-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/di-luca-killer-slr2-review-13-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/di-luca-killer-slr2-review-13-768x511.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/di-luca-killer-slr2-review-13-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/di-luca-killer-slr2-review-13-750x499.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/di-luca-killer-slr2-review-13-1140x759.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/di-luca-killer-slr2-review-13-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/di-luca-killer-slr2-review-13-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/di-luca-killer-slr2-review-13-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/di-luca-killer-slr2-review-13.jpg 2000w\" /><figcaption>Mike Massaro</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Cyclist</em>‘s team of reviewers has huge experience of riding and reviewing the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-road-bike\" target=\"_blank\">best road bikes </a>available and a whole range of other cycling equipment, including cycling shoes.

href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-torch-3-0-shoes-review\" target=\"_blank\">Specialized Torch 3.0</a> are now similar in appearance to the more premium S-Works Torch shoes, and borrow some of their key design features – including a thoughtfully sculpted heel design and a wider toe box – while remaining in a mid-range price bracket.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having inherited the looks and asymmetric dial setup of the S-Works shoes, our tester pointed out the rare incidence of ‘trickle up’ technology in the Specialized Torch 3.0, with a transaction of features and design moving in both directions across the range.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Specialized’s Retül fit system formulates its foot lasts based on scans of over 100,000 feet. This research has led to the inclusion of details like the ‘metatarsal button’ for reducing numbness and an outward sole tilt for improving body alignment while pedalling, features that contributed to a locked-in and not overly compressed ride feel for our tester. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Torch 3.0 shoes scored less well in the ventilation stakes, and the upper material lacked a bit of suppleness at least to begin with, but overall they performed as good all-rounders, suitable for riding at a range of different intensities.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/specialized-torch-3-0-shoes-review\" target=\"_blank\">Specialized Torch 3.0 shoes review</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=205647X1684865&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.specialized.com%2Fgb%2Fen%2Ftorch-30-road-shoes%2Fp%2F1000135004%3Fcolor%3D1000138010-1000135004\" target=\"_blank\">Specialized (£210)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Rapha Pro Team</h3>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"728\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/02/05225545/rapha-knit-shoe-1-970x728.jpg\" alt=\"rapha-knit-shoe-1\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h4>£295 | <a href=\"https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=18515&amp;awinaffid=1306327&amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rapha.cc%2Fgb%2Fen%2Fshop%2Fpro-team-shoes%2Fproduct%2FPOH01XXBLK\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Woven upper for higher thread count and less stretch</li>\n\n\n\n<li>No seams for less chance of rubbing</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite appearing similar initially to some of the other shoes on show, Rapha claims its Pro Team shoes are markedly different. The upper is woven, not knitted, which gives it a higher thread count.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rapha says its ‘Powerweave’ material can therefore be used to create more complex structures that are much less prone to stretching or abrasion. What’s more, the upper is seamless – which the brand says promotes comfort – and DWR-treated to better cope with wet conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At a claimed 250g per shoe, the ‘Powerweave’ upper contributes to the shoes’ light weight too. Dual Boa IP1 dials take care of a fairly conventional-looking closure pattern and the tongue is padded to disperse pressure across the rider’s foot.

Its CX333 shoes, designed for high-cadence, performance riding, come in three widths, two different upper materials, and 20 sizes – and are just one model of the dozen road shoes Lake offers. But our tester was particularly keen on CX333’s balance of comfort and performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pair of CX333s tested had a sturdy microfibre upper that contributed to a relatively bulky overall weight of 660g, but extensive arch support and internal padding was deemed a worthwhile trade-off. Fit is Lake’s calling card, and the CX333 shoes can literally be baked in the oven to make them tesselate to the heel. The Thermaform Carbon Fibre moulding process is straightforward and effective, albeit slightly unnerving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As some of Lake’s highest spec shoes, they also include a fibreglass layer that sits beneath the arched inner sole and on top of the carbon fibre sole plate to create a sandwich of stiffness and comfort.

Fizik also offers a wide version of the Infinito, easily replaceable walking pads, 20mm of fore-aft cleat adjustment and a well-constructed inner sole which are useful day-to-day details.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full </strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/fizik-vento-infinito-carbon-2-review\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Fizik Vento Infinito Carbon 2 review</strong></a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy now from </strong><a href=\"https://www.fizik.com/uk_en/vento-infinito-carbon-2.html\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Fizik (£349.99</strong>)</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Giro Regime</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"648\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GIRO5-970x648.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GIRO5-970x648.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GIRO5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GIRO5-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GIRO5-1536x1026.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GIRO5-2048x1368.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GIRO5-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GIRO5-1140x762.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GIRO5-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GIRO5-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/09/GIRO5-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4>£229.99 | <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=205647X1684865&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=15.7.1&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Freviews%2Fgiro-regime-road-cycling-shoes-review&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tredz.co.uk%2F.Giro-Regime-Road-Cycling-Shoes_231450.htm%3Fvariations%3Dcolour%3AWhite&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=0&amp;xuuid=e22a43b3f0406bd5f6fa50aa1e0a03a7&amp;abp=1&amp;xjsf=other_click__auxclick%20%5B2%5D\" target=\"_blank\">View offer</a></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Borrows tech from top-end Giro shoes</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Excellent value for the spec</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite not being at the top of Giro’s range, the Regimes benefit from enough trickle-down technology and top-end materials to make them a seriously strong option. Our tester put down some serious mileage in the Regimes, and the main headlines were long-lasting comfort, durability, foot support and – thanks to all that and a £229.99 pricetag – value.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The use of Synchwire material – a composite thermo-bonded film – helps to make the Regimes both strong and pliable and distributes pressure from the two Boa dials across the foot. In the cons column, the material wasn’t well ventilated and the shoes weigh 556g which isn’t particularly light, but it was very easy to clean and coupled with the ample padding, made wearing them very enjoyable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Giro saves its most premium carbon fibre plate for its higher spec models up the food chain, but if anything, slightly less stiffness contributed to the high comfort levels. Overall, while racers and weight-weenies might not be swayed, for most road cyclists the Regime is all the shoe you will need.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full </strong><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/giro-regime-road-cycling-shoes-review\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Giro Regime review</strong></a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Buy now from </strong><a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=205647X1684865&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=15.7.1&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyclist.co.uk%2Freviews%2Fgiro-regime-road-cycling-shoes-review&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tredz.co.uk%2F.Giro-Regime-Road-Cycling-Shoes_231450.htm%3Fvariations%3Dcolour%3AWhite&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=0&amp;xuuid=e22a43b3f0406bd5f6fa50aa1e0a03a7&amp;abp=1&amp;xjsf=other_click__auxclick%20%5B2%5D\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Tredz (£229.99)</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Check out our guide to the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-budget-road-cycling-shoes\" target=\"_blank\">best budget road cycling shoes </a>for more affordable options.</em></p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-cycling-overshoes\">Best cycling overshoes 2024 reviewed: Waterproof protection for your feet</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-cycling-shoes-for-winter-buyers-guide\">Best cycling shoes for winter: buyer’s guide</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-budget-road-cycling-shoes\">Best budget cycling shoes reviewed 2024: Cheap clip-in shoes</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-cycling-socks-for-summer\">Best cycling socks for summer: Top picks and how to choose</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-best-winter-cycling-socks\">Best winter cycling socks 2024: Keep your feet warm while riding in the cold</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-cycling-shoes\">Best road cycling shoes 2024 ridden, reviewed and rated</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Sam Challis &#124;
