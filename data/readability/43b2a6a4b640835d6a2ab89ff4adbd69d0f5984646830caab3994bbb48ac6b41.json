The study referenced by Clemson University positions it as one of the safest bike lights on the market.</p><p>It’s one of those concepts that makes you think, <em>why didn’t I think of that?</em> As you turn the crank, the lights on both sides of the flat aluminum pedals move, well, in a circle. In an appeal to intuition, the visual cue “instantly identifies you as a cyclist” to anyone nearby.</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/08144442/Studio-Pedal-11.jpg\" alt=\"arclight safest bike light\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/08144442/Studio-Pedal-11.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/08144442/Studio-Pedal-11-297x167.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/08144442/Studio-Pedal-11-800x450.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/08144442/Studio-Pedal-11-120x68.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/08144442/Studio-Pedal-11-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/08144442/Studio-Pedal-11.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/08144442/Studio-Pedal-11.jpg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/08144442/Studio-Pedal-11-297x167.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/08144442/Studio-Pedal-11-800x450.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/08144442/Studio-Pedal-11-120x68.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/08144442/Studio-Pedal-11-768x432.jpg 768w\"></p><p>Light also splashes from the pedals onto the ground, giving an even more noticeable signature.

However, technology and smart features are packed in tight.</p><p>The interchangeable light modules slide into the front and rear of the pedals in any orientation. Once they’re installed and active, they pretty much run the show: they sense when you approach and automatically turn on. They also sense when and if you flip your pedal, so you’re always lit up red behind and white in front. Shutoff is also automatic.</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/08144618/Kickstarter-Social-Posts-no-text-041.jpeg\" alt=\"arclight safest bike light\" width=\"1200\" height=\"745\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/08144618/Kickstarter-Social-Posts-no-text-041.jpeg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/08144618/Kickstarter-Social-Posts-no-text-041-297x184.jpeg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/08144618/Kickstarter-Social-Posts-no-text-041-800x497.jpeg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/08144618/Kickstarter-Social-Posts-no-text-041-120x75.jpeg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/08144618/Kickstarter-Social-Posts-no-text-041-768x477.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/08144618/Kickstarter-Social-Posts-no-text-041.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/08144618/Kickstarter-Social-Posts-no-text-041.jpeg 1200w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/08144618/Kickstarter-Social-Posts-no-text-041-297x184.jpeg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/08144618/Kickstarter-Social-Posts-no-text-041-800x497.jpeg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/08144618/Kickstarter-Social-Posts-no-text-041-120x75.jpeg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/08144618/Kickstarter-Social-Posts-no-text-041-768x477.jpeg 768w\"></p><p>They’re IP64 waterproof (solid against splashing water) and clip in and out magnetically. They also plug directly into standard USB charging ports. Set the lights to steady-state (3 hours battery life), flash (11 hours), or “eco-flash” (fast strobe, 36 hours), and away you go.</p><p>And even though the company is stoked about its pedal-mounted system, the lights come with modular mounts so that you can use them as traditional headlights or seat post lights. The smart red/white functionality and magnetic attachment apply no matter where you mount them.</p><p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/08144807/Inserting-light-in-pedal.jpeg\" alt=\"arclight safest bike light\" width=\"1014\" height=\"661\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/08144807/Inserting-light-in-pedal.jpeg 1014w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/08144807/Inserting-light-in-pedal-297x194.jpeg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/08144807/Inserting-light-in-pedal-800x521.jpeg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/08144807/Inserting-light-in-pedal-120x78.jpeg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/08144807/Inserting-light-in-pedal-768x501.jpeg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1014px) 100vw, 1014px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/08144807/Inserting-light-in-pedal.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/08144807/Inserting-light-in-pedal.jpeg 1014w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/08144807/Inserting-light-in-pedal-297x194.jpeg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/08144807/Inserting-light-in-pedal-800x521.jpeg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/08144807/Inserting-light-in-pedal-120x78.jpeg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/08144807/Inserting-light-in-pedal-768x501.jpeg 768w\"></p><h2>Options and funding</h2><p>Despite its massive popularity (over 700 backers in two days), Arclight pedals were still readily available on pre-order from Kickstarter as of this writing.
