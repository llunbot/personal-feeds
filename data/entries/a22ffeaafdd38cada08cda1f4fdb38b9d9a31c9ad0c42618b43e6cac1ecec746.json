For example, it introduces a new mode called StandBy that allows it to act as a sort of smart clock with special widgets when it's placed in landscape mode while connected to power—\"clock radio mode,\" if you will.</p>\n<p>It also adds a new journaling app, improved search and other tweaks for Messages, greatly improved autocorrect, offline Maps, FaceTime video voicemails, a safety feature for keeping your friends or family updated about your status called \"Check In,\" and an overhaul of AirDrop. Further, it will now transcribe voicemails as they come in, allowing you to screen calls like in the olden days. You can even invoke Siri without saying \"hey\" first.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1964612#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1964612&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a22ffeaafdd38cada08cda1f4fdb38b9d9a31c9ad0c42618b43e6cac1ecec746","category":"Tech"}
