They are likely to be joined by an international partner astronaut, probably Japan's Koichi Wakata, for the mission.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1800940#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1800940&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"93f6ace4f33cde1d5e0bddc1b77aa4d7ddf0ba766ccdc29dec39a9009c8fcd6e","category":"Tech"}
