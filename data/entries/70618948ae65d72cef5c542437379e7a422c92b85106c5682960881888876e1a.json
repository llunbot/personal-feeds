{"title":"Moom 4 Is Excellent, But Not Available in the Mac App Store","link":"https://manytricks.com/blog/?p=6385#more-6385","date":1728489710000,"content":"\n<p>Many Tricks:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Moom 4 is only available directly from Many Tricks; it is not\navailable on the Mac App Store. If it were our choice, it would\nalso be in the Mac App Store, but it’s not our choice.</p>\n\n<p>Why isn’t it in the Mac App Store? Because the Mac App Store does\nnot allow apps that aren’t sandboxed. And Moom 4 cannot be\nsandboxed, as its use of <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/accessibility/accessibility-api\">the Accessibility API</a> makes that\nimpossible. So how was Moom 3, which also uses the Accessibility\nAPI, on the Mac App Store? Simple: Moom 3 was in the store before\nApple required all Mac App Store apps to be sandboxed, so it was\nallowed to remain in the store, as long as we never added new\nfeatures.</p>\n\n<p>If Apple ever changes the rules, we will submit Moom 4 for Mac App\nStore review, but until/unless those rules change, you can only\nget Moom 4 directly from us.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What a perfect example of the shortcomings of the Mac App Store. MacOS 15 Sequoia \nadds <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/12/macos-sequoia-window-tiling/\">new window-tiling features</a> that, on the surface, you might think Sherlock Moom — a longstanding Mac utility that automates window resizing/arranging. But Moom does so much more than Sequoia’s tiling features. It’s a fabulous utility from a great developer, but Many Tricks isn’t allowed to offer it through the Mac App Store. </p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/10/09/moom-4-app-store\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"70618948ae65d72cef5c542437379e7a422c92b85106c5682960881888876e1a","category":"Tech"}
