The move comes after years of criticism from privacy experts, media outlets, and regulators, warning that tech like PimEyes could be abused to stalk children online.</p>\n<p>PimEyes CEO Giorgi Gobronidze told The Times that in addition to setting a \"no harm policy,\" the company has also implemented new AI age-detection technology to detect and block searches of minors. This update is due to privacy concerns that \"images of children might be used by [some] individuals with a twisted moral compass and values, such as pedophiles, child predators,\" Gobronidze said. Critics had long warned that PimEyes' tech made it easy to upload a photo of any child and quickly find other photos or discover their name and address.</p>\n<p>By design, PimEyes is supposed to make it easy for people to figure out where their own photos have been posted online, but PimEyes has no way to stop people from searching for photos of other people, The Times reported. The platform's \"data security unit\" has monitored suspicious activity in the past by flagging any upload of a child's photo or detecting when male users repeatedly search for photos of women, the BBC <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-63544169\">reported</a>. Gobronidze confirmed to The Times that out of 118,000 searches per day of PimEyes' database of 3 billion images, the company has detected and banned more than 200 accounts conducting \"inappropriate searches of childrenâ€™s faces.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1978190#p3\">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1978190&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6d63905e0c13701ecad313d1c0d3311d501b557a82b6a6506a2e78aec3eca6ee","category":"Tech"}
