On a profile just shy of 200km, no rider ventured into the day-long breakaway. It was only when<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/pro-cycling-sponsors\"> TotalEnergies’ </a>Thomas Gachignard attacked that a rider saw daylight between themselves and the bunch. His lead barely broke the two-minute marker during his 40km-long solo effort, making the whimsical seven-minute leash handed to breakaways in the 2010s seem like the distant past.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This breakaway stalemate has been a common occurrence at the 2024 race. After 17 stages, only four this year have gone to the breakaway (Stages 1, 2, 9 and 17). That is a hit rate far lower than typical Tours of the past decade, which usually see around 25% to 33% of stages decided by the breakaway at this point. Strangely, three of these wins this year came before the first rest day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, no pure flat stage has slipped into the hands of the breakaway. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\" target=\"_blank\">Mountain and hilly stages</a> have also been swept up by the GC favourites instead of hopeful chancers. Tour de France breakaways are becoming smaller and shorter-lived than they have in recent memory. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, is the end of the Tour de France breakaway, and why are breakaways dying out?</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Increased stakes in the GC and sprints</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T163500.238-970x647.png\" alt=\"tour de france 2024 peloton\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T163500.238-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T163500.238-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T163500.238-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T163500.238-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T163500.238-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T163500.238-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T163500.238-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T163500.238-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T163500.238-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T163500.238.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>More teams in the Tour de France are bringing sprinters and GC leaders than before. With increased interest in these competitions, teams find it ever more fruitless to send riders up the road each day. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Results are more important in this current era, and filling time on the TV broadcast has become less desirable. In an age of social media where stage results and finishing line photos are spread around, there are fewer column inches – or rather, TikTok seconds – given to the morning break.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps this is also caused by <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/uci-points-relegation\" target=\"_blank\">the new UCI ranking system</a>, where teams are promoted and relegated based on UCI rankings. Teams lower down in the standings sit in a precarious position in need of points to remain in the top level of cycling, the WorldTour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under this system, no points are rewarded for featuring in a breakaway, and there are no UCI points on offer for <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-prize-money\" target=\"_blank\">breakaway prizes such as intermediate and mountain sprints</a>. The daily combativity prize for the most influential breakaway rider is also met with no UCI points. Even wearing the polka dot jersey yields no benefit in terms of points. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This takes away any spur to go in the breakaway for teams wanting to stay afloat in the UCI rankings. Instead, finishing inside the top 15 of a stage is seen as more lucrative as it yields more points. Similarly, GC standings are rewarded with more points than any breakaway battle. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The hungry GC wolves</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T162337.024-970x647.png\" alt=\"tadej poagacar and jonas vingegaard riding gc at the tour de france 2024\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T162337.024-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T162337.024-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T162337.024-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T162337.024-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T162337.024-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T162337.024-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T162337.024-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T162337.024-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T162337.024-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T162337.024.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/who-are-the-favourites-for-tour-de-france\" target=\"_blank\">The GC riders</a> are easy scapegoats when it comes to the faltering hopes of Tour de France breakaways. It’s becoming more common for the top climbers to cruelly sweep the escapees in favour of adding another stage win to their <em>palmarès</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently at the Giro, we saw Tadej Pogačar break young Guilio Pelizzari’s heart on Stage 16. Likewise, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/primoz-roglic\" target=\"_blank\">Primož Roglič</a> caused a stir at the 2021 Paris-Nice when he caught the day’s break in the final kilometre on Stage 7 on his way to a third stage win at the race while also cementing his overall lead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The current <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-big-four\" target=\"_blank\">crop of GC riders</a> are poaching more stage wins than those of the past couple of decades. This is in part down to faster racing and more dominant team control in the peloton. The superteams of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/visma-lease-a-bike\" target=\"_blank\">Visma-Lease a Bike</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/uae-team-emirates\" target=\"_blank\">UAE Team Emirates</a> clinically control the race on the crucial mountain and hilly days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With bonus seconds on offer at the finishing line, and sometimes at points close to the finale, stage wins are becoming more worthwhile for the GC battle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Breakaway riders have unsurprisingly been unhappy about this trend. ‘In the long run, it is a bit destructive for the entertainment that Visma and the UAE are terribly greedy,’ says Uno X rider Johannes Kulset. Similarly, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/derek-gee-interview\" target=\"_blank\">Derek Gee told us before the Tour</a> that it is getting harder to predict breakaway days too, and he pinned that on the wider state of play in the GC.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The death of the ‘breakaway team’</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T162904.736-970x647.png\" alt=\"totalenergies in tour de france 2024 breakaway\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T162904.736-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T162904.736-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T162904.736-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T162904.736-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T162904.736-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T162904.736-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T162904.736-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T162904.736-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T162904.736-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T162904.736.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Charly Lopez</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In Grand Tours gone by, teams would often come with the intention of searching out breakaway wins, or even breakaway cameos. Cast your minds back to Team Europcar and IAM Cycling in the Tour de France, and Gianni Savio’s Androni squad and the Italian Bardiani team in the Giro d’Italia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the 2010s, the results from these teams were impressive. <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/i-ve-learned-to-live-with-the-popularity-thomas-voeckler-profile\" target=\"_blank\">Thomas Voeckler</a> went into the yellow jersey in 2011 from a breakaway and almost won the whole thing. At the Giro, Bardiani raided breakaways and secured plenty of stage wins courtesy of cult heroes such as Stefano Pirazzi and Enrico Battaglin. The idea of a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0kQh5mEq-Y\" target=\"_blank\">Marco Canola-style</a> breakaway win at a Grand Tour, particularly the Tour de France, now seems wildly outdated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ‘breakaway team’ role used to be filled by the invitee teams such as TotalEnergies and Uno X, or similarly by teams with fewer GC resources. Recently, there have been fewer statements from team directors discussing a plan of ‘riding for breakaways from day one’. These teams seem to have evolved over time into a ‘lesser GC’ or ‘sprinting team’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just look at Arkéa-B&amp;B Hotels. They started their Tour de France journey in 2014 as a plucky breakaway team, but have now evolved into a team with hopes of reaching the top ten in sprints rather than scooping up combativity awards, despite the fact that their only Tour stage win in their history came from one of the few successful breakaways in this year’s race.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The end of the ‘breakaway rider’ archetype</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-17T165507.226-970x647.png\" alt=\"tour de france 2024 breakaways carapaz and hindley\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-17T165507.226-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-17T165507.226-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-17T165507.226-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-17T165507.226-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-17T165507.226-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-17T165507.226-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-17T165507.226-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-17T165507.226-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-17T165507.226-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-17T165507.226.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Charly Lopez</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Conversely, the death of the breakaway team may be a result of a changing definition of a breakaway rider. With faster speeds and a higher level of training, it has become harder for riders to specialise purely in the breakaways. The aforementioned riders from the 2010s would be unlikely to stand out in a break in the 2020s. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the 2024 Tour de France, the likes of <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/gallery-giro-ditalia-2022-stage-20\" target=\"_blank\">Jai Hindley</a>, Richard Carapaz and <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/simon-yates-profile\" target=\"_blank\">Simon Yates</a> – all of whom are former Grand Tour winners – have been consistently searching for a place in the morning break. On Stage 17 for example, the first successful breakaway since the first rest day, the top three on the stage standings were all occupied by former Grand Tour champions and podium finishers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, Classics stars and A-list riders are jumping into the breakaway more than ever. No wonder the small teams are changing tack.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The false hope of the polka dot jersey</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T161939.069-970x647.png\" alt=\"richard carapaz in breakaway at tour de france 2024\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T161939.069-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T161939.069-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T161939.069-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T161939.069-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T161939.069-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T161939.069-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T161939.069-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T161939.069-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T161939.069-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T161939.069.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The mountains classification was <em>the</em> prize of old for breakaway hopefuls. With plenty of points on offer on mountain stages, riders would fight tooth and nail to make the early morning break in the hope of rising up the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/history-of-the-tour-de-france-jerseys\" target=\"_blank\">King of the Mountains</a> standings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nowadays, the allure of the polka dot jersey has been dashed by GC teams. Whether this is the fault of the GC teams or the jersey’s points system is up for debate, but the polka dots are becoming more and more of a prize for the GC elite.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since 2020, only once has the polka dot jersey gone to a breakaway rider. This rider, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giulio-ciccone-cyclist\" target=\"_blank\">Guilio Cicconne</a>, is now fighting for top ten at this year’s Tour de France – that’s all you need to know. Otherwise, the polka dot jersey has been won by the eventual<em> <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/in-celebration-of-the-yellow-jersey\" target=\"_blank\">maillot jaune</a></em>. Before, the polka dot jersey was fought between riders who were courageous enough to outfox their breakaway companions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without this polka dot reward for breakaway efforts up the road, there is little incentive for riders to jump in the breakaway on mountain stages, particularly if UAE Team Emirates or Visma-Lease a Bike are pacing behind for a stage win. Uno-X’s Jonas Abrahamsen was the most present breakaway rider in 2024, but as soon as he lost his polka dot lead to Pogačar he stopped.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The top three on GC, Pogačar, Vingegaard and Evenepoel, currently fill the top three slots in the KoM classification, making it pointless for a rider to reach out for polka dot glory in the final week of racing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Fewer riders on teams, fewer riders to lose</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-17T133841.539-970x647.png\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-17T133841.539-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-17T133841.539-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-17T133841.539-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-17T133841.539-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-17T133841.539-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-17T133841.539-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-17T133841.539-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-17T133841.539-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-17T133841.539-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-17T133841.539.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Charly Lopez</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Grand Tour teams now comprise eight riders, whereas before 2018, there were nine. With this cut in numbers, teams were forced to drop one rider from their ideal Grand Tour startlist. And often, the first rider to go from these lineups was the <em>rouleur</em>-breakaway type.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More importantly, with fewer numbers, teams need to be tighter on their resources. In order to control the race and support sprinting and or GC hopes, teams need to be more conservative. In a team of eight, roles are more regimented than the previous mandate of nine-man teams. It’s not worth sending a rider up the road on a sprint stage in the name of fiery action instead of protecting the long-term ambitions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, the flexibility to go in the break is a luxury more than a necessity. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>No room for lady luck</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T162700.607-970x647.png\" alt=\"tour de france 2024 breakaways\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T162700.607-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T162700.607-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T162700.607-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T162700.607-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T162700.607-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T162700.607-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T162700.607-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T162700.607-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T162700.607-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-16T162700.607.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Charly Lopez</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There is reason to believe that breakaways are a victim of cycling’s new technological wave. Nothing can be left to chance anymore in this data-driven age.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the peloton’s perspective, pulling back the break has become more methodical. In the team car, calculations can be made using power data, wind forecasts and average speeds to predict exactly when the breakaway will be caught.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>GPS analysis via Google Streetview and Veloviewer has also made the finale more meticulously planned. Teams now have access to mapping and route data in a way they never have before. Riders rehearse the finale and visualise the approach to the line before the stage even begins. There are fewer chances for breakaways to outwit the peloton in a hectic finale or a secret roundabout these days.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>They’re not gone, they’re just…different</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-17T164525.144-970x647.png\" alt=\"tour de france breakaway stage 17 2024\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-17T164525.144-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-17T164525.144-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-17T164525.144-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-17T164525.144-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-17T164525.144-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-17T164525.144-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-17T164525.144-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-17T164525.144-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-17T164525.144-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/07/file-2024-07-17T164525.144.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Charly Lopez</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Doom and gloom aside, breakaways are not dead at the Tour de France. They’re just different. Whether that’s for the best for riders and fans, we wait to find out. However, for those hopeful of a solo underdog winner up in front, I’m afraid the future looks bleak.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At recent Tours de France, the escape groups have been billed with Grand Tour podium finishers, rainbow jerseys and monument winners. To even win from a break nowadays at the Tour, you need a prestigious <em>palmarès</em> and then some.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s more, it takes almost 100 kilometres for the breakaway to even form on rolling stages. They’re fought out like one-day Classics rather than Grand Tour stages – full throttle from the start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is far-flung to imagine a stage where a French nobody stuns the race against the odds. Neither can we imagine a breakaway rider receiving the<em> maillot jaune</em> on loan anymore. More brutally for the optimists, it’s not enough to attack on a couple of Alpine days to win the polka-dot jersey. Every move off the front of the peloton is tracked by ruthless calculations or by GC teams strangling the peloton in the hunt for yet more stage win.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s all change at the head of the race. What’s that turn of phrase? Don’t cry because it’s over, smile because it happened.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/winners-losers-week-two-tour-de-france-2024\">The winners and losers of the second week of the Tour de France 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/best-romain-bardet-moments\">5 of the best Romain Bardet moments</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-predictions-2024\">Cyclist’s Tour de France predictions 2024</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-climbs\">The climbs that will decide the 2024 Tour de France</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\">Men’s Tour de France 2024: Route, how to watch and all you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-breakaways\">Is this the end of Tour de France breakaways?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Ewan Wilson &#124; Staff Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"0b06d0b2b0e15e3a3fd792df341ad37ff39f97ffc143c5213b95dcbea234b16d","category":"Cycling"}
