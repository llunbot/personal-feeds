Pixel Drops, which arrive quarterly, refine and expand the features on Pixel phones. This probably won't come as a surprise, but AI plays a big role in the changes rolling out to Pixels this time around. There are also some new connectivity and photography options.</p>\n<p>A long-overdue update is coming to Google's Pixel Studio app, which is preinstalled on the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/pixel-9-family-the-just-hardware-review-no-ai/\">Pixel 9 series</a>. The app lets you generate AI images, but person generation was not available at launch because of well-documented problems with the Imagen 3 model's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/googles-hidden-ai-diversity-prompts-lead-to-outcry-over-historically-inaccurate-images/\">penchant for diversity</a>. Google re-enabled person generation on the web about six months ago, but Pixel Studio is just now gaining this ability.</p>\n<p>Google's AI will also begin butting in if it suspects a caller or message is <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/google-wants-ai-to-listen-to-your-phone-calls-detect-scam-callers/\">attempting to scam you</a>. Google says this feature (previously available as a limited beta) is not foolproof, as scammers often change up their tactics. However, it may help catch some of the less sophisticated scams that regularly ensnare your less technologically literate family and friends. This feature will be available in Google Messages with the Pixel 6 and later, but the phone call scam detection will require a Pixel 9 because it uses on-device AI features that only exist on Google's latest phones. That makes it a little less creepy.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/03/googles-march-pixel-drop-is-here-with-a-ton-of-android-upgrades/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/03/googles-march-pixel-drop-is-here-with-a-ton-of-android-upgrades/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ryan Whitwam","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"15a747f972e4fb2227bae1e8b834f9f9097bdab05b937bc1baad80af12210629","category":"Tech"}
