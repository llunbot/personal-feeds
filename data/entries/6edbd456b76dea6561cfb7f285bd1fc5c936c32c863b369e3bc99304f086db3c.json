The 2nd- and 3rd-generation models both improved aggressively on the first model's small screen and mediocre battery life, arriving at something that was laptop-y enough to fill in for a laptop but tablet-y enough to be unique.</p>\n<p>And then, things just sort of... stood still. Some of the ports changed over the years—late 2019's Surface Pro 7 finally got USB-C—but the basic design and accessory compatibility have been exactly the same in every mainline Surface Pro between 2014 and now.</p>\n    <div>\n        <div>\n            <div>\n                <div>\n                    <div>\n                                                <h3>Microsoft Surface Pro 8                                                </h3>\n                        <div>\n                                                            <ul>\n                                        \n                                    <li>\n                                        <a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/EaeZ12\" target=\"_blank\">From $1099 at Best Buy</a>\n                                    </li>\n                                        \n                                    <li>\n                                        <a href=\"https://fave.co/3uKcMXC\" target=\"_blank\">From $1099 at Microsoft</a>\n                                    </li>\n                                                                    </ul>\n                                                    </div>\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n                            </div>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n            <div>(Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through <a href=\"/affiliate-link-policy/\">affiliate programs</a>.)</div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n\n<p>Five generations' worth of accessory interoperability is laudable and useful in some cases, especially if you're using multiple generations of Surface Pro tablets in a business and you need to be able to swap parts quickly. But some elements of the Surface Pro 3 design have been showing their age in the last couple of generations—Thunderbolt and/or USB-C ports accomplish nearly everything that the proprietary Surface Connect port is trying to do, and other laptops, tablets, and convertibles had been shrinking their display bezels for a few years to increase screen size.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1800841#p3\">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1800841&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6edbd456b76dea6561cfb7f285bd1fc5c936c32c863b369e3bc99304f086db3c","category":"Tech"}
