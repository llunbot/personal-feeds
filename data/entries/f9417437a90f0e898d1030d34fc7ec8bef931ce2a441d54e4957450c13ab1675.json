That’s where Muuvr (pronounced ‘mover’), the latest app to grace the cycling world, comes in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Calling itself a ‘fitness experience’, Muuvr works alongside existing fitness apps rewarding users with ‘Muuvs’ for their fitness journey, which can be redeemed for apparel, equipment, and event entries.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How does it work?</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/Muuvr-2-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/Muuvr-2-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/Muuvr-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/Muuvr-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/Muuvr-2-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/Muuvr-2-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/Muuvr-2-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/Muuvr-2-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/Muuvr-2-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/Muuvr-2-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/Muuvr-2.jpg 1800w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Muuvr rewards users for every stride, ride and stroke with its in-app currency called Muuvs. They can then spend these Muuvs on clothing, equipment and event entries in the Muuvr marketplace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pairing with apps such as Apple Fitness, Wahoo and Garmin Connect, Muuvr calculates how many Muuvs a user has earned using its bespoke sports science that is benchmarked against every user’s unique activity effort. This means that every user’s earning potential is on the same level, regardless of age, gender or ability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Essentially, a pro cyclist and a commuter cyclist will be able to earn the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The app has seven career ranks that users can progress up through with the activities they complete. There is a community feel to the app, with in-app challenges and clubs, and you can compare your activities and Muuvs balance with your friends too. There are also collectibles, which are digital items (think NFT) in the form of images, sounds or videos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Muuvr does not connect with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/strava\" target=\"_blank\">Strava </a>so users will need to connect with Apple Fit, Garmin, Fitbit, Zwift, Wahoo, Polar, or Suunto with more fitness apps coming soon.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n

semi-intensive activity a week to earn around 7,000 to 8,000 Muuvs per year which equates to around £70.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Head over to the Muuvr marketplace and there are plenty of items on offer, including a lot of Huub and Brownlee cycling gear, as well as event entries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s worth noting that the marketplace isn’t fully functional just yet, you can’t buy anything currently and don’t expect to get <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-cycling-deals\" target=\"_blank\">Black Friday deals</a> on it either.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Initial

have to do anything on it, if you don’t want to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It processes your activities and rewards you for them. Simple.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve been using it for a few weeks now and I’ve really enjoyed it. Unlike some apps that might remind me that I haven’t done a workout, Muuvr sends positive push notifications, congratulating me for moving up another level or for unlocking a reward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I haven’t quite grasped the attraction of having collectibles, and I’m also not expecting to make big money from it either, but for an app that can run in the background and accrue a few pounds for simply riding your bike? It doesn’t seem like a bad idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To join Muuvr <a href=\"https://muuvr.io/\" target=\"_blank\">download the app for iOS or Android</a>. </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/muuvr-fitness-app\">Can the Muuvr app really get you free stuff?</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Emma Cole &#124; Features Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"f9417437a90f0e898d1030d34fc7ec8bef931ce2a441d54e4957450c13ab1675","category":"Cycling"}
