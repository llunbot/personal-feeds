Moore will remain as showrunner while also serving as executive producer, alongside series stalwarts Ben Nedivi, Bradley Thompson, David O. Weddle, Matt Wolpert and Nichole M. Beattie.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWith season three expected to be released in mid 2022, the WGA page has season four production kicking off that same year and running into 2023, so it'll be a while yet before we see it on Apple's streaming TV service, assuming the listing is correct. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n\"For All Mankind\" has proven to be one of Apple's more popular ‌Apple TV+‌ shows. It explores what might have happened if the global space race had never ended in an alternate history where the USSR beats the United States to the moon. The story is told through the lives of NASA astronauts and their families, who are at the center of extraordinary events.
