With prices starting at $1,299, the original model's standard specs including a 1.1GHz dual-core Intel Core M processor, integrated Intel HD 5300 graphics, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"Apple has reinvented the notebook with the new MacBook,\" said Apple's former marketing chief <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/phil-schiller/\">Phil Schiller</a> in a <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2015/03/09Apple-Unveils-All-New-MacBook/\">March 2015 press release</a>. \"Every component of the MacBook reveals a new innovation. From its fanless design, ultra-thin Retina display and full-size keyboard that's 34 percent thinner, to its all-new Force Touch trackpad, versatile USB-C port and breakthrough terraced battery design, the new MacBook is the future of the notebook.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe 12-inch MacBook was also the first MacBook model to feature Apple's infamous butterfly switch keyboard design, which was prone to failure and eventually dropped from the entire MacBook lineup after years of complaints and lawsuits. Apple last updated the 12-inch MacBook in June 2017, and it was discontinued in July 2019.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple classifies a product as technologically obsolete once more than seven years have passed since the company stopped distributing it for sale. The original 12-inch MacBook was discontinued in April 2016 upon the release of a second-generation model with improved specs, so the laptop recently crossed that seven-year mark.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition to the original 12-inch MacBook becoming obsolete, Apple has classified the stainless steel models of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-watch-2/\">Apple Watch Series 2</a> as vintage. Aluminum Series 2 models were previously classified as vintage <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/30/apple-2013-2014-imacs-obsolete/\">last November</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe vintage products list features devices that Apple stopped distributing for sale more than five years ago and less than seven years ago. Apple provides service and parts for vintage devices for up to seven years, or as required by law, but repairs are subject to parts availability.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 8</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/vintage-and-obsolete/\">Vintage and Obsolete Apple Products</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook.129\">MacBook</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/30/original-12-inch-macbook-obsolete/\">Apple Says Original 12-Inch MacBook Now Obsolete</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-original-12-inch-macbook-now-obsolete.2394643/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Eric Slivka","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d0fbc74f733bcc99fca72b07c85c790e2e3b5324e87658d7e8624e51448b8606","category":"Apple"}
