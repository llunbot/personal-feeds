Your friends will also be able to see the videos that you have liked, which is something to be aware of.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn this new Reels feed filled with friend recommendations, there will be an option to \"start a conversation\" with someone over a reel that they've liked.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"We want Instagram to not only be a place where you consume entertaining content, but one where you connect over that content with friends,\" Instagram head Adam Mosseri <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/DE7eV_zxKbx/\">said in a video</a> announcing the change.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nInstagram used to have a dedicated Activity feed that offered up this information, but it was removed several years ago. It is not yet known if Instagram plans to provide an opt-out for the new feed.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new feed is rolling out in a handful of countries right now, with Instagram set to expand it in the future.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nInstagram competitor TikTok could be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/17/tiktok-january-19-ban-imminent/\">unavailable to use</a> starting on Sunday, which is the day U.S. app stores will be prohibited from distributing the app. Instagram could absorb some displaced TikTok users if that ends up happening.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/instagram/\">Instagram</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/17/instagram-new-reels-friend-feature/\">Instagram Adds New Features to Reels as TikTok Ban Looms</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/instagram-adds-new-features-to-reels-as-tiktok-ban-looms.2447606/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6916576a4f996b0c5d992a3a07c4def09fab2d3c00d2935013af0658d20d21f7","category":"Apple"}
