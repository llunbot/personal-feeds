This comes after a disappointing reception to the show’s second season in France alongside the decision to cover the Tour de France Femmes in 2025 <a href=\"https://www.leparisien.fr/sports/cyclisme/tour-de-france/cyclisme-pourquoi-netflix-va-arreter-sa-serie-sur-le-tour-de-france-13-02-2025-E45WXJLVGZFEDI4463VNM4OZU4.php\" target=\"_blank\">according to reports from French newspaper <em>Le Parisien</em></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The show, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/james-gay-rees-tour-de-france-unchained-interview\">made by Box To Box Films</a>, follows the ins and outs of a handful of Tour de France squads.<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/tour-de-france-unchained-netflix-season-2-review\"> The eight-part series was met with positive reviews</a> within the cycling community, with some hoping for the show to become cycling’s equivalent to Netflix’s hit F1 series <em>Drive to Survive</em>. However, Netflix’s Tour de France production disgruntled some pros, including <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/tom-pidcock-podcast\">Tom Pidcock</a> and Wout van Aert who were both unhappy with how they were portrayed in the final edit. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third and final series of <em>Tour de France: Unchained</em> is set to be released this June ahead of the 2025 Tour de France, which will kick off in Lille on Saturday 5th July. Recounting the 2024 Tour, the final season of <em>Unchained </em>will include behind-the-scenes footage within UAE Team Emirates, Visma-Lease a Bike and Soudal-QuickStep among other top teams.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Production thwarted</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"663\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/GettyImages-2162926881-970x663.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/GettyImages-2162926881-970x663.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/GettyImages-2162926881-300x205.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/GettyImages-2162926881-768x525.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/GettyImages-2162926881-1536x1049.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/GettyImages-2162926881-2048x1399.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/GettyImages-2162926881-750x512.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/GettyImages-2162926881-1140x779.jpg 1140w\" /><figcaption>Tim de Waele/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>After the release of its first two series in June 2023 and 2024, <em>Tour de France: Unchained</em> was met with relatively strong support internationally, with the show cracking Netflix’s weekly top 10 in a handful of countries. However, the viewing figures for the second series in France were underwhelming. Given the show was crafted with a French audience in mind, and with the aim of consolidating the platform’s subscription numbers in France, the show required rethinking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Netflix has not officially confirmed the show’s cancellation, those involved previously in its production have told reporters in France that they have not been contacted to discuss the possibility of making a fourth season, which would the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/tour-de-france-route-live-tv-guide-startlist-stage-by-stage\">2025 Tour de France</a>. Without production in the works, it’s looking increasingly likely that the show will conclude after its third series is released in June.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+1\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-1-970x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-1-970x300.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-1-300x93.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-1-768x238.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-1-1536x476.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-1-2048x634.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-1-750x232.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/01/Subs-flash-160-for-web-1-1140x353.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One French team told <em>Le Parisien</em>, ‘At the end of January, Netflix usually contacts us about filming with some of our riders in the spring,’ but the team hasn’t received a call from Netflix at all this year. ‘It seems that the message is clear.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another source told <em>Le Parisien</em> that the nature of cycling had become ‘too repetitive’ for Netflix to keep covering. The source, an insider within the Tour de France’s organisation, speculated that Tadej Pogačar’s dominance was off-putting to the show’s producers saying: ‘With Pogačar crushing everything, the suspense seems complicated to maintain.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the<em> Le Parisien </em>report <a href=\"https://x.com/dnlbenson/status/1889997065566216355?s=46&amp;t=TDTtttQK1BkrDzptlBR_TA\"
