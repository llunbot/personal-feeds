Hooked, on the other hand, has no apparent link to an ‌Apple TV+‌ series. Hooked is still published by ‌Apple TV+‌ in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-podcasts/\">Apple Podcasts</a> and it remains unclear if Apple will create a dedicated channel for Apple Original podcasts. Hooked is produced by Campside Media, and Apple describes the series as follows:<blockquote>When Tony Hathaway was arrested outside a Seattle bank in February 2014, it brought an end to one of the most prolific bank robbery streaks in American history. Hathaway robbed 30 banks in a single year, all within a 30-mile radius of his suburban home. But that’s not the most surprising part of this story. Before Hathaway was a masterful bank robber—a shape-shifting professional who confounded multiple police departments and the FBI—he was a top design engineer at Boeing, one of America’s most important companies. Hathaway traveled the world in business class, working on the 747, while hiding a gigantic secret: an OxyContin addiction that ultimately unraveled his life. Based on three years of conversations between Hathaway and journalist Josh Dean, Hooked is a different kind of crime story that takes listeners on an exceptional and very personal tour of America’s opioid epidemic.</blockquote>Apple has ramped up its podcast production output over the past year and is rumored to be <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/apple-podcast-subscription-service/\">working on a podcast streaming subscription service</a> to better compete with Spotify. Hooked appears to be another step toward bolstering ‌Apple Podcasts‌' ability to rival Spotify.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe first three episodes of Hooked are available now <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/hooked/id1592401710\">in the Apple Podcasts app</a> or <a href=\"https://rss.art19.com/hooked\">via RSS in other podcast players</a>, with new episodes becoming available on Wednesdays.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nYesterday, ‌Apple Podcasts‌ gained two new subscription-based channels: BBC Studios and Slate. BBC Studios gives subscribers in the U.S. and Canada access to shows that were previously only accessible in the UK.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-podcasts/\">Apple Podcasts</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/03/apple-debuts-true-crime-podcast-hooked/\">Apple Debuts True-Crime Podcast 'Hooked' as First Standalone Original</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-debuts-true-crime-podcast-hooked-as-first-standalone-original.2321595/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=9YtJ07pFayA:TgIGsxQ0N_I:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=9YtJ07pFayA:TgIGsxQ0N_I:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/9YtJ07pFayA\" />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c6054a5e590717868f3ee8cb4ef9a6908dc5868e40244b223565187396c814b3","category":"Apple"}
