Sign in for the Free or Pro Tier of Amazon Q Developer, and open your project in your IDE. You can authenticate for the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/q-free-tier.html\">Free Tier</a> with <a href=\"https://community.aws/builderid?trk=3e9b6713-31e2-4b27-91ca-f9a1829daa5a&amp;sc_channel=el\">AWS Builder ID</a> or for the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/q-pro-tier.html\">Pro Tier</a> with <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html\">AWS IAM Identity Center</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>1. Enhanced documentation in codebases</strong><br /> You can now generate comprehensive documentation, such as readmes and data flow diagrams about the codebase in your preferred IDE. With Amazon Q Developer handling the labor-intensive task of documentation, you can focus your efforts on designing and authoring code—all while maintaining quality based on software engineering best practices.</p> \n<p>To start the documentation with your IDE, open the chat panel and type <code>/doc</code>.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/26/2024-amazon-q-developer-1-doc.jpg\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1010\" /></p> \n<p>Now you can create a README or update an existing README in your project. It will scan source files, create knowledge graph, summarize source files, and generation documents. When complete, check out the created REAME file and choose <strong>Accept </strong>to use this document in the code editor.</p> \n<p><strong> 2. Supporting code reviews to detect and resolve code quality issues</strong><br /> You can identify and resolve a spectrum of code quality issues pertaining to code smells, anti-patterns, naming convention violations, potential bugs, logical errors, code duplication, poor documentation and security vulnerabilities, as well as AWS best practices across your IDE or GitLab repository.</p> \n<p>This automated code review process empowers your development teams to save substantial time, improve productivity, and maintain consistency in code quality, ultimately enabling faster feature releases while adhering to security standards and best practices.</p> \n<p>To start the code reviews with your IDE, open the chat panel and type <code>/review</code>.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/26/2024-amazon-q-developer-2-review-1.jpg\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1010\" /></p> \n<p>Amazon Q Developer will review your project or a particular file you select and identify issues before code commit, provide a list of findings from where you can follow up with Amazon Q to find solution, and generate on-demand code fixes inline. When complete, check out the suggested code fixes for code issues and choose <strong>Accept Fix</strong> to apply the changes in the code editor.</p> \n<p><strong> 3. Generating unit tests automatically and improving test coverage</strong><br /> You can automate the unit test process from identifying test cases to writing unit tests for your project files. Within unit tests, you can generate basic cases such as boundary conditions, null values, off-by-1 cases, and checking multiple input types.</p> \n<p>To start the unit test workflow with your IDE, open the chat panel and type <code>/test</code>.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/26/2024-amazon-q-developer-3-test-1.jpg\" width=\"1800\" height=\"927\" /></p> \n<p>Amazon Q Developer will generate unit tests in your specific source file, place them into the relevant test file and self-debug test errors. When complete, choose <strong>View diff</strong> to check out the generated unit tests in the code editor. Then, you can accept or reject the generated unit tests.</p> \n<p><u><strong>Now available</strong></u><br /> Three new Amazon Q Developer agent capabilities for software development are now available in all AWS Regions where Amazon Q Developer is available.</p> \n<p>To learn more, visit the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/q/developer/\">Amazon Q Developer product page</a> and the latest blog posts in the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/category/amazon-q/\">AWS DevOps &amp; Developer Productivity Blog</a> channel.
