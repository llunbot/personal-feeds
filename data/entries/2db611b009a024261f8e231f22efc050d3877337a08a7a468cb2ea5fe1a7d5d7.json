Accordingly, none of the promised features are available <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-4-features/\">in the first beta of iOS 18.4</a> released last month.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn his <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-03-02/apple-siri-compared-with-alexa-m4-macbook-air-and-ipad-air-2025-coming-soon-m7rn2k2y\"><em>Power On</em> newsletter today</a>, he said the features will be available in iOS 18.5:<blockquote>The follow-up release, iOS 18.5, is where the good stuff is supposed to wind up. It has the AI-infused Siri that the company showed off last June, as well as support for Apple Intelligence in China.</blockquote>Apple's software engineers have been <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/17/apple-already-testing-ios-18-5/\">internally testing iOS 18.5</a> since at least the start of February, according to the <em>MacRumors</em> visitor logs.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman expects iOS 18.5 to be released in May, but beta testing should begin sooner:<blockquote>The next version of Siri will be a test of whether Apple can mount a comeback. The software is likely be released in May, a full 11 months after it was introduced.</blockquote>It is still possible that some of the Siri upgrades could arrive in a later iOS 18.4 beta, but Gurman seems to be leaning into iOS 18.5 timing for now.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe upgrades coming to Siri will include on-screen awareness, understanding of a user's personal context, and deeper per-app controls. For example, during its WWDC 2024 keynote, Apple showed an iPhone user asking Siri about their mother's flight and lunch reservation plans based on info from the Mail and Messages apps.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple Intelligence requires an iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, or any iPhone 16 model.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-intelligence/\">Apple Intelligence</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/02/siri-apple-intelligence-likely-ios-18-5/\">Apple Intelligence Upgrades for Siri Likely Pushed Back to iOS 18.5</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-intelligence-upgrades-for-siri-likely-pushed-back-to-ios-18-5.2451130/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2db611b009a024261f8e231f22efc050d3877337a08a7a468cb2ea5fe1a7d5d7","category":"Apple"}
