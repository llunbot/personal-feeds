Tennessee also risked being blocked, but a <a href=\"https://www.xbiz.com/news/286326/fsc-court-blocks-tennessee-age-verification-law\">court preliminarily blocked its age-verification law</a> from taking effect.</p>\n<p>The other blocked states are Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, and Virginia. Mapping it out, 404 Media noted that the Aylo blackout spans nearly the entire US South, with Georgia's age verification law set to take effect in July and likely to trigger another block that would almost complete the blackout.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/almost-the-entire-us-south-is-now-being-blocked-by-pornhub/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/almost-the-entire-us-south-is-now-being-blocked-by-pornhub/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2dd35af3838f8d13dffbfde3366f3b836a1dcc423fad134f3225375e44605505","category":"Tech"}
