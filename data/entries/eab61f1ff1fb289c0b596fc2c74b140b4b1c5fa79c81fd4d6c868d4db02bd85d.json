The entry-level iPad Air, for instance, is back down to <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3ArIZEI\" target=\"_blank\">$500 at various retailers</a>. That equals a deal we first saw last month but nevertheless remains $100 off Apple's MSRP and tied for the best price we've tracked. If you need more storage, the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3iqk3Ge\" target=\"_blank\">256GB model is also discounted</a> to a joint-low of $650.</p>\n<p>If you'd rather step up to the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/05/2021-ipad-pro-review-more-of-the-same-but-way-way-faster-thanks-to-m1/\" target=\"_blank\">higher-quality hardware and M1 processor</a> of a new iPad Pro, though, various models of those <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3xx2gT1\" target=\"_blank\">recently released slates</a> are <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Cwxz4f\" target=\"_blank\">$100 off</a> their<a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/1305166/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-12-9-inch-iPad-Pro-2021-Wi-Fi-256GB-Space-Gray%2F385211636&amp;subid1=dealmaster081021\" target=\"_blank\"> standard going rates</a> as well. Of particular note, this brings the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3s6kz0d\" target=\"_blank\">11-inch Pro down to $700</a>, a price we've only tracked a couple of times before. That's still undeniably pricey for a tablet that still isn't quite capable of being a true laptop replacement for most, but as <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/staff/2021/07/apple-ipad-air-deals-100-off-amazon-best-buy/\" target=\"_blank\">we noted in a recent Dealmaster</a>, the Pro does give you such upgrades a brighter and smoother 120 Hz display, a faster chip, a Thunderbolt 3 port, and slightly better mics, cameras, and speakers. The Air is still likely the better value for most, as its accurate display and A14 Bionic chip are <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/ipad-air-2020-review-semi-pro/\" target=\"_blank\">still luxurious for most tablet needs.</a> But if money is less of an object, the Pro <em>is</em> a superior piece of hardware all the same.</p>\n<p>Besides tablets, our deals roundup also has <a href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/1305166/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-pencil-2nd-generation%2F-%2FA-54217063&amp;subid1=dealmaster081021\" target=\"_blank\">Apple's Pencil stylus for $100</a>, which again ties the best price we've seen. It's still a convenient and accurate tool for sketching and note taking, but note that this is the second-gen model, which means <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211029\" target=\"_blank\">it's only compatible</a> with recent iPad Pro models and the newest iPad Air mentioned above. Meanwhile, the MagSafe wireless charger, which we've tested and recommend for iPhone 12 users, is still <a href=\"https://fave.co/3fksTV6?xcust=xid:fr1628514571999fha\" target=\"_blank\">down to $30 at Amazon-owned Woot</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1785725#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1785725&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Staff","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"eab61f1ff1fb289c0b596fc2c74b140b4b1c5fa79c81fd4d6c868d4db02bd85d","category":"Tech"}
