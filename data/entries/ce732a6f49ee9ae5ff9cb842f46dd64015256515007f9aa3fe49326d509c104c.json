Users will be able to initiate screen searches by tapping the three-dot menu and selecting \"Search this Screen.\" The feature supports various interaction methods, including drawing, highlighting, or tapping to select content for visual searches while browsing articles, shopping, or watching videos.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGoogle is also expanding its AI-powered search capabilities within Lens. The company says it is introducing AI Overviews, which will appear more frequently in Lens results without requiring users to formulate specific questions. As a result, Lens should be able to provide detailed information about novel or unique images beyond its existing object recognition capabilities.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe screen search features are rolling out globally this week for both Chrome and the Google app on iOS. The AI Overviews expansion will initially be available to English-language users in supported regions through the Google app for Android and iOS, with Chrome desktop and mobile support coming soon.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/\">Google</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/google-lens-screen-search-comes-to-ios-chrome-and-google-app/\">Google Lens Screen Search Comes to iOS Chrome and Google App</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-lens-screen-search-comes-to-ios-chrome-and-google-app.2449717/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ce732a6f49ee9ae5ff9cb842f46dd64015256515007f9aa3fe49326d509c104c","category":"Apple"}
