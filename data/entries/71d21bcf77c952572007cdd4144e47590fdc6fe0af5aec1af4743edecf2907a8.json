Take the station wagon, for example. This once-popular form factor for family transport has all but disappeared from new car showrooms in North America, consequently making the station wagon all kinds of cool in the process. At the apex are the superwagons, factory-tuned models with prodigious power outputs, with one in particular attaining legendary status in large part because BMW chose never to import the M5 Touring across the Atlantic. Until now.</p>\n<p>BMW first made a Touring—or station wagon—version of the M5 in 1992 with the second-generation (better known as the E34) 5 series. When I was growing up in the UK, these were unavailable, as they were in the US, quickly giving the five-door M5 an extra level of cachet that the four-door lacked, despite a starring role in <em>Ronin</em>.</p>\n<p>Truth be told, the E34 M5 Touring looked very cool, but it wasn't the greatest sales success.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043774#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2043774&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
