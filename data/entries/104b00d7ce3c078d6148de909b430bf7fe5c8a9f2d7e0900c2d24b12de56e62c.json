Users can review those captures via a carousel, and Gemini will automatically identify the associated places and offer to save them with additional details. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe feature's Auto-scan option requires that Google Maps is given the \"Allow Access to All Photos\" permisssions, so it's not like your photos automatically get scanned. Alternatively, users can browse their photos and manually import screenshots to review. Here's how Google <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/maps/how-to-google-maps-screenshot-save-gemini/\">describes</a> the steps involved to save screenshots in Google Maps:\r<br />\n<blockquote><ol>\r<br />\n  <li>Navigate to the You tab.</li>\r<br />\n  <li>At the top of the You tab, you'll see a Screenshots list with a badge that says \"Try it out!\" Tap the badge. This will open a video showing you how the feature works â€” you'll even be able to test it out alongside the video.</li>\r<br />\n  <li>You'll see a request to allow Google Maps access to your photos. Choose when it has access. (There's also a manual option if you don't want to give Maps full access, more on that later.)</li>\r<br />\n  <li>Next time you take a screenshot that includes location information, head to Google Maps after.</li>\r<br />\n  <li>If Maps recognizes a place, a message will pop up telling you that it has places ready for you to review.</li>\r<br />\n  <li>Tap \"review,\" and decide if you want to save the image to your screenshots list or not. (You can add these images to other lists later, too, if you want.)</li>\r<br />\n  <li>You also have the option to upload screenshots manually: When you're in the app select the Screenshots list under the You tab. From there, you can upload screenshots manually. The rest of the process is the same!</li>\r<br />\n  <li>You'll see the saved places directly on your map or can get to the list through You tab to access while you're on the go.</li>\r<br />\n</ol></blockquote>The new capability has rolled out to Google Maps for iOS (in U.S. English), and is likely to extend to other languages and regions soon.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google-maps/\">Google Maps</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/08/google-maps-scan-screenshots-for-places/\">Google Maps Can Now Scan Your iPhone Screenshots for Places</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-maps-can-now-scan-your-iphone-screenshots-for-places.2456712/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"104b00d7ce3c078d6148de909b430bf7fe5c8a9f2d7e0900c2d24b12de56e62c","category":"Apple"}
