On Thursday, word came that astronomers spotted a large planet orbiting close to a tiny star—a star that's too small to have had enough material around it to form a planet that large.</p>\n<p>This doesn't mean that the planet is \"impossible.\" But it does mean that we may not fully understand some aspects of planet formation.</p>\n<h2>A big mismatch</h2>\n<p>LHS 3154 is, by any reasonable measure, a small, dim star. Imaging by the team behind the new work indicates that the red dwarf has just 11 percent of the Sun's mass. Temperature estimates place it at about 2,850 K, far lower than the Sun's 5,800 K temperature and barely warm enough to keep it out of ultracool dwarf category. (Yes, ultracool dwarfs are enough of a thing to merit <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-cool_dwarf\">their own Wikipedia entry</a>.)</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1987829#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1987829&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"502d2647ceab0552651869cd07363c77466014bfa51e47f56b38566af21d1e3c","category":"Tech"}
