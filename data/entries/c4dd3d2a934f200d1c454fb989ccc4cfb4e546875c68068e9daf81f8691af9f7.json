But it ended on one hell of a cliffhanger than sets up any number of tantalizing possibilities for the MCU as a whole—particularly <em><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/07/marvels-what-if-trailer-takes-the-mcu-to-a-weird-but-wonderful-place/\">Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</a></em>, currently scheduled for release next March.</p>\n<p><strong>(Major spoilers for the finale are below the second gallery. We'll give you a heads up when we get there.)</strong></p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/06/review-our-favorite-trickster-god-is-charismatic-as-ever-in-loki-premiere/\">we've reported previously</a>, the launching point for <em>Loki</em> the series is that scene in <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/avengers-endgame-is-three-of-marvels-best-films-rolled-into-one/\"><em>Avengers: Endgame</em></a> when a 2012 version of Loki snags the tesseract containing the Space Stone and vanishes through a portal. Our trickster soon encounters a team of armed guards who \"arrest\" him on behalf of an entity known as the Time Variance Authority (TVA), the \"custodians of chronology\" in the MCU, monitoring violations to the Sacred Timeline. Catch the TVA's attention by trying to change history, and you just might meet the wrong end of the Retroactive Cannon (Ret Con) and have your entire history deleted from the historical timeline. </p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1780045#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1780045&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c4dd3d2a934f200d1c454fb989ccc4cfb4e546875c68068e9daf81f8691af9f7","category":"Tech"}
