But the shocking thing is that Apple may have inadvertently revealed that some of these core ideas are actually dead ends — that they can't ever be executed well enough to become mainstream. This is the best video passthrough headset ever made, and that might mean camera-based mixed reality passthrough could just be a road to nowhere. This is the best hand- and eye-tracking ever, and it feels like the mouse, keyboard, and touchscreen are going to remain undefeated for years to come. There is so much technology in this thing that feels like magic when it works and frustrates you completely when it doesn't.</blockquote><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/personal-tech/apple-vision-pro-review-39f2d82e\"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em>'s Joanna Stern</a>:<blockquote>Apple's headset has all the characteristics of a first-generation product: It's big and heavy, it's battery life sucks, there are few great apps and it can be buggy. And come on, have you seen what this thing thinks I look like?\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYet so much of what the Vision Pro can do feels sci-fi. I'm flicking apps all over my home office. I've got multiple virtual timers hovering over my stove. I'm watching holograms of my kid petting a llama. It's the best mixed-reality headset I've ever tried, way more advanced than its only real competition, the far cheaper Meta Quest Pro and Quest 3.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThese companies know these aren't really the devices we want. They're all working toward building virtual experiences into something that looks more like a pair of regular eyeglasses. Until then, they're just messing with our heads.</blockquote><a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/apple-vision-pro-review-a-mind-blowing-look-at-an-unfinished-future/\"><em>CNET</em>'s Scott Stein</a>:<blockquote>The very first thing I noticed about the Vision Pro in my first demo was how good the displays were. The 4K-resolution-per-eye, micro-OLED display tech Apple uses is basically the \"retina\" moment for VR and AR. It's vivid, richly colored, HDR and just stunning. Not only is it good enough for movies -- something Apple is touting constantly -- but it's better than any TV in my house.</blockquote><a href=\"https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/smart-glasses/apple-vision-pro-review\"><em>Tom's Guide</em>'s Mark Spoonaeur</a>:<blockquote>As for endurance, the Vision Pro's battery is rated for 2 hours of general use and 2.5 hours of video playback. In my testing of on and off use over 2 hours, the Vision Pro was down to about 60% and then down to 40% after another couple hours.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf you want to use the Vision Pro continuously, you can always just plug in the battery using the included USB-C power adapter. Competing mixed reality headsets like the Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest Pro have batteries built into the headset, which is more convenient, but they're also less powerful.</blockquote><h2>What's in the Box</h2>\r<br />\nAlongside the Vision Pro, the following accessories are included in the box:<ul><li>Light Seal</li>\r<br />\n<li>Light Seal Cushion (Two Sizes)</li>\r<br />\n<li>Solo Knit Band</li>\r<br />\n<li>Dual Loop Band</li>\r<br />\n<li>Front Cover</li>\r<br />\n<li>Battery Pack</li>\r<br />\n<li>Vision Pro Polishing Cloth</li>\r<br />\n<li>30W USB-C Power Adapter</li>\r<br />\n<li>USB‑C Charging Cable</li></ul>Apple also released an optional <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/apple-releases-vision-pro-accessories/\">Vision Pro travel case</a> for $199.
