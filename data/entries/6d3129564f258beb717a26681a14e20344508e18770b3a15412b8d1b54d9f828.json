<p>Favero has announced the Assioma Duo-Shi, a new <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/power-meters/\">power meter</a> pedal spindle that is compatible with a select range of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/shimano-spd-vs-spd-sl/\">Shimano SPD-SL</a> road bike clipless pedal bodies.</p>\n<p>Though patents suggested <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/shimano-spd-sl-power-meter-road-pedal/\">Shimano may have been working on a pedal-based power meter system</a>, it appears <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/shimano-dura-ace-r9200/\">the next generation of Dura-Ace</a> will stick with a crank-based power meter.</p>\n<p>This left Garmin, with its <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/garmin-rally-power-meter-pedals/\">Rally power meter pedal</a> system, as the lone Shimano SPD-SL compatible power meter pedal option, until now.</p>\n<h2>Favero Assioma Duo-Shi</h2>\n<p>The Assioma Duo-Shi consists of two pedal spindles with power meter internals, and the pods of the standard <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/power-meters/favero-assioma-duo-power-meter-pedals-review/\">Favero Assioma Duo power meter pedals</a>, which can be installed onto the following Shimano SPD-SL pedal bodies:</p>\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/pedals/shimano-ultegra-r8000-pedals-review/\">Shimano PD-R8000</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/pedals/shimano-105-r7000-pedals-review/\">Shimano PD-R7000</a></li>\n<li>Shimano PD-6800</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/pedals/shimano-tiagra-r550-pedals-review/\">Shimano PD-R550</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/shimano-rd540-spd-sl-pedals/\">Shimano PD-R540</a></li>\n</ul><p>Notably, the Favero Assioma Duo-Shi does not include a set of Shimano SPD-SL compatible pedal bodies pre-installed.</p>\n<p>This means anyone purchasing a set will need to supply their own pedal bodies – either a new set or a set they already own.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Assioma Duo-Shi is spindle only – you’ll need to supply your own Shimano SPD-SL pedal bodies.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Favero said it made the decision not to include pedal bodies because it “aims at offering the best value for money to those cyclists who already ride with Shimano [pedals]”.</p>\n<p>With this in mind, the RRP for the Assioma Duo-Shi spindles is, at €495, slightly cheaper than the standard Look Keo-compatible Assioma Duo power meter pedals, which cost €569.67.</p>\n<p>Consumers will therefore have the task of disassembling the Shimano pedals and attaching the Assioma Duo-Shi spindles to the pedal bodies.</p>\n<p>When using Shimano PD-R8000 pedals, the process is very simple, though, requiring only a 17mm and a 19mm spanner, and a compatible torque wrench.</p>\n<p></p><div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n

    </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\nFavero also confirmed it has “long-term plans” to release an SPD (off-road) compatible pedal spindle, but a release date has yet to be confirmed.\n<p>In the meantime, <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bikes/\">gravel</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/mtb/\">mountain bike</a> riders wanting a power meter pedal will still need to look elsewhere.</p>\n<h2>Faverio Assimo Duo-Shi specifications</h2>\n<p>We’ve had a set in to test, and can confirm that the Assioma Duo-Shi spindles weigh 99g per spindle (spot-on the claimed weight).</p>\n<p>This makes for a total assembled weight of 157g per pedal, when used with Shimano PD-R8000 pedal bodies, with a pair weighing just 9g heavier than the standard Assioma Duo pedals.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, the spec is almost identical:</p>\n<ul><li>True dual-sided power measurement</li>\n<li>Claimed accuracy of +/- 1 per cent</li>\n<li>Accelerometer-based cadence measurement</li>\n<li>Automatic temperature compensation</li>\n<li>Internal rechargeable battery promising at least 50 hours of use</li>\n<li>Bluetooth and ANT+ data broadcasting</li>\n<li>IP67 waterproof rating</li>\n<li>Easy installation</li>\n<li>Two-year warranty</li>\n<li>RRP €495</li>\n</ul><p>The only notable change from the standard Assioma Duo is that the Q-factor (the distance between the centre of the pedal body and the crank arm) on the Assioma Duo-Shi is 65mm.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Favero Assioma Duo-Shi Q-factor.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>This is 11mm wider than the 54mm Q-factor of the standard Assioma Duo pedal, and 13mm wider than a Shimano PD-R8000 pedal.</p>\n<p>Favero says this increase is due to the increased width of the SPD-SL pedal bodies themselves, combined with the pods on the Assioma spindles which take up room on the axle, compared to a standard Shimano pedal axle.</p>\n<p></p><div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n

<figcaption><span>Combined with the pod on the spindle, which takes up room on the axle, this has resulted in a large increase in Q-factor.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Simon Bromley / Immediate Media</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\nThis increase will likely have a knock-on effect on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/stance-width-what-it-is-and-why-you-should-care/\">stance width</a> for most riders, which could be an issue for those who are fussy about <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/sizing-and-fit/road-bike-position/\">bike fit</a>.\n<p>There is limited evidence to suggest that <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22612455/\" target=\"_blank\">a narrower Q-factor can be beneficial to efficiency</a>, but the precise ideal Q-factor may be unique to each individual rider, depending on their proportions.</p>\n<h2>Can I convert existing Favero Assioma pedals to use Shimano SPD-SL pedal bodies?</h2>\n<p>Unlike with the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/power-meters/garmin-rally-rs200-power-meter-pedals-review/\">Garmin Rally power meter pedals</a> (Garmin took a different design approach and built its own SPD-SL compatible pedal body around its existing <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/training/power-meters/garmin-vector-3-power-meter-review/\">Vector 3</a> spindle design), existing Assioma Duo pedal systems cannot be converted for use with Shimano SPD-SL pedal bodies.</p>\n<p>Although the power meter internals are the same, the Assimo Duo-Shi uses a different spindle construction in order to be compatible with existing Shimano SPD-SL pedal bodies.</p>\n<p>As a result, existing Assioma spindles are not compatible with Shimano SPD-SL pedal bodies.</p>","author":"Simon
