After a problem with the spacecraft's propulsion system, instead of entering a low orbit around the Moon, it crashed into the lunar surface.</p>\n<p>The Russian mission to the Moon was <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/07/here-come-the-moon-landing-missions-probably/\">one of several spacecraft</a> that were to attempt a landing on the Moon in the next six months, alongside probes from Japan, India, and the United States. In this sense, Russia is just one of many nations participating in a second space race back to the Moon, alongside nations and private companies alike.</p>\n<p>But unlike NASA, China, India, and several companies in the United States and Japan, the Luna 25 effort does not presage the coming of a golden era of exploration for Russia. Rather, it is more properly seen as the last gasp of a dying empire, an attempt by the modern state of Russia, and President Vladimir Putin, to revive old glories.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1961951#p3\">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1961951&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b9812f5841b87e48863d2074db8be46db726a25e11cf0922b7543e823e9d4dc5","category":"Tech"}
