We've been hearing rumors about the device for the last couple of years, and now there's some new information about its potential design.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/04/HomePod-G4-Feature.jpg\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nCalled <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/04/leak-confirms-apples-work-on-home-accessory/\">the \"HomeAccessory\" internally</a>, the upcoming smart home device has a \"squarish display,\" according to <em><a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2024/09/26/apples-long-awaited-homeaccessory-could-have-square-display-a18-chip-for-ai-more/\">9to5Mac</a></em>. The square display would make the product distinct from an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, which has a more rectangular display. <em>Bloomberg</em>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a> has previously described the smart home hub as \"iPad-like\" with features adopted from the ‌iPad‌, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/homepod/\">HomePod</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, but he's also described a separate ‌HomePod‌ with a screen, which seems to be simpler.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>9to5Mac</em> claims it is unclear whether the square design will make it into the final product, which also seems to have a built-in camera for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a>. The device includes a camera that is able to identify hand gestures from afar, and it can tell one person apart from another for personalized requests. While it can run apps and play media like the ‌Apple TV‌, it will also serve as an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airplay/\">AirPlay</a> receiver like the ‌HomePod‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>MacRumors</em> spotted signs of the HomeAccessory in Apple's backend code earlier this year. It is a product that is distinct from Apple's other home devices, the ‌Apple TV‌ and the ‌HomePod‌. It seems to run a variant of tvOS much like the ‌HomePod‌, and the test version we've seen described is equipped with an A18 chip, so there is a possibility that it might not be too far off from launching.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWith an A18 chip or later, Apple's smart home product would be able to run Apple Intelligence features, and it would support the smarter <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> that Apple plans to introduce in 2025. Prior rumors have said that it <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/25/homepod-with-ipad-like-screen-2025-rumor/\">will debut in 2025</a> at the earliest, and <em>9to5Mac</em> says it could come next spring. <div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-smart-home-display/\">Apple Smart Home Display</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/26/apple-smart-home-accessory-square-display/\">Apple's Upcoming Smart Home Accessory Could Feature 'Squarish' Display</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apples-upcoming-smart-home-accessory-could-feature-squarish-display.2438268/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d6a2b7742f368d938b7238d3ae7c25690d9203e772a157a761bbf0c63c1cbed6","category":"Apple"}
