Assuming the settlement is approved by the court, the payments will apply to Zoom users nationwide.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn addition to payments, Zoom agreed to over a dozen major changes to its practices, \"designed to improve meeting security, bolster privacy disclosures, and safeguard consumer data,\" according to the settlement. A hearing on the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary approval of the settlement is scheduled for October 21, 2021.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nIn <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/04/01/zoom-end-to-end-encryption-claims-misleading/\">April 2020</a>, Zoom faced accusations of misleading encryption claims after an investigation by <em>The Intercept</em> revealed that Zoom was securing video calls using TLS encryption, the same technology that web servers use to secure HTTPS websites.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nTLS encryption is different to end-to-end encryption, a term that refers to a way of protecting user content so that the company has no access to it whatsoever. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFor Zoom meetings to be truly end-to-end encrypted, calls would need to be encrypted in such a way that ensured only the participants in the meeting had the ability to decrypt them through the use of local encryption keys. But that level of security was not what the service offered at the time.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/lawsuit/\">lawsuit</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/encryption/\">Encryption</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/zoom/\">Zoom</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/04/zoom-pay-85m-users-misleading-encryption-claims/\">Zoom to Pay $85 Million to Users for Misleading Encryption Claims</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/zoom-to-pay-85-million-to-users-for-misleading-encryption-claims.2306461/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=no1r3lKSrZ0:dGmQ38zBVrM:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=no1r3lKSrZ0:dGmQ38zBVrM:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/no1r3lKSrZ0\" />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ab6229e551bb482aa189e9380f9022035e6ca1e7502857d3f5f84cab527bba13","category":"Apple"}
