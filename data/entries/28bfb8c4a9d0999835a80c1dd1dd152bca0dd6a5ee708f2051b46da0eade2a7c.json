We’ve tested a wide range of gravel bike tyres over the years, but these are the ones that truly impressed our test team.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/what-is-gravel-riding/\">Gravel riding</a> covers a broad range of ride experiences. Hard-packed dirt roads may be as smooth as pavement, rocky roads may have embedded rocks or loose gravel, and some so-called gravel rides may take cyclists onto stretches of singletrack.</p>\n<p>There’s a lot of terrain out there and many different gravel bike tyres to suit the varied surfaces you may encounter when you leave the tarmac. As a result, choosing the right set of tyres for your bike, and the type of riding you typically do, is key.</p>\n<p>If you’re also looking to upgrade your ride, you can check out our buyer’s guide to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-bikes/\">best gravel bikes</a>, while we’ve also got a round-up of the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-gravel-wheels/\">best gravel wheels</a> tested by the BikeRadar team.

The Terra Speeds do hold up on damp trails, but they wouldn’t be our first choice for cutting through deep mud.</p>\n<p>When it comes to wear and tear, the Terra Speeds have held up well, and we’ve logged over 3,500km on these tyres.

Smaller wheels will typically leave room for wider tyres if you’re limited on tyre clearance.</p>\n<p>Regardless of wheel size, choosing a wider gravel bike tyre will allow you to run lower pressures for greater comfort and technical capability – just make sure there is enough tyre clearance to fit them. If you intend to run a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/tubeless/\">tubeless setup</a>, then make sure the tyres are tubeless-compatible.</p>\n<p>From a low-profile file tread or slick tyre all the way through to aggressive, mud-shedding tread with shoulder knobs, the tread pattern is probably the most important element of your gravel bike tyre choice, and will be dependent on where you ride and the trail conditions.</p>\n<p>Look for extra puncture protection if you plan on heading into more remote areas on a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/heres-what-you-need-for-a-bikepacking-adventure/\">bikepacking</a> trip or know you ride on surfaces that tend to wreck rubber. If you’re looking to go fast and ride in dry conditions, you can choose a light and supple tyre.</p>\n<p>There’s no single right answer and tyre choice will always contain an element of compromise. Gravel bike tyres suited to looser surfaces or mud will inevitably be slower when you take them on tarmac, while tyres at the lighter, slicker end of the spectrum will be out of their depth on tougher terrain.</p>\n<p>This guide will take you through the main things to keep in mind when looking for a gravel bike tyre, from wheel size to puncture protection and width. It also answers some common gravel bike tyre questions.</p>\n<h3>Wheel size</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Canyon Grail AL 6 WMN gravel bike\" title=\"Canyon Grail AL 6 WMN gravel bike\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Will you opt for ‘standard’ 700c or slightly smaller 650b hoops with chunkier tyres?</span></figcaption><span> <i>Robyn Furtado / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Your wheel size is the first factor to consider when choosing a set of gravel bike tyres. While 700c wheels are pretty much standard for the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-road-bike-tyres/\">best road bike tyres</a>, gravel bikes often use smaller-diameter 650b wheels.</p>\n<p>The main reason for using 650b wheels is to be able to run wider tyres on bikes that have limited frame and fork clearance, although the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/road-gravel-tech-trends-2022/\">latest gravel bikes</a> are increasingly addressing this with bigger clearances for 700c wheels.</p>\n<p>If you’re considering switching from 700c to a 650b wheelset, first make sure your bike is compatible with both wheel sizes.</p>\n<p>700c wheelsets tend to be chosen by riders who are seeking efficiency over longer rides, or ride predominantly on roads and more tame gravel tracks.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if tyre width and volume are important, a 650b wheelset might give you the option to size up when it comes to tyre choice.</p>\n<h3>Gravel bike tyre width</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Vernier calipers measuring tyre width\" title=\"Vernier calipers measuring tyre width\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Use vernier calipers to accurately measure tyre width.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Katherine Moore / Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The width of your gravel bike tyres, and hence tyre volume, will make a huge difference to how your gravel bike rides. From narrow 35mm tyres all the way through to MTB-eqsue rubber measured in inches, there’s now a huge range of gravel bike <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/bike-tyre-sizes/\">tyre sizes</a>.</p>\n<p>Your frame and fork will likely be the key limiting factor to how wide you can go: check your tyre clearances with both 700c and smaller 650b wheels.</p>\n<p>The official minimum clearance between tyre and frame/fork is 6mm to pass safety standard ISO-4210. Although you might be able to squeeze a slightly larger tyre in than recommended by the bike manufacturer, this isn’t always a good idea. You’ll reduce mud clearance and could also damage the bike if something gets trapped between the tyre and frame (for example, on the chainstays).</p>\n<p>Another factor is wheel <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/rim-width-explained-for-road-bikes-mountain-bikes-and-gravel-bikes/\">rim width</a>. Before selecting wider gravel bike tyres, you’ll have to ensure your gravel bike wheels are wide enough to safely fit them.</p>\n<p>Wider tyres will allow you to run lower <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/workshop/gravel-tyre-pressure/\">tyre pressures</a>, which can aid both grip and comfort. You’ll also increase the contact patch between the tyre and whatever surface you’re riding on.</p>\n<p>A narrower tyre will be lighter and might be faster on smoother terrain and tarmac, but there are a lot of factors at play here, including tyre pressure, tyre construction and tread pattern.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, tyre width plays an important role in how your bike rides and what it’s capable of. Consider experimenting with different widths to see what feels best for you, with your local terrain and conditions.</p>\n<h3>Gravel tyre tread pattern</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Liv Devote tread\" title=\"Liv Devote tread\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Choose your tread pattern according to the terrain and conditions you’ll be tackling.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The tread pattern of your tyres can have a huge impact on how your gravel bike handles over different terrain.</p>\n<p>The tread typically extends to the shoulders of the tyre and comes into contact with the ground both in a straight line and as you lean the bike through corners.</p>\n<p>Typically, you’ll find a smoother centre line for speed and efficiency, flanked by raised ribs, which may be ramped on directional treads, and with a more pronounced shoulder tread for cornering grip.</p>\n<p>Tyres designed for wetter conditions feature deeper grooves and more raised, aggressive tread, along with more widely spaced tread, which helps with mud shedding.</p>\n<p>For drier terrain, you’re likely to find a low-to-mid profile tread, or a very minimal file tread, or even slick tyres.</p>\n<p>Choosing the right tread pattern for your terrain and conditions will avoid having an excessively draggy tyre in the dry or a terrifying lack of grip in the wet.</p>\n<p>Don’t be afraid to mismatch treads with a grippier, more aggressive tyre up-front and a faster-rolling one on the back, as many riders do with the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-mountain-bike-tyres/\">best mountain bike tyres</a>.</p>\n<h3>Puncture protection</h3>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"How to repair a punctured tubeless bike tyre\" title=\"How to repair a punctured tubeless tyre 02a\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Tyres with additional puncture protection should mean you spend more time riding and less time trailside fixing flats.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Immediate Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Look out for enhanced puncture protection when considering which gravel bike tyres to choose.</p>\n<p>Many tyre brands offer different options for race use, as well as more durable alternatives for general riding and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/routes-and-rides/heres-what-you-need-for-a-bikepacking-adventure/\">bikepacking</a> – for example, WTB’s SG2 range, Vittoria’s TNT casing or Teravail’s Durable tyres.</p>\n<p>This additional puncture protection may span the tread of the tyre, or also include the sidewalls for full bead-to-bead.</p>\n<p>This typically adds a little extra weight to the tyres (eg, 50g in the case of WTB’s SG2 protection).
