But it wasn't until <a href=\"https://www.moddb.com/mods/half-life-alyx-novr/downloads/half-life-alyx-novr-script-update-6\">Script Update #6</a> this weekend that the \"entire game can now be played from start to finish\" without a VR headset, the creators wrote.</p>\n<p>Installation is as simple as copying a downloaded folder into your Steam installation and adding a short text string to the launch options. And while the mod doesn't work with any save files created in the VR version of the game, you can use a handy level select to jump to your favorite parts without getting into virtual reality.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1930728#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1930728&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"551ebfdc4d83d85acdd27987f505923bdd341dc2647188fc0184ee81c72bad29","category":"Tech"}
