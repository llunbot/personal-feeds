{"title":"Woody Johnson’s New York Jets","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6005172/2024/12/19/woody-johnson-jets-madden-sons/","date":1734652271000,"content":"\n<p>Zack Rosenblatt, Dianna Russini, and Michael Silver have written a devastating profile of the most dysfunctional franchise in all of U.S. pro sports, the New York Jets, whose dysfunction has a clear and obvious root cause: meddling idiot owner Woody Johnson (heir to the Johnson &amp; Johnson pharmaceutical fortune). One example:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A few weeks later, Douglas and his Broncos counterpart, George\nPaton, were deep in negotiations for a trade that would have sent\nJeudy to the Jets and given future Hall of Fame quarterback Aaron\nRodgers another potential playmaker. The Broncos felt a deal was\nnear. Then, abruptly, it all fell apart. In Denver’s executive\noffices, they couldn’t believe the reason why.</p>\n\n<p>Douglas told the Broncos that Johnson didn’t want to make the\ntrade because the owner felt Jeudy’s player rating in “Madden\nNFL,” the popular video game, wasn’t high enough, according to\nmultiple league sources. The Broncos ultimately traded the\nreceiver to the Cleveland Browns. Last Sunday, Jeudy crossed the\n1,000-yard receiving mark for the first time in his career.</p>\n\n<p>Coming into this season, the Jets had hopes of ending the\nfranchise’s 13-year playoff drought — the longest in the four\nmajor men’s North American sports — and quieting years of talk\nabout the franchise’s dysfunction. Instead, this season has only\ncemented the Jets’ reputation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The fans of every other team in the NFL that is having a disappointing season — like <a href=\"https://gruber.micro.blog/\">yours truly</a> — are all texting this story to each other today, with the same message: “At least we’re not the Jets.”</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/12/19/woody-johnsons-new-york-jets\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"545329bc321b22491ed64df52cfc8de3e1b1bee2b1686a5313f1dae1740db4a5","category":"Tech"}
