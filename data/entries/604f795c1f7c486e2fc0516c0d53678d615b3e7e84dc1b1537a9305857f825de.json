{"title":"The New Yorker Modernizes a Few Words in Its Style Guide","link":"https://www.newyorker.com/newsletter/the-daily/the-new-yorker-house-style-joins-the-internet-age","date":1741710841000,"content":"\n<p>Andrew Boynton, head of copy at The New Yorker:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Keen-eyed grammar fans may notice some changes in our pages — and\nin this newsletter. Last fall, David Remnick, the editor,\nsuggested convening a group to talk about the magazine’s house\nstyle, to see if any rules might bear reëxamination. The group — comprising copy editors, current and former, and editors — met\nthis past January and came up with a list of styles that might\nqualify for changes, and in a subsequent meeting the following\nmonth the director of copy and production and I came up with a\nlimited list of proposals. It was decided that, while no one\nwanted to change some of the long-standing “quirky” styles\n(teen-ager, per cent, etc.), some of newer vintage could go. Along\nwith a few other changes, “in-box” is now “inbox,” “Web site” is\nnow “website,” “Internet” is now “internet,” and “cell phone” is\nnow “cellphone” (though everyone acknowledges that the word “cell”\nin this context will soon disappear altogether).</p>\n\n<p>Some of you may lament the changes as being radically modern,\nwhile others are likely to greet them as long overdue. <em>Welcome to\n1995</em>, you may be thinking. (Italicized thoughts are new, too.)\nRegardless, it should be noted that the diaeresis (see that\n“reëxamination,” above) has overwhelming support at the magazine,\nand will remain.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’m in favor of all these changes except for lowercasing “Internet”. I actually started lowercasing it years ago — I think right around <a href=\"https://www.ap.org/the-definitive-source/products-and-services/ready-to-lowercase-internet-and-web/\">when the AP changed its style</a> — but I was chatting post-<a href=\"https://dithering.fm/\">Dithering</a> with Ben Thompson a week or two ago and he offhandedly mentioned that lowercasing “internet” is a pet stylistic peeve of his, because there’s only one Internet. He said that and I was like, <em>Yeah! — But so why did I start lowercasing it?</em> The Internet is a lot like the Earth. It’s everywhere. It is our universe, in a sense, from the human-scale perspective. But it’s a unique and distinct thing, thus deserving to be treated as a proper noun. (The universe doesn’t get capitalized because while it’s a one-off, it’s not a name. We speak of <em>the universe</em> like we speak of <em>the planet</em>, which is lowercase.) It’s almost <a href=\"https://www.cartoonstock.com/cartoon?searchID=CC145273\">disrespectful</a> to lowercase it, and the Internet is one of the great achievements in the history of mankind.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/11/new-yorker-style-modernizations\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"604f795c1f7c486e2fc0516c0d53678d615b3e7e84dc1b1537a9305857f825de","category":"Tech"}
