Apple said that it already actively monitors its operations to maintain compliance with applicable nonâ€‘discrimination laws. During the shareholder meeting, Apple CEO Tim Cook acknowledged that the company may be forced to make changes to its DEI policies in the future, as required by law. Trump believes that Apple should get rid of the policies, rather than modify them.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn any case, Cook <a href=\"https://x.com/markgurman/status/1894428592978727404\">told shareholders</a> that Apple will always have a culture of belonging.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"We strive to create a culture of belonging where everyone can do their best work,\" said Apple, in its <a href=\"https://s2.q4cdn.com/470004039/files/doc_financials/2025/Proxy_Statement_2025.pdf\">annual shareholders meeting notice</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTrump has criticized DEI programs since returning to the White House. Last month, he signed an <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-radical-and-wasteful-government-dei-programs-and-preferencing/\">executive order</a> that \"terminates 'diversity, equity, and inclusion' (DEI) discrimination in the federal workforce.\" In response, some other tech companies like Google have scaled back DEI policies in recent weeks.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/26/trump-on-apple-diversity-policies/\">Trump Responds to Apple Keeping Diversity Policies</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/trump-responds-to-apple-keeping-diversity-policies.2450221/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"78fc38a63a66bcddc14f0ed326acec912de39c2f82f3f9fc546bf31a08adf70f","category":"Apple"}
