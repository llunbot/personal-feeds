And now it looks like it might be gone forever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, we’re talking about the much-maligned Lightning to 3.5 mm Headphone Jack Adapter. When Apple launched the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, it removed the headphone jack, leaving the Lightning port as the only way to plug in wired headphones. And since most people didn’t have a pair of Lightning headphones, Apple supplied a free dongle in the boxes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on Apple’s store listing, the accessory may be gone forever. It’s currently sold out online and isn’t available at any nearby stores. Apple still sells a <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MW2Q3AM/A/usb-c-to-35-mm-headphone-jack-adapter\" target=\"_blank\">USB-C to 3.5 mm Headphone Jack Adapter</a> for newer iPhones, however.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple still sells the iPhone SE and iPhone 14, both of which have Lightning ports, but this legacy port is on the way out. If you still want a Lightning to 3.5 mm Headphone Jack Adapter, you can <a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-Lightning-to-3-5-mm-Headphone-Jack-Adapter/54738078\" target=\"_blank\">grab one on sale at Walmart for $7</a>.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"c5cbad11f35ef00719c2fd85598f2e4b31073b86558e7cdbeebe40b88050418d","category":"Apple"}
