Magellan Ltd, a <a href=\"https://www.magellan.gg/titanic-in-3d/\">deep-sea mapping company</a>, and Atlantic Productions conducted the scans over a six-week expedition. That project is the subject of the new National Geographic documentary <a href=\"https://www.natgeotv.com/za/programs/natgeo/titanic-the-digital-resurrection\"><em>Titanic: The Digital Resurrection</em></a>, detailing several fascinating initial findings from experts' ongoing analysis of that full-size scan.</p>\n<p><em>Titanic</em> met its doom just four days into the Atlantic crossing, roughly 375 miles (600 kilometers) south of Newfoundland. At 11:40 pm ship's time on April 14, 1912, <em>Titanic</em> hit that infamous iceberg and began taking on water, flooding five of its 16 watertight compartments, thereby sealing its fate. More than 1,500 passengers and crew perished; only around 710 of those on board survived.</p>\n<p><em>Titanic</em> remained undiscovered at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean until an expedition led by Jean-Louis Michel and Robert Ballard reached the wreck on September 1, 1985. The ship split apart as it sank, with the bow and stern sections lying roughly one-third of a mile apart. The bow proved to be surprisingly intact, while the stern showed severe structural damage, likely flattened from the impact as it hit the ocean floor. There is a debris field spanning a 5×3-mile area, filled with furniture fragments, dinnerware, shoes and boots, and other personal items.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/3d-digital-twin-of-titanic-wreck-yields-fresh-insights/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/04/3d-digital-twin-of-titanic-wreck-yields-fresh-insights/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fe8f737dca41ce3ef84ee29b4bee0dc0c1f5a8622fba55dcb31c99e6c5ce1fcb","category":"Tech"}
