Ponderous? Unengaging? Mid-level components? Nope! Rethink everything you know about endurance bikes – the new Pinarello Dogma X is a gamechanger. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the Dogma name will be familiar as the historic Italian company’s race-winning speed machine, this new model effectively retains that bike’s usable performance credentials but adds a heap of comfort benefits. It loses none of its edge in the process, becoming way more accessible to a broader range of riders.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"594\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/pinarello-dogma-x-02-970x594.jpg\" alt=\"Pinarello Dogma X\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/pinarello-dogma-x-02-970x594.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/pinarello-dogma-x-02-300x184.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/pinarello-dogma-x-02-768x470.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/pinarello-dogma-x-02-750x459.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/pinarello-dogma-x-02-1140x698.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/pinarello-dogma-x-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Pinarello</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Inspired by those of us who love a big day in the saddle, the Dogma X levers technical design prowess for maximum ride compliance, modern carbon technology for unparalleled performance, plus unprecedented tyre clearance and relaxed geometry for optimum comfort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘The whole point was to make a bike that would be comfortable for the average rider on long rides, rather than a bike made especially for the pros,’ says Pinarello’s chief operating officer, Maurizio Bellin. Here’s how they’ve achieved it…</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/pinarello-x-series\">Pinarello X series: The perfect balance</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/sponsored/pinarello-f-series\">Pinarello F series: Born to win</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>Won’t keep you in suspense</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While some manufacturers tread the route of adding suspension systems in the frame to isolate road vibrations, Pinarello has applied its peerless knowledge of carbon layup and frame geometry to produce an altogether more state-of-the-art solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Dogma X has X-STAYS – crisscrossed ‘X’ configuration stays absorb vibration and boost lateral stiffness without sacrificing anything at the altar of increased weight gain.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"727\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/pinarello-dogma-x-03-970x727.jpg\" alt=\"Pinarello Dogma X\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/pinarello-dogma-x-03-970x727.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/pinarello-dogma-x-03-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/pinarello-dogma-x-03-768x575.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/pinarello-dogma-x-03-750x562.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/pinarello-dogma-x-03-1140x854.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/pinarello-dogma-x-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Pinarello</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>By doubling the attachment points, the top stays are able to disperse forces on two points of the seat tube to further reduce vibration transfer to the rider’s rump.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘It cannot be understated how effective the flexible stays seem to be at dispersing shock before it reaches the rider,’ was the verdict of Cyclist’s first ride of the bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Comfort and joy</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Glad tidings! The Pinarello Dogma X has been engineered with 35mm tyre clearance, to allow high-volume, low-pressure tubeless tyres for not only superior roadholding but also phenomenal comfort – on tarmac as well as mixed terrain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allied to this magic carpet ride is the application of Pinarello’s Endurance geometry, with a shorter reach and higher stack than the bike’s Tour de France-winning namesake, to ensure the Dogma X supplies the perfect balance of high-end performance and real-world comfort. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"727\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/pinarello-dogma-x-04-970x727.jpg\" alt=\"Pinarello Dogma X\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/pinarello-dogma-x-04-970x727.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/pinarello-dogma-x-04-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/pinarello-dogma-x-04-768x575.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/pinarello-dogma-x-04-750x562.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/pinarello-dogma-x-04-1140x854.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/pinarello-dogma-x-04.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Pinarello</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Crucially, it also means it fits from the off, without the need to add a stack of spacers under the stem. This is a bike you’ll think nothing of taking on a century ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond this, longer chainstays add even more flex to the ride. ‘This movement will keep riders more comfortable for longer periods on the bike,’ adds Bellin.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>No compromise</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We said you can have it all, and we meant it. While the Dogma X is not a race bike, it retains enough of its performance DNA to ensure there’s zero compromise between speed, efficiency and comfort. Speaking of DNA, asymmetry is Pinarello’s frame design calling card, and the Dogma X is no exception, applying this theory to counter torsional forces in the drive chain to ensure no pedalling effort goes to waste.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/pinarello-dogma-x-05-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Pinarello Dogma X\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/pinarello-dogma-x-05-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/pinarello-dogma-x-05-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/pinarello-dogma-x-05-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/pinarello-dogma-x-05-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/pinarello-dogma-x-05-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/pinarello-dogma-x-05-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/pinarello-dogma-x-05.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Pinarello</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>That frame is constructed from high-tensile, high-modulus T1100 carbon-fibre, for an unparalleled stiffness to weight ratio.
