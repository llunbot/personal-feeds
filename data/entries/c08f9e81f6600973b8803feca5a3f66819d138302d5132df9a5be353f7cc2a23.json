Apple is said to have contacted suppliers in Asia in recent months about making components for the device.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nRumors about a foldable iPhone have circulated for many years, but the report claims that Apple is finally moving forward with the project. The device has allegedly been given a codename of \"V68\" inside Apple, suggesting that work is ramping up.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is said to have struggled to achieve its goal of eliminating a visible crease in the area where the iPhone's screen would fold, but this obstacle could eventually be overcome. However, there is of course a possibility that Apple decides not to release a foldable iPhone, should the device fail to meet the company's high quality standards.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn any case, it appears that a foldable iPhone is still at least a few years away.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theinformation-com/\">The Information</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/foldable-iphone/\">Foldable iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/07/23/foldable-iphone-2026-report/\">Apple Reportedly Working on Foldable iPhone With Similar Design as Samsung's Galaxy Z Flip</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-reportedly-working-on-foldable-iphone-with-similar-design-as-samsungs-galaxy-z-flip.2432036/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c08f9e81f6600973b8803feca5a3f66819d138302d5132df9a5be353f7cc2a23","category":"Apple"}
