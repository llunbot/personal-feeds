The app works on the iPhone 6S and newer and requires iOS 15 and later, and is available to <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/app/spectre-camera/id1450074595\">download from the App Store</a>.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/halide/\">Halide</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/19/spectre-camera-app-iphone-free/\">Spectre Long-Exposure iPhone Camera App Now Free, Ushering in Spectre Pro</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/spectre-long-exposure-iphone-camera-app-now-free-ushering-in-spectre-pro.2396299/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"5259e109c19158340780316bb161fe98d6bf88470ee8fd222dd41b88c59f9fa2","category":"Apple"}
