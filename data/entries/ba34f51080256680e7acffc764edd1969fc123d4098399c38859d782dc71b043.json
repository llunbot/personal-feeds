The change will apparently allow Apple to make its PCBs even thinner. Current <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> PCBs are made from a flexible copper substrate material. A thinner PCB could free up valuable space inside compact devices like the ‌iPhone‌ and Apple Watch to provide more room for larger batteries or other components.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> Pro models are expected to grow in size from 6.1- and 6.7-inches to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/08/iphone-16-pro-larger-display-sizes/\">6.3- and 6.9-inches</a>, respectively. The increase in size is believed to be partly <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/28/gurman-corroborates-iphone-16-pro-size-increase/\">due to a need for more internal space</a> for additional components such as a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/17/periscope-lens-exclusive-iphone-15-pro-max/\">tetraprism telephoto camera</a> with 5x optical zoom and a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/iphone-16-capture-button/\">capacitive \"Capture\" button</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe information comes from an <a href=\"https://weibo.com/u/1833340431\">integrated circuit expert</a> on Weibo, who was first to report that the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a> would retain the A15 Bionic chip, with the A16 being exclusive to the ‌‌iPhone 14‌‌ Pro models. Most recently, the user said that the A17 chip designed for the ‌iPhone 16‌ and ‌‌iPhone 16‌‌ Plus will be made using a fundamentally <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/iphone-16-first-chip-designed-for-standard/\">different manufacturing process to the A17 Pro</a> in the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a> to cut costs.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/phone-chip-expert/\">Phone Chip Expert</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/26/apple-looking-to-save-space-with-thinner-pcbs/\">Apple Looking to Save Space in Future iPhones With Thinner Circuit Boards</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-looking-to-save-space-in-future-iphones-with-thinner-circuit-boards.2404787/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ba34f51080256680e7acffc764edd1969fc123d4098399c38859d782dc71b043","category":"Apple"}
