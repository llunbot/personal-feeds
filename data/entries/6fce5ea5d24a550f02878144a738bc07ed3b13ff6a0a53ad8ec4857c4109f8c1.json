They are allegedly planning to hit him tomorrow with serious charges related to abetting terrorism, fraud, money laundering, and crimes against children, all of it apparently stemming from a near-total lack of moderation on Telegram. According to French authorities, thanks to its encryption and support for crypto, Telegram has become the new top tool for organized crime.</p>\n<p>The French outlet TF1 <a href=\"https://www.tf1info.fr/justice-faits-divers/info-tf1-lci-le-fondateur-et-pdg-de-la-messagerie-cryptee-telegram-interpelle-en-france-2316072.html\">had the news first</a> from sources within the investigation.

Their source said, \"Pavel Durov will definitely end up in pretrial detention. On his platform, he allowed an incalculable number of offenses and crimes to be committed, which he does nothing to moderate nor does he cooperate.\"</p>\n<p>Durov is a 39-year-old who gained a fortune by building VKontakte, a Russian version of Facebook, before being forced out of his company by the Kremlin. He left Russia and went on to start Telegram, which became widely popular, especially in Europe. He was arrested today when his private plane flew from Azerbaijan to Paris's Le Bourget Airport.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045167#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2045167&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Nate Anderson","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6fce5ea5d24a550f02878144a738bc07ed3b13ff6a0a53ad8ec4857c4109f8c1","category":"Tech"}
