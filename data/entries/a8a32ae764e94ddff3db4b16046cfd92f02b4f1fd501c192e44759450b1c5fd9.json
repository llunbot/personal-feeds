This includes record low prices on the Sonos Arc soundbar ($719), as well as various discounted bundles, all of which are deals we haven't tracked since the holidays.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/02/sonos-deals-purple.jpg\" width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Sonos.

The only two products available outside of a bundle are the <a href=\"https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/arc\">Sonos Arc for $719</a> ($180 off) and <a href=\"https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/sub\">Sonos Sub Gen 3 for $639</a> ($160 off). \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><a href=\"https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/promotional-offers\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>UP TO $340 OFF</div>Sonos Home Theater Sale</div></a></div>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSonos very rarely offers discounts this steep on its website, so it'll likely be quite a long time before these sales return after this sale ends on February 11.
