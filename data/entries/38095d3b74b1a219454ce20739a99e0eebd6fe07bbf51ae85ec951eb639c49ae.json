A new Caltech study found that ants search for and remove loose grains of soil when digging their tunnels, much like humans remove loose blocks while playing <em>Jenga</em>.

Now, a team of scientists from Caltech has used X-ray imaging to capture the process of how ants construct their tunnels. The scientists found that the ants have evolved to intuitively sense which grain particles they can remove while maintaining the stability of the structure, much like removing individual blocks in a game of <em>Jenga</em>. The team described their work inÂ <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2102267118\">a new paper</a> published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</p>\n<p>Scientists interested in collective behavior have been studying ants for decades. That's because, as a group, ants behave like a form of granular media. A few ants spaced well apart behave like individual ants. But <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/08/we-can-learn-the-secrets-of-smooth-traffic-flow-by-watching-fire-ants/\">pack enough of them</a> closely together, and they behave more like a single unit, exhibiting both solid and liquid properties. You can pour fire ants from a teapot, for instance, or the ants can link together to build towers or floating rafts. Ants may be tiny critters with tiny brains, but these social insects are capable of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/10/study-ants-are-immune-to-traffic-jams/\">collectively organizing themselves</a> into a highly efficient community to ensure that the colony survives.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002592\">Several years ago</a>, behavioral biologist <a href=\"https://www.iast.fr/people/guy-theraulaz\">Guy Theraulaz</a> of the Institute for Advanced Study in Toulouse, France, and several colleagues combined laboratory experiments with Argentine ants and computer modeling to <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/ants-build-complex-structures-with-a-few-simple-rules-20140409/\">identify three simple rules</a> governing the ants' tunneling behavior. To wit: (1) the ants picked up grains at a constant rate (about 2 grains every minute); (2) the ants preferentially dropped their grains near other grains to form pillars; and (3) ants typically chose grains marked with a chemical pheromone after being handled by other ants. Theraulaz <em>et al</em>. built a computer simulation based on those three rules and found that, after a week, their virtual ants built a structure that closely resembled real ant nests. They concluded that those rules emerge from local interactions between individual ants, with no need for central coordination.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1789021#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1789021&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"38095d3b74b1a219454ce20739a99e0eebd6fe07bbf51ae85ec951eb639c49ae","category":"Tech"}
