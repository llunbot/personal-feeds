The brand cites that in 2020 there were 80,000 bike accidents in Germany alone with 2,500 people ending up in intensive care. The <em>Deutsche Gesellschaft für Chirurgie </em>(German Society for Surgery) says that 70% of traumatic brain injuries suffered in these cases could be avoided if people were wearing helmets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the stats are there, we know helmets are important, but just how does an inflatable one work?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Airy tech</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"546\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Hinten_links_viertel-970x546.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Hinten_links_viertel-970x546.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Hinten_links_viertel-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Hinten_links_viertel-768x432.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Hinten_links_viertel-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Hinten_links_viertel-750x422.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Hinten_links_viertel-1140x641.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Hinten_links_viertel.jpg 1920w\" /><figcaption>Inflabi</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Inflabi, the helmet uses air chambers to provide impact absorption, which it says offers up to four times the shock absorption when compared to traditional foam helmets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s worth noting that Inflabi is currently working towards getting safety certification for the Inflabi Inflatable bike helmet, so it will be interesting to see whether these safety claims materialise.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"546\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Ventil_Detailshot-970x546.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Ventil_Detailshot-970x546.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Ventil_Detailshot-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Ventil_Detailshot-768x432.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Ventil_Detailshot-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Ventil_Detailshot-750x422.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Ventil_Detailshot-1140x641.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/Ventil_Detailshot.jpg 1920w\" /><figcaption>Inflabi</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The helmet has a valve at the back for inflating and deflating, and the brand seems to recommend it be pumped up with a pump.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inflabi also claims the helmet is better for the environment than traditional helmets. By volume, 70 percent of it is just air while the rest is an abrasion-resistant material (exactly what fabric, Inflabi doesn’t say) which can be repaired, thus potentially making the helmet reusable after a crash in a way that conventional foam helmets are not.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n

packs down to just 15% of its inflated size, making it portable and easy to carry around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being inflatable makes the helmet naturally lightweight, packable and thus potentially more

one size does fit all? The helmet will also be made available in different colours and patterns, and its latest prototype is black rather than orange. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you think this helmet is air-mazing or a load of hot air, it will be intriguing to see whether the Inflabi inflatable helmet will be leaving the cycling market breathless.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Read our guide to the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-bike-helmet\" target=\"_blank\">best bike helmets</a>. </em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/inflabi-inflatable-helmet\">This inflatable helmet is truly packable and claims to be ultra-safe</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Emma Cole &#124; Features Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"420473fb285038fef5276eaaf20d2332acd7533d54108c2a210c1b5a9d0a58db","category":"Cycling"}
