It might not be a big one, but the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK3YLRM8\">new iPad mini is available in all colors for $484 at Amazon</a>, $15 off its MSRP, and a good time to grab one if you’ve been thinking of buying. (We don’t know why it’s not marked as a deal but we assure you it’s on sale.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s been quite a while since Apple updated the iPad mini tablet, which was last released in 2021. And this is a pretty mild update, with a speedier A17 Pro chip, Apple intelligence support, and compatibility with the new Apple Pencil Pro. As far as the design goes, the new tablet looks identical to the previous version the same 8.3″ display with 500 nits. As far as colors, there’s a new blue option to go with purple, space gray, and starlight. The best part is that the new iPad Mini now starts at 128GB, which is double the previous models’ lowest capacity option and essentially a $50 price cut. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If those upgrades aren’t enough, you can still get the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09G91LXFP/\">6th-gen iPad mini for $350 (30% off)</a> while supplies last. It’s still a great tablet, but just note that it won’t be able to support <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362804/apple-intelligence-faq-features-release-date-hardware-support.html\">all the AI goodies</a> Apple has coming beginning with iPadOS 18.1.</p>\n\n\n<span>First week, first discount for the iPad Mini</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK3YLRM8\" target=\"_blank\">Buy it now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"6831e96630ef5809a404c5f6b00000761c6729873e746c41e0a142ca5d7eae8a","category":"Apple"}
