The original report is posted below.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re expecting Apple to unveil a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2290228/new-ipads-probably-arrive-week-of-may-6-trusted-analyst.html\">new set of iPads during the first week of May</a>. A new report on Thursday may provide a peek into what could be in store, and it says a lot about what the company is doing with its iPad lineup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Analyst Ross Young <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/dsccross&amp;xcust=1-1-2308318-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">posted</a> on X (subscription required) that, “The upcoming 12.9″ iPad Air has a MiniLED display,” which is the same display technology used by the current 12.9-inch iPad Pro. Young states that Apple is using leftover supply from production of that Pro model since it is expected to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2203369/ipad-pro-too-expensive.html\">upgrade the iPad Pro to OLED displays</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Implementing a Mini LED display would provide a power consumption savings over the current LED displays. Mini LEDs also produce better blacks, so the image quality on the iPad Air could see an improvement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A 12.9-inch iPad Air has been rumored to be a new addition to the iPad lineup to complement the current 10.9-inch iPad Air. This creates a non-pro pairing that’s an alternative to the 11- and 12.9-inch iPad Pro. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Young, however, doesn’t mention if the smaller Air will also upgrade from its current LED display to Mini LED. If the current iPad Pro setup is any indication–the 11-inch model has a standard LED, while the 12.9-inch model uses Mini LED–it’s possible Apple wouldn’t upgrade it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, no comment was made about how the Mini LED upgrade would affect the price. The current 12.9-inch iPad Pro with 128GB of storage starts at $1,099, while the iPad Air line is much cheaper with an entry-level price of $599. The rumored upgrade to OLED for this model could increase the price, which would leave room for the 12.9-inch iPad Air to come in at the $999 range. Apple could also lower the Air’s standard SSD configuration to 64GB (versus the iPad Pro’s 128GB) to lower the price a bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stay up-to-date with the latest news by checking out our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2110304/ipad-air-2024-release-date-specs-display-size-price-processor.html\">iPad Air</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1835319/2024-ipad-pro-release-specs-features-price.html\">iPad Pro</a> rumor roundups.</p>\n\niPad</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"22aaeb5e2ad842a37f034049aa2c776c56055091a81bf19e6d639ba458283369","category":"Apple"}
