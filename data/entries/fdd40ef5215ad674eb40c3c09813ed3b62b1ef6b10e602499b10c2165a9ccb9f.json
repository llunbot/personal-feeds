These initiatives aim to transform Thailand into an innovation-driven economy by using emerging technologies to enhance productivity, competitiveness, and sustainable growth.</p> \n<p>The new AWS Region will help startups, enterprises, government agencies, educational institutions, and nonprofit organizations run their applications and serve end users while maintaining data residency in Thailand. This aligns with Thailand’s digital transformation goals and the growing demand for cloud services. Over the next 15 years, Amazon Web Services (AWS) planned investments in Thailand are estimated to contribute $10B to Thailand’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and support an estimated average of 11,000 full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs in local Thai businesses annually.</p> \n<p><strong><span>Growing presence of AWS in Thailand</span><br /></strong>Our journey in Thailand began in 2013 with the first AWS office in Bangkok. Since then, AWS has continuously expanded its infrastructure and services in the country:</p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/\">Amazon CloudFront</a></strong> – Since 2020, AWS has established six Amazon CloudFront edge locations throughout Thailand. These edge locations are part of the highly secure and programmable AWS content delivery network (CDN), designed to accelerate the delivery of data, videos, applications, and APIs to users worldwide with low latency and high transfer speeds.</p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/outposts/\">AWS Outposts</a></strong> – In the same year, 2020, AWS introduced AWS Outposts to the Thai market. As a fully managed solution, AWS Outposts brings AWS infrastructure and services to virtually any on-premises or edge location, enabling a truly consistent hybrid experience. This service is particularly valuable for workloads that require low latency, local data processing, or local data storage.</p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/localzones/\">AWS Local Zones</a></strong> – In 2022, AWS strengthened its commitment to Thailand by launching AWS Local Zones in Bangkok. This infrastructure deployment places compute, storage, database, and other select services closer to large population, industry, and IT centers. As a result, customers can deliver applications requiring single-digit millisecond latency to end users.</p> \n<p><strong><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/directconnect/\">AWS Direct Connect</a></strong> – AWS established a AWS Direct Connect location in Bangkok in 2023 to enhance connectivity options and added a new AWS Direct Connect location with the launch of the AWS Asia Pacific (Thailand) Region. Customers can use AWS Direct Connect to establish secure and dedicated network connections to their AWS resources, providing improved network performance and reduced bandwidth costs.</p> \n<p><span><strong>AWS customer success stories in Thailand<br /></strong></span>Organizations in Thailand are using our services to drive innovation and transformation. Here are a few examples:</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/case-studies/2c2p-case-study/\"><strong>2C2P</strong></a><br />2C2P, a leading Thailand-based FinTech startup, chose AWS for its robust security capabilities.

The program has successfully integrated cloud computing into educational curricula across Thailand, providing students with direct access to AWS resources and hands-on experience. The impact has been substantial, with over 20,000 Thai students enrolled in the program.
