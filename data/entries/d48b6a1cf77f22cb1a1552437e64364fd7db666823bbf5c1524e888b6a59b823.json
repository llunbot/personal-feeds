After connecting the hub to the Mac, users must open the HyperDisplay app that appears on the desktop.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nKeep in mind that on both of the hubs, one HDMI port supports 60Hz and the other is limited to 30Hz, which may be a dealbreaker for some users.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe 3-in-1 hub is priced at $129.99 in the United States and is <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&amp;mid=43456&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.[…]Fproducts%2Fhyperdrive-dual-4k-hdmi-adaptor-for-m1-macbook\">available on Hyper's website</a>, while the 10-in-1 hub <a href=\"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=J2shFQg6J/U&amp;mid=43456&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.[…]com%2Fproducts%2Fhyperdrive-dual-4k-hdmi-10-in-1-usb-c-hub\">runs for $199.99</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<small><em>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Hyper.
