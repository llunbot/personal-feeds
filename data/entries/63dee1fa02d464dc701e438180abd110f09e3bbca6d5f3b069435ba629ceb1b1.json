Then, it loops around protecting both your ears and the joint at the top of your jaw from direct impacts. A large opening still lets your ears shed heat. Then, thin padding ensures a comfortable fit and even pressure distribution in an impact. All of that, without the feeling of a big squishy sponge against your cheek. There’s also a cutout at the top of the pad so the helmet doesn’t press against the arms of your sunglasses.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a
