But there haven't been many notable graphics card launches, and new ones are <a href=\"https://www.techradar.com/computing/gpu/nvidia-rtx-5080-and-5090-may-not-turn-up-this-year-after-all-next-gen-gpus-might-be-launched-at-ces-2025\">still rumored to be a few months off</a> as both Nvidia and AMD prioritize their money-printing AI accelerators.</p>\n<p>But that doesn't make it a bad time to buy a PC, especially if you're looking for some cost-efficient builds. Prices of CPUs and GPUs have both fallen a fair bit since we did our last build guide a year or so ago, which means all of our builds are either cheaper than they were before or we can squeeze out a little more performance than before at similar prices.</p>\n<p>We have six builds across four broad tiers—a budget office desktop, a budget 1080p gaming PC, a mainstream 1440p-to-4K gaming PC, and a price-conscious workstation build with a powerful CPU and lots of room for future expandability.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044018#p3\">Read 54 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044018&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fa78943645a0d53ff84e5c1a511a22628212bee001daed3025d64e0c3c886ea9","category":"Tech"}
