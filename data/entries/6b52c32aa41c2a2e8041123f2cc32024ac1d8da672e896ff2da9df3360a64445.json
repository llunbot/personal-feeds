This is a new record low price for this accessory on Amazon, and the all-around best deal currently available online.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08634XFH9?tag=macrumors-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$95 OFF</div>12.9-inch iPad Pro Smart Keyboard Folio (2020) for $104.05</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThis model is on the low-end of the price range for Apple keyboards because it lacks features like backlit keys and a trackpad, as well as the Magic Keyboard's floating cantilever design. It's still a solid full-size keyboard accessory for any 12.9-inch iPad Pro owners who don't specifically need a trackpad or backlit keys.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nNext, the 2020 12.9-inch iPad Pro Magic Keyboard remains on sale at Best Buy, available for <a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/153062/633495/10014?prodsku=6340357&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.bestbuy.com%2Fclick%2F-%2F6340357%2Fpdp&amp;intsrc=APIG_4831\"><strong>$199.00</strong></a>, down from $349.00. This remains the best price we've ever tracked on this version of the Magic Keyboard, and Best Buy is the only major retailer offering it at this price.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/153062/633495/10014?prodsku=6340357&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.bestbuy.com%2Fclick%2F-%2F6340357%2Fpdp&amp;intsrc=APIG_4831\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$150 OFF</div>12.9-inch iPad Pro Magic Keyboard (2020) for $199.00</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nLastly, the 2021 12.9-inch iPad Pro Magic Keyboard is on sale for <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09327XWMP?tag=macrumors-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\"><strong>$324.88</strong></a> on Amazon, down from $349.00. Only the Black color is on sale at this price, and it's another new all-time low price for an iPad keyboard accessory.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09327XWMP?tag=macrumors-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$24 OFF</div>12.9-inch iPad Pro Magic Keyboard (2021) for $324.88</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThis brand new model of the Magic Keyboard features a trackpad, USB-C port for charging, backlit keys, and a floating cantilever design with magnetic attachment to the iPad Pro.
