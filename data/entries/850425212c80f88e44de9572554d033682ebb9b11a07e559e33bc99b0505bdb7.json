According to a new leak, that‚Äôs going to change with version 10.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1788333/watchos-10-apple-watch-updated-interface-enhancements.html\">Mark Gurman reported</a> watchOS 10 was due for an ‚Äúupdated interface,‚Äù Analyst 941 on Twitter, who has leaked a flurry of information about <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1519552/ios-17-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">iOS 17</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1351959/iphone-15-plus-pro-ultra-rumors-specs-release-price.html\">iPhone 15</a>, claims watchOS 10 will have ‚Äúa redesigned homescreen layout/grid.‚Äù According to the report, the new grid is ‚Äúgoing to be much easier to use,‚Äù with a layout that takes its design cues from iOS.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>Happy 9:41 AM<br /><br />I saved the best for last, watchOS will have a redesigned homescreen layout/grid.<br /><br />heavy details SOON. but it's going to be much easier to use, move, &amp; act more familiar to iOS, including folders.üìÇ<br /><br />Unsure if it will be a third option or replace grid as default. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://t.co/GuNvcnmIox&amp;xcust=1-1-1792206-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">pic.twitter.com/GuNvcnmIox</a></p>‚Äî 941 (@analyst941) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/analyst941/status/1648366185967239170?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-1792206-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">April 18, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Analyst 941, that means icons will be arranged in rows rather than in a honeycomb pattern. Unlike on the iPhone, you‚Äôll scroll vertically to see the rest of your apps rather than swiping from side to side. According to the renders they provide, nine apps will fit on the screen at once, with three more partially visible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Analyst 941 also says watchOS 10 will support folders for the first time, though it‚Äôs unclear how they will work. They say folders will ‚Äúbe very reminiscent of the iOS 4-6 days,‚Äù which were limited to 12 apps and a single screen. Since you can‚Äôt hide apps on Apple Watch as you can on the iPhone, folders will be an important way to clean up a watch with lots of apps installed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The leaker says they will provide ‚Äúheavy details SOON‚Äù and we can‚Äôt wait to see what else watchOS 10, which is shaping up to be the biggest news out of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678333/wwdc-ios-macos-watchos-hardware-keynote.html\">WWDC</a>, has to offer.</p>\n\nApple Watch</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"850425212c80f88e44de9572554d033682ebb9b11a07e559e33bc99b0505bdb7","category":"Apple"}
