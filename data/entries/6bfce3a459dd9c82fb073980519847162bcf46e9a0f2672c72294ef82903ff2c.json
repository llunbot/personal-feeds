{"title":"Google Channels Jony Ive in Ad Promoting Pixel 5a Headphone Jack","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/27/google-pixel-5a-headphone-jack-ad/","date":1630092648000,"content":"Google today shared a new Pixel 5a ad that's meant to parody some of the product intro videos that former Apple design chief Jony Ive used to make to highlight new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> features.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div></div>\r\n<br />\r\nIn the video, Google spends a full two minutes describing the design of the Pixel 5a's headphone jack in exaggeratory language, and as noted by <em><a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/google-pixel-5a-ad-spoofs-apple-with-humorous-ode-to-the-headphone-jack/#ftag=CADf328eec\">CNET</a></em>, there are even two moments where the video uses Ive's British pronunciation of aluminum. From the video description:<blockquote>Calling this perfectly-symmetrical, technological marvel, a \"headphone jack\" may feel like an understatement...but technically, that's what it's called, so... fair enough. Behold! The Headphone Jack, on the Google Pixel 5a with 5G.</blockquote>Since Jony Ive is no longer Apple's design chief and does not make Apple's product videos, it's not clear why Google has opted to make a video imitating him two years after he left the company. A video promoting the headphone jack is also an unusual choice as fervor over the component has died down now that many high-end smartphones have eliminated it, including Google's own flagship Pixel models. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/17/google-5g-low-cost-pixel-5a-smartphone/\">$449 Pixel 5a</a> goes on sale today. In addition to a headphone jack, it features a 6.3-inch display with hole punch camera cutout, IP67 water resistance, 5G connectivity, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G chip.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nGoogle's Pixel 5a competes with the $699 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12 mini</a> and the $399 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a> at the current time, but Apple plans to release an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">upgraded 5G version of the iPhone SE</a> for 2022.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google/\">Google</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/google-pixel/\">Google Pixel</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/27/google-pixel-5a-headphone-jack-ad/\">Google Channels Jony Ive in Ad Promoting Pixel 5a Headphone Jack</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/google-channels-jony-ive-in-ad-promoting-pixel-5a-headphone-jack.2308942/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Al1h6FO755E:pmgmRieXC2A:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Al1h6FO755E:pmgmRieXC2A:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/Al1h6FO755E\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6bfce3a459dd9c82fb073980519847162bcf46e9a0f2672c72294ef82903ff2c","category":"Apple"}
