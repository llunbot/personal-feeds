After passing through the city, the riders head to the Alto de San Jeronimo. The second category ascent averages 3.3% over 13km. However, the first 5.1km average 6.9%, and thereafter numerous downhill sections decreases the average gradient before the summit is crested.</span></p>\n<p><span>After the descent, the riders return to </span><span>Córdoba for a second occasion. After navigating around the city, the finish line is passed for the first occasion with just over 30km remaining. T</span><span>he riders will then take on the Alto Del 14%. The climb averages 5.6% over 7.6km, though as is the norm at La Vuelta, the gradients are irregular. The most difficult section is the final 1.8km, which averages 9.4%.</span></p>\n<p><span>At the top, they’ll still be almost 20km left, and the initial 10km are downhill. Some sections of the descent are technical, so the bravest descenders will be able to make an impression here. The final 10km are flat, and take place around Córdoba, where the city hosts a stage finish for the twentieth occasion.</span></p>\n<h4><b>Contenders</b></h4>\n<p><span>The two categorised climbs will have a major impact on the stage result. However, they are far from the only factor. A lot could change in the</span><span> 20km remaining after the <span>Alto Del 14%. There'll be time</span></span><span> to make up ground on the descent, whilst solo attackers must preserve energy to stay clear on the conclusive 10km, where the road flattens.</span></p>\n<p><span>Should any of the GC favourites roll the dice, it must be a carefully thought out move, perhaps with satellite riders dropping back from the breakaway to support their leader. In spite of that, </span><span><strong>Primož Roglič</strong> caught his rivals off-guard when he </span><span>attacked on the </span><span>Puerto de Almáchar two days ago.</span></p>\n<p><span>Of the GC favourites, Roglič is by far the quickest in a sprint. </span><span><strong>Felix Großschartner</strong> </span><span>and <strong>Egan Bernal</strong> have also demonstrated a turn of speed. However, Rogli<span>č</span>’s rivals know that towing him to the line leaves him with a great chance of winning the stage. Due to this, Jumbo-Visma might be forced to the front of the peloton</span><span>. With </span><span> decisive, mountains stages approaching, they may prefer to preserve their resources.</span><span> This leaves the breakaway with a good chance.</span></p>\n<p><span>Astana - Premier Tech have recently announced that they’ll </span><a href=\"https://www.astanapremiertech.com/astana-team-set-to-continue-in-2022/\" target=\"_blank\"><span>continue in 2022</span></a><span> with the return of </span><span>Alexander Vinokourov</span><span>. However, they haven't <span>genuinely </span>challenged for a Vuelta a España stage since </span><b>Alex Aranburu</b><span> finished second in the opening time-trial. Aranburu has since withdrawn from La Vuelta, which is a blow for Astana — he would have been a viable option here. Instead, </span><b>Ion Izagirre, Gorka Izagirre </b><span>and </span><b>Omar Fraile</b><span> may try their luck.</span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GettyImages-1335563009_1024x1024.jpg?v=1629904390\" /></span></p>\n<p><em>Fraile</em><b> </b><em>looks ready for a big day...</em></p>\n<p><b>Matteo Trentin</b><span> is another rider with supreme pedigree at </span><span>La Vuelta — he won four stages at the 2017 edition. Trentin played his hand from the stage 10 breakaway but could only finish thirteenth. The kilometres after the final climb allow strong descenders such as Trentin to move back to the front of the race if they are dropped, where he’d be threatening in a sprint.</span></p>\n<p><b>Michael Matthews</b><span> possesses similar qualities to Trentin, and would perhaps be even more feared by others in a sprint.</span><span> </span><b>Rob Stannard </b>and <strong>Nick Schultz</strong> are<span> <span>Team BikeExchange's </span>other options.</span></p>\n<p><span>Trek-Segafredo have had a sound Vuelta a España up to this point. Kenny Elissonde enjoyed a brief spell in red, whilst Giulio Ciccone looks likely to finish in the top ten overall. However, we haven’t seen much of Grand Tour debutant </span><b>Quinn Simmons</b><span>. The American has demonstrated good climbing and sprinting skills before, and won the Tour de Wallonie in late July. If he joins the breakaway, he might be competing for victory in </span><span>Córdoba.</span></p>\n<p><span>Other riders to consider from a breakaway are </span><b>Michael Storer, Romain Bardet, Mauri Vansevenant, Jhonatan Narváez</b><span> and </span><b>Clément Champoussin.</b></p>\n<p><i><span>Cover image: </span></i><i><span>Luis Angel Gomez / ASO</span></i></p>\n<p> </p>\n<div></div>\n    ","author":"Peter Stuart","siteTitle":"Rouleur - Rouleur: Inside the peloton","siteHash":"ea8d66ea396dc8e8ee093b36b528071101364ebaa7b32b2b8db5023e357746ea","entryHash":"fc58f70e3124835bb5b3550426809dcd9b6ac066635460ebbf6742f836986ff3","category":"Cycling"}
