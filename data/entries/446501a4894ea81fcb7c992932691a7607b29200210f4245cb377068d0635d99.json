Masks will be required in select stores starting on Wednesday, July 29. The Delta variant is more infectious than original COVID-19 strains and cases have been spiking across much of the United States.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple informed employees about the change in a memo:<blockquote>\"After carefully reviewing the latest CDC recommendations, and analyzing the health and safety data for your local area, we are updating our guidance on face masks for your store. Starting July 29, face masks will be required in store for customers and team members - even if they're vaccinated.\" The company added it is making the change \"out of an abundance of caution.\"</blockquote>In addition to requiring most employees to wear masks, Apple is also asking retail staff to get vaccinated. \"Apple encourages everyone who is eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, to take it,\" reads Apple's memo. At this time, the vaccine is not required.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has not yet shut down any of its retail stores nor does it seem to have plans to, but the company last week announced that its corporate employees will not be returning to offices <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/28/apple-considering-vaccine-requirement-for-employees/\">until October at least</a>. Apple had originally planned to have employees back in the office three days a week starting in September.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-retail-stores/\">Apple Stores</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-retail/\">Apple retail</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/covid-19-coronavirus/\">COVID-19 Coronavirus</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/mac-basics-help-and-buying-advice.78\">Mac Basics, Help and Buying Advice</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/28/apple-retail-stores-mask-requirement/\">Many U.S. Apple Retail Stores Again Require Customers to Wear Masks</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=IRc_2aL-Yi8:3dw_9afoiZg:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=IRc_2aL-Yi8:3dw_9afoiZg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/IRc_2aL-Yi8\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"446501a4894ea81fcb7c992932691a7607b29200210f4245cb377068d0635d99","category":"Apple"}
