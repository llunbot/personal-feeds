A well executed comfort break feature means the rider won’t need to remove any upper layers to go to the toilet – handy when it’s very cold – and is quicker and easier for emergency pee stops while out on a ride. </p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-womens-saddles\">Buyer’s guide: Best women’s bike saddles 2023, reviewed by women</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-gravel-bike\">Best of the best gravel bikes 2023: Cyclist’s top-rated gravel and adventure bikes</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-womens-bibshorts-buyers-guide\">Best women’s bib shorts: A buyer’s guide to the best bibs for cycling</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>In this sense it also promotes dignity and safety, with riders not needing to strip off the majority of their clothes to use the loo.

The design cleverly uses straps that connect at the upper back which split again to allow and rejoin by overlapping at the lower back. This is great because it stops the straps sliding on the shoulders – without the need for a cross strap design – and still holds the fabric secure when the feature is not in use. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The chamois is high density and provides effective support on long rides, and there are leg pockets for storage – worth noting that these sit on the front of the leg rather than the traditional side placement. The GV500 bib shorts do run pretty small so we’d recommend sizing up at least one size.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/endura-gv500-reiver-bib-shorts-review\" target=\"_blank\">Endura women’s GV500 Reiver bib shorts review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>7.

It’s secure and easy to use, though the bib shorts do run very small so we would definitely recommend sizing up to get the most out of the shorts and the toilet break feature. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cut itself is compressive and soft, and there is a wide range of sizing options to choose from. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://intl.velocio.cc/collections/womens-bibs-shorts-tights/products/womens-utility-bib-short\" target=\"_blank\">Velocio</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/velocio-womens-utility-bib-shorts-review\" target=\"_blank\">Velocio women’s Utility bib shorts review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>8.

We really enjoyed the compression, though would recommend it for mid-to-cool bib short weather riding as the fabric has limited breathability for really hot days. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Mono bib shorts use the classic cross strap comfort break design, which is highly elasticated and the rear panel springs back nicely into place when no longer in use. They’re also very reasonably priced so are a good option for those looking on a tighter budget. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://www.universalcolours.com/product/mono-womens-bib-short\" target=\"_blank\">Universal Colours</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/universal-colours-mono-womens-bib-shorts-review\" target=\"_blank\">Universal Colours Mono women’s bib shorts review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>9.

It seems strange but it works incredibly well – all you have to do is unclip at the front (which is low enough to reach under a jersey or jacket) and pull down at the back. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fabric is lightweight and the chamois is brilliant, especially on long rides, though we personally prefer a slightly longer bib short leg than on the Summits. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Buy now from <a href=\"https://www.pactimo.co.uk/products/womens-summit-classic-cycling-bibs\" target=\"_blank\">Pactimo</a></strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/pactimo-womens-summit-classic-bib-shorts-review\" target=\"_blank\">Pactimo women’s Summit Classic bib shorts review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>10.

There is a secure bib strap connection at the upper back and Lusso has managed to create a highly elasticated design with the need for overlapping straps or extra security. The rear panel just pulls down and works excellently. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bib shorts also have a high density chamois and minimal seams.

It is easy to pull down but the lack of bib strap connection at the back does mean they straps can slide if you’re wearing a slippery base layer.

This means you’re not reliant on stretchy material alone, which can become loose over time, though does take a little getting used to. Although it can be a little fiddly, it is an effective option for those that want a fully detachable design. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bib short fabric has a high level of compression and, paired with a reliable long distance chamois, is a good option for big days out on the bike, whether for racing or leisure. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Read our full <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/reviews/assos-uma-gtv-bib-shorts-c2-review\" target=\"_blank\">Assos UMA GTV bib shorts C2 review</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>FAQs</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Do I need a comfort break feature? </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Comfort break features can be very useful for several reasons. Firstly, they’re handy for those urgent toilet stops mid-ride as they enable you to remain fully dressed and decent while still being able to pee. Secondly, they are especially useful in the winter when you don’t want to remove all of your upper layers to go to the toilet. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They’re designed to reduce faff and are a great addition to bib shorts and tights for any rider, especially those doing big days out on the bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How do comfort break features work? </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Each comfort break feature will function slightly differently, but there are a few common trends. The most widely used system features bib straps that cross over at the back, combined with a high stretch rear panel on the shorts, which allows the bibs to be pulled down at the rear without pulling the straps off the shoulders. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another popular design sees a connection between traditional vertical bib straps on the upper back, which serves the same purpose. Some brands also employ magnetic clips so that the straps can be disconnected on either the front or the back. No one design is categorically superior to another, and we’ve tested a range of different systems to give your our honest feedback on each style. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What to look out for in a comfort break feature</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Comfort break bib shorts, like much cycling kit, can be broken down into key elements to check for, and we’ve listed a few below: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Strap design</strong> – look at how the comfort break feature operates. If you struggle with arm mobility, it might be best to avoid ones that require clipping and unclipping at the back. If you want a really secure design, check how the straps sit on the shoulder both while riding and when the fabric is pulled down. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Fit and compression</strong> – to allow the rear of the shorts to be pulled down, many brands will use looser or stretchier fabric on the lower back to facilitate this movement. If you want a really compressive fit all round, it’s worth looking at how much give that area has and if the cut is high or low waisted. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Sizing </strong>– it’s important to check whether a set of bib shorts run true-to-size, especially when looking at comfort break features. If you end up with a size that’s too small, it’s likely it will impact how easy the feature is to use as the area may already be reaching its maximum stretch. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Chamois</strong> – comfort break features are typically geared towards longer rides and as such, make sure to check out our reviews on each chamois. It’s one of the few elements that can’t really be tried before purchase so we’ve made sure to include extensive testing for each of our bib short reviews. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Pockets</strong> – you don’t need pockets, but we’d argue that at least one cargo pocket on long distance bib shorts is a major bonus. They provide quick and easy storage access while riding, great for snacks or your phone. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-bib-shorts-with-pee-feature\">Best toilet-friendly cycling shorts 2023: Buyer’s guide to comfort break bib shorts</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Charlotte Head &#124; Tech Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"f0f3ffa5a1dd978285343fdffd07dc2ce65b143fce532b576b5f54ab495dfb04","category":"Cycling"}
