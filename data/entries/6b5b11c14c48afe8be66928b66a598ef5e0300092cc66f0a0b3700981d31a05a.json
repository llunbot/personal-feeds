Believe it or not, this has a US price, and you can order it online!</p>\n<p>You can never call Sony generic. This is the only company in the world that ships a \"4K\" (3840×1644) smartphone, giving the 6.5-inch, 120 Hz OLED a ridiculous 643 PPI. We've seen some of these in person—Sony's densest smartphone displays hit <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/02/xperia-xz-premium-hands-on-sony-powerhouse-has-a-snapdragon-835-and-a-4k-lcd/\">801 PPI once upon a time</a>—and these ultra-dense displays always seemed far past what anyone can see at a reasonable distance. The other uniquely Sony design traits are symmetrical top and bottom bezels and a camera shutter button. There's also a side power button fingerprint reader. I'm starting to think Sony's fancy 4K displays don't support any of the normal under-screen components like a hole punch camera or in-screen fingerprint reader, and that's how this entire design happened.</p>\n<p>There are a bunch of lovely textures happening all over this phone. The back is still glass, but it has a small diamond dimple effect sort of like a diamond plate, and that's <em>in</em> the glass, not under it. Apparently, you can feel it, as Sony calls it a \"functional tactile design.\" The band that wraps around the phone's perimeter is ribbed, and there is diamond knurling on the camera shutter button. There's also a slick-looking matte finish to the glass.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1938524#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1938524&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6b5b11c14c48afe8be66928b66a598ef5e0300092cc66f0a0b3700981d31a05a","category":"Tech"}
