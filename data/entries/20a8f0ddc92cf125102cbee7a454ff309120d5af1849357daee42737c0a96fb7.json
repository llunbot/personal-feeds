It’s still a rigid aluminum hardtail. But now it gets a lighter carbon fork, much bigger tire clearance, hydraulic disc brakes, a bit more modern MicroShift 1x drivetrain, and internal routing for a dropper post. Like its predecessor, it comes in 24″ wheels, or a smaller 20″ version, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Trek’s new lightweight Wahoo Trail 24 kids’ mountain bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_teaser.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_teaser.jpg\" alt=\"Trek Wahoo Trail lightweight alloy kids bike hybrid mountain bike, 20&quot;\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_teaser.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_teaser-297x165.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_teaser-800x444.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_teaser-120x67.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_teaser-768x427.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_teaser-1536x853.jpg 1536w\" /></a><figcaption><em>all c. Trek</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Officially, the Wahoo family is Trek’s hybrid kids bike, with ‘just big enough’ tires to make it off-road-ready, but sticking with a light and simple rigid frame and fork. Well for 2024, the hybrids lean a bit harder into mountain bikes with the new Wahoo Trail, bumping up to 2.2″ tires – <em>and room for more</em> – plus, what Trek is calling an ‘adult-level’ spec with kid-specific component fits.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>So what’s new?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_knobby-tires.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_knobby-tires.jpg\" alt=\"Trek Wahoo Trail lightweight alloy kids bike hybrid mountain bike, 2.2&quot; tires\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_knobby-tires.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_knobby-tires-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_knobby-tires-800x800.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_knobby-tires-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_knobby-tires-768x768.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_hydraulic-disc-brakes.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_hydraulic-disc-brakes.jpg\" alt=\"Trek Wahoo Trail lightweight alloy kids bike hybrid mountain bike, disc brakes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_hydraulic-disc-brakes.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_hydraulic-disc-brakes-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_hydraulic-disc-brakes-800x800.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_hydraulic-disc-brakes-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_hydraulic-disc-brakes-768x768.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_carbon-fork.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_carbon-fork.jpg\" alt=\"Trek Wahoo Trail lightweight alloy kids bike hybrid mountain bike, carbon fork\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_carbon-fork.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_carbon-fork-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_carbon-fork-800x800.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_carbon-fork-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_carbon-fork-768x768.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to the old Wahoo, this new Wahoo Trail simply looks beefed up for mountain biking. The 4 big visual shifts are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Proper knobby mountain bike tire. Now the bike gets spec’d with 2.2″ Kenda Amrak knobbies. But there’s apparently room for up to 2.4″ tires if your grom wants to go bigger down the trail.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Real disc brakes. The new bike gets short-reach Tektro hydraulic disc brakes sized for small hands &amp; 160mm rotors.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>More aggressive frame shaping. A dropped toptube and seattube strut mean more standover clearance. But it also helps build in space for internal dropper post routing, if you want to swap in a 31.6 dropper in the future.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Lastly, a carbon fork. Bigger tires, disc brakes, and a burly frame inevitably mean more weight. So, Trek gave the Wahoo Trail a carbon fork with its own integrated fender to keep weight in check. Complete bike weight is still a bit more than 1kg heavier than the old rim brake 1.95″-tired version.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_20-24-in-geometry.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_20-24-in-geometry.jpg\" alt=\"Trek Wahoo Trail lightweight alloy kids bike hybrid mountain bike, new geometry\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_20-24-in-geometry.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_20-24-in-geometry-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_20-24-in-geometry-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_20-24-in-geometry-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_20-24-in-geometry-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_20-24-in-geometry-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_20-24-in-geometry-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_20-24-in-geometry-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Less obvious, but Trek’s new Alpha Silver Aluminum Wahoo Trail gets a geometry upgrade with a much slacker 67° head angle, longer chainstays &amp; more BB drop. It’s definitely a more MTB-oriented bike now with about 2cm longer Reach and lower Stack and longer wheelbase overall to complement the bigger tires.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_microshift-1x.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_microshift-1x.jpg\" alt=\"Trek Wahoo Trail lightweight alloy kids bike hybrid mountain bike, microshift advent 1x 9-speed\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_microshift-1x.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_microshift-1x-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_microshift-1x-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_microshift-1x-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_microshift-1x-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_microshift-1x-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Trek-Wahoo-Trail-lightweight-alloy-kids-bike-hybrid-mountain-bike_microshift-1x-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Wahoo Trail build also upgrades to a MicroShift Advent 1x 9-speed drivetrain with a wider gear spread and a kid-friendly trigger shifter.
