Their relative simplicity compared to full-suspension models tends to allow companies to hit a lower price point without sacrificing much in terms of component quality, potentially opening up mountain biking to people who might not otherwise consider it. The first e-hardtail I checked out, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/07/aventons-ramblas-an-e-bike-that-offers-a-hard-tail-and-a-solid-ride/\">Aventon's Ramblas</a>, fits this description to a T, offering a solid trail riding experience at a price that's competitive with similar offerings from major manufacturers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.velotricbike.com/products/velotric-summit-1?variant=42388148912311\">Velotric's Summit 1</a> has a slightly different take on the equation. The company has made a few compromises that allowed it to bring the price down to just under $2,000, which is significantly lower than a lot of the competition. The result is something that's a bit of a step down on some more challenging trails. But it still can do about 90 percent of what most alternatives offer, and it's probably a better all-around bicycle for people who intend to also use it for commuting or errand-running.</p>\n<h2>Making the Summit</h2>\n<p>Velotric is another e-bike-only company, and we've <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/08/no-gimmicks-no-problems-the-low-fuss-reasonably-priced-e-bike/\">generally been impressed</a> by its products, which offer a fair bit of value for their price. The Summit 1 seems to be a reworking of its T-series of bikes (which <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/08/velotric-t1-e-bike-review-low-key-and-sleek-yet-powerful-and-fun/\">also impressed us</a>) into mountain bike form. You get a similar app experience and integration of the bike into Apple's Find My system, though the company has ditched the thumbprint reader, which is supposed to function as a security measure. Velotric has also done some nice work adapting its packaging to smooth out the assembly process, placing different parts in labeled sub-boxes.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038100#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2038100&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0242167a1e68d265641927391ce426450fe6f70e22f4b89b47837d4c2a55c4c7","category":"Tech"}
