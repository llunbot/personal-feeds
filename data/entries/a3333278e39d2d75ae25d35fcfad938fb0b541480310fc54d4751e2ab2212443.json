If the Vision Pro's glass cracks or the device is damaged in some other way, you could be facing an expensive repair without <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/applecare/\">AppleCare</a>+.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/06/vision-pro-headset-1.jpg\" width=\"2698\" height=\"1518\" />\r<br />\nOn <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/repair\">Apple's Vision Pro service page</a>, repair fees are listed. It will cost $799 to fix cracked cover glass, but if you need any other component repaired, the cost shoots up to $2,399. That's just $1,100 less than the full cost of the Vision Pro to begin with.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌AppleCare‌+ <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/applecare-plus-for-vision-pro/\">is priced at $499</a> for two years of coverage, or customers can choose to pay $24.99 per month for ‌AppleCare‌+, with the coverage lasting until payments are canceled, so it's not cheap.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nVision Pro ‌AppleCare‌+ includes unlimited repairs for accidental damage, Apple-certified service and support, Express Replacement Service, and 24/7 priority access to \"Apple experts.\" It is worth noting that there is a $299 deductible for any ‌AppleCare‌+ repair to the device itself (including a cracked display), and a $29 service fee for any accessories such as the Light Seal that are in need of repair.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGiven the price of the Vision Pro headset, ‌AppleCare‌+ might be worth purchasing. As repairs are expensive, it will be worth finding some kind of protective case to use at a minimum to keep it safe if you plan to bring it from one location to another. Apple sells a case for $200, but there should soon be multiple third-party options available.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-vision-pro/\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AppleVisionPro\">Vision Pro (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-vision-pro.209\">Apple Vision Pro</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/19/vision-pro-repair-cost/\">Apple Vision Pro Repairs Cost Up to $2,400 Without AppleCare+</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-vision-pro-repairs-cost-up-to-2-400-without-applecare.2416819/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a3333278e39d2d75ae25d35fcfad938fb0b541480310fc54d4751e2ab2212443","category":"Apple"}
