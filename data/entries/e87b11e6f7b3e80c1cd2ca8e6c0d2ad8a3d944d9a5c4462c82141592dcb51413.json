Hidden inside a lot of words about a “$100 million credit facility from asset-based lender (ABL) Eclipse Business Capital”, Kent Outdoors announced that they would be selling the Kona brand. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“In connection with the investment of capital and the management team coming onboard, the Company performed a strategic review of its operating units and determined that it would continue to seek a buyer for its bike business, Kona. This move allows the Company to direct its resources toward investment in its key water sports businesses. The bike industry has faced very significant challenges in the post-COVID world and Kona has not been immune to these headwinds.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s unclear whether all current employees have been laid off, and if the sale will be for anything more than just the Kona name. Check out the most recent press release in full below. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Original post:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sea Otter is in full swing and there are a <em>lot</em> of brands in attendance. But it’s the brand that isn’t in attendance that’s generating the most buzz. After appearing on site and setting up their tent, Kona Bicycles then tore down that same tent before the show even started. By the time we rolled into the venue on Wednesday at the end of our ride with Otso Bicycles, the space for Kona’s tent was already vacant (circled above).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The move is a head-scratcher for a number of reasons – the brand had just unveiled a <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/kona-ouroboros-gravel-adventure-dropbar-mtb/\" target=\"_blank\">new adventure bike</a> as the show opened, and it seems like a strange move considering they had already paid to get their booth to the venue and set it up. However, the day after their mysterious exit, it was announced that <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/kona-bicycles-is-acquired-by-a-former-watersports-company/\" target=\"_blank\">Kona’s parent company, Kent Outdoors</a>, had just appointed a new CFO. According to the press release, new CFO Rob Otto has experience “improving profitability and operational efficiencies along with managing integrations”. Conspicuously absent from the press release is any mention of Kona Bicycles. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve poked around Sea Otter to find more details, but for now, no one is willing to make any sort of comment on the record. <a href=\"https://www.bicycleretailer.com/industry-news/2024/04/17/wheres-kona-brand-sets-then-breaks-down-sea-otter\" target=\"_blank\">BRAIN reported </a>earlier in the week that the company expected to have a “town hall” meeting on Thursday, which seems likely to have taken place, but without any further news. We’ll keep digging, but for now, the future of Kona remains up for interpretation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>PR</strong> <strong>From Kent Outdoors</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Executive Hire is Part of Company’s Strategic Investment in Leadership, Innovation and Operations</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>SALT LAKE CITY, April 18, 2024 /PRNewswire/ — Kent Outdoors (“Kent” or the “Company”), which has been helping people in their pursuit of outdoor adventures for more than 60 years, is pleased to announce that it has added Rob Ottoto the company’s executive management team as the company’s chief financial officer.

The new ABL facility follows recent investments from Goldman Sachs and Comvest Partners. These investments are critical to the Company’s efforts to implement a strategy for future growth and success as it continues to market innovative new products for outdoor enthusiasts and adventure seekers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We appreciate being trusted to deliver this critical financing on an expedited timeline.

The capital investment is instrumental to maintaining solid partnerships with our key vendor partners and customers while allowing Kent the flexibility to also pursue new growth opportunities,” said Kent Executive Chairman Lee Belitsky. “The support also allows the Company to continue to build our market share by attracting new marquee customers and maintaining long-term relationships with key suppliers.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Belitsky joined Kent as part of the capital investment, bringing significant experience in the sporting goods industry as a key executive who helped drive Dick’s Sporting Goods growth over the past 25 years.
