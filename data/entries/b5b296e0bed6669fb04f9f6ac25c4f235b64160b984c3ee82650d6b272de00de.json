Generative Remove is Lightroom’s\nmost powerful remove tool yet, giving everyone the power to remove\nunwanted objects from any photo non-destructively in a single\nclick by intelligently matching the removed area with pixel\nperfect generations for high-quality, realistic and stunning\nresults. From removing distractions in family photos, to\nempowering professionals with speedier retouching workflows and\nmore fine-grain control, Generative Remove empowers exciting\ncapabilities for all photographers. Generative Remove is available\ntoday as an early access feature across the Lightroom ecosystem\nfor millions of users.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As software ever more dominates the field of photography, Nilay Patel often asks, “<a href=\"https://twitter.com/reckless/status/1578031596737024005\">What is a photo</a>?”</p>\n\n<p>I’m not exactly comfortable with making removal of people and objects this easy, but I also really want to use the feature myself. The discomfort this causes is exactly in line with the discomfort that <a href=\"https://winworldpc.com/product/ad-ps/1x\">Photoshop 1.0</a> raised in 1990. It’s raising to the level of table stakes. Google launched Magic Eraser in 2021. Adobe’s brief demo video in this press release doesn’t show a professional photographer — it’s a woman shooting photos with her phone. Apple is going to have to add this to Photos, and it ought to be announced next month.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/05/21/adobe-lightroom-generative-remove\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b5b296e0bed6669fb04f9f6ac25c4f235b64160b984c3ee82650d6b272de00de","category":"Tech"}
