Last year, Charlotte Kool (Team DSM) won two stages, winning the overall by 11 seconds ahead of Canyon-Sram’s Chloe Dygert. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get tickets for the Ford RideLondon-Essex 100, <a href=\"https://www.letsdothis.com/gb/e/2024-ford-ridelondon-essex-193788/race-selection?eventId=193788&amp;preferred=true&amp;utm_organiser_id=29443\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>. </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/ridelondon-2024-route\">Route announced for 2024 Ford RideLondon 100, confirmed until 2026</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Robyn Davidson &#124; Editorial Assistant","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"d2c3b8909f7e46ffa99c92c965c768dd4cbdae9cf3a3a687b9ae1f0eff27ea93","category":"Cycling"}
