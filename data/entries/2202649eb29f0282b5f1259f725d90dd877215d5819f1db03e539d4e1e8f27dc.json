Di Benedetto, reporting for The Verge:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The tech industry’s relentless march toward labeling everything\n“plus,” “pro,” and “max” soldiers on, with Dell now taking the\nnaming scheme to baffling new levels of confusion. The PC maker\nannounced at CES 2025 that it’s cutting names like XPS, Inspiron,\nLatitude, Precision, and OptiPlex from its new laptops, desktops,\nand monitors and replacing them with three main product lines:\nDell (yes, just <em>Dell</em>), Dell Pro, and Dell Pro Max.</p>\n\n<p>If you think that sounds a bit Apple-y and bland, you’re right.\nBut Dell is taking it further by also adding a bit of auto\nindustry parlance with three sub-tiers: Base, Plus, and Premium.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s simple, really.
