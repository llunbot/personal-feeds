A launch has been thought to be imminent for a while now. In fact, it was originally rumored to be planned as Apple's first hardware launch of the year, but that turned out to be the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/19/apple-announces-iphone-16e/\">iPhone 16e</a>, which debuted over the past week.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGurman last week said Apple will begin selling new MacBook Air models featuring its latest M4 chip by March \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/17/gurman-m4-macbook-air-models-launch-march/\">at the latest</a>,\" so his wording suggests he is fully confident that the machines are arriving next month. Whether that's in the first half of March or later in the month is still unclear. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nTwelve days ago Gurman claimed that the machines would be introduced \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/11/gurman-iphone-se-4-by-next-week/\">within weeks</a>.\" While he's betting on March, Gurman seems not further forward on learning the exact release timing of the new versions of the company's most popular laptop.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple inadvertently <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/11/macos-sequoia-15-2-m4-macbook-air-leak/\">confirmed</a> the upcoming M4 ‌MacBook Air‌ machines back in December when the macOS Sequoia 15.2 software update included files for unreleased \"Mac16,12\" and \"Mac16,13\" machines. The files referenced the \"‌‌MacBook Air‌‌ (13-inch, M4, 2025)\" and the \"‌‌MacBook Air‌‌ (15-inch, M4, 2025).\"<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macbook-air/\">MacBook Air</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#15-MacBook-Air\">15\" MacBook Air (Don't Buy)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#MacBook_Air\">13\" MacBook Air (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macbook-air.122\">MacBook Air</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/23/m4-macbook-air-march-debut-retail-teams/\">M4 MacBook Air Marketing, Sales, Retail Teams Prepare for March Debut</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/m4-macbook-air-marketing-sales-retail-teams-prepare-for-march-debut.2450037/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"3c3ce70b4eba27d60ef0fd5bd629675d797016c68923445b82583f1f83596f41","category":"Apple"}
