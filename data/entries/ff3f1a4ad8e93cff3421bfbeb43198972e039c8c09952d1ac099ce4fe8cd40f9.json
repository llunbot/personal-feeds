Good news: if you already have a K-EDGE mount, you’re probably in luck. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After partnering with Hammerhead, K-EDGE has introduced the HMS or Hammerhead Mounting System. The HMS is an insert kit that will adapt almost 50 different K-EDGE mounts to use with the Karoo 2’s unique connection. With the HMS insert, the computer attaches in the same was as the stock Hammerhead mount – slide it back onto the mount to lock in place, twist and then slide forward to release. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Kit-scaled-e1695836205236.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"425\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Kit-scaled-e1695836205236-800x425.jpg\" alt=\"Hammerhead HMS mount insert\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Kit-scaled-e1695836205236-800x425.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Kit-scaled-e1695836205236-297x158.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Kit-scaled-e1695836205236-120x64.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Kit-scaled-e1695836205236-768x408.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Kit-scaled-e1695836205236-1536x815.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Kit-scaled-e1695836205236-2048x1087.jpg 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>(photo/K-EDGE)</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The HMS Insert Kit is made in the USA and will sell for just $12.99, including a selection of different hardware and spacers to work with various mounts.

They’re beautiful, incredibly robust, and will likely outlast your bike. So it’s a good thing when you can adapt them to new computer systems. Compared to the mount that came with the Karoo 2, the K-EDGE mounts are easier to operate, and of course made from machined aluminum rather than plastic. There’s also no ‘shelf’ underneath the computer to catch sweat like I found with the stock mount. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When used with a wide stem, the Max XL places the computer a little off-center, so you’d be better off using the Boost Stem mount if you want it perfectly aligned. Overall, if you own a Hammerhead Karoo 2, these are the mounts to get. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://k-edge.com/shop/computer-mounts/mounts-accessories/hammerhead-mounting-system-insert-kit/\" target=\"_blank\">k-edge.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/adapt-your-existing-k-edge-mount-for-karoo-2-with-new-hammerhead-mounting-system/\">Adapt Existing K-EDGE Mounts for Karoo 2 w/ New Hammerhead Mounting System</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"ff3f1a4ad8e93cff3421bfbeb43198972e039c8c09952d1ac099ce4fe8cd40f9","category":"Cycling"}
