Aston Martin and Porsche <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/20/first-next-generation-carplay-vehicles-announced/\">previewed next-generation CarPlay vehicle designs</a> late last year, but neither automaker has released any vehicles with support yet.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple continued to highlight next-generation CarPlay <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/06/10/wwdc-2024-next-generation-carplay-images/\">in WWDC 2024 coding sessions</a> for developers, suggesting that the company remains committed to rolling out the system as of three months ago, but it is clearly taking quite some time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Next-Generation CarPlay</h2>\r<br />\nNext-generation CarPlay will have deeper integration with a vehicle's instrument cluster, climate controls, FM radio, and more. It will also support multiple displays across the dashboard, and offer widgets for apps like Calendar and Weather.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn addition, next-generation CarPlay will be highly customizable, allowing automakers to tailor the design of the system to uniquely match their vehicles.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>New Features</h3>\r<br />\n<strong>Instrument Cluster Integration</strong>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/06/Multi-Display-CarPlay-2.jpeg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"896\" />\r<br />\nNext-generation CarPlay will integrate with a vehicle's instrument cluster, including the speedometer, tachometer, odometer, fuel gauge, engine temperature gauge, oil pressure gauge, and more. Apple says drivers will be able to choose from several gauge cluster designs and layouts, including brandâ€‘specific options.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<strong>Climate Controls</strong>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/07/CarPlay-Next-Generation-Screen.jpg\" width=\"3562\" height=\"1990\" />\r<br />\nYou'll be able to access your vehicle's climate controls directly within the new CarPlay interface, allowing you to adjust the temperature of the A/C or heat, fan speed, heated seats, heated steering wheel, and other options.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<strong>Multi-Display Support</strong>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/12/CarPlay-Next-Generation-Multi-Screens.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"897\" />\r<br />\nNext-generation CarPlay will be able to appear across all of the displays in a vehicle, providing a consistent experience across the infotainment system, instrument cluster, and any additional screens on the dashboard. Apple says the new CarPlay will be tailored to each vehicle model to accommodate unique screen shapes and layouts. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<strong>Widgets</strong>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/12/CarPlay-Next-Generation-Widgets.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nWidgets will be a key part of the new CarPlay experience, offering at-a-glance information such as trip duration, fuel economy, distance traveled, calendar events, weather, phone calls, the status of a HomeKit-enabled garage door, and more. It will also be possible to view and scroll through the widgets within the instrument cluster.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<strong>FM Radio App</strong>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/12/CarPlay-Next-Generation-Radio.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"899\" />\r<br />\nNext-generation CarPlay will include an all-new Media app that allows you to easily control the FM radio in your vehicle, such as to change the station.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>New Apps</h3>\r<br />\niOS 17.4 for the iPhone added <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/25/ios-17-4-next-generation-carplay/\">hidden code-level references to eight new CarPlay apps</a>:<ul><li><strong>Auto Settings:</strong> This app will let you manage paired iPhones and adjust vehicle settings.</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Car Camera:</strong> This app will display the vehicle's rear-view camera feed.</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Charge:</strong> For electric vehicles, this app will display battery level, charging status, time remaining until the battery is fully charged, and more.</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Climate:</strong> This app will provide access to a vehicle's climate controls within CarPlay, allowing you to adjust the temperature of the A/C or heating system, fan speed, heated seats, heated steering wheel, and more.</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Closures:</strong> This app will display if any of the vehicle's doors are opened, and it might also display vehicle warning symbols.</li>\r<br />\n<li><strong>Media:</strong> This app will provide access to FM and AM radio station controls within CarPlay, along with other media options like SiriusXM.
