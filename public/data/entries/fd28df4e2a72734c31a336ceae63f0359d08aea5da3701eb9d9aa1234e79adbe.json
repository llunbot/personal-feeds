And today the combo is cheaper than it’s ever been: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/2022-Apple-iPad-10-9-inch-Wi-Fi/dp/B09V3JH3XS/?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Amazon is selling the iPad Air for $499</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K1WWBJK?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Apple Pencil 2 for $89</a>, a combined savings of $140 and the lowest price we’ve ever seen for both.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPad Air has an all-screen aluminum design with a 10.9-inch Liquid Retina display and a USB-C port for charging. It was updated in 2022 with an M1 processor, 12MP front camera, and 5G, and it isn’t expected to get an refresh until 2024. The Apple Pencil 2 magnetically attaches to the side of the iPad to charge and can be used for navigation, writing, and drawing with “imperceptible lag, pixel-perfect precision, and tilt and pressure sensitivity.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/625135/ipad-air-m1-review.html\">4.5-star review</a>, we called the iPad Air the “best iPad in Apple’s range” and our opinion hasn’t changed a year later. And with the Apple Pencil 2 for $140 off, nothing even comes close.</p>\n\niPad</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"fd28df4e2a72734c31a336ceae63f0359d08aea5da3701eb9d9aa1234e79adbe","category":"Apple"}
