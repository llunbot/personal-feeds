And most laptops have uniform, non-modular keyboards, with similar acoustic profiles across models.</p>\n<p>Previous attempts at keylogging VoIP calls, without physical access to the subject, achieved <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.09359.pdf\">91.7 percent top-5 accuracy over Skype in 2017</a> and <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3176258.3176341\">74.3 percent accuracy in VoIP calls in 2018</a>. Combining the output of the keystroke interpretations with a \"hidden Markov model\" (HMM), which guesses at more-likely next-letter outcomes and could correct \"hrllo\" to \"hello,\" saw one prior side channel study's accuracy jump from 72 to 95 percent—though that was <a href=\"https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/sec10/tech/full_papers/Backes.pdf\">an attack on dot-matrix printers</a>. The Cornell researchers believe their paper is the first to make use of the recent sea change in neural network technology, including <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/illustrated-self-attention-2d627e33b20a\">self-attention layers</a>, to propagate an audio side channel attack.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1959255#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1959255&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"112328426f29330b945fcf5ced04d01de3ffedd30bedea1c71b02bc0484fb546","category":"Tech"}
