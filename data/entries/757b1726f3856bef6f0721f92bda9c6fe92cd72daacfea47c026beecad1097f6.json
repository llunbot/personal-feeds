Mimestream is a Mac email client specifically for Gmail. They’ve got plans to expand to iOS, and plans to perhaps expand to IMAP (and JMAP) email accounts in the future, but as it stands today, Mimestream does one thing and does it incredibly well: it’s a true Mac app for Gmail. It’s both a great Mac app and a great Gmail client. $5/month or $50/year, with a two-week free trial.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2023/05/mac-gmail-client-mimestream-reaches-1-0/\">Jason Snell</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple Mail is free.
