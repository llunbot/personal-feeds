Over two-thirds of the trash examined plays host to coastal marine species, many of which are clearly reproducing in what would otherwise be a foreign habitat.</p>\n<p>The findings suggest that, as far as coastal species are concerned, there was nothing inhospitable about the open ocean other than the lack of something solid to latch on to.</p>\n<h2>Into the deep</h2>\n<p>The work isn't a complete surprise, given the aftermath of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, which swept various debris, including entire docks and boats, across the Pacific Ocean and onto North American shores. Coming ashore with the wreckage were a number of Japanese coastal marine species, which indicated that they could survive for long periods adrift in the ocean—the longest officially recorded trip was six years, although the debris might have been in coastal environments for part of that time.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1932346#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1932346&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"78c0e0c3131ef93f6fe78f7a9a09dfe360de30b96072dffa64c117d848cbe921","category":"Tech"}
