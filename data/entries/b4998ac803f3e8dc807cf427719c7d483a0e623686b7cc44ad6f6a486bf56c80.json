The Australian regulator said the company sold 5,300 monitors this way.</p>\n<p>As Ars Technica previously reported, the ACCC launched <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/dell-in-hot-water-for-making-shoppers-think-overpriced-monitors-were-discounted/\">litigation against Dell Australia</a> in November. In June, the Australian Federal Court <a href=\"https://www.judgments.fedcourt.gov.au/judgments/Judgments/fca/single/2023/2023fca0588\">declared</a> that Dell Australia made shoppers believe monitors would be cheaper if bought as an add-on item.</p>\n<p>Here's how the \"misleading representations\" worked. Shoppers of Dell Australia's website who were buying a computer would see an offer for a Dell display with a lower price next to a higher price with a strikethrough line. That suggested to shoppers that the price they'd pay for the monitor if they added it to their cart now would be lower than the monitor's usual cost. But it turns out the strikethrough prices weren't the typical costs. Sometimes, the lower price was actually <em>higher</em> than what Dell Australia typically charged.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1960737#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1960737&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b4998ac803f3e8dc807cf427719c7d483a0e623686b7cc44ad6f6a486bf56c80","category":"Tech"}
