Its successor now breaks with tradition by relinquishing tubular compatibility, in favour of tubeless technology.</p>\n<p>Made from carbon, the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/rim-width-explained-for-road-bikes-mountain-bikes-and-gravel-bikes/\">rim width</a> of the Ghibli 0.9 is broad for a track wheel, measuring 25mm internally and 27.4mm externally. It’s designed to work with wide tyres, too.</p>\n<p>For context, the 25mm internal rim width is the same as the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/components/wheels/wheel-sets/enve-ses-4-5-wheelset-review/\">ENVE SES 4.5</a> wheels found on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/vingegaard-cervelo-s5-versus-pogacar-colnago-v4rs/\">Tadej Pogačar’s Colnago V4Rs at the Tour de France</a>, which ballooned his 28c Continental tyres beyond 31mm in width.</p>\n<p>Campagnolo says Italy’s sprint and endurance track cyclists in Glasgow will race the €3,418 Ghibli 0.9, which weighs a claimed 990g.</p>\n<h2>On track for tubeless</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Campagnolo Ghibli 0.9 disc wheel\" title=\"GHIBLI 09 fondo nero-12\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The 25mm internal rim width is up from 20mm on the old tubular wheel.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Campagnolo </i></span></div>\n<p>Campagnolo explains the internal width of the C21 rim bed has increased from 20mm and is now only compatible with clincher and tubeless tyres.</p>\n<p>While <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/tubeless/\">tubeless tyres</a> have become popular with WorldTour riders on the road, tubulars have remained the go-to option on the track. That will change with the Ghibli 0.9, while the new disc wheel could also signal a move to wider tyres on the track.</p>\n<p>Italian track riders involved in the development of the new wheel wanted to use 23c to 28c tubeless tyres for their performance and safety benefits, according to Campagnolo.</p>\n<p>Again, 28c tyres were <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/pro-bike/tour-de-france-2023-tech-trends/\">commonplace at this year’s Tour de France</a>, but 20c rubber has remained popular on the track.</p>\n<h2>More aerodynamic and lower rolling resistance</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Campagnolo Ghibli 0.9 disc wheel\" title=\"GHIBLI 09 fondo nero-13\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The full-carbon wheel is claimed to be more aerodynamic and faster-rolling.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Campagnolo </i></span></div>\n<p>The Italian brand claims a reduced camber angle on the Ghibli 0.9 reduces its frontal profile and consequently drag.</p>\n<p>Campagnolo says the switch from tubular to tubeless tyres decreases rolling resistance.</p>\n<p>The new C.U.L.T. (Ceramic Ultimate Level Technology) bearings in a cup-and-cone system offer little friction, according to the brand.</p>","author":"Jack Evans","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"ee85cc24d417b990d07106b0a5b171e968e4b985ac7fc0e4c53aa4d4cf1b964b","category":"Cycling"}
