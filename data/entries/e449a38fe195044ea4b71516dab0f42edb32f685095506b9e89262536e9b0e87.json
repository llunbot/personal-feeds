We even <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234986/airpods-max-review.html\">reviewed them a while back, giving them 4/5 stars</a>. The main reason they didn’t get more stars was the price, as we believe they are wildly expensive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This refurbished pair, however, can end up saving you over $200. <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Frefurbished-apple-airpods-max-bluetooth-wireless-headphones-space-gray-2020-1st-generation-target-certified-refurbished%2F-%2FA-88141199%3Fpreselect%3D88141207&amp;publisher_slug=macworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=macworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macworld.com%2Ffeed&amp;u1=1-1-2349984-1-0-0\">This pair in blue spotted at Target is a mere $335.74</a>, which is a much more acceptable price point. Target says they are “a fully functional product that may show some minor cosmetic blemishes” and come with a six-month warranty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A new pair of Apple AirPods Max headphones cost $549, which is a bit too much. At its lowest on Black Friday, the AirPods Max got down to $429, but even that’s pretty expensive. The only way to get these headphones for a decent price is, it seems, to get a refurbished model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What sets these headphones apart? Our expert, Jason Cross, found that the AirPods Max deliver exceptional sound quality, boast “industry-leading” active noise canceling, and are built to last. These features make them a top contender in the headphone market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The AirPods are comfortable to wear for long hours and easy to control. Our review notes that Apple avoided touch controls (everyone with a hoodie rejoice!), opting instead for a digital crown like that on the Apple Watch along with a single button, both on the top of the right earpiece.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While we know it’s ideal to get your tech brand new, sometimes it’s worth going for refurbished options to save a lot of money. These discounted AirPods Max are Target Certified Refurbished, which means they’ve been brought to a “like-new” condition. While some minor cosmetic blemishes may be present, the headphones function normally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So go ahead and grab the cheapest AirPods Max we’ve ever seen.</p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Frefurbished-apple-airpods-max-bluetooth-wireless-headphones-space-gray-2020-1st-generation-target-certified-refurbished%2F-%2FA-88141199%3Fpreselect%3D88141207&amp;publisher_slug=macworld&amp;exclusive=1&amp;article_name=macworld&amp;article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macworld.com%2Ffeed&amp;u1=1-1-2349984-7-0-0\" target=\"_blank\">Get the refurbished AirPods Max for $335.74 at Target</a></p>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\nHeadphones</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"e449a38fe195044ea4b71516dab0f42edb32f685095506b9e89262536e9b0e87","category":"Apple"}
