{"title":"Ongoing iOS 18 Bug Prevents Photo Edits From Being Saved","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/18/ios-18-photos-bug/","date":1731975917000,"content":"There is an ongoing but infrequent <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photos/\">Photos</a> bug that some <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> users <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/photos-not-saving-syncing-iphone-16-pro.2441501/\">have been experiencing</a> since upgrading to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>. The issue occurs when attempting to save edits on an image, with users seeing the following message: \"There was an error saving this photo. Please try again later.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/11/iphone-16-pro-rear-cameras.jpg\" width=\"1610\" height=\"906\" />\r<br />\nAs the message suggests, edits are not able to be saved, and hitting \"Cancel\" and discarding changes is the only way to get out of the editing interface.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nA lot of the complaints about the problem have been from users who have an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> model, but it also appears to be impacting some older iPhones as well. We've run into this bug several times at <em>MacRumors</em>, and it seems to be impacting every version of ‌iOS 18‌ to date.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nReports about the bug started in September, and have continued since then. Most recently, several beta testers running iOS 18.2 have reported <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/1gskugo/ios_182_pb2_there_was_an_error_saving_this_photo/\">seeing the popup</a>. It is worth noting that this is an error that some people ran into before ‌iOS 18‌, but it appears to be much more frequent now.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's not clear what's causing the problem, and it does not seem to impact all users or even every photo. It could be linked to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/live-photos/\">Live Photos</a>, or it could be an issue with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/icloud-photo-library/\">iCloud Photos</a>. Some users have all photos from a specific day bugged, indicating a problem with photo capture or saving.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere is no complete fix, but duplicating a broken image with a \"still photo\" allows the edits to be saved, but it removes Live Photo and Photographic Styles. Apple is aware of the issue and is working on a fix. <div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-18/\">iPadOS 18</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-18.244\">iOS 18</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-18.245\">iPadOS 18</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/18/ios-18-photos-bug/\">Ongoing iOS 18 Bug Prevents Photo Edits From Being Saved</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ongoing-ios-18-bug-prevents-photo-edits-from-being-saved.2443380/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"967f62944b682647fe85d978b2b3547fc398d10995342ef5bade676b37c3effe","category":"Apple"}
