Within the following year, the US passed an infrastructure law, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/07/whats-inside-the-uss-first-big-climate-bill/\">Inflation Reduction Act</a> (IRA), all of which contained provisions intended to help cut the US's emissions in half by 2030. The Environmental Protection Agency has also <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/05/epas-new-rules-will-shift-power-plants-to-carbon-capture-green-hydrogen/\">formulated policies</a> that should radically reduce the emissions from generating electricity.</p>\n<p>In other words, shortly after the report's release, the US formulated a plan to accelerate decarbonization and a target of a 50 percent emissions reduction by 2030.</p>\n<p>Rather than pat themselves on the back, however, the experts who prepared the original report recognized that the US's climate goals require it to reach net-zero emissions by mid-century, and that will require lots of policy changes beyond the ones already in place. The new report is largely a call for people to start thinking of what we need to implement to ensure emissions keep dropping after 2030.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1977299#p3\">Read 19 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1977299&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6948ed64ddd59ce5e9e45f2f744746cad268e623c251ae465a784146c70c7a4a","category":"Tech"}
