(Spotify doesn’t officially support Siri commands on HomePod, but there has been a <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://9to5mac.com/2023/09/21/ios-17-play-spotify-music-on-homepod/&amp;xcust=1-1-2255834-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">workaround</a> since the launch of iOS 17.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as of the release of HomePod Software 17.4, Siri on HomePod will become smart enough to learn this information, just as it does already on the iPhone and iPad. It isn’t entirely clear how this will work, but rather than basing it on repetition or the last service you selected, Siri will probably actively ask for your service of choice the next time you ask it to play something, because that’s what happens on iPhone. The release notes for the software update simply say:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This update enables Siri to learn your preferred media service, so you no longer need to include the name of the media app in your request.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>HomePod Software 17.4 is likely to be released to the public sometime this week. To update your HomePod or HomePod mini, go to the Home app on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, tap the three-dot menu in the top right, <em>Home Settings</em>, and <em>Software Update</em>. If the update is available, hit <em>Update</em> and follow the instructions. A white spinning light will be visible on your HomePod until the update is complete.</p>\n\nSmart Speakers</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"488996c4037b66c48d857c323a2618c31795c96778921b1afe678a4188a47ecd","category":"Apple"}
