This new eBike is their most high-tech to date, providing Lectric users with a new level of technology innovation for the first time. 6-speed Pinion gearbox, push-button electronic shifting, and the hassle-free Gates belt drive.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Lectric ONE belt-drive electronic-shift Pinion commuter ebike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lectric-ONE-eBike-turning-right-e1710952633331.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"670\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lectric-ONE-eBike-turning-right-e1710952633331-800x670.jpeg\" alt=\"Lectric ONE eBike turning right\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lectric-ONE-eBike-turning-right-e1710952633331-800x670.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lectric-ONE-eBike-turning-right-e1710952633331-297x249.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lectric-ONE-eBike-turning-right-e1710952633331-120x101.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lectric-ONE-eBike-turning-right-e1710952633331-768x644.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lectric-ONE-eBike-turning-right-e1710952633331.jpeg 1000w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Lectric Bikes)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Lectric <em>One</em> is designed and built for riders who want both a durable commuter and world-class tech. Also, with <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/priority-bikes-600hxt-pinion-smart-shift-tech/\" target=\"_blank\">Pinion’s Smart.Shift</a> and the Gates Carbon Belt Drive system, the riders will have a virtually maintenance-free steed that will make your daily commute easier than ever. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Equipped with a Pinion gearbox and electronic shifting, the Smart.Shift system gives the rider modern shifting precision at the push of a button. Like paddle shifters in a car, the Pinion’s Smart.Shift delivers shifts quickly and intuitively. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, the beauty of the Gates Carbon Belt drive system is it’s nearly maintenance-free. Comparatively, it uses a carbon fiber-reinforced belt to provide a chainless drivetrain that is clean, quiet, smooth-running, and strong. Therefore, the Gates belt lasts longer than standard chains. It won’t rust, or need to be lubricated, thus providing the rider with a more reliable everyday ride. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>A Word From Lectric</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>“<em>The technology built into this [e]bike is going to appeal to serious commuters, and the maintenance-free aspect that comes along with that tech will excite everyday riders</em>,” said Lectric eBikes CEO and cofounder, Levi Conlow. “<em>And no other [e]bike on the market has this level of world-class technology at such a low price</em>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conlow continued: “<em>We’re committed to bringing great design and the latest tech to our diverse community of riders, and our ongoing partnerships with such industry leaders as Pinion and Gates will help us continue to be the most popular eBike brand in America</em>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Lectric <em>ONE</em> commuter ebike</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lectric-ONE-eBike-studio-drive-side.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lectric-ONE-eBike-studio-drive-side-800x800.jpeg\" alt=\"Lectric ONE eBike studio drive side\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lectric-ONE-eBike-studio-non-drive.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Lectric-ONE-eBike-studio-non-drive-800x800.jpeg\" alt=\"Lectric ONE eBike studio non-drive\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Lectric <em>ONE</em> is powered by Lectric’s proprietary Bafang Sutto 750-watt Stealth M24 rear hub motor technology.
