Hard work, a trailblazing approach, user experience and lessons learned from other industries already setting the standard.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How does it work?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of your budget, your bike itself is almost certainly the most expensive piece of cycling equipment you own. We all know that feeling of wishing our prized possession was wrapped in cotton wool every time we take it out for a blast. But with invisiFRAME there is no need for cotton wool – just a thin, transparent polyurethane film that sticks to your frame like a snug, see-through glove, giving you peace of mind whether you’re tearing down a gravel trail, floating over the cobbles or dodging potholes on your weekend rides.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-01-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-01-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-01-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-01-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-01-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-01-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-01-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-01.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The premium quality film was developed in the automotive industry to protect car paint on high-end sports and race cars. This state-of-the-art paint protection film (PPF) will protect your frame from general wear and tear, gravel debris, scuffs and scratches, abrasions, stone chips, storage and transportation mishaps – just about any damage you could imagine – keeping your bike looking newer for longer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>invisiFRAME offers over 40,000 custom kits, universal protection and after-care products for any bike. And if your bike is not included in the 95% coverage, you can send it into invisiFRAME to be specifically measured for a bespoke kit of your own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People are spending more money than ever on bikes and for under £100 you can protect your frame, keep it pristine and maximise its resale value. What’s not to love?</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"776\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/invisiFRAME-cyclingbrad_1-776x970.jpg\" alt=\"InvisiFRAME\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/invisiFRAME-cyclingbrad_1-776x970.jpg 776w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/invisiFRAME-cyclingbrad_1-240x300.jpg 240w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/invisiFRAME-cyclingbrad_1-768x960.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/invisiFRAME-cyclingbrad_1-750x938.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/invisiFRAME-cyclingbrad_1-1140x1425.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/02/invisiFRAME-cyclingbrad_1.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Ah, but can I do it at home, you ask? Of course. The kits are meticulously designed so that even the untrained novice can easily apply them at home without difficulty. On the other hand, if you don’t feel confident enough to take the job on yourself, just consult the Find A Fitter section on the invisiFRAME website to locate your closest local fitter. And if there isn’t one, then drop an email to info@invisiframe.co.uk and the team will try to direct you to someone.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Inspiration from the automotive industry</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>invisiFRAME is the brainchild of former car painter Lee Regan, who would blow off steam from the demands of his day job by spending his weekends on mountain bike trails. After maxing out his credit card on a new bike, he found himself too afraid of using it for fear of damaging the pristine Yeti frame. It just didn’t make sense throwing it down mountains without any kind of protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then came the light bulb moment. Couldn’t he apply the same protective film that he used on high-end sports cars at work? If this world class PPF is good enough for a supercar, wouldn’t it also be the ultimate protection for a bike? So, he went home and designed his own bespoke frame protection kit and invisiFRAME was born.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-03-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-03-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-03-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-03-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-03-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-03-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-03-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-03-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-03.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>After showing off his design when riding with friends, it wasn’t long before Lee had his first clients. Interest spread through word of mouth until Lee was able to take the plunge and go all-in with invisiFRAME.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>From kitchen table to industry leader</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The company has come on a long way since the days of Lee and his wife, a nurse at the NHS, cutting kits at their kitchen table at night while juggling demanding day jobs and bringing up two children. Fast forward 11 years and invisiFRAME is in rude health, with Lee and Vicky both working full-time alongside a team of ten at the head of a growing and game-changing family business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years, invisiFRAME has developed a unique, patented process that allows the team to map every line, contour and angle of a frame to create a kit like no other on the market – one that is truly bespoke to that frame. While other companies have tried to replicate the details in an invisiFRAME kit, they have always missed the mark.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This precision and market-leading commitment to quality has recently led to a merger with American company XPEL, the world’s leading manufacturer of PPF. This merger now allows invisiFRAME to produce more kits, deliver to more countries and develop more products than ever before.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Varying levels of protection</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-04-647x970.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-04-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-04-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-04-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-04-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-04-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-04-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-04.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>Aside from its full frame protection kits, invisiFRAME offers other products around its cutting-edge PPF. If you don’t fancy going the whole hog with a protective film on your frame, then its Protective Coating spray offers excellent entry-level protection for your bike, while making cleaning easier for any frame type and finish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Developed together with famous UK department store Fenwick’s, this hydrophobic spray can be applied to all surfaces – including painted matte and gloss, anodised, raw carbon and raw metal. The water-based spray contains no harmful petrochemicals and can also be used for all parts on a bike excluding brake levers, grips, pedals and saddle. Crucially, it will not detract from the bike’s appearance in any way – that means no white marks, smearing or greasiness on your prized possession.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s where it gets extra special: not only will a single application give you six months of protection, but a single bottle of Protective Coating (100ml; £15) contains enough solution for approximately 15 to 20 applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To take things to a whole new level of protection, you can use invisiFRAME Protective Coating in tandem with any custom Paint Protection Film. The spray actively bonds to PPF to refresh and enhance protection so that riding in poor weather and on challenging roads or trails no longer needs to hold you back. There is no better option for maximum protection against the elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Different finishes and custom extras</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-05-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-05-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-05-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-05-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-05-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-05-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-05-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-05-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-05-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-05.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>PPF from invisiFRAME is available in both matte and gloss options to match your frame finish. Unfortunately, the surface of anodized frames does not lend itself well to the application of the polyurethane because the coarse texture traps moisture and air under the film.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gloss films can be polished to extend longevity and keep the surface looking slick – meaning all those little scratches from gravel, stones or muddy trails can be polished out. Furthermore, a range of premium custom decals can be printed to order, to provide you with long-lasting, durable and non-fading colour decals. These should always be applied over the PPF kits to assure as smooth a surface as possible for the kit to be applied to.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The final word</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-02-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-02-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-02-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-02-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-02-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-02-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-02-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-02-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/12/invisiFRAME-02.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>With over a decade of bike industry experience in the tank, invisiFRAME has developed trusted working relations with the world’s top bike brands and independents. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means the company often works under embargo, licence and special permission to create the ultimate bespoke frame protection and colour decals.
