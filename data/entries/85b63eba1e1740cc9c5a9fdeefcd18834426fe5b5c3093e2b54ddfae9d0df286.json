Based on the Speedmax CFR triathlon bike, the Canyon Speedmax CFR Track has a similar front end profile to that bike, with a narrow stance to the 40mm deep fork legs. However it’s a pure track bike, meaning it has a fixed-gear drivetrain. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rear triangle has a radical, wide stance to the seatstays and a high seat tube junction in place of the tri bike’s low-placed seatstays. The design here is more akin to the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/hope-lotus-track-bike-team-gb-2023\" target=\"_blank\">Hope-Lotus HBT</a> of the UK team. Canyon has also thinned out the Speedmax Track’s top tube from the triathlon bike’s deep top tube design.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Two years of development</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"649\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/495785-MicrosoftTeams-image-17-d5b8de-original-1690899284-970x649.png\" alt=\"Canyon Speedmax Track\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/495785-MicrosoftTeams-image-17-d5b8de-original-1690899284-970x649.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/495785-MicrosoftTeams-image-17-d5b8de-original-1690899284-300x201.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/495785-MicrosoftTeams-image-17-d5b8de-original-1690899284-768x514.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/495785-MicrosoftTeams-image-17-d5b8de-original-1690899284-750x502.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/495785-MicrosoftTeams-image-17-d5b8de-original-1690899284-1140x763.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/495785-MicrosoftTeams-image-17-d5b8de-original-1690899284-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/495785-MicrosoftTeams-image-17-d5b8de-original-1690899284-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/08/495785-MicrosoftTeams-image-17-d5b8de-original-1690899284.png 1400w\" /><figcaption>Canyon </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Canyon says it has taken over two years to develop the new track bike, in association with the aerodynamics experts at wheel maker Swiss Side . That includes 442 supercomputer runs, 312 wind-tunnel analyses and 155 hours of track testing to adapt the already-fast triathlon bike’s design to the velodrome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aero profiles on the bike have been optimised for the very high riding speeds of up to 70kmh on the track. Canyon has also looked to optimise the bike’s stiffness-to-weight, where it says it has found significant gains for track use.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n

Product Management Road at Canyon. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>‘Proven at the highest echelons of triathlon, the Speedmax served as the perfect foundation, but we went back to the drawing board and collaborated extensively with our aerodynamics partner, Swiss Side, to ensure every aspect of this bike was sculpted for supreme aero efficiency at the exceptionally high speeds and unique conditions of the

medallist <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/chloe-dygert-makes-anticipated-jump-to-womens-worldtour\" target=\"_blank\">Chloe Dygert</a>, who signed for the <a

she joined Canyon-SRAM was that Canyon would build a track bike specifically for her needs.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canyon also says its partnership with the Danish track team helped it to ensure that the front end of the bike was stiff enough for the forces generated as the rider braces in the start machine before the start.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Swappable cockpit for mass-start

The standard setup includes Canyon disc wheels and its Pro Extension aero cockpit and is optimised for solo races, but a swap to the Bunch Handlebar Kit and a spoked front wheel will ready the bike for mass-start events. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both wheelsets are run with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/continental-grand-prix-5000-as-tr-all-season-tyre\" target=\"_blank\">Continental Grand Prix 5000 TT TR</a> tyres – the least spendy part of the bike.
