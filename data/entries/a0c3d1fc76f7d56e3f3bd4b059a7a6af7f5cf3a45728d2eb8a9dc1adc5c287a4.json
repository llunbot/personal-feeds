But if they travel to a place where population immunity is unreliable, experts recommend that infants ages 6 to 11 months get an early dose—then follow it up with the standard two doses at the standard times, bringing the total to three doses.</p>\n<p>The reason they would need three—and the reason experts typically recommend waiting until 12 months—is because the maternal antibodies infants carry can interfere with the vaccine response, preventing the immune system from mounting long-lasting protection. Still, the early dose provides boosted protection in that 6-to-11-month interval.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/collapsing-us-herd-immunity-to-measles-spurs-experts-to-call-for-extra-mmr-dose/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/collapsing-us-herd-immunity-to-measles-spurs-experts-to-call-for-extra-mmr-dose/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"a0c3d1fc76f7d56e3f3bd4b059a7a6af7f5cf3a45728d2eb8a9dc1adc5c287a4","category":"Tech"}
