{"title":"Apple: iOS 18.1 Will Offer API for Third-Party Apps to Offer In-App NFC Transactions Using the Secure Element","link":"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/08/developers-can-soon-offer-in-app-nfc-transactions-using-the-secure-element/?1723649422","date":1723655068000,"content":"\n<p>Apple Newsroom:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Starting with iOS 18.1, developers will be able to offer NFC\ncontactless transactions using the Secure Element from within\ntheir own apps on iPhone, separate from Apple Pay and Apple\nWallet. Using the new NFC and SE (Secure Element) APIs,\ndevelopers will be able to offer in-app contactless transactions\nfor in-store payments, car keys, closed-loop transit, corporate\nbadges, student IDs, home keys, hotel keys, merchant loyalty and\nrewards cards, and event tickets, with government IDs to be\nsupported in the future.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Reading between the lines, I do <em>not</em> think this will grant third-party apps access to the double-tap-side-button action to initiate a payment. And, I say, that’s a good thing. That’s something Apple should reserve for Apple Pay. I’m not sure the European Commission will agree with me.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/08/14/apple-nfc-ios-18-1-\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"84f5e04990e28a8b52256c3aef3e1373bf1bc99744f12005befe8ba0410f2868","category":"Tech"}
