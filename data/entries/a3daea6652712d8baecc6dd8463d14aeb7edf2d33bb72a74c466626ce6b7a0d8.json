From there, you can add an effect or delete it. Effects include adding a white sticker outline, a \"puffy\" sticker effect, a glittery effect, and more. Subjects pulled from <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/live-photos/\">Live Photos</a> have the option of animating. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nStickers that you have created can be used through the sticker interface in the Messages app, accessible by tapping on the \"+\" button and then \"Stickers.\" You can insert stickers as single images, or add them to messages and photos, which is how stickers have worked since the feature was introduced. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/06/ios-17-animated-stickers/\">You Can Turn Your Photos Into Animated Stickers With iOS 17</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/you-can-turn-your-photos-into-animated-stickers-with-ios-17.2391974/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"a3daea6652712d8baecc6dd8463d14aeb7edf2d33bb72a74c466626ce6b7a0d8","category":"Apple"}
