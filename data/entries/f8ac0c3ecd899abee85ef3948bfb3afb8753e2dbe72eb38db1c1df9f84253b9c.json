It has the same torque output, the same peak &amp; nominal power, and even the same pedal-assist support multiplier. So, what makes it better?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bosch says the real upgrades are smoother, quieter operation, and a more natural feel while riding. Plus, they claim that it is 3% lighter, which boosts its power-to-weight ratio. And who doesn’t want to save 100g?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Bosch Performance CX eBike motor gets new upgrades</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Bosch dubs this latest generation of their CX motor: “<em>Power meets Control</em>“.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a combination of improved sensor technology inside combined with smarter power delivery management programming – all inside a slightly lighter magnesium casing. Described as more responsive, more controlled, and more direct, Bosch says the new motor creates a more “natural riding experience”. And that’s to refined materials and gears inside the gearbox, Bosch reduced the noise of the motor spinning for a quieter eMTB ride.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Bosch Performance CX eBike motor (BDU384Y) weighs a claimed 2.8kg (down 100g from the previous generation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s actually new?</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_-new-Bosch-eBike-Performance-CX-motor-sensors-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_-new-Bosch-eBike-Performance-CX-motor-sensors-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Bosch CX eBike, motor sensor details\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_-new-Bosch-eBike-Performance-CX-motor-sensors-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_-new-Bosch-eBike-Performance-CX-motor-sensors-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_-new-Bosch-eBike-Performance-CX-motor-sensors-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Focus-JAM2-eMTB-alloy-all-mountain-Bosch-CX-eBike_-new-Bosch-eBike-Performance-CX-motor-sensors-768x432.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>By both improving and “reinterpreting” the live data Bosch collects from the internal motor inertial measurement unit, cadence, and torque sensors, the new CX motor can more accurately and more quickly react to real trail situations. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A big benefit of that is the new Hill Start Assist feature that allows the motor to instantly react when you put power to a pedal, making it much easier to start climbing up loose terrain, with a newfound smoothness to maintain traction. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Bosch-Performance-CX-eBike-motor-upgrade_uphill-start-assist-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Bosch-Performance-CX-eBike-motor-upgrade_uphill-start-assist-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Bosch Performance CX eBike motor upgrade, Pivot Shuttle AM modded to test the new motor\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Bosch-Performance-CX-eBike-motor-upgrade_uphill-start-assist-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Bosch-Performance-CX-eBike-motor-upgrade_uphill-start-assist-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Bosch-Performance-CX-eBike-motor-upgrade_uphill-start-assist-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Bosch-Performance-CX-eBike-motor-upgrade_uphill-start-assist-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Bosch-Performance-CX-eBike-motor-upgrade_uphill-start-assist-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Bosch-Performance-CX-eBike-motor-upgrade_uphill-start-assist-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Bosch-Performance-CX-eBike-motor-upgrade_uphill-start-assist-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Bosch)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Extended Boost is another similarly-linked performance improvement. Much like the signature longer power support you used to get only in the CX Race motor, now you should be able to quickly kick the pedals on the new standard CX motor to get more support through narrow technical sections where you might not be able to keep a smooth continuous pedal stroke. Bosch says this also helps eMTB riders pick up the front wheel to get over tougher obstacles, making it a more natural ride feel to get the most out of pedal-assist.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s also the automated electronic shift integration with the new TRP A12 E.A.S.I derailleur system that <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bosch-trp-autoshift-app-updates/\" target=\"_blank\">we previewed at Eurobike</a>, along with AI-managed smart assist levels and the new extra range Eco+ mode.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>New 600Wh &amp; 800Wh PowerTube batteries</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Bosch-Performance-CX-eBike-motor-upgrade_new-internal-PowerTube-batteries-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Bosch-Performance-CX-eBike-motor-upgrade_new-internal-PowerTube-batteries-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Bosch Performance CX eBike motor upgrade, 600Wh &amp; 800Wh internal battery options\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Bosch-Performance-CX-eBike-motor-upgrade_new-internal-PowerTube-batteries-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Bosch-Performance-CX-eBike-motor-upgrade_new-internal-PowerTube-batteries-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Bosch-Performance-CX-eBike-motor-upgrade_new-internal-PowerTube-batteries-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Bosch-Performance-CX-eBike-motor-upgrade_new-internal-PowerTube-batteries-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Bosch-Performance-CX-eBike-motor-upgrade_new-internal-PowerTube-batteries-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Batteries and their capacities are often the purviews of individual ebike makers. But now two new standard 600Wh &amp; 800Wh PowerTube internal battery options will make it easy for many manufacturers to spec a lighter or longer range setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, there’s the 1.5kg PowerMore 250Wh external range extender that’s about the size of a water bottle (but requires a proprietary mount) to take you further,</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>New Purion 400 display</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Bosch-Performance-CX-eBike-motor-upgrade_new-Purion-400-display-mimics-Shimano-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Bosch-Performance-CX-eBike-motor-upgrade_new-Purion-400-display-mimics-Shimano-jpg.webp\" alt=\"2024 Bosch Performance CX eBike motor upgrade, new Purion 400 display copies Shimano Di2/EP8\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Bosch-Performance-CX-eBike-motor-upgrade_new-Purion-400-display-mimics-Shimano-jpg.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Bosch-Performance-CX-eBike-motor-upgrade_new-Purion-400-display-mimics-Shimano-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Bosch-Performance-CX-eBike-motor-upgrade_new-Purion-400-display-mimics-Shimano-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Bosch-Performance-CX-eBike-motor-upgrade_new-Purion-400-display-mimics-Shimano-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Bosch-Performance-CX-eBike-motor-upgrade_new-Purion-400-display-mimics-Shimano-768x461.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Bosch also has a new small handlebar-mounted color display to show you keep eMTB stats at a glance, without getting in the way. The new Purion 400 sits next to your stem, and looks strikingly similar to the typical Shimano display that has come with MTB Di2 &amp; EP8 ebikes for years. That was one of the things I missed whenever I would switch from Shimano to Bosch systems, so this little display will be a big boost for usability in my book.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Tech details</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Bosch-Performance-CX-eBike-motor-upgrade_motor-only-scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1536\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Bosch-Performance-CX-eBike-motor-upgrade_motor-only-scaled.webp\" alt=\"2024 Bosch Performance CX eBike motor upgrade, BDU384Y motor\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Bosch-Performance-CX-eBike-motor-upgrade_motor-only-scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Bosch-Performance-CX-eBike-motor-upgrade_motor-only-297x178.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Bosch-Performance-CX-eBike-motor-upgrade_motor-only-1536x922.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Bosch-Performance-CX-eBike-motor-upgrade_motor-only-120x72.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Bosch-Performance-CX-eBike-motor-upgrade_motor-only-768x461.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-Bosch-Performance-CX-eBike-motor-upgrade_motor-only-2048x1229.webp 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>new BDU384Y CX motor</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You still get a max 85Nm of torque, a max 600W of motor power (still rated 250W nominal to meet ebike regulations), and a max 340% support factor multiplying the power you put in at the pedals.

But the <a href=\"https://www.bosch-ebike.com/en/products/performance-line-cx\" target=\"_blank\">new CX generation</a> is already popping up in a bunch of new performance eMTBs. And we expect to see it gradually replace the previous iteration as ebikes get updated through the rest of the year into 2025. For now, you can check out new ebikes like the Focus JAM² and the Santa Cruz Vala that get the new smoother motor and updated ebike drive system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bosch-ebike.com/en\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Bosch-eBike.com</em></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/boschs-new-performance-cx-ebike-motor-is-not-more-powerful-but-is-better-and-lighter/\">Bosch’s new Performance CX eBike Motor is Not More Powerful But is Quieter, and Lighter</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Cory Benson","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"f8ac0c3ecd899abee85ef3948bfb3afb8753e2dbe72eb38db1c1df9f84253b9c","category":"Cycling"}
