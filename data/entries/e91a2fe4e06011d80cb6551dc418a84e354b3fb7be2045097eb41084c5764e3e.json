Studies have shown that automatic emergency braking systems have reduced road deaths in the <a href=\"https://www.iihs.org/topics/bibliography/ref/2111\">US</a>, <a href=\"https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/eng-2021-0097/html?lang=en\">Europe</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/3/917?type=check_update&amp;version=1\">China</a>, but so-called phantom braking problems have dogged systems from both <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/02/teslas-radar-less-cars-investigated-by-nhtsa-after-complaints-spike/#:~:text=The%20National%20Highway%20Traffic%20Safety,about%20416%2C000%20cars%20are%20affected.\">Tesla</a> and Honda.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/02/nhtsa-to-investigate-honda-accords-and-cr-vs-over-phantom-braking/\">We first learned of the problem in 2022</a>, when NHTSA opened a preliminary investigation into the matter, based on 278 complaints. Now, NHTSA's Office of Defects Investigation has received 1,294 complaints from drivers of Honda CR-Vs (model years 2017–2022) and Honda Accords (model years 2018–2022), all claiming that their Hondas' automatic emergency braking system slammed on the brakes with no apparent obstruction in the way.</p>\n<p>Honda says it's aware of even more cases—1,991 in all, and NHTSA says that, when it takes out cases where multiple reports affect the same vehicle, <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2022/HONDA/ACCORD/4%252520DR/FWD#investigations\">it knows of</a> 2,976 reports of inadvertent automatic emergency braking, with 93 injury reports and 47 crashes to date.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017732#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2017732&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
