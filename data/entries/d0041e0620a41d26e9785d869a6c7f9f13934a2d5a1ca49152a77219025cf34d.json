Unlike the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/review/twelve-south-powerpic/\">previous model</a>, the new device is made of a magnetic lucite frame, which detaches to fit any 4x6 photo.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/powerpic-mod.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe frame can be positioned vertically or horizontally, and it will require a 20W USB-C power adapter, which is not included. The accessory can charge any smartphone that supports Qi charging, as well as devices like the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSimilar to the previous model, the idea behind the PowerPic Mod is to hide a wireless charger within an unassuming piece of home decor. Twelve South says that the device works well on desks, bedside tables, and in kitchens.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe PowerPic Mod will charge at 7.5W max speed for Apple devices. You can get the PowerPic Mod in White or Black today <a href=\"https://www.twelvesouth.com/products/powerpic-mod-wireless-charger?aff=11\">on Twelve South's website for $59.99</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Twelve South.
