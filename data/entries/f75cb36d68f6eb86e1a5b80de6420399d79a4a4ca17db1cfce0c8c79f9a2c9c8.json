The <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2389252/beats-pill-2024-review.html\">Beats Pill has dropped to $100 at Amazon</a>, a 33 percent discount from its $150 MSRP. That’s the lowest we’ve seen <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2482529/apples-beats-pill-speaker-drops-to-new-best-price-for-prime-day.html\">since Prime Day</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2389252/beats-pill-2024-review.html\">reviewed the Beats Pill</a> and found it’s a good speaker with decent volume and sound for its size and fantastic battery life. We gave it a four-star rating and found that it’s probably about a firmware update from being the whole package. One of the best things about the speaker is that it comes with an IP67 rating for water and dust resistance. That means it’s a perfect companion for any trip you want to take, whether that’s to the beach, up the mountain, or to the nearby park.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, the Beats Pill delivers some 24 hours of playtime and is tiny enough to fit in any backpack where you could squeeze a water bottle in. The controls may take a bit to figure out, but one of the cool things you can do is double-tap the power button to trigger your go-to voice assistant, be it Siri or Google Assistant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So take the chance to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2389252/beats-pill-2024-review.html\">get the new Beats Pill for $100 this Black Friday</a> because we don’t think we’ll see a lower price anytime soon.</p>\n\n\n<span>Get the Beats Pill for its best price</span><div><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2389252/beats-pill-2024-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">Buy it now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"f75cb36d68f6eb86e1a5b80de6420399d79a4a4ca17db1cfce0c8c79f9a2c9c8","category":"Apple"}
