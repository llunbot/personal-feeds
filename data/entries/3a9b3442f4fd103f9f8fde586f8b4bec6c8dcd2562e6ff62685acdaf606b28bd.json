{"title":"Trump, Asked if He Has to ‘Uphold the Constitution’, Says, ‘I Don’t Know’","link":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-asked-uphold-constitution-says-dont-know-rcna204580","date":1746372968000,"content":"\n<p>NBC News:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When Welker tried to point out what the Fifth Amendment said,\nTrump suggested that such a process would slow him down too much.</p>\n\n<p>“I don’t know. It seems — it might say that, but if you’re\ntalking about that, then we’d have to have a million or 2 million\nor 3 million trials,” he said. “We have thousands of people that\nare — some murderers and some drug dealers and some of the worst\npeople on Earth.”</p>\n\n<p>“I was elected to get them the hell out of here, and the courts\nare holding me from doing it,” he added.</p>\n\n<p>“But even given those numbers that you’re talking about, don’t you\nneed to uphold the Constitution of the United States as\npresident?” Welker asked.</p>\n\n<p>“I don’t know,” Trump replied. “I have to respond by saying,\nagain, I have brilliant lawyers that work for me, and they are\ngoing to obviously follow what the Supreme Court said.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The oath of office, which Trump has now taken twice, is “I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.”</p>\n\n<p>I’ll repeat <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/11/china-calls-trump-a-joke\">what I wrote a few weeks ago</a> when the Chinese government correctly mocked Trump’s tariffs as “a joke in the history of world economics”: Democrats and all other Trump opponents should repeatedly call into question Trump’s mental fitness for office. Don’t (just) argue that he’s trying to subvert the Constitution as a WWE-style authoritarian, but argue (also) that he clearly doesn’t even remember the oath of office. He’s in early dementia. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Trump\">Trump’s father was suffering from severe dementia</a> when he was Trump’s age. Throw Biden under the bus: remind people that <a href=\"https://apple.news/ANs1GK_4ISEikICuDBenaSA\">we just saw</a> what happens when a mentally enfeebled 80-year-old<sup>*</sup> serves as President, and that under Trump it’s far worse. Biden was sleepy but steady; Trump is agitated and erratic. Only some dementia sufferers act lost and confused — others act out in anger and belligerence. Trump is in the latter group. He doesn’t remember the oath of office.</p>\n\n<p><small>* Keep calling him “80”; make his sycophants correct you that he’s “only” turning 79 in June.</small></p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/04/trump-doesnt-know-if-he-needs-to-uphold-the-constitution\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"3a9b3442f4fd103f9f8fde586f8b4bec6c8dcd2562e6ff62685acdaf606b28bd","category":"Tech"}
