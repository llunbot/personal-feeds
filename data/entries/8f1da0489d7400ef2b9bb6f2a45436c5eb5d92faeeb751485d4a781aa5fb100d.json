[...]</p>\n\n<p>Given the significant technical complexity of this issue, as well\nas the important national security harms that will result from\nweakening cybersecurity defenses, it is imperative that the U.K.’s\ntechnical demands of Apple — and of any other U.S. companies — be subjected to robust, public analysis and debate by\ncybersecurity experts. Secret court hearings featuring\nintelligence agencies and a handful of individuals approved by\nthem do not enable robust challenges on highly technical matters.\nMoreover, given the potential impact on U.S. national security, it\nis vital that American cybersecurity experts be permitted to\nanalyze and comment on the security of what is proposed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/14/us-lawmakers-letter-to-ipt\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"8f1da0489d7400ef2b9bb6f2a45436c5eb5d92faeeb751485d4a781aa5fb100d","category":"Tech"}
