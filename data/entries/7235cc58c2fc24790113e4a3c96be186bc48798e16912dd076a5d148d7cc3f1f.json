The trade-off for a lower high-pressure is less effort to push bigger volumes of air. That’s especially important when you start talking about fat bike tires and modern MTB tires. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_17-Large.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_17-Large.jpeg\" alt=\"Wolf tooth components Encase bike pumps tool storage\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_17-Large.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_17-Large-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_17-Large-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_17-Large-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_17-Large-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_17-Large-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_19-Large.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"854\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_19-Large.jpeg\" alt=\"Wolf tooth components Encase bike pumps tool storage\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_19-Large.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_19-Large-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_19-Large-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_19-Large-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_19-Large-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_19-Large-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n<figcaption>The mounting bracket has multiple mounting positions for different sized downtubes.

If it’s going to be mounted to the downtube of a mountain, fat, or gravel bike, there’s a good chance it’s going to get very dirty. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_20-Large.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"854\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_20-Large.jpeg\" alt=\"Wolf tooth components Encase bike pumps tool storage\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_20-Large.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_20-Large-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_20-Large-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_20-Large-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_20-Large-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_20-Large-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_21-Large.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"854\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_21-Large.jpeg\" alt=\"Wolf tooth components Encase bike pumps tool storage\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_21-Large.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_21-Large-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_21-Large-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_21-Large-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_21-Large-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_21-Large-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n<figcaption>(Photos/WTC)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-06.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-06-1536x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Wolf tooth components Encase bike pumps tool storage\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-06-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-06-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-06-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-06-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-06-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-06-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-06-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-05.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-05-1536x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Wolf tooth components Encase bike pumps tool storage\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-05-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-05-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-05-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-05-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-05-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-05-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-05-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n<figcaption>(Photos/BikeRumor)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To prevent that dirt from gunking up the internals, WTC created what they call the EnviroLock. Essentially a threaded seal, the EnviroLock locks the body of the pump in place and protects all of the internals so it’s always ready to go. To use the pump, simply give the handle a quick twist while holding onto the EnviroLock collar, and the handle telescopes outwards. When you’re done, thread the handle back into the Envirolock. When locked, the handle can rotate if you try to turn it, but the handle can’t extend. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-03.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-03-1536x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Wolf tooth components Encase bike pumps tool storage\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-03-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-03-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-03-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-03-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-03-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-03-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-03-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s also a rubber cap that fits tightly to the pump head keeping crud out of the urethane gasket. Compatible with Presta valves only, the pump simply presses onto the valves without the need for a locking lever. So far I’ve tried it on a number of valves including Fillmore, and it seems to work on everything so far regardless of valve length.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a

If you’d like to have a pump and multi-tool in one, the pumps will fit one or two of the WTC EnCase multi-tools in a rubber sleeve that snaps in place with a rubber plug at the end. There’s also an option for a new EnCase Tire Plug tool. The smaller 40cc pump has room for one of these tools, while the larger 85cc pump can run both EnCase tools, or the Tire Plug Tool. When running both EnCase tools, the larger 85cc pump does have a slight rattle, but the rubber casing does a decent job of deadening the sound. The Tire Plug Tool also has a slight rattle when the plugger fork is empty. Preloading the fork with a plug all but eliminates any sound. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t want to run anything other than the pump? WTC also has a rubber plug that will keep the cavity clean, and you can use it to stash emergency cash, etc.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pump Performance</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_9-Large.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_9-Large.jpeg\" alt=\"Wolf tooth components Encase bike pumps tool storage\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_9-Large.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_9-Large-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_9-Large-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_9-Large-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_9-Large-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_9-Large-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n<figcaption>(Photo/WTC)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Most importantly, how do the Encase pumps work as actual pumps? Not surprisingly, Wolf Tooth built the EnCase pumps to work with higher-volume tires. At lower pressures, the pump is super easy to use and pushes an impressive amount of air. I have not had a chance to use these pumps trailside yet, but I sat down in the shop with multiple tire sizes to see what pressures you might see with 100 strokes of the pump. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>85 CC Pump (large)</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>700c x 23mm Road – 50 strokes = 57psi</li>\n\n\n\n<li>700c x 45mm Gravel – 100 strokes = 26psi</li>\n\n\n\n<li>29 x 2.4″ MTB – 100 strokes = 20psi</li>\n\n\n\n<li>26 x 4.6″ Fat – 100 strokes = 5.5psi</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>40 CC Pump (small)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>29 x 2.4″ MTB – 100 strokes = 8 psi</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Both pump sizes telescope out for a longer stroke, but it’s clear that the 85cc pump has a substantial edge. When pumping up the same 29 x 2.4″ MTB tire from 0psi, the 85cc pump got the tire to 20psi with 100 strokes, while the 40cc pump only managed to get it to 8psi. The 40cc pump was still very easy to pump at that point, so it’s not that you’ll have to push much harder, but you will need to use a lot more strokes to get it up to pressure. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was most impressed by the 85cc pump when inflating a fat bike tire. With 100 strokes, it took the 26 x 4.6″ tire from 0-5.5psi with minimal effort. That doesn’t sound like much, but anyone who’s ever inflated a fat bike tire with a hand pump knows it can take ages. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Out of curiosity, I tried the 85cc pump on a 700c x 23mm road tire. It was quickly apparent the pump wasn’t designed for the task, but it still managed to get the tire up to 57psi with 50 strokes. At that point, it was getting very hard to pump though, so while you may be able to use this pump in a pinch, I wouldn’t recommend it for a road bike (unless you’re running high-volume tires on that road bike). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some users may miss the lack of a hose connecting the pump to the valve, but thanks to the relatively low stroke force needed, the EnCase pump is easy to use. The push-on pump head does a good job of staying attached to the valve during vigorous pumping, but if you angle it too much it can leak some air. The good news is that without a hose, there’s no chance of unthreading the valve core. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Completely Rebuildable</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_25-Large.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1280\" height=\"854\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_25-Large.jpeg\" alt=\"Wolf tooth components Encase bike pumps tool storage\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_25-Large.jpeg 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_25-Large-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_25-Large-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_25-Large-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_25-Large-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-Tooth_EnCase-Pump_25-Large-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n<figcaption>(Photo/WTC)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Wolf Tooth believes in the right to repair their products, and it’s no different here. The EnCase pumps are completely rebuildable with every component available for sale separately. There will also be a video guide to servicing and rebuilding the pump. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-01.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-01-1536x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Wolf tooth components Encase bike pump small weight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-01-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-01-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-01-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-01-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-01-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-01-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-02.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-02-1536x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Wolf tooth components Encase bike pump tool large weight\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-02-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-02-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-02-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-02-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-02-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-02-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Wolf-tooth-components-Encase-bike-pumps-tool-storage-02-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n<figcaption>(Photos/BikeRumor)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, the EnCase pumps seem well thought out, easy to use, precisely built, and offer multiple options on how to run them. While the 40cc pump definitely takes longer to inflate a tire, it’s hard to ignore the pint-sized pump’s ability to stash in a jersey, bib, or short pocket (or even inside of your frame). If you can’t remember the last time you used a pump on the trail but always bring one in case of emergency, the 40cc could be the pump to get. Otherwise, the 85cc pushes a lot of air with more room for tools. And if you’re planning to mount it to your bike, the added length shouldn’t be an issue. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The EnCase pumps are available now for $64.95 for the 40cc version and $69.95 for the 85cc version. Internal tools are optional and increase the price from there. Everything is available now. </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wtc-encase-bike-pumps-with-tool-storage/\">WTC EnCase Pumps Hide Tools, Push High Volume, and Thrive in Muddy Conditions</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"7235cc58c2fc24790113e4a3c96be186bc48798e16912dd076a5d148d7cc3f1f","category":"Cycling"}
