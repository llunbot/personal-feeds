The stone-washed canvas made from 100 percent cotton looks stylish and has a durable repellent coating. This coating is good at keeping out a short rain shower, and a proper rain cover is included to keep out water during a downpour. The two-color twill lining and genuine leather applications match the style.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As befits a backpack manufacturer, great attention has also been paid to the carrying system. The padded back panel is just as comfortable as the shoulder straps. This means that even heavy loads can be carried home in comfort. The Retrospective EDC has a storage capacity of 19 liters and weighs just one kilogram.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Retrospective EDC Backpack: Compartments galore</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A USB-C adapter here, a charging cable or an SSD there–in a mobile office, many small items accumulate that need to be adequately stored. The more compartments a backpack has, the better it is as an organizer and this is where the Retrospective EDC Backpack scores highly. I counted 15 different-sized compartments alone–the most I’ve counted in a backpack. These compartments range from small with a zip for USB-C sticks, to compact for keys, to large for books and folders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The many compartments are spread over three levels. At the back is the large, lined with soft fabric laptop compartment big enough for a 16-inch Macbook Pro. Next comes the large main compartment, with additional compartments for an iPad and A4 notebooks, for example. But even a pair of shoes with a water bottle fit inside. </p>\n\n\n\n<div><div><ul><li><figure><img alt=\"Thinktank Retrospective EDC Backpack\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Thinktank_RetrospectEDCBackpack_03.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Thinktank Retrospective EDC Backpack\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Thinktank_RetrospectEDCBackpack_05.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Thinktank Retrospective EDC Backpack\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/TT1_6554-Edit.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Thinktank Retrospective EDC Backpack\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Retrospective-EDC-Backpack-Rain-Cover.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Thinktank Retrospective EDC Backpack\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/TT1_6945-Edit.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Thinktank Retrospective EDC Backpack\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Thinktank_RetrospectEDCBackpack_06.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Thinktank Retrospective EDC Backpack\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Thinktank_RetrospectEDCBackpack_01.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li><li><figure><img alt=\"Thinktank Retrospective EDC Backpack\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Retrospective-EDC-Backpack-Lockable-Zipper-Pulls.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\" /></figure></li></ul><a></a><a></a><a></a><div></div></div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Then comes a slim compartment with lots of smaller pockets for all your device accessories. Lastly, there is a compartment on the front that fits a bunch of keys or an iPhone, among other things. It is lined with soft fabric and can be closed with a zip. All compartments are covered by a lid that serves as visual and weather protection for the zips. The lid is held in place with strong magnets. The last compartment is located on the back and is theft-protected and is particularly suitable for your iPhone or ID documents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The eyelets on the robust YKK zips also serve to protect against theft. In addition to the very comfortable carrying straps, there are three handles for transport, on the left and right sides and at the top. There is also a loop for the trolley handle. The otherwise excellent Retrospective EDC Backpack also has two disadvantages: it is only available in green and is very expensive. After all, quality has its price. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Should you buy the Think Tank Retrospective EDC Backpack?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a wish list for a laptop backpack, you could tick many boxes with the Retrospective EDC Backpack. It’s very comfortable to carry and the cotton material is robust and perfectly finished.  The great thing is not the sheer number of compartments, but that they are so varied and therefore suitable for many situations. The padding for the MacBook is also impressive and your precious item also has its place in a separate compartment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article originally appeared on <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macwelt.de/article/2266530/thinktank-retrospective-edc-backpack-test.html#&amp;xcust=1-1-2312949-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Macwelt</a> and was translated by </em><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/author/rloyola\"><em>Roman Loyola</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n\nLaptop Accessories</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"18328289488ae2cd5b50d129a6305599eaacb04a9217b2e9112526611003ad0b","category":"Apple"}
