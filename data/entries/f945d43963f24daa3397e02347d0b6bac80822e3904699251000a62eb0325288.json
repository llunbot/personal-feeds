{"title":"Figma and Adobe Abandon $20 Billion Acquisition Plan","link":"https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-adobe-abandon-proposed-merger/","date":1702940033000,"content":"\n<p>Dylan Field, co-founder and CEO of Figma:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Figma and Adobe have reached a joint decision to end our pending \nacquisition. It’s not the outcome we had hoped for, but despite \nthousands of hours spent with regulators around the world \ndetailing differences between our businesses, our products, and \nthe markets we serve, we no longer see a path toward regulatory \napproval of the deal. </p>\n\n<p>We entered into this agreement 15 months ago with the goal of \naccelerating what both Adobe and Figma could do for our respective \ncommunities. While we leave that future behind and continue on as \nan independent company, we are excited to find ways to partner for \nour users. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/796343/000079634323000254/adbedecember182023pressrel.htm\">From a joint press release</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Although both companies continue to believe in the merits and \nprocompetitive benefits of the combination, Adobe and Figma \nmutually agreed to terminate the transaction based on a joint \nassessment that there is no clear path to receive necessary \nregulatory approvals from the European Commission and the UK \nCompetition and Markets Authority. </p>\n\n<p>“Adobe and Figma strongly disagree with the recent regulatory \nfindings, but we believe it is in our respective best interests \nto move forward independently,” said Shantanu Narayen, chair and \nCEO, Adobe. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/adobe-figma-terminate-20-bln-deal-2023-12-18/\">Adobe owes Figma a $1 billion termination fee</a>, but it’s unclear to me whether Figma was adequately prepared to go it alone as an independent company. Who else could and would acquire them for a similar price?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.threads.net/@benedictevans/post/C0_yVocOm56\">Benedict Evans, on Threads</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I did not understand how this could possibly get past regulatory \nreview even without the current shift in attitudes. ‘Company that \ndominates a market buying a hugely strong new challenger that’s \nchanging the market’ looked like an old-fashioned textbook \ncompetition case.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/09/15/adobe-figma\">Yours truly, a year ago, when the acquisition was announced</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Figma’s breakthrough is that it was the first web-app to establish \nitself as a leading tool for professional designers. It’s hard to \noverstate how profoundly Figma disrupted Adobe’s status as the \nundisputed leader in design tools, because Figma made \ncollaboration a first-class part of its workflow. Adobe has had \nmany competitors over the decades, but Figma was the first that \nseemingly was reducing Adobe’s relevance to professional \ndesigners. I don’t think this acquisition was driven by revenue so \nmuch as by relevance. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/12/18/figma-adobe-ixnay-on-the-acquisitionyay\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f945d43963f24daa3397e02347d0b6bac80822e3904699251000a62eb0325288","category":"Tech"}
