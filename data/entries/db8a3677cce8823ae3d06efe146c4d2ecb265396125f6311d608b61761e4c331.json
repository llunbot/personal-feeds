And, what would the bike look like if someone had kept it alive with retro upgrades?</p>\n<p>The paintwork has details lifted from <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/palace-rapha-capsule-collection/\">Rapha and Palace Skateboard’s recent collaboration</a> and touches of EF-Education Nippo’s pink and blue colour scheme.</p>\n<p>You can also check out Manfredsson’s ideas for adapting the Super V with modern <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/the-ultimate-guide-to-bike-geometry-and-handling/\">mountain bike geometry</a> on his Instagram.</p>\n<blockquote><div> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CPLncRRB0Rl/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\"> <div> <div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div><div></div> <div></div><div> <div> View this post on Instagram</div></div><div></div> <div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div></div><div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div> <div> <div></div> <div></div></div></a><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CPLncRRB0Rl/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by damn_design (@danielmanfredsson)</a></p></div></blockquote><p>Elsewhere, the bike has a Selle Italia Turbo saddle, Kenda K-829 tyres and smatterings of purple anodisation, which will hopefully quell some retro-purists’ discontent.</p>\n<p>Manfredsson now works as a designer for Cannondale, confirming possibly that there is an appetite for wilder things in the bike industry.</p>\n<p>You might see some of his bold ideas in the flesh soon enough, but in the meantime, here is the Super V in his own words.</p>\n<hr /><div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Manfredsson wanted the bike to look like a “mess of parts put together”.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Daniel Manfredsson</i></span></div>\n<p>As a Cannondale nerd, the Super V in its many different versions is something special to me. The Y frame design is super iconic and it really screams “full sus!” – kind of the opposite to today where we just hide and cover functions and features, and everything going outside the double diamond frame design gets punished and laughed at.</p>\n<p>Are we maybe a bit more boring today, and also a lot less flamboyant?</p>\n<p>This build has a double nature. The drivetrain side is retro, in its paint scheme, decals and stickers. It should look like a ’90s version of the bike, where someone has upgraded it with cool retro parts and kept it alive.</p>\n<p>The other side is much more influenced by modern Cannondales, adding a bit of the awesome Palace-Rapha paint as well as some EF racing fade going on, and asks, what if the Super V was still in production today?</p>\n<p></p><div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/07/cannondale-super-v-manfredsson-wheel-741d2a6.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>White Kenda K-829 tyres and purple Tektro brakes, anyone? </span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Daniel Manfredsson</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/07/cannondale-super-v-manfredsson-saddle-86dcc65.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Spot the Palace logo and the Rapha-Palace duck.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Daniel Manfredsson </i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/07/cannondale-super-v-manfredsson-front-a2cf78e.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>No hidden cables here. </span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Daniel Manfredsson </i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\nFrom this side, we can really see the frame shape and what a strong design it is.\n<p>Okay, the Super V was not alone on the market with Y-frame design, but you immediately knew that it was something special.</p>\n<p>The idea was also to heavily mix colours, graphics and finishes so in its full, the bike would look like a mess of parts put together, but when you zoom in, you can actually find interesting contrasts or total mindful harmony – or something like that.</p>\n<p>The build list is kind of hard to compile, but it is a mix of parts from the late ’80s to the late ’90s, with some brand-new parts thrown in.</p>\n<p></p><div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/07/cannondale-super-v-manfredsson-frame-34fc32e.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>You get a good look at the paintwork from this shot.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Daniel Manfredsson </i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/07/cannondale-super-v-manfredsson-rear-triangle-bd1532d.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>This might be a ludicrous build, but that fade is top-notch. </span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Daniel Manfredsson </i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\nI would like to quickly get it in a more used condition with scratches, dents and sun-faded paint to make it really hard to tell if this is a new or old build. Timeless art, or just a cocktail of all things giving you mental diarrhoea.\n<p>I couldn’t really remove the idea of how the Super V would be if it was still alive or introduced today. So I roughly just sketched a Super V, but with modern <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/new-cannondale-scalpel/\">Scalpel</a> geometry.</p>\n<p>I also added some minor updates to the suspension, like better linkage, adding more rear travel and adding a 100mm version of the Headshock.</p>\n<p>The bike is still rough, and not really a progressive take on the design, but there is something there, and I need to explore this more.</p>","author":"Stan Portus","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"db8a3677cce8823ae3d06efe146c4d2ecb265396125f6311d608b61761e4c331","category":"Cycling"}
