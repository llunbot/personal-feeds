{"title":"Women’s Milan-San Remo to make long-awaited return in 2025","link":"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/milan-san-remo-women","date":1727450162000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/milan-san-remo-women\">Women’s Milan-San Remo to make long-awaited return in 2025</a></p>\n\n<p>After two decades, the women finally have their chance to race Milan-San Remo again. The UCI has announced the inclusion of Milan-San Remo Women in the 2025 calendar. It is scheduled for the 22nd March – the same day as the men’s race – though the route and distance are yet to be revealed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Milan-San Remo has been a feature for the men’s peloton since 1907, and a women’s edition called the Primavera Rosa was previously run from 1999 to 2005. German rider Trixi Worrack was the last winner of the race. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>In 2022, Paolo Bellino, CEO of RCS Sport, which organises most of the big Italian races including Milan-San Remo and the Giro d’Italia, said plans were in the works to launch a women’s edition of Milan-San Remo for 2023, but that didn’t materialise. The confirmation for 2025 means that the women’s one-day race Trofeo Alfredo Binda, which is usually run on the same weekend as the men’s Milan-San Remo, has been moved a week earlier in the calendar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The UCI says this is ‘further proof of the growth of women’s professional road cycling’.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The men’s Milan-San Remo is one of the longest races on the calendar, typically around 300km, however the maximum a Women’s WorldTour one-day race can currently be is 160km. That said, permission can be granted to go longer, as happened with a 170km Giro d’Italia stage and a 177km Tour de France Femmes stage in 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More details about the race are expected to be revealed soon.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/where-are-they-now-2014-world-championships\">Where are the rising stars of the 2014 UCI World Championships now?</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/autumn-classics-guide\">Cycling autumn Classics 2024: Canadian and Italian race dates, details and live TV guide</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/worldtour-race-ranked-women\">Every UCI Women’s WorldTour race ranked: From the Tour de France to the Tour of Chongming Island</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/uci-road-cycling-world-championships-route-tv-guide-all-you-need-to-know\">UCI Road World Championships 2024: Routes, how to watch and all you need to know</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/milan-san-remo-women\">Women’s Milan-San Remo to make long-awaited return in 2025</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Robyn Davidson &#124; Editorial Assistant","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"df4848ae2fd663459f0776372190170db18f0cb3b3cf0e1694662d83701fd41a","category":"Cycling"}
