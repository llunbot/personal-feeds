A big benefit of the Pinion is suspension optimization – both decreased unsprung weight and more ideal frame+drivetrain weight distribution, plus they say that it allows for&nbsp;more freedom in suspension design overall.</p><p>CTO Pascal Tinner says that control over&nbsp;weight distribution is key, as “descending ride dynamics are 99% of the equation” in DH racing. Tinner does admit that grip-shifting is limiting broader adoption of Pinion for the time being, but hopes a trigger shift or electronic shift solution is in the works (hint, hint.. Pinion!)</p><p>Not to be overlooked is the selection of the ideal gearbox for the application. This particular prototype was spec’d with a Pinion C1.6 gear box, but Gamux has also been racing DH with the C1.9XR, as well. And of course, reduced crash damage and overall reduced drivetrain maintenance in taxing weather conditions, too.</p><h3>Why CNC-machined aluminum?</h3><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05114742/Gamux-CNC-197-Gearbox-DH-prototype_Pinion-Gates-downhill-mountain-bike_pre-order-now_front-angled.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05114742/Gamux-CNC-197-Gearbox-DH-prototype_Pinion-Gates-downhill-mountain-bike_pre-order-now_front-angled.jpg\" alt=\"Gamux CNC 197 Gearbox DH, prototype Pinion gearbox downhill bike, front end\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05114742/Gamux-CNC-197-Gearbox-DH-prototype_Pinion-Gates-downhill-mountain-bike_pre-order-now_front-angled.jpg 2000w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05114742/Gamux-CNC-197-Gearbox-DH-prototype_Pinion-Gates-downhill-mountain-bike_pre-order-now_front-angled-297x178.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05114742/Gamux-CNC-197-Gearbox-DH-prototype_Pinion-Gates-downhill-mountain-bike_pre-order-now_front-angled-800x480.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05114742/Gamux-CNC-197-Gearbox-DH-prototype_Pinion-Gates-downhill-mountain-bike_pre-order-now_front-angled-120x72.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05114742/Gamux-CNC-197-Gearbox-DH-prototype_Pinion-Gates-downhill-mountain-bike_pre-order-now_front-angled-768x461.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05114742/Gamux-CNC-197-Gearbox-DH-prototype_Pinion-Gates-downhill-mountain-bike_pre-order-now_front-angled-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05114742/Gamux-CNC-197-Gearbox-DH-prototype_Pinion-Gates-downhill-mountain-bike_pre-order-now_front-angled.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05114742/Gamux-CNC-197-Gearbox-DH-prototype_Pinion-Gates-downhill-mountain-bike_pre-order-now_front-angled.jpg 2000w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05114742/Gamux-CNC-197-Gearbox-DH-prototype_Pinion-Gates-downhill-mountain-bike_pre-order-now_front-angled-297x178.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05114742/Gamux-CNC-197-Gearbox-DH-prototype_Pinion-Gates-downhill-mountain-bike_pre-order-now_front-angled-800x480.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05114742/Gamux-CNC-197-Gearbox-DH-prototype_Pinion-Gates-downhill-mountain-bike_pre-order-now_front-angled-120x72.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05114742/Gamux-CNC-197-Gearbox-DH-prototype_Pinion-Gates-downhill-mountain-bike_pre-order-now_front-angled-768x461.jpg 768w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05114742/Gamux-CNC-197-Gearbox-DH-prototype_Pinion-Gates-downhill-mountain-bike_pre-order-now_front-angled-1536x922.jpg 1536w\"></a></p><p>So why opt for the complex alloy machining vs. the welded aluminum first gen Gamux bikes?</p><p>Tinner says quality is simply more constant through CNC-machining vs. the increased variability of the high temperatures &amp; material feeding of welded seams. More consistency means Gamux can more precisely calculate/simulate the ultimate strength and performance characteristics of the completed CNC’d alloy frame.</p><p>CNC machining also gives them more design freedom when shaping the frame without needing expensive custom tooling like their tube-to-tube frames require. That also means they can take a new completed design from the computer to a rideable prototype in just a couple of weeks, vs. much longer for more conventional construction.</p><p>And the machining allows for tweaking of a “unique flex characteristic” while having control for “almost perfect weight distribution” when paired with the Pinion gearbox.

For now you only need to put 100 Swiss francs (~$110/92€) down to secure your production slot, but it’s going to cost a lot more than that. Once you get a spot in the line, Gamux will help you sort out you bike build and you’ll need to pay 50% of that before it goes into actual production.</p><h3>What’s next?</h3><div id=\"attachment_270636\"><p><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05114749/Gamux-CNC-197-Gearbox-DH-prototype_Pinion-Gates-downhill-mountain-bike_pre-order-now_Pascal-Tinner.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-270636\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05114749/Gamux-CNC-197-Gearbox-DH-prototype_Pinion-Gates-downhill-mountain-bike_pre-order-now_Pascal-Tinner.jpg\" alt=\"Gamux CNC 197 Gearbox DH, prototype Pinion gearbox downhill bike, Pascal Tinner\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" data-ezsrcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05114749/Gamux-CNC-197-Gearbox-DH-prototype_Pinion-Gates-downhill-mountain-bike_pre-order-now_Pascal-Tinner.jpg 1000w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05114749/Gamux-CNC-197-Gearbox-DH-prototype_Pinion-Gates-downhill-mountain-bike_pre-order-now_Pascal-Tinner-297x178.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05114749/Gamux-CNC-197-Gearbox-DH-prototype_Pinion-Gates-downhill-mountain-bike_pre-order-now_Pascal-Tinner-800x480.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05114749/Gamux-CNC-197-Gearbox-DH-prototype_Pinion-Gates-downhill-mountain-bike_pre-order-now_Pascal-Tinner-120x72.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05114749/Gamux-CNC-197-Gearbox-DH-prototype_Pinion-Gates-downhill-mountain-bike_pre-order-now_Pascal-Tinner-768x461.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" ezimgfmt=\"rs rscb28 src ng ngcb28 srcset\" data-ezsrc=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05114749/Gamux-CNC-197-Gearbox-DH-prototype_Pinion-Gates-downhill-mountain-bike_pre-order-now_Pascal-Tinner.jpg\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05114749/Gamux-CNC-197-Gearbox-DH-prototype_Pinion-Gates-downhill-mountain-bike_pre-order-now_Pascal-Tinner.jpg 1000w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05114749/Gamux-CNC-197-Gearbox-DH-prototype_Pinion-Gates-downhill-mountain-bike_pre-order-now_Pascal-Tinner-297x178.jpg 297w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05114749/Gamux-CNC-197-Gearbox-DH-prototype_Pinion-Gates-downhill-mountain-bike_pre-order-now_Pascal-Tinner-800x480.jpg 800w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05114749/Gamux-CNC-197-Gearbox-DH-prototype_Pinion-Gates-downhill-mountain-bike_pre-order-now_Pascal-Tinner-120x72.jpg 120w,https://bikerumor.com/ezoimgfmt/s3.amazonaws.com/www.bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/05114749/Gamux-CNC-197-Gearbox-DH-prototype_Pinion-Gates-downhill-mountain-bike_pre-order-now_Pascal-Tinner-768x461.jpg 768w\"></a></p><p id=\"caption-attachment-270636\">Pascal Tinner with this v1 Gamux CNC 197 Gearbox DH prototype, c.
