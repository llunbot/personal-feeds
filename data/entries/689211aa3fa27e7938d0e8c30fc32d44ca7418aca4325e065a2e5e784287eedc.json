On the first day of Prime Day, Amazon has slashed the price of every AirPods model to prices so low we thought it was a mistake—and no matter which model you want you’re going to save tons of money</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>AirPods Pro (2nd-gen with USB-C)</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> $169</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Savings:</strong> $80</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Why we love them:</strong> Apple’s <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1207444/airpods-pro-2022-review.html\">2nd-gen AirPods Pro</a> are among the best noise-canceling earbuds you can buy, with an iconic design, incredible battery life, excellent audio, and some truly incredible software features, including Transparency Mode, conversation Awareness, and Adaptive Audio.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1XD1ZV3/\" target=\"_blank\">View AirPods Pro Deal</a></div>\n\n\n<h3>AirPods (3rd-gen with Lightning case)</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> $120</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Savings:</strong> $49</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Why we love them: </strong>Even at more than three years old, the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/549094/airpods-3rd-generation-review.html\">3rd-gen AirPods</a> are Apple’s latest model and still one of the best earbuds you can buy, with personalized spatial audio, adaptive EQ, excellent battery life, and  IPX4 sweat and water resistance. Just note: This sale is on the wired case.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1WXVQTN/\" target=\"_blank\">View AirPods (3rd gen) Deal</a></div>\n\n\n<h3>AirPods (2nd-gen)</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Price:</strong> $69</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Savings:</strong> $50</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Why we love them: </strong>Apple’s older <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/232610/airpods-2nd-generation-review.html\">2nd-gen AirPods</a> are missing many of the features found in the 3rd-gen model, but they’re still great earbuds at a great price—especially when you can save $50 on them. They have the older design, high-quality audio, and Siri voice control, but are missing spatial audio and noise cancellation and other features found on the higher-end models, but they’re a fantastic set of earbuds for the price.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PXGQC1Q/\" target=\"_blank\">View AirPods (2nd gen) Deal</a></div>\n\n\n<h3>AirPods Max</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Price: </strong>$395</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Savings:</strong> $155</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Why we love them:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234986/airpods-max-review.html\">AirPods Max</a> may be over three years old but they’re still a fantastic set of over-ear headphones. They feature a gorgeous design with a knit-mesh canopy that comes in one of five colors, long battery life, personalized spatial audio, and active noise cancellation. There may be a new model coming out later this year, but at under $400, you won’t regret this purchase.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08PZHYWJS/\" target=\"_blank\">View AirPods Max Deal</a></div>\n\n\n<p>Of course, it’s not just <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2382647/best-airpods-prime-day-2024-deals.html\">AirPods</a> that are on sale for <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/prime-day\">Prime Day</a>.
