He rewrote the game’s rendering, physics, sound, and generally “everything everywhere.” He <a href=\"https://phoboslab.org/log/2023/08/rewriting-wipeout\">documented the project</a>, put <a href=\"https://github.com/phoboslab/wipeout-rewrite\">his code on GitHub</a>, and has some version of a justification. “So let's just pretend that the leak was intentional, a <b>rewrite</b> of the source falls under fair use and the whole thing is abandonware anyway,” Szablewski writes.</p>\n<p>Most of the code seemed to come from <i>Wipeout ATI 3D Rage Edition</i>, a “lackluster port for Windows” that was bundled with ATI GPUs, Szablewski wrote. It is a mess. There are fragments of code versions from DOS, PlayStation, Windows 95, and Windows 98, with lots of things shakily patched in, including some kludgey 25-to-30 frames-per-second physics calculations in moving from European PAL to North American NTSC. The result was bad geometry, sluggish performance, and even goofed text rendering.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1963042#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1963042&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"ab9fcb8eec9cdf02c27417a137276e42c02fb7fb4d309e326e7cc42ca11e0f4f","category":"Tech"}
