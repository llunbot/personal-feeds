{"title":"UK Court Rejects Government Secrecy in Apple's Fight Against Backdoor Request","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/07/apple-challenges-uk-government-back-door-demand/","date":1744024808000,"content":"Apple has filed a legal appeal against a UK government order requiring the company to create a \"back door\" to its encrypted cloud storage systems, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) confirmed on Monday (via <em><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-appealing-against-uk-governments-back-door-order-tribunal-confirms-2025-04-07/\">Reuters</a></em>). The confirmation means that the Home Office cannot keep all the details of its demand out of the public domain.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/02/iCloud-Versus-UK-Key-Feature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nThe high-profile challenge follows reports earlier this year that the UK used its Investigatory Powers Act to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/07/uk-government-orders-access-icloud/\">demand secret access to encrypted user data</a> uploaded to iCloud worldwide. Apple responded by <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/21/apple-pulls-encrypted-icloud-security-feature-uk/\">removing its Advanced Data Protection feature</a> from the UK rather than compromising its security standards.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to the IPT ruling, the British government had sought to keep details of the case private. The Home Office argued that publicizing the existence of the appeal could damage national security, but Judges Rabinder Singh and Jeremy Johnson rejected this claim.\r<br />\n<blockquote>\"It would have been a truly extraordinary step to conduct a hearing entirely in secret without any public revelation of the fact that a hearing was taking place,\" the judges wrote in their <a href=\"https://investigatorypowerstribunal.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IPT-25-68-CH-Judgment.pdf\">decision</a>. \"For the reasons that are set out in our private judgement, we do not accept that the revelation of the bare details of the case would be damaging to the public interest or prejudicial to national security.\"</blockquote>Monday's ruling follows a hearing in London in March, which was held in secret.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple previously <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/30/apple-deeply-concerned-uk-surveillance-law/\">made it clear</a> that it would pull ‌iCloud‌ features from the UK rather than compromise its user security, and while that only extends to Advanced Data Protection right now, it could lead to key features like FaceTime and iMessage being removed in the country. The UK wants backdoor access to ‌iCloud‌ data to fight terrorism and investigate child sex abuse.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe UK's order was particularly controversial as it would have required Apple to provide access to data from users outside the UK without their governments' knowledge. Additionally, the IPA makes it illegal for companies to disclose the existence of such government demands.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe US government is reportedly <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/27/us-probes-uk-apple-backdoor-treaty-violation/\">investigating</a> whether the UK's demand violates the CLOUD Act, which prevents the UK from requesting data from US citizens.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-privacy/\">Apple Privacy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-security/\">Apple Security</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/encryption/\">Encryption</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/united-kingdom/\">United Kingdom</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/07/apple-challenges-uk-government-back-door-demand/\">UK Court Rejects Government Secrecy in Apple's Fight Against Backdoor Request</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/uk-court-rejects-government-secrecy-in-apples-fight-against-backdoor-request.2454880/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"989e508a9b5fd7a5df5313c8ab0a0b58869b459a79ca70fa3ae1d2870a05551a","category":"Apple"}
