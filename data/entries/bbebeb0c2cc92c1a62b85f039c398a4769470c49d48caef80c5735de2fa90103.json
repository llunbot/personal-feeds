However, it does not feature Face ID like the iPad Pro. Rather, it follows the 2020 iPad Air in featuring a TouchID fingerprint reader on one of the power button for authentication. It also leaves behind Apple's long-standing, proprietary Lightning port in favor of industry standard USB-Câ€”a change that also came to other recent iPad redesigns.</p>\n<p>The new iPad Mini will be available for pre-order today, and will begin shipping next week.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1794540#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1794540&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bbebeb0c2cc92c1a62b85f039c398a4769470c49d48caef80c5735de2fa90103","category":"Tech"}
