According to his sponsor E.F. Education-EasyPost’s recap on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CxCkNoTOwuF/?img_index=1\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a>, his individual time trial (ITT) on the Tour Divide Route was about pushing himself in a sustainable way and during his 12day 12hr and 21min run down the divide, he stopped to rest for 12 hours out of every 48. While it is unlikely that his ride will be counted as the official record given the presence of a media crew, it should be noted that he went nearly a day-and-a-half faster than the late-great Mike Hall (13:22:51), with neither rider going over the now-notorious Koko Claims hike-a-bike section (Lachlan being forced to reroute due to wildfires in Canada).<span></span></em></p>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote>\n<div>\n<p> </p>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div>View this post on Instagram</div>\n</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CxCkNoTOwuF/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" target=\"_blank\">A post shared by EF Education–EasyPost (@efprocycling)</a></p>\n</div>\n</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Time to get some short-lived rest indeed as—if he completes the Lifetime Grand Prix series—Lachlan is slated to race the upcoming all-out 40-mile Chequamegon MTB Festival in Cable, WI on September 16, followed by the 110-mile Rad Dirt Fest in Trinidad, CO on September, 30 and, finally, the Big Sugar Gravel century in Bentonville, AR on October 21!</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/lachlan-morton-tour-divide-record/\">Congratulations to Lachlan Morton for Completing the Tour Divide in 12 Days 12 Hours and 21 Minutes</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"Hailey Moore","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"1abc004485cba3bae59101df05820b5e8ced84d00fd6d6a8e04903aa521a86e7","category":"Cycling"}
