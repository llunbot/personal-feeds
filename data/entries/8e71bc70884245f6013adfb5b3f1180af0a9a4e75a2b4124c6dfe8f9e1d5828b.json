The highest projections are coming from NRG with an estimate\nof around $5 million, though audience interest polls from the\ncompany have 30% saying they are “definitely not” interested in\nwatching the film, an unusually high count for any wide release.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These projections are <em>with</em> a $35 million promotional campaign, for a movie Amazon paid $40 million to purchase.
