SpaceX tried this on <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/03/after-its-third-test-flight-spacexs-starship-could-soon-carry-satellites/\">Starship's third launch</a> in March but aborted the engine restart after the rocket lost roll control during the flight's coast phase.</p>\n<p>A successful engine relight demonstration would pave the way for future Starships to ascend into stable, sustainable orbits. It's essential to test the Raptor engine's ability to reignite in space for a deorbit burn to steer Starship out of orbit toward an atmospheric reentry.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/spacex-will-try-some-new-tricks-on-starships-sixth-test-flight/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/spacex-will-try-some-new-tricks-on-starships-sixth-test-flight/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f33d2ef4d35b3f33a4dab19c7cefca2e0543401c5736e7f4df49d4b0212b295d","category":"Tech"}
