You could wind up using different accounts for different purposes or sets of machines and want to consolidate receiving email for all of them. Apple doesn’t offer an obvious way to add iCloud accounts just for email in the Mail app. (Any third-party app makes it easy.) That’s because Apple steers you to select iCloud as your account type in the setup process, and only then warns you that account would then be used for all your iCloud purposes, not just email.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s a way to do it that requires using an <em>app-specific password</em>, which is Apple’s term for a password used exclusively for email, calendar, and contacts access. This kind of password is required because all other syncing is locked inside iCloud.com’s secure and proprietary services. Email, calendar, and contacts rely on industry standards, and it’s common to use third-party apps with them. (This is also why <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1439693/how-to-enable-manage-advanced-data-protection-icloud-data.html\">Apple’s Advanced Data Protection for iCloud</a> can’t secure those items using end-to-end encryption.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please note:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>You <em>cannot</em> add an iCloud account already being used on your device through this method—you have to enable regular iCloud email for that.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You can only use your primary address. To find that, log into iCloud.com with the account, choose the Mail web app, and then click the Settings (gear) icon. Under Primary Address, you’ll see the email address you need to use below.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how to bypass Apple’s seeming blockage and add iCloud accounts for email in your Mail app.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Start at <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://appleid.apple.com&amp;xcust=1-1-2133421-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">appleid.apple.com</a> with the account you want to add for email only.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>After logging in, click <em>Sign-In and Security</em> if it’s not highlighted, then tap <em>App-Specific Passwords</em> near the bottom of the set of options.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>If you see the button “Generate an app-specific password” click it; you should only see that if you haven’t created one of these kinds of passwords before.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click the plus (+) button to the right of the Passwords label.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Enter a descriptive name to remind you later why you added this password, and click <em>Create</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You may be prompted with <em>Sign In with Password</em>. If so, click that button and follow the steps required to return here. You may also be prompted to just enter your Apple ID password and click <em>Continue</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Apple creates a password in a dialog that reads, “Your app-specific password is: <code>aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa</code>”—four sets of four lowercase letters separated by dashes. Copy it or write it down, as once you click <em>Done</em>, it cannot be recovered. You must create a new one.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click <em>Done</em>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/mac911-app-specific-password-mail-bordered.png\" alt=\"iCloud Mail app specific password\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/mac911-app-specific-password-mail-bordered.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 816w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/mac911-app-specific-password-mail-bordered.png?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/mac911-app-specific-password-mail-bordered.png?resize=768%2C514&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/mac911-app-specific-password-mail-bordered.png?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"816\" height=\"546\" /><figcaption><p>Copy the app-specific password generated at the Apple ID site.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you can set up Mail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In macOS:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Launch Mail.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Choose <em>Mail &gt; Settings/Preferences</em> and click the <em>Accounts</em> button.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Click the plus (+) button at the lower-right corner of the window.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Select <em>Other Mail Account</em> and click <em>Continue</em>.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Enter your iCloud email account name in the Email Address field and the app-specific password in the Password field.
