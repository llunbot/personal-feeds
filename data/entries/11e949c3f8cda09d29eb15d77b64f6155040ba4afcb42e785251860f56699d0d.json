Cook said that the company will \"break new ground\" in generative AI in 2024. \"We believe it will unlock transformative opportunities for our users,\" said Cook.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/03/hey-siri-banner-apple.jpg\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\" />\r<br />\nCook has made several statements on Apple's artificial intelligence ambitions in recent months. <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/02/tim-cook-generative-ai-comments/\">Back in November</a>, he said that Apple was \"investing quite a bit\" in AI, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/01/apple-ai-details-coming-later-this-year/\">in February</a>, he said that the company was spending a \"tremendous amount of time and effort\" on AI, with more details to come later in the year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMultiple rumors have said that Apple will add new generative AI features in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>, with plans to use AI to boost the capabilities of many of the built-in iOS apps.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAside from Cook's comments on AI, the shareholder meeting was business as usual. As <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-28/apple-shareholders-vote-down-request-for-ai-transparency-report\">noted by <em>Bloomberg</em></a>, shareholders rejected a proposal asking Apple for an AI transparency report with details on whether AI is being used ethically.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's board and executive compensation plans were approved, but no shareholder proposals were accepted. Al Gore and James Bell are set to retire from Apple's board, while former Aerospace Corp. CEO Wanda Austin will join.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/aapl/\">AAPL</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/28/tim-cook-apple-generative-ai-break-new-ground/\">Tim Cook Says Apple Will 'Break New Ground' in Generative AI</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/tim-cook-says-apple-will-break-new-ground-in-generative-ai.2420670/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"11e949c3f8cda09d29eb15d77b64f6155040ba4afcb42e785251860f56699d0d","category":"Apple"}
