The refurbished models are discounted by approximately 15% compared to the original pricing of these iPads.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple first introduced this particular iPad Air model in March 2022, and the iPad Pro models followed in October of that year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple says its refurbished iPads include a new battery and outer shell, a new white box, and all manuals and accessories, including a USB-C charging cable and power adapter. Apple says it puts refurbished devices through a \"thorough cleaning process and inspection,\" and it performs full functionality testing to ensure there are no defective units.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAll refurbished iPads are covered by Apple's one-year limited warranty and 14-day return policy, and eligible for AppleCare+ coverage.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile some savings can be had here, these are obviously two-year-old iPad models with fewer remaining years of iPadOS support.
