The company (from Australia) is Forcite, and the helmet is the MK1S, which promises to not only handle navigation and media streaming but also bring a little AI to the party, too. I've been living with one for over a month now, and while the experience hasn't been perfect, it's good enough to make me bullish on this technology—and the company.</p>\n<p>Let me start by saying I'm a rider who doesn't like distractions. I've reviewed a number of <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/reviews/nuviz-head-up-display-preview/\">in-helmet communication systems</a> over the years, plus various other <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2011-02-08-tachyon-xc-hd-helmet-camera-review.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAEI_Vyf4nkqkR0GVTnrrH7ia6q7S_6MiRdAFWhk-R_s35D-17UvGkLSmrmjoIguifvQ40rePxbiUboHE0Au8hpqnPs9TNqyjHlOEpfUx_Nx-iT_C2J5ftKdSpXLVq_IAQ-1DRsqL97gkBzh6ccEVNuN5gNbu5p1pHpCnw0ytPkW0\">motorcycle gadgets</a>, and none have ever made their way into my regular rotation. I'm surrounded by so much tech all the time that, for me, hopping on a motorcycle is an escape.</p>\n<p>Given that, I was skeptical that I'd really be enamored of a smart helmet that talks and blinks at me. Color me surprised, then, that I actually enjoyed my time with it.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1951906#p3\">Read 29 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1951906&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Staff","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"019f87ff2adc9e7e95d89b76b9ec6b52418683dc42c44ca91ad2697115480aea","category":"Tech"}
