It used to be Apple's mainstream workstation Mac, but in the Apple Silicon era, that role has been filled by the <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/m2-pro-mac-mini-review-apples-goldilocks-desktop-for-semi-professionals/\">Mac mini</a> and <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/m2-ultra-mac-studio-review-who-needs-a-mac-pro-anyway/\">Mac Studio</a>, instead. The 24-inch iMac, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/10/apples-m3-gives-the-new-24-inch-imac-a-big-speed-boost-but-little-else/\">recently updated with a new M3 chip</a>, is a smaller machine focused more on casual day-to-day computing.</p>\n<p>Some 27-inch iMac users have been holding out for a true large-screened iMac replacement. But Apple threw cold water on those hopes in a statement given to the Verge (and later reiterated to Ars), where it said definitively that it wasÂ <em>not</em> working on an Apple Silicon version of the 27-inch iMac. Users of 27-inch Intel Macs should either move to the 24-inch iMac or to the M2 Pro Mac mini or the Mac Studio if they need more performance, according to Apple.</p>\n\n<p>Eternal optimists still holding out hope for a new large-screened iMac might note that Apple specifically mentioned the 27-inch iMac, which doesn't necessarily preclude the possibility of an even-larger iMac in the 30-something-inch range. But given Apple's usual aversion to discussing its future plans, an explicit denial does hit differently than a total lack of comment or a boilerplate \"Apple doesn't comment on future plans.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1981517#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1981517&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"607fc32dbe07bb1c844a7b31ddca30f12e0d3feb90d122ec5bcd9e8e10a8c7aa","category":"Tech"}
