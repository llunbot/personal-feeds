This episode is packed full with insight, particularly on the importance of emotional intelligence both in a professional sense but also in everyday life and the reasons why some people are so chatty before an event while others are as quiet as a mouse. Dr Perry also shares how to find that all-important balance between pushing yourself hard and pushing yourself over the limit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few curveballs too, including her reasoning for why she thinks not every cycling team should have a sports psychologist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interview starts at 4:09.</p>\n\n\n\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Listen to <a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/618e52740da782001471efbe/episodes/dr-josie-perry\" target=\"_blank\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 78 now on Acast</a></strong></li><li><strong>Check outÂ </strong><a href=\"https://shows.acast.com/618e52740da782001471efbe/episodes\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>all episodes</strong></a></li><li><strong>Also available wherever you get your podcasts</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h3><span>Related Posts</span></h3>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/orla-chennaoui-podcast\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 77: Orla Chennaoui, the face of pro cycling</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/pippa-york-podcast\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 76: Polka dot jersey winner Pippa York on finding happiness</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h3>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/will-butler-adams-brompton-podcast\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 75: Brompton CEO, Will Butler-Adams</a>\r\n                       </h3>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div><p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/dr-josie-perry-podcast\">Cyclist Magazine Podcast episode 77: Fear, pain and motivation with sports psychologist Dr Josie Perry</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Emma Cole &#124; Features Writer","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"fc351a85e0e4ad036afcd9d95583b84a4df65dd107cdc927a690bc60b02bc9cc","category":"Cycling"}
