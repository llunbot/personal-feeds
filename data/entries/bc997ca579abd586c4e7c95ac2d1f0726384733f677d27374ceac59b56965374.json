He was found deceased at his home on Friday after friends requested a wellness check. Christensen, along with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randy_Suess\">Randy Suess</a>, created the first BBS in Chicago in 1978, leading to an <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/11/the-lost-civilization-of-dial-up-bulletin-board-systems/506465/\">important cultural era</a> of digital community-building that presaged much of our online world today.</p>\n\n<p>In the 1980s and 1990s, BBSes introduced many home computer users to multiplayer online gaming, message boards, and online community building in an era before the Internet became widely available to people outside of science and academia. It also gave rise to the <a href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/728527/what-is-shareware-and-why-was-it-so-popular-in-the-1990s/\">shareware gaming scene</a> that led to companies like <a href=\"https://www.howtogeek.com/713532/before-fortnite-there-was-zzt-meet-epics-first-game/\">Epic Games</a> today.</p>\n<p>Friends and associates remember Christensen as humble and unassuming, a quiet innovator who never sought the spotlight for his groundbreaking work. Despite creating one of the foundational technologies of the digital age, Christensen maintained a low profile throughout his life, content with his long-standing career at IBM and showing no bitterness or sense of missed opportunity as the Internet age dawned.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/ward-christensen-bbs-inventor-and-architect-of-our-online-age-dies-at-age-78/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/ward-christensen-bbs-inventor-and-architect-of-our-online-age-dies-at-age-78/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"bc997ca579abd586c4e7c95ac2d1f0726384733f677d27374ceac59b56965374","category":"Tech"}
