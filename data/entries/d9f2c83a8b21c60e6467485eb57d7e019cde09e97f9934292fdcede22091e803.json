With the recent announcement of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/openai-collapses-media-reality-with-sora-a-photorealistic-ai-video-generator/\">OpenAI's Sora</a> video synthesis model, many people have noted the dramatic jump in AI-video quality over the past year compared to the infamous spaghetti video. Smith's new video plays on that comparison by showing the actual actor eating spaghetti in a comical fashion and claiming that it is AI-generated.</p>\n\n<p>Captioned \"This is getting out of hand!\", the Instagram video uses a split screen layout to show the original AI-generated spaghetti video created by a Reddit user named \"<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/chaindrop/submitted/\">chaindrop</a>\" in March 2023 on the top, labeled with the subtitle \"AI Video 1 year ago.\" Below that, in a box titled \"AI Video Now,\" the real Smith shows 11 video segments of himself actually eating spaghetti by slurping it up while shaking his head, pouring it into his mouth with his fingers, and even nibbling on a friend's hair. 2006's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap_Yo_Fingers\">Snap Yo Fingers</a> by Lil Jon plays in the background.</p>\n<figure>\n    <div>\n            </div>\n    </figure>\n<p>In the Instagram comments section, some people <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C3i5vAZvRS3/c/18004905593348071/\">expressed confusion</a> about the new (non-AI) video, saying, \"I'm still in doubt if second video was also made by AI or not.\" In a reply, someone else <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/C3i5vAZvRS3/c/18094389379397695/\">wrote</a>, \"Boomers are gonna loose [sic] this one. Second one is clearly him making a joke but I wouldnâ€™t doubt it in a couple months time it will get like that.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2004546#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2004546&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d9f2c83a8b21c60e6467485eb57d7e019cde09e97f9934292fdcede22091e803","category":"Tech"}
