After today, you can still download or re-download any titles you've previously bought from those shops, though that can obviously change in the future. Closing the eShops means that roughly 1,000 digital-only games will no longer be accessible, according to <a href=\"https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/analysis-digital-only-wii-u-3ds-games/\">research by VGC</a>, including 335 Virtual Console games that aren't available through the Nintendo Switch Online service.</p>\n<p>These kinds of sweeping moves, while perhaps understandable from a business perspective, pose a serious danger to the preservation of many games in the systems' libraries. As Ars detailed earlier this month, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/03/why-game-archivists-are-dreading-this-months-3ds-wii-u-eshop-shutdown/\">video game preservationists are hamstrung by laws and regulations</a> around remote access to DRM-protected work, even if it's kept by research-driven organizations. Nintendo is one of many organizations that, through the Entertainment Software Association, lobbies to prevent libraries from offering legal access to archived games.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1927063#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1927063&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"374608792a20a32c955d71e4685121b62d2e2ca3fe97a383c717764b2b59f89d","category":"Tech"}
