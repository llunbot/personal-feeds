These design attributes did not make it into the final release.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nOften in filings of this type, external photos and other sensitive details are subject to a confidentiality clause with an expiry date, so it is likely that the clause in this one recently expired, hence why the images have only just come to light.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple currently offers the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>, released in September 2023, in the same natural titanium color as the first-generation model. Prior to launch, some rumors <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/01/apple-watch-ultra-2-black-titanium-rumor/\">suggested</a> Apple could release a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/31/2023-apple-watch-ultra-new-dark-color/\">new darker color option</a> that was originally tested for the previous model but ultimately canceled.
