{"title":"Apple Requiring Unvaccinated Corporate Employees to Be Tested for COVID-19 Daily","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/20/apple-employees-covid-19-testing-protocols/","date":1634765147000,"content":"Apple corporate employees who are unvaccinated or who have not shared their vaccination status with Apple will need to undergo a COVID-19 test each time they come into the office, reports <em><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-20/apple-will-force-unvaccinated-office-workers-to-get-tested-daily\">Bloomberg</a></em>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2018/06/apple-park-drone-june-2018-2.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nAn employee going into the office on a daily basis would need to be tested each day of the week under the new rules. Apple is still stopping short of implementing a vaccine mandate that would require employees to be vaccinated to return to the office. Apple corporate employees that have been vaccinated will need to do a rapid test once per week.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs for retail staff, unvaccinated employees will need to test twice per week instead of on a daily basis, and vaccinated retail employees will need to take a rapid test once per week.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nEmployees submitting to testing will be able to use at-home rapid tests that can be picked up from Apple's corporate offices and retail stores. Tests take 15 minutes and require employees to self-report the results.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nMany other tech companies have implemented vaccine mandates, which Apple has declined to do so far, but as <em>Bloomberg</em> points out, Apple may soon need to change its rules. The Biden administration is requiring all federal contractors to require their employees to be vaccinated by December 8, and Apple sells products to the government.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple has asked employees to provide their vaccination status by October 24, and they'll also need to provide proof in the near future. The new testing requirements go into effect on November 1.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple is now planning for employees to return to the office at least three days per week starting in January.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-park/\">Apple Park</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/covid-19-coronavirus/\">COVID-19 Coronavirus</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/20/apple-employees-covid-19-testing-protocols/\">Apple Requiring Unvaccinated Corporate Employees to Be Tested for COVID-19 Daily</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=v3q2pg4OhOI:D6ULK6wdQTs:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=v3q2pg4OhOI:D6ULK6wdQTs:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/v3q2pg4OhOI\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e262561c96bd70d220e34ea1daa98a952e9cd200cb2700c0929d84aca905224f","category":"Apple"}
