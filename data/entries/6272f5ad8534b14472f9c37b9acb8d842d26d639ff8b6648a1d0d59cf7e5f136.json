That 34-year streak was finally broken on December 21, 2023, when 13-year-old phenom BlueScuti <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9oVQ43j22g\">became the first human to reach the game's \"kill screen\"</a> after a 40-minute, 1,511-line performance, crashing the game by reaching its functional limits.</p>\n<div><div></div><p>The game-crashing, record-setting performance. Jump to 38:56 for BlueScuti's disbelieving reaction to his achievement and a short interview. </p></div>\n<p>What makes BlueScuti's achievement even more incredible (as noted in some <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2-9wvKD1z4\">excellent</a> YouTube <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuJ5UuknsHU\">summaries</a> of the scene) is that, until just a few years ago, the <em>Tetris</em> community at large assumed it was functionally impossible for a human to get much past 290 lines. The road to the first NES <em>Tetris</em> kill screen highlights the surprisingly robust competitive scene that still surrounds the classic game and just how much that competitive community has been able to collectively improve in a relatively short time.</p>\n<h2>From hypertaps to rolling</h2>\n<p>If and when a player reaches Level 29 on NES <em>Tetris</em> (after clearing between 230 to 290 lines, depending on the starting level), the game reaches its highest possible speed. At this point, simply holding down left or right on the NES D-pad can't usually get a piece all the way to the side of the well unless the board is extremely \"low\" (i.e., pieces only on the first one or two rows, maximum). Thus, for years, players that reached Level 29 found their games usually \"topped out\" just a few pieces later.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1993353#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1993353&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6272f5ad8534b14472f9c37b9acb8d842d26d639ff8b6648a1d0d59cf7e5f136","category":"Tech"}
