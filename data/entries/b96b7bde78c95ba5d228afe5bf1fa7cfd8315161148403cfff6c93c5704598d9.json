The officials didn’t elaborate.</p>\n<p>Commercial spyware is sold by a host of companies, with the best known being NSO Group of Israel. The company sells a hacking tool known as Pegasus that can surreptitiously compromise both iPhones and Android devices using “clickless” exploits, meaning they require no user interaction. By sending a text or ringing the device, Pegasus can install spying software that steals contacts, messages, geo locations, and more, even when the text or call isn’t answered. Other companies selling commercial spyware include Cytrox, Candiru, and Paragon.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1927199#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1927199&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b96b7bde78c95ba5d228afe5bf1fa7cfd8315161148403cfff6c93c5704598d9","category":"Tech"}
