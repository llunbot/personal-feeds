Despite the notch claims, the black and white mockups depicted show the older notch design with the selfie camera just left of center, backing up rumors that the device is largely based on the iPhone 14. There's also a single-lens camera on the back, as expected, along with a glass back and a aluminum band.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>Here's what the iPhone SE 4 looks like <a href=\"https://t.co/pEyIAJ34VR\">pic.twitter.com/pEyIAJ34VR</a></p>— Majin Bu (@MajinBuOfficial) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1883269912266944850?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 25, 2025</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\nSuggestions that the iPhone SE 4 could get an Action Button or Camera Control button also appear off the mark, based on these mockups, which are very similar to images previously shared by leaker <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/16/iphone-se-4-dummy/\">Sonny Dickson</a>. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAlong with the visible features from the dummy model, the ‌iPhone SE 4‌ is expected to include a faster A17 Pro chip, an Apple-designed modem chip, and 8GB RAM – the minimum amount of memory required for Apple Intelligence. The camera is expected to be the same 48-megapixel Wide camera used in the current ‌iPhone 16‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/iphone-se-4-mockups-bu-e1737971887187.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3072\" height=\"3584\" />\r<br />\nApple is expected to debut the next ‌iPhone SE‌ sometime in March or April, and it will continue to be the company's lowest-cost device. It could go up in price slightly, but Apple is said to be aiming to keep it below $500.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/majin-bu/\">Majin Bu</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE\">iPhone SE (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/27/latest-iphone-se-4-dummy-images-show-notch/\">Latest iPhone SE 4 Dummy Units Reveal Three Missing Rumored Features</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/latest-iphone-se-4-dummy-units-reveal-three-missing-rumored-features.2448172/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"54d4fe2a6aa79fa294534328212e5b2bc00a31ee814899217f82acdc769e90d9","category":"Apple"}
