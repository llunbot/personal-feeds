Despite his domination of La Vuelta, Heras couldn’t produce the same form at the Tour de France or Giro d’Italia — his best overall result at both races was fifth.</span></p>\n<p><span>Tony Rominger and Alberto Contador are the two riders to have claimed a hat-trick of overall victories at the Vuelta.</span></p>\n<p><span>Primož Roglič has won La Vuelta on both of his two starts at the race, and begins the 2021 edition as the favourite to become only the fourth rider to win the Vuelta at least three times.</span></p>\n<h4><b>Oldest Vuelta a España Winners</b></h4>\n<p><b><img src=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0040/5251/6910/files/GettyImages-179363405-min_1024x1024.jpg?v=1628093650\" /></b><em>Chris Horner (</em><em>Image credit: JOSE JORDAN/AFP via Getty Images)</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>2013 - Chris Horner, 41 years and 328 days</span></li>\n<li><span>1994 - Tony Rominger, 33 years and 49 days</span></li>\n<li><span>2006 - Alexandre Vinokourov, 33 years and 1 day</span></li>\n<li><span>1979 - Joop Zoetemelk, 32 years and 161 days</span></li>\n<li><span>2017 - Chris Froome, 32 years and 113 days</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>Chris Horner made cycling history when he won the 2013 edition of the Vuelta a España at the age of 41.
