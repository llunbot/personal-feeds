Well, it wasn’t that I avoided them, I was just devoid of the place because the riding in Chico was so great!” </i></p></blockquote>\n<p>For as much as the history books record Marin County as the epicenter of all things relevant to pioneer mountain biking, it’s important to remember that—no different than the seismic waves that emanate from an earthquake’s epicenter—there was a variety of decades-ago frame builders who were embarking on their own age of fat-tire discovery.</p>\n<p>Among them was Jeff Lindsay. No stranger to racing and building road frames in the 70s, Jeff founded Mountain Goat as a steel-framed mountain bike brand and bikes that bear its horned head badge remain highly sought-after jewels from the pioneering club of NorCal builders.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-10.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-10.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-10.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-10.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-10.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-10.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-10.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-10.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>The Roots of the Goat in His Own Words</h3>\n<p>“Like many famous mountain bike frame builders up here, I really got my start racing road bikes as a kid. In fact, I still remember racing Gary Fisher when we were both about 12 years old. It was in 1974 when I was studying Industrial Arts at Chico State that I first learned about the art of frame building. I kept riding and racing but once I got a car, I put the bikes aside for a while and moved to Chico. But the riding up here in the foothills was so amazing that it got me back on the bike.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-22.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-22.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-22.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-22.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-22.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-22.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-22.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-22.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-29.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-29.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-29.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-29.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-29.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-29.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-29.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-29.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>“I was in college at Chico State and actually made a track bike as my graduate project.

I couldn’t make enough bikes at the time, which was fine, but the real problem was that I didn’t know anything about running a business! At the time Ritchey had a leg up on me because [he] could build bikes faster, but when all the bikes imported from Japan and Taiwan started showing up, my market started falling apart.”</p>\n<p>“In 1995 my wife told me that we needed to have a Plan B and that was when I started working with a trading company in Japan and had the Escape Goat built, which I sold a container of. Then, I made a deal with a Taiwan-based frame builder called A-Pro and they were looking for an American-based frame build shop to add to their Taiwan and Chinese production. Mountain Goat would become their boutique brand and we’d also get subassemblies shipped over for brands like Voodoo, Pro-Flex, and even Gary Fisher and then finish the build in our Chico shop. We did that for about three years and then bailed on the bike industry completely.”</p>\n<p>“In 1999 I started making special tools for the glass-blowing industry. Thankfully, all my years in the bike industry taught me some good lessons in marketing, and that really paid off with this new venture.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1333\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-34.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-34.jpg?w=1333&amp;quality=75 1333w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-34.jpg?resize=1024,1536&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-34.jpg?resize=768,1152&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-34.jpg?resize=700,1050&amp;quality=75 700w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1333\" height=\"2000\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-4.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-4.jpg?w=1333&amp;quality=75 1333w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-4.jpg?resize=1024,1536&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-4.jpg?resize=768,1152&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-4.jpg?resize=700,1050&amp;quality=75 700w\" /></p>\n<h3>What About the Deluxe?</h3>\n<p>“I guess if there was a signature look to my early bikes it was the ovalized top tube that I’d sourced from Phil Wood who was originally rolling the tubes to be used for tandem frames. I loved the shape of them and ran them into and past the headtube to create a better surface for the fillet brazing. The top tube was really an aesthetic thing and didn’t really impact how the bike rode. I made most of these bikes from 1982-1983 and always used 70-degree head tubes because anything more relaxed just made for sloppy handling. Actually, for the WhiskeyTown, which was my most successful frame, I steepened the head angle to 71-degrees with a 73-degree seat angle.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-31.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-31.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-31.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-31.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-31.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-31.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-31.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-31.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-30.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-30.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-30.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-30.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-30.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-30.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-30.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-30.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>“The seat tube junction on this bike was pretty special as the seat tube pierced the top tube. One of my earliest road bikes was a Legnano that had a cool seat binder design that was in front of the seat tube which I copied but ran on the backside of the seat tube. I can tell that this is an early bike, and the frame was made with straight gauge steel tubing with an off-the-shelf unicrown fork. I didn’t make many unicrown forks, but I did make a few forks with a plated crown that I sourced from Henry James.”</p>\n<p>“I made the stem, and it was pretty basic. The one thing I liked to do was run all the cables on the underside of the downtube so that you couldn’t see them when you were looking down on the frame when you were riding.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-38.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-38.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-38.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-38.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-38.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-38.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-38.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-38.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<h3>Looking Back</h3>\n<p>Today, the 74-year-old Lindsay stays busy making his glass-blowing tools and watching UCI cross-country mountain bike and motorcycle racing on the telly.</p>\n<p>“You know, looking back, I’m glad I did what I did with Mountain Goat, but I’m glad I’m not doing it anymore. With glass-blowing tools, there’s never the threat of a recall or lawsuit because of a broken bolt! I remember when I finally ran my first full-page color ad in Mountain Biking Magazine and the Mammoth Mountain NORBA National Gary Fisher saw that and laughed saying, ‘First full-page, first lawsuit!’ And he was right because not soon after some guy who folded a downtube on one of my bikes sued me! So no, I don’t miss being in the bike industry!”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-3.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" alt srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-3.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-3.jpg?resize=1024,682&amp;quality=75 1024w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-3.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-3.jpg?resize=1800,1200&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-3.jpg?resize=1335,890&amp;quality=75 1335w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-3.jpg?resize=700,467&amp;quality=75 700w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2023/05/1988-Mountain-Goat-Dinoflage-Deluxe-3.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>Just as it is with so many other small mountain bike brands that contributed their efforts to the sport, Mountain Goat too played a historical role that still excites riders and enthusiasts today. In the end, the metric for success wasn’t the number of bikes sold or races won, but the design and ingenuity put into the bikes that continue to inspire us today.</p>\n<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Year: 1988</li>\n<li>S/N: 211988D</li>\n<li>Frame: Mountain Goat Deluxe</li>\n<li>Fork: Mountain Goat Deluxe</li>\n<li>Stem: Mountain Goat Deluxe</li>\n<li>Headset: Chris King</li>\n<li>Bottom Bracket: Bullseye</li>\n<li>Handlebar: Cook Bros</li>\n<li>Handlebar Shim: MG</li>\n<li>Shifters: Deore XT</li>\n<li>Front Derailleur: Deore XT</li>\n<li>Rear Derailleur: Deore XT</li>\n<li>Brake Levers: Deore XT</li>\n<li>Front Brake: Deore XT</li>\n<li>Rear Brake: Deore XT</li>\n<li>Crankset: Bullseye</li>\n<li>Chainrings: Bullseye</li>\n<li>Pedals: Deore XT</li>\n<li>Hubs: Deore XT</li>\n<li>Tires: Panaracer Timbuk II</li>\n<li>Wheel QR: Deore XT</li>\n<li>Seatpost: IRD</li>\n<li>Saddle: Unicanitor</li>\n<li>Grips: Oakley</li>\n<li>Cogs: Deore XT</li>\n<li>Chain: Deore XT</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/1988-mountain-goat-dinoflage-deluxe/\">From The Pro’s Closet: 1988 Mountain Goat Dinoflage Deluxe</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"dab3b1a7a69cbcd30d41bb69ba136f6758ee038cc07107fa3fc0e408cb4fa257","category":"Cycling"}
