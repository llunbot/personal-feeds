The real question to start with is: Is the\nheart rate function (accuracy aside), even usable? A lot of hours\nlater, I have answers to both of those questions. And trust me,\nit’s a very mixed bag.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The answer:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It’s clear that any movement (even on a stationary bike) quickly\nleads to either dropouts or inaccurate heart rate. And outdoors\nrunning, it’s even worse. Ultimately, I don’t see any value in the\nheart rate sensor in this product, because it’s simply not good\nenough to be useful, even for casual use.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So maybe this feature is <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/17/chance-miller-reviews-the-beats-powerbeats-pro-2\"><em>not</em> soon coming</a> to AirPods? I think there’s <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@_Davidsmith/114105204080909252\">a good argument to be made</a> that these are better than no heart rate monitor at all but also not nearly as good as an Apple Watch or dedicated device.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/17/maker-powerbeats-pro-2-heartrate-sensor\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"f172a13ea6c98219b883505983e2d5b7663a8b7223f8be04e4776a6d0f4dbb46","category":"Tech"}
