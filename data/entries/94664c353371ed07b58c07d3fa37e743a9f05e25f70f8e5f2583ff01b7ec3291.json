Because it was a freemium game, there are players who invested a lot of money in various items in the game, so Pocket Camp Complete allows those players to continue to play the base version of the game.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nNintendo has stopped all events and updates now that the online version of Pocket Camp has been discontinued. Pocket Camp saves can be transferred to Pocket Camp Complete and the game has many of the same features, but there is no support for visiting and interacting with other players or receiving gifts. It does not have in-app purchases, nor is there an online connection.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAnimal Crossing: Pocket Camp Complete is available from the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a> for $9.99. Saves can be transferred until June 2, 2025, and transferring a save requires a Nintendo Account.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/nintendo/\">Nintendo</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/02/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-complete/\">Paid Version of Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp Now Available</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/paid-version-of-animal-crossing-pocket-camp-now-available.2444480/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"94664c353371ed07b58c07d3fa37e743a9f05e25f70f8e5f2583ff01b7ec3291","category":"Apple"}
