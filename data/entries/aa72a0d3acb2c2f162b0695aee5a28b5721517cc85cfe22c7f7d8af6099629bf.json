As one of the most successful (yet sometimes <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90240345/myst-at-25-how-it-changed-gaming-created-addicts-and-made-enemies\">divisive</a>) computer games of all time, it sold <a href=\"https://www.filfre.net/2020/02/myst-or-the-drawbacks-to-success/\">6 million</a> boxed copies in the 1990s and later ended up on over <a href=\"https://www.mobygames.com/game/1223/myst/\">a dozen platforms</a>, with remakes counting for <a href=\"https://cyan.com/games/myst/\">even more</a> appearances, including a VR version. Now, thanks to an unofficial <a href=\"http://deater.net/weave/vmwprod/myst_vcs/\">hobby project</a> by Vince Weaver, <em>Myst</em> can add one more platform to the list: Atari 2600.</p>\n\n<p>Vince Weaver is an associate professor at the University of Maine in Computer Engineering. Since last year, he has been working on a partial \"demake\" of the famous point-and-click adventure game that runs on Atari's 8-bit game system, and he just returned to the project to make updates <a href=\"https://twitter.com/deater78/status/1672071594372476929?s=20\">last week</a>.</p>\n<p>For those not in the gaming community, the term \"demake\" might need some unpacking. A demake is essentially the opposite of a remake: instead of upgrading a game to fit modern standards, a demake takes a modern or classic game and adapts it for older, less powerful hardware.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1950582#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1950582&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"aa72a0d3acb2c2f162b0695aee5a28b5721517cc85cfe22c7f7d8af6099629bf","category":"Tech"}
