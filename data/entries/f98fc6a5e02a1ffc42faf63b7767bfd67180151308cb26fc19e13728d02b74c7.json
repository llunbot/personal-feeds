The Aluminum cases also weigh up to 10% less, while the Series 10 also comes in Grade 5 titanium, replacing stainless steel.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple says it's the fastest-charging Apple Watch ever, reaching an 80% charge in 30 minutes. It uses a new neural network to reduce background noise when making calls with the watch.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple says the latest Apple Watch model can play music and podcasts directly through the speaker for the first time. It also includes a new depth gauge (good to 20 feet) as well as water temperature for pool and open water swims, as well as a new metal back that integrates the antenna into the housing. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nSeries 10 can also alert you to sleep apnea conditions, where breathing stops repeatedly during the night. Apple says the algorithm was developed using machine learning and clinical data, and then validated in a large clinical trial. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new Apple Watch Series 10 comes in Jet Black and Rose Gold, joining the existing Silver Aluminum color. The Apple Watch Series 10 starts at $399, and $499 for cellular models, and will be available to purchase from Friday, September 20.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 9</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Don't Buy)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/09/apple-announces-apple-watch-series-10/\">Apple Announces Thinner Apple Watch Series 10 With Bigger Screen Than Ultra</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-announces-thinner-apple-watch-series-10-with-bigger-screen-than-ultra.2435456/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f98fc6a5e02a1ffc42faf63b7767bfd67180151308cb26fc19e13728d02b74c7","category":"Apple"}
