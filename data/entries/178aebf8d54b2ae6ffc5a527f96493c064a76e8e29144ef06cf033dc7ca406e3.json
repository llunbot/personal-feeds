The confirmation appeared in a profile of the designer by <em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/21/technology/jony-ive-apple-lovefrom.html\">The New York Times</a></em>, putting to rest speculation that began nearly a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/27/jony-ive-openai-design-ai-hardware/\">year ago</a> about a potential collaboration between the two figures.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/jony-ive-ipad-pro.jpeg\" width=\"1278\" height=\"850\" />\r<br />\nThe AI hardware venture is reportedly being funded by Ive and the Emerson Collective, a company founded by Laurene Powell Jobs. According to the report, the project could secure up to $1 billion in funding by the end of the year, signaling significant investor interest in the endeavor.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDespite its high-profile leadership, the project is still in its early stages, with only 10 employees currently on board. However, the team includes notable former Apple designers Tang Tan and Evans Hankey, both of whom worked closely with Ive on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>. Ive's design firm, LoveFrom, is spearheading the device's design process.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe collaboration between Ive and Altman reportedly stemmed from discussions about the potential for generative AI to enable new types of computing devices. The technology's ability to handle complex requests is seen as a key factor in creating novel user experiences that go beyond traditional software capabilities.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile specific details about the AI product and its release timeline remain under wraps, the team has already established a significant presence in San Francisco, working out of a 32,000-square-foot office building, part of a $90 million real estate acquisition by Ive on a single city block.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new venture marks Ive's most significant technology project since departing Apple in 2019. After <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/06/27/jony-ive-leaving-apple/\">leaving his role</a> as chief design officer, Ive continued to work with Apple as a consultant through LoveFrom until 2022, when the partnership <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/07/12/apple-ends-jony-ive-partnership/\">officially concluded</a>.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/artificial-intelligence/\">Artificial Intelligence</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/jony-ive/\">Jony Ive</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/openai/\">OpenAI</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/23/jony-ive-working-on-new-device-openai/\">Jony Ive Confirms Involvement in AI Hardware Project With OpenAI</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/jony-ive-confirms-involvement-in-ai-hardware-project-with-openai.2437761/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"178aebf8d54b2ae6ffc5a527f96493c064a76e8e29144ef06cf033dc7ca406e3","category":"Apple"}
