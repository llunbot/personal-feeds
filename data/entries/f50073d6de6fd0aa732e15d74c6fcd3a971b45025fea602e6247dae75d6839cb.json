People <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/PBSOD/\">have made a hobby of</a> spotting them out in the wild, and in some circles, they remain a byword for the supposed flakiness and instability of PCs. To this day, networked PCs in macOS are <a href=\"https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/134338/why-does-the-icon-of-a-pc-show-a-blue-screen\">represented by</a> beige CRT monitors displaying a BSOD.</p>\n<p>But the BSOD is supposed to be a diagnostic tool, an informational screen that technicians can use to begin homing in on the problem that caused the crash in the first place; that old Windows' BSOD error codes were often so broad and vague as to be useless doesn't make the <em>idea</em> a bad one. Today, <a href=\"https://github.com/systemd/systemd/releases/tag/v255\">version 255 of the Linux <code>systemd</code> project</a> honors that original intent by adding a <code>systemd-bsod</code> component that generates a full-screen display of some error messages when a Linux system crashes.</p>\n\n<p>The <code>systemd-bsod</code> component is currently listed as \"experimental\" and \"subject to change.\" But the functionality is simple: any logged error message that reaches the <code>LOG_EMERG</code> level will be displayed full-screen to allow people to take a photo or write it down. Phoronix <a href=\"https://www.phoronix.com/news/systemd-255\">reports</a> that, as with BSODs in modern Windows, the Linux version will also generate a QR code to make it easier to look up information on your phone.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1989459#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1989459&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"f50073d6de6fd0aa732e15d74c6fcd3a971b45025fea602e6247dae75d6839cb","category":"Tech"}
