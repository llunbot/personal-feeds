Not the ones we <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2417766/apple-is-planning-a-mess-of-m4-mac-updates-this-fall-with-dramatic-changes-in-store.html\">might be getting later this year</a>–the models Apple is selling right now. Every MacBook is on sale right now for incredibly low prices and if you need one for school or just want to upgrade your old one, it’s a ridiculously good time to buy one. Here are the best prices we’ve found:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-MacBook-Air-13-3-inch-Laptop-Space-Gray-M1-Chip-8GB-RAM-256GB-storage/609040889\"><strong>13-inch MacBook Air (M1, 256GB, 8GB RAM): $649 ($50 off)</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Apple stopped selling the M1 MacBook Air earlier this year, Walmart picked up the remaining stock, slashing the price from $999 to $699. Now it’s even lower–$649, which is a great price for a computer that’s still quite good even four years after its release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B3BVWJ6Y/\"><strong>13-inch MacBook Air (M2, 256GB, 8GB RAM): $799 ($200 off)</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The M2 MacBook Air is already a great bargain at Apple’s usual $999 MSRP, but for under $800, it’s a downright steal. Its processor might be older, but it has the same design as the new M3 model and you can get it in the same four colors (midnight, silver, space gray, starlight) so it won’t feel a bit like last year’s model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CX23V2ZK/\"><strong>13-inch MacBook Air (M3, 256GB, 8GB RAM): $850 ($249 off)</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re used to seeing $100 discounts on the latest MacBooks, but $250 off the entry-level Air is truly bonkers. This is Apple’s newest MacBook Air model with an M3 processor that includes the ability to connect two external displays with the laptop lid closed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CX23GFMJ/\"><strong>15-inch MacBook Air (M3, 256GB, 8GB RAM): $1,050 ($249 off)</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you need a screen larger than 13 inches, the 15-inch MacBook Air is also on sale for $250 off. It’s identical to the 13-inch model in every way but the display, so the decision is easy–bigger or smaller.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CM5JV268/\"><strong>14-inch MacBook Pro (M3, 512GB, 8GB RAM): $1,399 ($300 off)</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The M3 MacBook Pro is Apple’s newest addition to the lineup, replacing the aging 13-inch model with a new entry-level laptop that offers the best parts of the Pro machines–the incredible Liquid Retina XDR display and expansive array of ports–with a low-end chip and less storage and memory. And at $1,399, you can’t beat it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CM5JV26D/\"><strong>14-inch MacBook Pro (M3 Pro, 512GB, 18GB RAM): $1,699 ($300 off)</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If speed is important, this step-up 14-inch model brings more speed and more memory and is also $300 off. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CM5BL45N/\"><strong>16-inch MacBook Pro (M3 Pro, 512GB, 18GB RAM): $1,999 ($500 off)</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cheapest 16-inch MacBook Pro usually costs $2,499, but this sale on Amazon brings the get-in price to under $2,000. You get a 16-inch screen and speedy M3 Pro processor, along with everything else that makes the MacBook Pro so great. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CM5J4X7W\"><strong>16-inch MacBook Pro (M3 Max, 1TB, 48GB RAM): $3,499 ($500 off)</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The absolute cream of the MacBook crop, this 16-inch MacBook Pro brings you more than enough power, storage, and memory for years of use.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"f2ade324b7f31330ae1b67cc874698bcc059ee9e800d8e1e2a268914d6fee040","category":"Apple"}
