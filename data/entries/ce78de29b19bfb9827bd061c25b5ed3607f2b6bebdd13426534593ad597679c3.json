In an act redolent with symbolism, Musk emerged from a facade built to resemble an actual building, then stepped into an aerodynamically styled two-seater that combined the shape of a Honda CR-Z coupe with the doors from a McLaren supercar. This is the Tesla Cybercab, proving <a href=\"https://insideevs.com/news/733673/tesla-robotaxi-cybercab-spy-shot/\">early leaks</a> right.</p>\n<p>Musk claimed to have \"50 fully autonomous cars here tonight,\" eliciting screams and cheers from the crowd of fans when he announced there were no pedals or steering wheel. The billionaire, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/elon-musk-political-donations-stephen-miller-desantis-39464294\">who has spent the past couple of years funneling millions</a> of dollars to far-right causes, told the attendees that he didn't want a dark future like his favorite film <em>Blade Runner</em>â€”\"except maybe that cool duster,\" he said, referring to the jacket of <a href=\"https://futurism.com/the-byte/elon-musk-main-character-blade-runner\">his favorite character</a>.</p>\n<p>Over the course of his presentation, Musk made many promises, variations of ones he's made many times before. \"Full self driving\" will enter an unsupervised mode that will allow passengers to fall asleep and wake up at their destinations. For people who think the cars are too expensive, they'll be worth five or 10 times as much because owners only use them an average of 10 hours a week.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/elon-musk-makes-bold-claims-about-tesla-robotaxi-in-hollywood-backlot/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/elon-musk-makes-bold-claims-about-tesla-robotaxi-in-hollywood-backlot/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
