The latest company to ram into an unforeseen AI speed bump is <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.figma.com/&amp;xcust=1-1-2385238-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Figma</a>, a design company for software developers. Figma thought their new Make Design tool that uses AI to create mockups was going to be a hit, but the company has pulled it for reasons that are, well, embarrassing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As pointed out on X, Make Design creates mockups that look exactly like Apple apps. In one example, a weather app submitted to Make Design resulted in a mockup that looks so much like Apple’s Weather app that it’s hard to tell the difference. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>Figma AI looks rather heavily trained on existing apps.<br /><br />This is a \"weather app\" using the new Make Designs feature and the results are basically Apple's Weather app (left). Tried three times, same results. <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://t.co/Ij20OpPCer&amp;xcust=1-1-2385238-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">https://t.co/Ij20OpPCer</a> <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://t.co/psFTV6daVD&amp;xcust=1-1-2385238-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">pic.twitter.com/psFTV6daVD</a></p>— Andy Allen (@asallen) <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://twitter.com/asallen/status/1807675146020454808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-2385238-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">July 1, 2024</a></blockquote>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s one thing to create a design that’s inspired by others, but in this case, it’s a downright rip-off. Figma’s excuse? It’s not their fault since they don’t use their own AI models. In an <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://x.com/zoink/status/1808045655082033483&amp;xcust=1-1-2385238-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">X thread</a>, Figma CEO Dylan Field said that Make Design “uses off-the-shelf LLMs, combined with design systems we commissioned to be used by these models.” When Figma CTO Kris Rasmussen was asked by <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/2/24190823/figma-ai-tool-apple-weather-app-copy&amp;xcust=1-1-2385238-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">The Verge</a> if Make Design was trained directly on Apple’s app designs, Rasmussen “couldn’t say for sure.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I have asked our team to temporarily disable the Make Design feature until we are confident we can stand behind its output,” Field <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://x.com/zoink/status/1808045664334668008&amp;xcust=1-1-2385238-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">posted</a> on X.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generative AI will eventually be a wonder tool, but this Figma incident is just another reminder that these tools can’t be used without a watchful eye. As <a href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/07/02/figma-disables-make-design&amp;xcust=1-1-2385238-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Daring Fireball’s John Gruber puts it</a>, “Generative AI is really good and truly useful when you say ‘Here’s a thing, help me tweak it or change it.’ But when you say ‘Make a new thing for me’ you’re effectively just getting a rip-off a lot–or perhaps most–of the time.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That watchful eye needs to be applied to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362804/apple-intelligence-faq-features-release-date-hardware-support.html\">Apple Intelligence</a>, too. While Apple is taking a cautious approach, users need to be vigilant that the tools are doing what they are supposed to without compromise.</p>\n\niOS</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"280737d14e38c651672ff8ed4a9b613526ea47057857ef5dead1a7190019510c","category":"Apple"}
