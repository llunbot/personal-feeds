Sure, it would probably take a bit of practice, but what these speedrunners are doing doesn't look <em>that difficult</em>, does it? How hard can it be to press a few buttons with good timing for a few minutes?</p>\n<p>After spending a few weeks with <em>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition</em>, I no longer think that way. The game's bite-size chunks of classic Nintendo games highlight the level of precision needed for even a few minutes of speedrunning perfection, not to mention the tedium of practicing the same in-game motions dozens of times to build up the needed muscle memory. In the process, I gained a newfound respect for the skill displayed by the best speedrunners and found a fresh way to experience some classic NES games that I felt I knew backward and forward.</p>\n<h2>Gotta go fast</h2>\n<p>While <em>Nintendo World Championships</em> draws its name from a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/01/after-100000-bid-3-more-ultra-rare-nintendo-world-championship-carts-appear/\">series</a> of <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/05/nintendo-brings-back-its-world-championships-competition-25-years-later/\">competitions</a> dating back to 1990, it draws its inspiration much more directly from the more recent rise of <a href=\"https://www.speedrun.com/\">the online speedrunning community</a>. Thus, the game's main single-player mode is named \"Speedrun,\" tasking players with putting up the fastest times in 150 mini-challenges spread across 13 different Nintendo-developed NES titles.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037726#p3\">Read 12 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2037726&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"aa71aa0fd1083c9e075d42f09cc06a7b8718dd4a90344888e192bda9112c13af","category":"Tech"}
