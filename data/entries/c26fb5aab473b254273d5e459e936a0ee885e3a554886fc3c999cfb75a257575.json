The Spring 2025 launch includes new MTB shorts, new Atlas shirts for MTB or gravel riding, more merino-blend Desperado shirts for women, and new colors for select road jerseys and bib shorts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>7mesh continues to implement eco-friendly production methods, like eliminating PFAS and PFC chemicals from their garments. They also make wide use of Bluesign-certified fabrics and recycled materials. 86% of the Spring collection is made primarily from recycled fabrics, and they aim to be at 95% for this fall’s clothing release.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All items featured below come in men’s and women’s versions and in sizes XS-XXL.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>7mesh Transition MTB Shorts:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/7mesh-Transition-short-on-bike.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/7mesh-Transition-short-on-bike.webp\" alt=\"7mesh Transition short, on bike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/7mesh-Transition-short-on-bike.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/7mesh-Transition-short-on-bike-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/7mesh-Transition-short-on-bike-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/7mesh-Transition-short-on-bike-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/7mesh-Transition-short-on-bike-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/7mesh-Transition-short-on-bike-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Transition shorts are a lightweight pair made for all-mountain riding. They are constructed from a DWR-treated water-repellent fabric, which offers four-way stretch. These shorts feature a new lightweight belt system that provides one full-size of waist adjustment. Small locking buckles cinch the waist down with minimal bulk.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/7mesh-Transition-short-womens.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/7mesh-Transition-short-womens.webp\" alt=\"7mesh Transition short, womens\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/7mesh-Transition-short-womens.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/7mesh-Transition-short-womens-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/7mesh-Transition-short-womens-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/7mesh-Transition-short-womens-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/7mesh-Transition-short-womens-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/7mesh-Transition-short-womens-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>*Photo: Roo Fowler</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For cargo, the Transition shorts include two zippered thigh pockets. Men’s models are cut with a 13” inseam, whereas the women’s models get a 12” inseam. The legs are cut to ensure ample room for lighter kneepads. One final touch is an underside gusset that keeps uncomfortable seams away from your saddle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Men’s and women’s color options are Black or Alpine.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Atlas Trail Shirt Collection:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/7mesh-Atlas-LS-shirt-woman-MTB.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/7mesh-Atlas-LS-shirt-woman-MTB.webp\" alt=\"7mesh Atlas LS shirt, woman MTB\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/7mesh-Atlas-LS-shirt-woman-MTB.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/7mesh-Atlas-LS-shirt-woman-MTB-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/7mesh-Atlas-LS-shirt-woman-MTB-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/7mesh-Atlas-LS-shirt-woman-MTB-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/7mesh-Atlas-LS-shirt-woman-MTB-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/7mesh-Atlas-LS-shirt-woman-MTB-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Another new offering for 2025 is the Atlas trail shirt line. Designed for MTB or gravel riders, these shirts are a light option for hot summer rides or can function as a base layer. Long-sleeve and short-sleeve versions are available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Atlas shirts are made from the same ultralight, fast-wicking, spandex-free fabric as 7mesh’s Atlas road jerseys. This fabric offers UPF20+ sun protection.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/7mesh-Atlas-SS-on-man.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/7mesh-Atlas-SS-on-man.webp\" alt=\"7mesh Atlas SS shirt, on man\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/7mesh-Atlas-SS-on-man.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/7mesh-Atlas-SS-on-man-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/7mesh-Atlas-SS-on-man-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/7mesh-Atlas-SS-on-man-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/7mesh-Atlas-SS-on-man-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/7mesh-Atlas-SS-on-man-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Atlas shirts offer an articulated shape with an extended reach and slim arms for a sleek fit.

This year they’ve added new short and long-sleeved women’s crew neck shirts to the lineup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The shirts are made from a 53% polyester, and 47% merino blend, making them ideal for a wide range of temperatures. Their fabric is also anti-microbial and designed to release soil and stay clean. The women’s Desperado shirts offer a trim fit. Their cut is articulated but also designed with off-bike comfort in mind. These jerseys feature very subtle styling and no pockets.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/7mesh-Desperado-shirts-gravel-riders.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/7mesh-Desperado-shirts-gravel-riders.webp\" alt=\"7mesh Desperado shirts, man and woman\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/7mesh-Desperado-shirts-gravel-riders.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/7mesh-Desperado-shirts-gravel-riders-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/7mesh-Desperado-shirts-gravel-riders-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/7mesh-Desperado-shirts-gravel-riders-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/7mesh-Desperado-shirts-gravel-riders-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/7mesh-Desperado-shirts-gravel-riders-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Color options for the women’s short-sleeved Desperado shirt are Frost, Black or Autumn Rose.
