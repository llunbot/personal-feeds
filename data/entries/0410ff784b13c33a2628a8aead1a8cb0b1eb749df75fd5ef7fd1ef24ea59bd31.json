Prices are really high — $500–1,000.</p>\n\n<p>The website edition is a fantastic experience — <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mike_matas/status/1645790693758242819\">thoughtfully designed</a>, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lorenb\">implemented with handcrafted care</a> — but I do wish the SJA had made the print edition available for retail purchase by the public. (I get it that the SJA doesn’t want to monetize this stuff, but they could sell these books and donate the proceeds to charities that Laurene Powell Jobs is involved with.)</p>\n\n<p>I’ve lucked my way into a copy, and it’s as nice an object as you’d expect. Books can be such lovely artifacts in hand, tactile experiences, and this is one. The whole thing — web and print editions alike — is exemplary work from LoveFrom.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/04/14/make-something-wonderful-ebay\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"0410ff784b13c33a2628a8aead1a8cb0b1eb749df75fd5ef7fd1ef24ea59bd31","category":"Tech"}
