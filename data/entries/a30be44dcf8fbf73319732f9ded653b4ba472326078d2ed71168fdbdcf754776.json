With a bulging shape quite different than what we see in most aero road wheels, Parcours says the FKT is fastest out on gravel roads with a 40mm tire. And that fastest tire is the latest Gravel King from Panaracer…</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Parcours FKT aero carbon gravel bike race wheels</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Parcours-FKT-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-race-wheels-pair.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Parcours-FKT-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-race-wheels-pair.jpg\" alt=\"Parcours FKT aero carbon gravel bike race wheels\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Parcours-FKT-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-race-wheels-pair.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Parcours-FKT-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-race-wheels-pair-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Parcours-FKT-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-race-wheels-pair-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Parcours-FKT-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-race-wheels-pair-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Parcours-FKT-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-race-wheels-pair-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Parcours-FKT-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-race-wheels-pair-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a rare feat to design a real aero gravel-specific wheelset. The few brands that have done so have opted for really wide rims at the bead to get as close to the width of the narrowest, most minimal tread gravel tires you’d expect for someone obsessed with optimizing their CdA. And then, they kind of admit that wider, kobbier tires will likely mean noticeably more drag. And building wider wheels inevitably means heavier, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Parcours seem to take a slightly different approach. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Parcours-FKT-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-race-wheels_wind-tunnel-test.jpg\"><img width=\"1350\" height=\"1620\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Parcours-FKT-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-race-wheels_wind-tunnel-test.jpg\" alt=\"Parcours FKT aero carbon gravel bike race wheels, in the NC wind tunnel\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Parcours-FKT-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-race-wheels_wind-tunnel-test.jpg 1350w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Parcours-FKT-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-race-wheels_wind-tunnel-test-250x300.jpg 250w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Parcours-FKT-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-race-wheels_wind-tunnel-test-100x120.jpg 100w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Parcours-FKT-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-race-wheels_wind-tunnel-test-768x922.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Parcours-FKT-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-race-wheels_wind-tunnel-test-1280x1536.jpg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They identified the new 40mm Panaracer <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/new-panaracer-gravelking-x1-gravel-tires/\" target=\"_blank\">Gravel King X1</a> tire as knobby-enough and wide enough that it would be a versatile all-rounder gravel tire you’d expect to show up at amateur and pro races alike. And then, they created what they call the optimal aero gravel bike race wheel for that tire. Interestingly, what likely makes that new Gravel King the ideal aero gravel tire are its low-height shoulder knobs. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Parcours-FKT-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-race-wheels_CFD.jpg\"><img width=\"1375\" height=\"663\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Parcours-FKT-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-race-wheels_CFD.jpg\" alt=\"Parcours FKT aero carbon gravel bike race wheels, in CFD\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Parcours-FKT-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-race-wheels_CFD.jpg 1375w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Parcours-FKT-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-race-wheels_CFD-297x143.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Parcours-FKT-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-race-wheels_CFD-120x58.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Parcours-FKT-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-race-wheels_CFD-768x370.jpg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Image/Parcours)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, surprisingly, Parcours CFD and then wind tunnel data, shows that even slightly narrower versions of this same gravel tire, are indeed slightly slower. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Unique aero gravel rim shape</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Parcours-FKT-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-race-wheels_rim-detail.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Parcours-FKT-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-race-wheels_rim-detail.jpg\" alt=\"Parcours FKT aero carbon gravel bike race wheels, rim shape detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Parcours-FKT-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-race-wheels_rim-detail.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Parcours-FKT-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-race-wheels_rim-detail-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Parcours-FKT-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-race-wheels_rim-detail-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Parcours-FKT-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-race-wheels_rim-detail-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Parcours-FKT-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-race-wheels_rim-detail-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Parcours-FKT-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-race-wheels_rim-detail-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Parcours-FKT-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-race-wheels_rim-detail-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But the real secret sauce seems to be the combination of an ideal gravel tire with a slightly unconventional aero profile. And the result, a virtual airfoil profile that smooths airflow from both sides.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Parcours isn’t sharing the FKT rim shape explicitly, a bit to protect the time and effort refining this aero gravel shape. But it’s pretty apparent that this is something quite different than most aero wheels, even if it’s just a few millimeters here or there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 47mm deep tubeless rim is wide at 27mm hookless internal. But it’s not exceptionally wide outside, measuring just 32mm external at the top of the tire bead.The widest point of the rim is 40mm wide (like the ideal tire) but that’s almost exactly in the middle of the overall rim depth. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Parcours-FKT-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-race-wheels_rim-to-tire-detail.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Parcours-FKT-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-race-wheels_rim-to-tire-detail.jpg\" alt=\"Parcours FKT aero carbon gravel bike race wheels, rim tire interface detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Parcours-FKT-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-race-wheels_rim-to-tire-detail.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Parcours-FKT-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-race-wheels_rim-to-tire-detail-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Parcours-FKT-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-race-wheels_rim-to-tire-detail-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Parcours-FKT-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-race-wheels_rim-to-tire-detail-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Parcours-FKT-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-race-wheels_rim-to-tire-detail-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Parcours-FKT-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-race-wheels_rim-to-tire-detail-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Parcours-FKT-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-race-wheels_rim-to-tire-detail-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Parcours description seems to me to suggest that this narrower ‘waist’ where the tire meets the rim just goes along to support some ‘good turbulence’ that keeps airflow attached to the wheel in the wind. Also, since the rim+tire shape combination is quite similar from either side, both the front half of the wheel with the tire cutting into the wind and the rear half of the wheel led by the rim, both have similarly good aerodynamic performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Parcours-FKT-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-race-wheels_tire-width-comparison-in-the-wind-tunnel.jpg\"><img width=\"1500\" height=\"965\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Parcours-FKT-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-race-wheels_tire-width-comparison-in-the-wind-tunnel.jpg\" alt=\"Parcours FKT aero carbon gravel bike race wheels, tire widt wind tunnel comparison\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Parcours-FKT-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-race-wheels_tire-width-comparison-in-the-wind-tunnel.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Parcours-FKT-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-race-wheels_tire-width-comparison-in-the-wind-tunnel-297x191.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Parcours-FKT-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-race-wheels_tire-width-comparison-in-the-wind-tunnel-120x77.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Parcours-FKT-aero-carbon-gravel-bike-race-wheels_tire-width-comparison-in-the-wind-tunnel-768x494.jpg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Image/Parcours)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Parcours data shows pretty consistent performance for a 35mm up to a 45mm tire. So it looks like you won’t suffer big penalties if you stray a bit from their fast 40mm tire setup.
