(Near the end of March Gurman cited “people with knowledge of the matter” in predicting that the devices would ship in <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2282952/ipad-pro-ipad-air-launch-shipping-may-2024.html\">that part of the year</a>.) But he also goes further than in previous articles, naming the specific week when the launch will “probably” happen, based on both information from sources and preparations at Apple retail stores.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Apple retail stores are preparing to receive new product marketing materials later that week,” Gurman explains. “That’s typically a sign that a new product release is incoming.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cynical readers may point out that they’ve heard this all before. The iPad range received no updates at all throughout the entire calendar year 2023, and were strongly tipped to get new models in March of this year; instead we got the M3 MacBook Air (via press release, rather than a proper media event) and nothing else. Gurman’s explanation for this is that the iPads were slated for a March release, but were delayed by manufacturing complications related to the “complex new iPad screens” that we will soon be getting to see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Gurman isn’t the only source pointing to an imminent launch. Late last week we covered the separate discovery of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2289217/ips-air-pro-new-model-numbers-bureau-of-indian-standards.html\">two batches of new iPads</a> on the Bureau of India Standards registration website–a total of four new models–which probably means a pair of Airs and a pair of Pros will be with us soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, in the new report Gurman says the Pro and Air will both be updated, and that we can also expect new versions of the Magic Keyboard and the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2286875/apple-pencil-3-squeeze-gesture-ipados-17-5-beta.html\">Apple Pencil</a>.
