{"title":"David Lynch Dies at 78","link":"https://www.rogerebert.com/tributes/have-a-great-day-david-lynch-1946-2025","date":1737076902000,"content":"\n<p>Brian Tallerico, writing for RogerEbert.com:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>David Lynch saw my dreams. As a teenager growing up in suburban\nAmerica in the ’80s, “Blue Velvet” and “Twin Peaks” hit like a\nbolt of lightning. Not only did they capture something about the\nsinister, surreal underbelly of life under the picket fences, but\nthey said something directly to anyone who thought they could be\nan artist: You don’t have to do what everyone else is doing.</p>\n\n<p>Lynch was one of those creative voices who found his own octave,\ndoing for film what people like David Bowie or Prince did for\nmusic, shattering expectations of what a piece of art could be.\nEven when his work missed the mark, which was rare, Lynch was\nnever anything less than a singular artist, a creator who never\nonce succumbed to the desire to please that derails so much\npotential in his industry. When people point to Lynch works like\n“<a href=\"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/mulholland-drive-2001\">Mulholland Dr.</a>” or “<a href=\"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-straight-story-1999\">The Straight Story</a>” or even\nthose of us who love “<a href=\"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/lost-highway-1997\">Lost Highway</a>,” it’s not just that\nspecific film that speaks to them — it’s the sense that the\npotential of the form is limitless as long as people like Lynch\nare involved. The entire art form was shifted by him and is now\nlessened by his absence. We owe it to him to burst through the\ndoors he opened. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Lynch’s fifth film, 1990’s “Wild at Heart” would be one of his\nmost divisive — it’s often pointed to as Lynch at his most\nexcessive — but it was what he did on television that same year\nthat rocked the entertainment world: “Twin Peaks.” I could write a\nbook about what “Twin Peaks” meant to a 15-year-old entertainment\njunkie. To summarize, it exploded the potential of the form.\nPeople who watch “Twin Peaks” over three decades later need to\nunderstand the TV landscape on which it landed. I’m not saying\nthere wasn’t quality TV in the ’80s, but there was less\nrisk-taking than in the 2020s, and watching the saga of Laura\nPalmer next to formulaic dramas or laugh-track-heavy sitcoms felt\nlike a true shock to the system.

Nothing exemplifies that more than <em>Twin Peaks</em> — I never stopped thinking that there wasn’t something there that I simply wasn’t getting, but I absolutely loved it. But now I realize that’s a big part of why I loved it. I don’t like to be confused but I do like it when it’s David Lynch confusing me. It’s still hard to believe that show was on commercial network TV.</p>\n\n<p>Like Kubrick, he was quick to embrace new technology as it became available and to see its artistic potential. He <a href=\"http://lostmag.matthewbrian.com/issue13/cinematography.php\">sung the praises of digital video</a> and declared himself done with film years ahead of the industry. Lynch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4wh_mc8hRE\">called bullshit</a> when he saw it. Also like Kubrick (whom Lynch, unsurprisingly, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/10/17/lynch\">named first when asked his favorite filmmakers</a>), Lynch’s later years were sparse with new work, but the work he delivered continued to elevate the art form. 2017’s 18-episode <em><a href=\"https://www.paramountplus.com/shows/twin-peaks-the-return/\">Twin Peaks: The Return</a></em> was so utterly Lynchian — a perfect capstone to a remarkable career.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/16/david-lynch-rip\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b32c33a4872bbb18ae6289baf899eb6440452a3703189a8279b425c44be4d4c7","category":"Tech"}
