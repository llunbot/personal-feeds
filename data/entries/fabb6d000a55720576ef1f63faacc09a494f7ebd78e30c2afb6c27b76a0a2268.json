It’s lower profile, so less exposure to the wind. And apparently laterally stiffer for better power transfer, without discomfort. But that also means that it needs its own proprietary seatpost clamping solution. For the Pogačar TT Tour Colnago TT1 time trial bike, the UAE team turned to ultralight carbon cockpit specialist Darimo, who’s been working with the team on customized carbon seatposts for several years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The end result is a saddle claiming to weigh just 140g with full EVA padding and pressure relief channel. And it claims to be significantly more aerodynamic than conventional saddles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://prologo.it/en\" target=\"_blank\">Prologo.it</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pogačar’s 2024 Tour de France-winning Colnago TT1 Disc time trial bike</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tadej-Pogacar-custom-2024-Tour-de-France-winning-Colnago-TT1-time-trial-bike_photo-SprintCyclingAgency_detail.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tadej-Pogacar-custom-2024-Tour-de-France-winning-Colnago-TT1-time-trial-bike_photo-SprintCyclingAgency_detail.jpg\" alt=\"Tadej Pogačar's tricked-out 2024 Tour de France winning Colnago TT1 time trial bike, up-close\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tadej-Pogacar-custom-2024-Tour-de-France-winning-Colnago-TT1-time-trial-bike_photo-SprintCyclingAgency_detail.jpg 1500w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tadej-Pogacar-custom-2024-Tour-de-France-winning-Colnago-TT1-time-trial-bike_photo-SprintCyclingAgency_detail-297x238.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tadej-Pogacar-custom-2024-Tour-de-France-winning-Colnago-TT1-time-trial-bike_photo-SprintCyclingAgency_detail-120x96.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tadej-Pogacar-custom-2024-Tour-de-France-winning-Colnago-TT1-time-trial-bike_photo-SprintCyclingAgency_detail-768x614.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Pogačar’s <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/colnago-tt1-disc-brake-time-trial-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">Colnago TT1 Disc</a> time trail bike itself is pretty much off-the-shelf, except for some tiny UAE decals and an upgrade to yellow Colnago logos.

Darimo Carbon was up to the task and created a fixed 0 offset cradle with a 2-bolt alloy head clamp to secure the new flat carbon rails.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the rails are a Prologo patented shape, it looks like it was relatively straightforward for Darimo to create a modified cradle to support them. That bodes well for a chance that other seatpost makers could add similar compatibility if Prologo decides to put these rails on more aero saddles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the front of Pogačar’s bike on the flatter early Individual Time Trail stage was this unmarked front wheel. With a rim depth of around 90-100mm or so, it is rumored to be a new ENVE SES 10 wheel. On the more hilly final ITT stage into Nice though, Pogačar stuck with the current 60mm deep wheel from his regular SES 6.7 road setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tadej-Pogacar-custom-2024-Tour-de-France-winning-Colnago-TT1-time-trial-bike_photo-SprintCyclingAgency_custom-aerobar-extensions.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tadej-Pogacar-custom-2024-Tour-de-France-winning-Colnago-TT1-time-trial-bike_photo-SprintCyclingAgency_custom-aerobar-extensions.jpg\" alt=\"Tadej Pogačar's tricked-out 2024 Tour de France winning Colnago TT1 time trial bike, custom aerobars\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tadej-Pogacar-custom-2024-Tour-de-France-winning-Colnago-TT1-time-trial-bike_photo-SprintCyclingAgency_custom-aerobar-extensions.jpg 1400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tadej-Pogacar-custom-2024-Tour-de-France-winning-Colnago-TT1-time-trial-bike_photo-SprintCyclingAgency_custom-aerobar-extensions-297x255.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tadej-Pogacar-custom-2024-Tour-de-France-winning-Colnago-TT1-time-trial-bike_photo-SprintCyclingAgency_custom-aerobar-extensions-120x103.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tadej-Pogacar-custom-2024-Tour-de-France-winning-Colnago-TT1-time-trial-bike_photo-SprintCyclingAgency_custom-aerobar-extensions-768x658.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Custom aerobar extensions shaped to the rider’s arms and optimized aero position are pretty much <em>de rigueur</em> for specialized time trialists and GC contenders these days. These narrow-set extensions are only minimally padded. But the deep wrap-around forearm cups and shaped handgrips should give Pogačar extra control while in his most aero tuck.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>And just sick custom gear</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tadej-Pogacar-custom-2024-Tour-de-France-winning-Colnago-TT1-time-trial-bike_photo-SprintCyclingAgency_AeroCoach-disc-wheel.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1400\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tadej-Pogacar-custom-2024-Tour-de-France-winning-Colnago-TT1-time-trial-bike_photo-SprintCyclingAgency_AeroCoach-disc-wheel.jpg\" alt=\"Tadej Pogačar's tricked-out 2024 Tour de France winning Colnago TT1 time trial bike, AeroCoach wheel\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tadej-Pogacar-custom-2024-Tour-de-France-winning-Colnago-TT1-time-trial-bike_photo-SprintCyclingAgency_AeroCoach-disc-wheel.jpg 1400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tadej-Pogacar-custom-2024-Tour-de-France-winning-Colnago-TT1-time-trial-bike_photo-SprintCyclingAgency_AeroCoach-disc-wheel-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tadej-Pogacar-custom-2024-Tour-de-France-winning-Colnago-TT1-time-trial-bike_photo-SprintCyclingAgency_AeroCoach-disc-wheel-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tadej-Pogacar-custom-2024-Tour-de-France-winning-Colnago-TT1-time-trial-bike_photo-SprintCyclingAgency_AeroCoach-disc-wheel-768x768.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tadej-Pogacar-custom-2024-Tour-de-France-winning-Colnago-TT1-time-trial-bike_photo-SprintCyclingAgency_carbon-ti-1x.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1400\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tadej-Pogacar-custom-2024-Tour-de-France-winning-Colnago-TT1-time-trial-bike_photo-SprintCyclingAgency_carbon-ti-1x.jpg\" alt=\"Tadej Pogačar's tricked-out 2024 Tour de France winning Colnago TT1 time trial bike, photo by SprintCyclingAgency, carbo-ti chainrings\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tadej-Pogacar-custom-2024-Tour-de-France-winning-Colnago-TT1-time-trial-bike_photo-SprintCyclingAgency_carbon-ti-1x.jpg 1400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tadej-Pogacar-custom-2024-Tour-de-France-winning-Colnago-TT1-time-trial-bike_photo-SprintCyclingAgency_carbon-ti-1x-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tadej-Pogacar-custom-2024-Tour-de-France-winning-Colnago-TT1-time-trial-bike_photo-SprintCyclingAgency_carbon-ti-1x-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Tadej-Pogacar-custom-2024-Tour-de-France-winning-Colnago-TT1-time-trial-bike_photo-SprintCyclingAgency_carbon-ti-1x-768x768.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Pogačar’s back wheel is the uniquely stepped and wavy AeroCoach Aeox Orbit disc wheel, which also claims to be the lightest tubeless disc TT wheel at just 980g (although Vision claims one <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/prototype-lightest-ever-vision-metron-tfw-tubeless-disc-wheel-nabs-paris-nice-tt-win/\">a few grams lighter</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Drivetrain is similar to what we saw on Pogi’s yellow jersey-winning <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/tadej-pogacar-tour-winning-colnago-v4rs-road-bike-gets-nice-yellow-jersey-makeover/\" target=\"_blank\">V4Rs road bikes</a> yesterday.
