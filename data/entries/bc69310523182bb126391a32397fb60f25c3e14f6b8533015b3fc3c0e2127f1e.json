While that’s also true at Taipei Cycle, first and foremost the show is about networking and making deals, about bike brands meeting with suppliers and manufacturers.</p>\n<p>More so than just about any category, OEM sunglass manufacturers abound at Taipei Cycle. I barely scratched the surface on day one and still found 10, with likely more I simply didn’t notice or have yet to stumble across.</p>\n<p>These are the companies making sunglasses for other brands, and they’ve got a lot of styles in their catalogues. Here are my favorites from the lot. A few companies didn’t allow photos of their products, so needless to say, there are some gems missing from this list.</p>\n<h2>This “blue camouflage” number from DaySun</h2>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/8505663-1340x892.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"892\" /></figure>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/8505664-1340x892.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"892\" /></figure>\n<p>It seems more blue floral to me than camouflage, but either way, I’m in.</p>\n<h2>I’m just going to say this Greatland model looks familiar and leave it at that.<span> </span></h2>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/8505710-1340x892.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"892\" /></figure>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/8505713-1340x892.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"892\" /></figure>\n<h2>Greatland red and blue splatter paint.</h2>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/8505714-1340x892.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"892\" /></figure>\n<p>The official shades of Jackson Pollock on a bike.</p>\n<h2>Hsin Jiang moto sunglasses</h2>\n<figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.cyclingtips.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/8505717-1340x892.jpg?width=730\" alt width=\"1340\" height=\"892\" /></figure>\n<p>A company representative told me these were for riding motos.

Just yes. To be fair, I’m not exactly sure these are meant for cycling, but if you wear any sunglasses while riding that makes them cycling sunglasses, no?</p>","author":"Will Tracy","siteTitle":"CyclingTips","siteHash":"30feca30fb3902119bf2da6559e7337232527b61c9abe0a00f5d7543c6aa6c84","entryHash":"bc69310523182bb126391a32397fb60f25c3e14f6b8533015b3fc3c0e2127f1e","category":"Cycling"}
