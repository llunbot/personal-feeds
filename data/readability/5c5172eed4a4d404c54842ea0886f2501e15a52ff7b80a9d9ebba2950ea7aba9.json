That wide range is possible due to the adjustable saddle height and effective reach. It looks like you’re able to adjust the distance the handlebars are away from the saddle, as well as bar height, but not independently.&nbsp;</p><h3>Pricing &amp; Availability</h3><p>The availability of the CrownCruiser eBike will be subject to the success of its Indiegogo Crowdfunding Campaign. Backing the project with a donation of $3,150 USD (50% off the expected retail price) secures you the CrownCruiser with a 250W motor. They are also offering a payment plan whereby, if you are unable to pay the full cost upfront, you have the option to pledge $699 USD initially, followed by two installments of $1,300 USD thereafter.
