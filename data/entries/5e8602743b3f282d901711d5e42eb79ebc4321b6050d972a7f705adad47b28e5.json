However, the company stopped short of saying it would reveal details about individual cases, and it did not make any commitment to reopen its handling of cases from previous years.</p>\n<p>The shareholder revolt followed years of complaints from some workers that the company had brushed pervasive claims of harassment under the carpet. Arjuna Capital, which submitted the shareholder proposal challenging management, said Microsoft’s human resources department upheld only one claim against the group out of a total of 238 that were included in a class-action lawsuit alleging discrimination and harassment in 2012.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1817098#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1817098&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Financial Times","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5e8602743b3f282d901711d5e42eb79ebc4321b6050d972a7f705adad47b28e5","category":"Tech"}
