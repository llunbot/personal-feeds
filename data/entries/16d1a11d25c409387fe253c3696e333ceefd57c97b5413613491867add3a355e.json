{"title":"Should Apple Cease Advertising on Twitter?","link":"https://technovia.co.uk/2023/09/04/its-long-past.html","date":1693946377000,"content":"\n<p>Ian Betteridge:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple is very good at taking a stand when it’s easy. It refused to\ncarry various small right-wing social platforms on its App Store,\nbecause the content moderation policies weren’t up to scratch.\nMeanwhile, Twitter gets a pass despite having no practical control\nover hate speech and an owner who actively encourages it.</p>\n\n<p>Should we be considering boycotting Apple and other companies that\nadvertise on Twitter? Let’s frame that another way: if you found\nout that a company was actively funding hate speech, would you\nwant to buy products from them?</p>\n\n<p>I know I wouldn’t.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Betteridge is without question correct that Apple is in a difficult position here. If you think it would be easy, recall last year, when Apple had drawn Musk’s ire over the App Store’s policies. <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2022/11/30/cook-musk-apple-park\">As I wrote then</a>, “Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.”</p>\n\n<p>But it’s hard to imagine any other ad venue — website, billboard, magazine, TV channel — where Apple would run ads that run alongside <a href=\"https://twitter.com/k_pendergrast/status/1697385443040653479\">ads like this one</a>. No need for a statement. Just cease running ads on Twitter/X, and stop paying for <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2023/08/29/hashmoji-iphone-15-apple-event/\">these promotional “hashflags”</a>. When inevitably asked why, respond how Apple responds best: no comment.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/09/05/betteridge-apple-twitter\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"16d1a11d25c409387fe253c3696e333ceefd57c97b5413613491867add3a355e","category":"Tech"}
