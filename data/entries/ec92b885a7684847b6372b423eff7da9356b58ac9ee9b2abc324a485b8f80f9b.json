Snell said that it was his understanding that there have been unspecified adjustments to the display hardware in the ‌iPad mini 7‌ that should make a difference when it comes to jelly scrolling.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSnell didn't provide a source, but his information likely comes directly from Apple. There is only an \"implication\" that the changes were to fix jelly scrolling, however, and Snell made it clear that because no one has seen the ‌iPad mini 7‌ as of yet, there's no concrete information. \"My guess is it's different,\" he said. \"And maybe better. And maybe gone.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nJelly scrolling is a display issue that causes text or images on one side of the display to be out of sync with the other side. The result is text or images that can appear to be tilted downward because of a screen refresh rate mismatch, and for some people, once you've noticed the problem, it's hard to ignore.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌iPad mini‌ 6 owners started <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/27/ipad-mini-6-jelly-scroll-issue-vertical/\">noticing jelly scrolling</a> in portrait mode on the device shortly after it launched in 2021. Some users were not bothered by the effect, while others said that it was irritating to look at and could cause eye strain.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nMost if not all ‌iPad mini‌ 6 units seemed to be impacted, but the degree of impact varied from user to user due to different tolerances for screen tearing. The effect likely impacted prior iPads, but it seemed to be more noticeable in the ‌iPad mini‌ 6.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌iPad mini 7‌ rumors suggested that Apple would <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/13/jelly-scrolling-reduced-on-ipad-mini-7/\">rotate the screen assembly</a> in order to cut down on jelly scrolling, so it's possible Apple has done something like that to minimize the issue in the seventh-generation model.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌iPad mini 7‌ is available for pre-order and is set to launch on Wednesday, October 23. Once the tablet is available, users will be able to see for themselves whether jelly scrolling has been addressed, and an iFixit teardown will provide insight into any hardware changes. We'll also likely get reviews before the ‌iPad mini 7‌ models launch, so we could have a more firm answer on the jelly scrolling question in a matter of days.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad-mini/\">iPad mini</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPad_Mini\">iPad Mini (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipad.137\">iPad</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/18/ipad-mini-7-jelly-scrolling/\">iPad Mini 7 Has Display Hardware Changes That Likely Fix Jelly Scrolling</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/ipad-mini-7-has-display-hardware-changes-that-likely-fix-jelly-scrolling.2440434/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ec92b885a7684847b6372b423eff7da9356b58ac9ee9b2abc324a485b8f80f9b","category":"Apple"}
