JAMA Neurology 2025</a>\n      \n<p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed white matter lesions around her lateral ventricles, large cavities in the center of the brain filled with cerebrospinal fluid that, from the side, are C-shaped. The type of MRI used, a FLAIR MRI, is used to more easily detect lesions, and the fluid-filled lateral ventricles appear as dark, curved spaces in the center. Doctors could see white blotches and smears around those dark spaces, indicating lesions. After doing a spinal tap and running tests on her cerebral spinal fluid, they suspected she might have a bacterial infection in her brain. So they treated her with an antibiotic and a fever reducer.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/this-is-what-it-looks-like-when-parasitic-worms-directly-invade-your-brain/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/health/2025/03/this-is-what-it-looks-like-when-parasitic-worms-directly-invade-your-brain/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b754f46499205ed3f556d3bd18a350ffe2aca9c7a1df2192803e52fcd4c2d7db","category":"Tech"}
