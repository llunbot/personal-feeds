Priced below market rate at $530, we’d love to see a Radavist reader walk away with a great camera system!<span></span></p>\n<p><em>“This Fuji GW690III is one of the best rangefinders I’ve ever had… and with honkin’ huge 6×9 frame size, this analog beauty is great for whatever you can throw at it. Takes 120 film, has a sharp &amp; fast 90mm f3.5 lens with a leaf shutter. It’s relatively lightweight and super reliable. I’ve used it as my go-to travel camera and taken good care of it. If you have any questions about it, just reach out! Also, I included the shipping cost in the price.”</em></p>\n<p>Check it out at the <a href=\"https://radbazaar.theradavist.com/listing/ontl7vjlwXT5cTCDBH4E?category=photography&amp;subcategory=undefined\" target=\"_blank\">Rad Bazaar</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/rad-bazaar-finds-fuji-gw690iii/\">Rad Bazaar Finds: Fuji GW690III</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"John Watson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"192450229a757af2c6e1624d1750210386468ac2152d2469f97bfa1ffaa4b18e","category":"Cycling"}
