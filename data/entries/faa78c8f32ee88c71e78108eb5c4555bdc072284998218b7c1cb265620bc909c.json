Advanced tech has trickled down to all but its entry-level models.</p>\n<p>So what does the Garmin Edge range offer and which head unit is right for you?</p>\n<h2>What can a Garmin GPS computer do?</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Bigger has generally meant better for Edge devices.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Warren Rossiter / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>At a minimum, a bike computer will enable you to track where you’ve been, how far and how fast. It will usually have a GPS chip that keeps track of your position, although some budget models will pair with a smartphone and use that device’s GPS data. </span></p>\n<p><span>All Garmin Edge computers have their own GPS chips though, and get position data from the GLONASS, Galileo and standard GPS satellite constellations.</span></p>\n<p><span>That basic data can be augmented with a raft of extras. </span></p>\n<p><span>Most computers will give you mapping, enabling you to plan and follow a route, with turn-by-turn navigation. Their ability to re-route if you willingly or unwillingly go off track has greatly improved. </span><span>Cheaper models have just a breadcrumb trail that doesn’t superimpose your route on a base map. </span></p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> You can pair devices such as power meters, heart rate monitors and cadence sensors with a bike computer.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Simon Bromley</i></span></div>\n<p><span>You can also pair your computer wirelessly with peripheral devices such as a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/how-to-choose-a-heart-rate-monitor/\">heart rate monitor</a> strap, speed and cadence sensors and a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-power-meters/\">power meter</a> to get more information on your performance.</span></p>\n<p><span>Entry-level Edge models are controlled using buttons on the sides of the unit, whereas more expensive ones include a touchscreen. The screen gets larger as you move up the range too, and goes from black-and-white to a colour display.</span></p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Varia RCT715 is a rear light, rear safety camera and rear radar in one.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Warren Rossiter / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>All Garmin Edge computers enable you to control <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/garmin-varia-rct715/\">Garmin’s Varia front and rear lights</a>, with the rear-facing units using radar to alert you via your computer of approaching vehicles. Most of the range can also be used to control the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/accessories/helmet-cams/garmin-virb-ultra-30-action-camera-review/\">Garmin VIRB</a> action camera.</span></p>\n<p><span>The computers link to the Garmin Connect web or smartphone app, where you can view and analyse your data and plan routes. </span></p>\n<p><span>The <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-cycling-apps/\">smartphone app</a> enables you to pair your Edge to your mobile, and they will ‘talk’ to one another, with the computer showing you notifications of incoming calls and texts. The app can also share your position and other metrics with other riders and family at home. </span></p>\n<p><span>Free-to-download apps in Connect IQ store enable you to personalise your Edge with, for example, a wind direction indicator. </span></p>\n<h2>Garmin Edge range explained</h2>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Features such as the Ride Summary are now available on cheaper Garmins.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Warren Rossiter / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p><span>The Garmin Edge range starts with the basic models that feature a simple black-and-white screen. Moving up the range gets you increasingly larger devices with larger-format colour touchscreens and more training data available. That said, even the base models have a lot of Garmin’s features included.</span></p>\n<p><span>As well as offering standalone computers, Garmin also sells bundles for each Edge model. </span></p>\n<p><span>These package up the Edge computer with other kit, such as a sensor bundle, which adds a heart rate monitor strap, and speed and cadence sensors. </span></p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> A silicone case, secure mount and lanyard are advisable for off-roading.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Sven Martin</i></span></div>\n<p><span>Opt for the mountain bike bundle and you get an off-road-specific mount, a silicone case for the computer and a remote, so you can operate it without taking your hands off the bars.</span></p>\n<p><span>Garmin has recently done some housekeeping on its Edge range, discontinuing some older longstanding models, so you might not see some familiar names below. </span></p>\n<p><span>We’ll start with the simplest, most affordable Garmin Edge computers, and work up from there.</span></p>\n<h2>Current Garmin Edge models</h2>\n<h3>Garmin Edge 130 Plus</h3>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt title /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The diminutive Edge 130 Plus still graces WorldTour handlebars.</span></figcaption><span> <i>George Scott / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<ul><li><strong>Best for:</strong> Riders who want a simple GPS with plenty of features, including mountain bike metrics</li>\n</ul><p>The Garmin Edge 130 Plus has an accelerometer that allows the device to include mountain biking metrics and incident detection.
