The good news is that Capcom is running a promotional discount of 75% off the usual price for a limited time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFrom now until January 8, the base game can be purchased for $9.99, while all in-game rewards can be unlocked for $1.99. After that date, the game will be sold for $39.99.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<em>Resident Evil 2</em> requires an iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 16 series model to run, along with iPads and Macs equipped with M1 chips or later. The game supports cross-progression across supported Apple devices, so players can continue their progress whether playing on iPhone, iPad, or Mac. It's also a universal purchase, meaning a single purchase grants access across all compatible Apple devices.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCapcom says the app is approximately 31GB in size, and that the installation process requires the target drive to have at least twice the size of the app in storage space available. An internet connection is also required to start the game. <em>Resident Evil 2</em> can be downloaded from the App Store.
