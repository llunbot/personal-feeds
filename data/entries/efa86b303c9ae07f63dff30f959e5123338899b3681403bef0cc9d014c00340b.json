Some folks have a bad habit of losing or breaking them, and not everyone has the budget to blow hundreds on specific eyewear for riding. Tifosi is a brand that seeks to offer performance at affordable prices, and they’ve just announced a new Vogel XC model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Vogel XC is a new addition to Tifosi’s Vogel sunglass series. Designed for smaller faces, this model offers a smaller overall fit than many of today’s large-fitting sunglasses. The Vogel XC’s are inexpensive sunglasses, but they’re built with shatterproof lenses and the same lightweight materials used by many luxury level brands.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tifosi Vogel XC Sunglasses – Construction:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tifosi-Vogel-XC-sunglasses-black-violet-right-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"551\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tifosi-Vogel-XC-sunglasses-black-violet-right-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Tifosi Vogel XC sunglasses, black, violet, right\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tifosi-Vogel-XC-sunglasses-black-violet-right-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tifosi-Vogel-XC-sunglasses-black-violet-right-297x136.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tifosi-Vogel-XC-sunglasses-black-violet-right-120x55.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tifosi-Vogel-XC-sunglasses-black-violet-right-768x353.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Vogel XC sunglasses are constructed with Grilamid TR-90 frames, and they offer a lightweight rimless design. This model was designed to provide a streamlined fit, but without sacrificing full eye coverage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>“We recognized that not everyone prefers oversized eyewear, and some athletes value a featherweight option that doesn’t compromise on performance or aesthetics,”</em> says Joe Earley, Owner of Tifosi Optics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Vogel XCs offer a compact shield style shape, with their lenses measuring 127.5mm wide and 51mm tall. The arms are 141mm long, and the nose bridge is 15.5mm wide.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tifosi-Vogel-XC-sunglasses-black-smoke-left-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tifosi-Vogel-XC-sunglasses-black-smoke-left-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Tifosi Vogel XC sunglasses, black, smoke, left\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tifosi-Vogel-XC-sunglasses-black-smoke-left-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tifosi-Vogel-XC-sunglasses-black-smoke-left-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tifosi-Vogel-XC-sunglasses-black-smoke-left-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tifosi-Vogel-XC-sunglasses-black-smoke-left-768x432.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One nice feature included on the affordably priced Vogel XCs are shatterproof and scratch resistant polycarbonate lenses. The lenses on the new Vogel XCs feature vents at the bottom to combat condensation. They are also constructed with a shallow lens-cut shape to ensure an ideal fit for smaller faces.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tifosi-Vogel-XC-sunglasses-AC-Red-lens-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tifosi-Vogel-XC-sunglasses-AC-Red-lens-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Tifosi Vogel XC sunglasses, Red AC lens\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tifosi-Vogel-XC-sunglasses-AC-Red-lens-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tifosi-Vogel-XC-sunglasses-AC-Red-lens-297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tifosi-Vogel-XC-sunglasses-AC-Red-lens-120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tifosi-Vogel-XC-sunglasses-AC-Red-lens-768x432.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Tifosi is offering six lens options, including their AC red lens. AC means ‘all conditions’, as this lens allows 39% light transmission and improves contrast in overcast conditions. This lens could be an ideal choice for mountain biking in forested areas or road riding on dimmer days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you work up a sweat, the Vogel XC’s hydrophilic nose pads and temples should keep them secure and properly positioned. Weight for the Vogel XC sunglasses is listed at just 24g. For the record, that’s just 2g more than the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/poc-elicit-3d-printed-titanium-sunglasses/\">wild 3D-printed titanium sunglasses from POC</a> that sold for $400. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Vogel XC Model Options:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tifosi-Vogel-XC-sunglasses-pink-left-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tifosi-Vogel-XC-sunglasses-pink-left-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Tifosi Vogel XC sunglasses, pink, left\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tifosi-Vogel-XC-sunglasses-pink-left-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tifosi-Vogel-XC-sunglasses-pink-left-297x132.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tifosi-Vogel-XC-sunglasses-pink-left-120x53.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tifosi-Vogel-XC-sunglasses-pink-left-768x341.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Vogel XC sunglasses are available in the following frame/lens combinations:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Blackout/Smoke</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Blackout/AC Red</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Crystal Clear/Clear</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Crystal Pink/Pink Mirror</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Matte Black/Violet Mirror</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Satin Clear/Sky Blue Mirror</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pricing and Availability:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tifosi-Vogel-XC-sunglasses-clear-clear-right-jpg.webp\"><img width=\"1200\" height=\"523\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tifosi-Vogel-XC-sunglasses-clear-clear-right-jpg.webp\" alt=\"Tifosi Vogel XC sunglasses, clear, right\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tifosi-Vogel-XC-sunglasses-clear-clear-right-jpg.webp 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tifosi-Vogel-XC-sunglasses-clear-clear-right-297x129.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tifosi-Vogel-XC-sunglasses-clear-clear-right-120x52.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Tifosi-Vogel-XC-sunglasses-clear-clear-right-768x335.webp 768w\" /></a><figcaption>*Images c.
