Microsoft said the vulnerability—in a class known as a \"use after free\"—was located in AFD.sys, the binary file for what’s known as the ancillary function driver and the kernel entry point for the Winsock API. Microsoft warned that the zero-day could be exploited to give attackers system privileges, the maximum system rights available in Windows and a required status for executing untrusted code.</p>\n<h2>Lazarus gets access to the Windows kernel</h2>\n<p>Microsoft warned at the time that the vulnerability was being actively exploited but provided no details about who was behind the attacks or what their ultimate objective was. On Monday, researchers with Gen—the security firm that discovered the attacks and reported them privately to Microsoft—said the threat actors were part of Lazarus, the name researchers use to track a hacking outfit backed by the North Korean government.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044100#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2044100&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1b56cc11774cdd7e6e86b4d88fa0b8b8c916abfd7d4aa01cb0330eafbc8e1697","category":"Tech"}
