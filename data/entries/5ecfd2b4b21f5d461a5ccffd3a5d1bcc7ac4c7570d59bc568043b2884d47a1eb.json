Its wide range of power stations are ideal for remote workers, campers and holiday makers, providing a reliable source of power for when you’re off the grid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For cyclists in particular, the BLUETTI range includes options such as the EB3A, which is portable enough to carry with you on bikepacking adventures. And with the rise of e-bikes, carrying a portable source of power with you is the perfect antidote to range anxiety, allowing you to lean on the motor’s electrical assistance with the peace of mind that you can recharge on the go without needing access to a power outlet when the battery runs low. Regardless of your e-bike’s existing battery capacity, a BLUETTI portable power station is the perfect range extender.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether it’s a bikepacking trip, a campervan adventure, a picnic or a more extended trip off the grid, BLUETTI has the power solution to suit. Let’s take a closer look at some of the products it offers:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>BLUETTI EB3A portable power station</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/eb3a-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/eb3a-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/eb3a-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/eb3a-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/eb3a-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/eb3a-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/eb3a-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/eb3a-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/eb3a-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/eb3a-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/eb3a-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>While most of BLUETTI’s portable power stations are compact enough to tuck away in the boot of a car or in a campervan, the EB3A is genuinely capable of being carried on a bike as part of your bikepacking kit – especially if you have the power assistance of an electric motor to offset the weight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not that it’s heavy – at 4.6kg it’s hardly a lead weight, and its dimensions of 255 x 180 x 183mm means it won’t take up too much space on a rack either. In return it has a 268Wh capacity, and thanks to the 600W AC pure sine wave inverter with 1,200W surge, you can power anything up to a small refrigerator, with eight outlets on board so you can charge multiple devices at once.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>• <strong><a href=\"https://bluettipower.co.uk/products/bluetti-eb3a-portable-power-station\" target=\"_blank\">Buy the Bluetti EB3A portable power station for £189 (save £60)</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>BLUETTI AC70 portable power station</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/ac70-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/ac70-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/ac70-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/ac70-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/ac70-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/ac70-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/ac70-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/ac70-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/ac70-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/ac70.jpg 1350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The BLUETTI AC70 provides the ideal balance between power and portability for anyone who needs reliable power on the go.

The unit itself charges to 80% capacity in just 45 minutes, while it can handle high-power resistive loads up to 2,000W to charge energy-intensive devices with ease thanks to the Power Lifting Mode controlled via the BLUETTI app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>• <a href=\"https://bluettipower.co.uk/products/ac70-portable-power-station\" target=\"_blank\">Buy the Bluetti AC70 portable power station for £449 (save £200)</a></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>BLUETTI AC180 portable power station</h2>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/ac180-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/ac180-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/ac180-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/ac180-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/ac180-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/ac180-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/ac180-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/ac180-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/ac180-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/11/ac180.jpg 1350w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>For a truly flexible power solution for travellers, remote workers or camping adventurers, look no further than the BLUETTI AC180.
