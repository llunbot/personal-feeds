Although only one of the tech giants has been taken to court for copying the other’s iconic design, the two parties have been <em>inspiring</em> each other for years. Notably, Apple tends to be more subtle with its reproduction. Samsung, on the other hand, well… just blatantly ripped off over a dozen Apple features and designs during its <a href=\"https://www.techadvisor.com/article/2583341/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review.html\">Galaxy S25</a> launch.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Appropriated intelligence</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s no secret that Apple is lagging behind in the artificial intelligence race. While the latest Android phones are now equipped with advanced AI tools, the Apple Intelligence rollout has been drawn out, and its tools, comparatively, are somewhat basic. Nevertheless, the iPhone’s AI suite has clearly caught Samsung’s attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple Intelligence offers built-in <strong><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2556848/how-to-apple-intelligence-siri-chatgpt-iphone.html\">ChatGPT integration</a></strong> with others, including Google Gemini, coming down the road. One of Samsung’s marquee AI features is that its AI infrastructure is designed to accommodate third-party chatbots, starting with Google Gemini over its own Bixby AI assistant.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Samsung-Galaxy-S25-series-launch-29.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Samsung Galaxy S25 series launch 29\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Samsung-Galaxy-S25-series-launch-29.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2500w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Samsung-Galaxy-S25-series-launch-29.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Samsung-Galaxy-S25-series-launch-29.jpg?resize=768%2C431&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Samsung-Galaxy-S25-series-launch-29.jpg?resize=1200%2C673&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Samsung-Galaxy-S25-series-launch-29.jpg?resize=1536%2C862&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Samsung-Galaxy-S25-series-launch-29.jpg?resize=2048%2C1149&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Samsung-Galaxy-S25-series-launch-29.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Samsung-Galaxy-S25-series-launch-29.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"673\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>The Galaxy S25 has borrowed more than a few Apple Intelligence features.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Luke Baker / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>When you trigger Gemini, you get a text box featuring a <strong>colorful glowing border</strong>—just like Siri. Samsung also showed off how the chatbot supports both text and voice input. Meanwhile, selecting text brings up a UI that is almost identical to Apple’s <strong>Writing Tools</strong>, letting users proofread the selection, turn it into a table, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Samsung then announced how its Phone app can now <strong>record, transcribe, and summarize calls</strong>, a perk familiar to iOS 18 users. Similarly, Galaxy S25 users will get to <strong>search for photos</strong> using natural language, <strong>summarize online articles</strong>, and <strong>turn photos into illustrations</strong>— Image Playground style.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the Galaxy S25 series will offer cross-app actions, letting AI agents search for and fetch information from multiple sources just like <strong>Siri App Intents</strong>. The approach similarly highlights the company’s commitment to users’ privacy, offering a mode that limits cloud processing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>That’s One familiar UI</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond AI-centric perks, Samsung previewed One UI 7 during the Galaxy S25 keynote. Perhaps this OS version’s signature feature is the <strong>Now Bar</strong>, which surfaces ongoing events—or, one could say, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1360554/ios-16-1-live-activities-dynamic-island-apps.html\"><strong>Live Activities</strong></a>. Like its iOS counterpart, it’ll not-so-originally highlight real-time sports scores, timers, and other similar tasks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Samsung then proceeded to boast about the S25’s camera features, which include a few tricks your iPhone learned months ago. Notably, Galaxy users will finally get to <strong>record log video</strong> and <strong>edit audio</strong> to focus on the speaker’s voice or their surroundings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company even revealed its own take on Apple’s second-gen <strong>Photographic Styles</strong>, which lets our fellow green-bubbled folks apply advanced filters to their shots and control their tones.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Samsung-Galaxy-S25-series-launch-11.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Samsung Galaxy S25 series launch 11\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Samsung-Galaxy-S25-series-launch-11.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2500w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Samsung-Galaxy-S25-series-launch-11.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Samsung-Galaxy-S25-series-launch-11.jpg?resize=768%2C433&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Samsung-Galaxy-S25-series-launch-11.jpg?resize=1200%2C676&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Samsung-Galaxy-S25-series-launch-11.jpg?resize=1536%2C866&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Samsung-Galaxy-S25-series-launch-11.jpg?resize=2048%2C1154&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Samsung-Galaxy-S25-series-launch-11.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Samsung-Galaxy-S25-series-launch-11.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"676\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>That’s not an iPhone—it’s the “new” Galaxy S25.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Luke Baker / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Uniform design</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While the similarities between the two operating systems’ features may be more prominent, Apple-like hardware also made it to Samsung’s party. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, like the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2469098/iphone-16-pro-and-iphone-16-pro-max-review.html\">iPhone 16 Pro</a>, now offers <strong>flat edges and rounded corners</strong>. For those unfamiliar, the flagship’s Galaxy predecessors had sharp corners and a curved body. Samsung, like Apple, also continues to preserve <strong>titanium</strong> for its highest-end model, while the entry-level ones settle for aluminum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A slim <strong><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2393967/iphone-17-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">iPhone 17 Air</a></strong> has been rumored for a September 2025 debut for some time. Samsung beat Apple to the punch, teasing a similar concept dubbed the <a href=\"https://www.techadvisor.com/article/2586390/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge.html\">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>. Like the rumored iPhone 17 Air, the S25 Edge will miss out on certain premium components, like a triple camera system, in favor of a sleeker design that prioritizes aesthetics over performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Samsung then showed media personnel its all-new, Qi2-compatible protective covers, which are quite literally identical to Apple’s transparent <strong>MagSafe cases</strong>. While the magnets’ shape and alignment are dictated by the wireless charging standard, Samsung could’ve at least opted for an original color and design that better aligns with its Galaxy design language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last but not least, journalists also got to check out Samsung’s upcoming <a href=\"https://www.techadvisor.com/article/2586243/samsung-project-moohan-android-xr-headset-confirmed.html\">Project Moohan VR headset</a>, which looks like a cheaper mockup of the <strong>Apple Vision Pro</strong>. If you accidentally put it on at some point in the future, you’ll also notice that it’s powered by Android VR, which has also borrowed elements from visionOS’s glassy, translucent user interface—but that’s not Samsung’s fault.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Samsung-Project-Moohan-1.png?w=1200\" alt=\"Samsung Project Moohan 1\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Samsung-Project-Moohan-1.png?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2000w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Samsung-Project-Moohan-1.png?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Samsung-Project-Moohan-1.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Samsung-Project-Moohan-1.png?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Samsung-Project-Moohan-1.png?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Samsung-Project-Moohan-1.png?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Samsung-Project-Moohan-1.png?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>It’s not hard to see the Vision Pro influence on Samsung’s new Project Moohan headset.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Good artists copy, great artists steal </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many Apple fans may be reading this and shaking their heads. But while Samsung might have gotten a good amount of inspiration from Apple and the iPhone, the S25’s features aren’t straight copies. For example, the Photographic Styles clone lets users copy another image’s composition and create a filter based on its hues. Similarly, the audio studio in the video editor is more comprehensive, allowing users to amplify or mute more sound types. The Now Bar will offer a briefing feature that “provides a personalized briefing of selected content that updates throughout the day.” And so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the smartphone industry, competition revolves around the way handsets and features are perfected and presented. iOS and Android have matured to the point where they both can perform the same main tasks in a nearly identical way. So, whenever one of them innovates, the other tends to build upon that foundation when releasing its own variation on the same theme. As a result, both Apple and Samsung users continue to receive upgraded tools that elevate the mobile computing experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, come on, Samsung, maybe next time let’s try to be a little more subtle.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"508661bace70c69df5c1bb7286aa94b2d8e5a6c2a077a4e60716a08525136b0d","category":"Apple"}
