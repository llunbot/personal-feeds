The copied pages gave basic instructions for configuring BIOS passwords (necessary to change some system settings) and iDRAC, a standard network remote control tool (which the manual explicitly requires the administrator to disable).</p>\n<p>On the next day, Watkins released a video purporting to be from a \"whistleblower\" exposing Dominion's \"most egregious lie\"—that, supposedly, Dominion can remotely administer the machines. He also released several screenshots of Election Management Systems hardware his \"whistleblower\" had access to.</p>\n<p>Although none of Watkins' screenshots—which will be immediately familiar to anyone who's ever administered enterprise-grade hardware—are as damning to the voting machines themselves as Watkins would clearly like, they did end up causing problems for one of Watkins' fellow travelers—county clerk Tina Peters of Mesa County, Colorado, whose office manages the machines in question.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1786499#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1786499&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jim Salter","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6ab0dba6cb0eb60e54a9304a2d7702fb2115b7886603f0857c9c86b1e4c37fff","category":"Tech"}
