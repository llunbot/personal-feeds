These were not your \"typical\" moped that looks kind of like a motorcycle with pedalsâ€”the <a href=\"https://france-amerique.com/solex-half-bike-half-moped/\">mopeds made by Solex</a> were essentially bicycles with a small, two-stroke engine mounted over the front wheel that could propel the rider around 100 km on a single liter of gas mixture. The downside: Solex mopeds were loud and cumbersome to ride due to the weight distribution, and they never really caught on in North America.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://clip.bike\">Clip</a>, a startup based in Brooklyn, New York, has come up with its own twist on the Solex. Its only product, the eponymously named Clip, is a friction drive unit that attaches to the front fork of any bicycle, turning it into an e-bike. At $499 for the Commuter model and $599 for the Explorer, it is a relatively inexpensive way to turn just about any bicycle into an e-bike for a fraction of the cost of a new one.</p>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/clip-closeup.jpg\"><img alt=\"The Clip mounts to the front fork just below the brake caliper. \" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/clip-closeup-640x853.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/clip-closeup-1280x1707.jpg 2x\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/clip-closeup.jpg\">The Clip mounts to the front fork just below the brake caliper. </a> (credit: Eric Bangeman)</p></div>\n<p>Weighing in at 8.8 lb (4 kg) for the Commuter model (the Explorer is a pound heavier), the Clip is at its essence a portable friction-drive. There's a detachable controller that mounts on the handlebar and the unit itself. The Explorer model, the one we reviewed, has a 192 Wh battery that takes an hour to fully charge. Its range is pegged at \"up to 12 miles,\" a claim that is pretty accurate based on our testing, and the top speed is 15 mph. The Commuter model offers half the battery capacity, charge time, and range.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028235#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2028235&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Bangeman","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2300a647d4d9c0512a41baff3465359552262f0d670f0ae48e38126f7b0e95c3","category":"Tech"}
