A priority filing was made <a href=\"https://www.tmdn.org/tmview/#/tmview/detail/LI500000000020671\">in Liechtenstein</a> in October 2024, and additional filings were made <a href=\"https://www.tmdn.org/tmview/#/tmview/detail/US500000099140347\">in the United States</a>, Argentina, Peru, and a few other countries in April this year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe trademark is now registered in Liechtenstein, but the applications are still pending elsewhere.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe trademark filing in the U.S. was first spotted by <a href=\"https://www.parkerortolani.com/\">Parker Ortolani</a> and <a href=\"https://9to5mac.com/2025/06/05/apples-new-homeos-might-debut-next-week-at-wwdc/\">reported by <em>9to5Mac</em></a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere is no definitive proof that Apple owns the shell company, but it has a history of creating limited-liability companies with generic names in order to discreetly move to protect its intellectual property related to unannounced products.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFor example, in May 2023, <em>MacRumors</em> <a href=\"https://x.com/rsgnl/status/1663956592990060544\">uncovered a \"VisionOS\" trademark application</a> filed by another secretive LLC shell company. A month later, at WWDC, Apple announced its Vision Pro headset and its visionOS operating system.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n\"homeOS\" has been referenced in various other places in the past, including <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/03/apple-refers-to-homeos-job-listings/\">in Apple job listings</a>, and in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/29/tvos-17-4-homeos-mention/\">tvOS 17.4 code discovered by <em>MacRumors</em></a>. It could end up being the name of the software platform that powers Apple's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-command-center/\">long-rumored smart home hub</a>, which has been described as a HomePod with a screen. The device will reportedly have a square iPad-like screen that can be attached to a speaker base or mounted on a wall.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe hub would allow users to control smart home accessories, make FaceTime video calls, use Apple's intercom feature between rooms in a house, and more. It might even double as a home security system with an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/04/apple-smart-home-camera-rumor/\">Apple-designed smart home camera</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn March, Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that the HomePod with a screen would <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/12/homepod-with-screen-after-wwdc-kuo/\">enter mass production in the third quarter of 2025</a>, but it is unclear if it will ship to customers this year or next year. Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/07/apple-intelligence-siri-features-delayed/\">delayed the personalized Siri features</a> that are expected to be at the core of the device, so perhaps next year is a safer bet at this point. However, Apple could still provide an early preview of the home hub at any point now, and its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/06/02/apple-readies-wwdc-2025-live-stream/\">WWDC 2025 keynote</a> just so happens to be coming up next week.
