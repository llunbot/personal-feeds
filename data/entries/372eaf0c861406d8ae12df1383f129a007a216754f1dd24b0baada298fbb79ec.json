The prior update, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/08/apple-power-beats-pro-beats-studio-buds-firmware/\">released in November</a>, was 10M2155.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/04/beats-studio-buds-april-2022-colors.jpg\" alt width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nApple does not provide information on what's included in firmware updates for its Beats earbuds, so we are not sure what improvements or bug fixes the new software brings.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere's no standard way to upgrade the ‌Beats‌‌ Studio Buds, but firmware is generally installed over-the-air while the earbuds are connected to an iOS device. Putting the Beats‌‌‌‌‌ in the case, connecting them to a power source, and then pairing them‌‌‌‌‌ to an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> should force the update after a short period of time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf we find notable changes after the firmware update is installed, we'll share details, but the software likely includes performance improvements and bug fixes rather than outward-facing changes.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/beats/\">Beats</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/beats-studio-buds/\">Beats Studio Buds</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/11/beats-studio-buds-firmware-update-2/\">Apple Releases New Firmware for Beats Studio Buds</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-releases-new-firmware-for-beats-studio-buds.2395638/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"372eaf0c861406d8ae12df1383f129a007a216754f1dd24b0baada298fbb79ec","category":"Apple"}
