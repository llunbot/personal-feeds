While not spectacular when compared to Q3 2023, the numbers do show modest growth, unlike the rather disappointing <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/07/tesla-production-fell-by-15-percent-in-q2-2024-as-sales-continue-to-decline/\">Q2 2024</a>. However, the production and sales numbers were still below many analysts' estimates.</p>\n<p>Tesla built 469,796 vehicles across the months of July, August, and September, a 9 percent increase on <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/10/tesla-just-posted-its-q3-financial-results-and-theyre-underwhelming/\">Q3 2023</a>. Of those, 443,668 were Models 3 and Y, a 6 percent growth from last year. Thanks to the Cybertruck, the previously moribund \"other\" category that also includes the slow-selling and outdated Models S and X has grown 91 percent compared to Q3 2023.</p>\n<p>Tesla sold fewer cars than it built in Q3, though. Total sales for the quarter amounted to 462,890â€”6 percent up compared to Q3 2023. That's better than some analyst estimates, but UBS and Barclays were both estimating 470,000 cars sold during the three months.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/tesla-reverses-sales-slump-sees-modest-growth-in-q3/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/10/tesla-reverses-sales-slump-sees-modest-growth-in-q3/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
