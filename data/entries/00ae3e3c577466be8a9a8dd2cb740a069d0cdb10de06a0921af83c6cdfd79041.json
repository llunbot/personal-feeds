When Google first debuted AI Overview, it quickly became apparent that the feature <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/googles-ai-overview-can-give-false-misleading-and-dangerous-answers/\">needed work with accuracy</a> and its ability to properly summarize information from online sources. AI Overviews are “built to only show information that is backed up by top web results,\" Liz Reid, VP and head of Google Search, wrote in a May <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/search/ai-overviews-update-may-2024/\">blog post</a>.

By adding \"site:reddit.com” to search results, users can hone their search to more easily find answers from real people. Google seems to understand the value of Reddit and signed an <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/your-reddit-posts-may-train-ai-models-following-new-60-million-agreement/\">AI training deal with </a>the company that’s reportedly worth $60 million per year.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/fake-restaurant-tips-on-reddit-a-reminder-of-google-ai-overviews-inherent-flaws/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/fake-restaurant-tips-on-reddit-a-reminder-of-google-ai-overviews-inherent-flaws/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"00ae3e3c577466be8a9a8dd2cb740a069d0cdb10de06a0921af83c6cdfd79041","category":"Tech"}
