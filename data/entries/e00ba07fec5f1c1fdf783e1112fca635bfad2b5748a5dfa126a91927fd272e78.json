That point is being made by <a href=\"https://redshiftsports.com/\" target=\"_blank\">RedShift Sports</a> with their new Arclight Pro <a href=\"https://redshiftsports.com/collections/arclight-pedals\" target=\"_blank\">Smart LED pedals</a>. After RedShift asked if I wanted to check them out in person, I was on board. About this same time last year, I <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-redshift-arclight-pedals-automatically-light-up-to-be-safe-and-get-seen/\" target=\"_blank\">wrote a review</a> on their Original Arclight City Pedals and found them very useful. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The unique thing about their lighted pedals is that they offer 360 degrees of visibility compared to a standard bike light that just provides front and/or rear visibility. It’s said that lights moving in a circular motion are said to make a cyclist 57% more likely to be seen by a motorist, more so than a standard bike light. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the review period of the Original Smart Pedals, I did find that I felt safer on the road amongst traffic while using the pedals, I definitely felt more “seen”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, it was a positive review, and I still use those pedals. But, I did conclude that although the pedals worked well at holding soft-soled shoes to the pedal, I thought they would benefit from the addition of traction pins for future iterations of the pedals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the press release for the Arclight PRO Pedals, I wasn’t the only one that felt that way. Now, the PRO version of the pedals is packed with cool features and versatility including the option to add traction pins if you’d like. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A big shout out to RedShift Sports for listening to their end users!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Pedals, Same Smart Features</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-regargable-light-pods-2.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-regargable-light-pods-2-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Arclight PRO Pedals rechargeable light pods 2\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-regargable-light-pods-2-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-regargable-light-pods-2-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-regargable-light-pods-2-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-regargable-light-pods-2-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-regargable-light-pods-2-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-regargable-light-pods-2.jpeg 1280w\" /></a><figcaption>The 4 USB rechargeable lights on the included regarding hub</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-rechargable-light-pods.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-rechargable-light-pods-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Arclight PRO Pedals rechargeable light pods\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-rechargable-light-pods-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-rechargable-light-pods-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-rechargable-light-pods-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-rechargable-light-pods-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-rechargable-light-pods-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-rechargable-light-pods.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The SmartSet Technology that was built into the Original Arclight City pedals was unique and really put the OGs in a class of their own. The good news is, the PRO version comes with the same SmartSet Technology. The PROs use the included 4 USB rechargeable light modules and an included recharge hub. The 3 beam pattern options (steady, flash, and eco) last up to 36 hours. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Arclight PROs SmartSet technology is the brain of the pedal. This tech instantly knows the orientation of the pedal and can switch the light that’s front-facing to white and turns the light that’s rear-facing to red. The auto on/off is controlled by the same technology. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Co-Founder Erik de Brun says, “<em>Customers are constantly telling us that cars are finally giving us a wide berth and slowing down while passing, and the motion of the lights grabs attention, even during the daytime.</em>” </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Archlight PRO Smart Pedals – Flats or Clipless</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-pair.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-pair-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Arclight PRO Pedals pair\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-pair-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-pair-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-pair-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-pair-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-pair-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-pair.jpeg 1280w\" /></a><figcaption>Arclight PRO Pedals pair</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new pedals look pretty nice. And although their profile is a bit clunky looking, they do look rugged and utilitarian in the fit and finish. They spin great with the use of three internal sealed bearings, and they are fully serviceable and rebuildable. They are a bit hefty, to be expected, and weigh in at 367g.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-8mm-hex.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-8mm-hex-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Arclight PRO Pedals 8mm hex\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-8mm-hex-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-8mm-hex-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-8mm-hex-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-8mm-hex-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-8mm-hex-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-8mm-hex.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-light-being-removed.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-light-being-removed-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"Arclight PRO Pedals light being removed\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-light-being-removed-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-light-being-removed-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-light-being-removed-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-light-being-removed-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-light-being-removed-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-light-being-removed.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-weight-outta-the-box-e1679433082476.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"448\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-weight-outta-the-box-e1679433082476-800x448.jpeg\" alt=\"Arclight PRO Pedals weight outta the box\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-weight-outta-the-box-e1679433082476-800x448.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-weight-outta-the-box-e1679433082476-297x166.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-weight-outta-the-box-e1679433082476-120x67.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-weight-outta-the-box-e1679433082476-768x430.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-weight-outta-the-box-e1679433082476-400x225.jpeg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-weight-outta-the-box-e1679433082476.jpeg 1280w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>First Look: What’s in the Box</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-whats-in-the-box-e1679423842439.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"404\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-whats-in-the-box-e1679423842439-800x404.jpeg\" alt=\"Arclight PRO Pedals what's in the box\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-whats-in-the-box-e1679423842439-800x404.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-whats-in-the-box-e1679423842439-297x150.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-whats-in-the-box-e1679423842439-120x61.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-whats-in-the-box-e1679423842439-768x388.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Arclight-PRO-Pedals-whats-in-the-box-e1679423842439.jpeg 1280w\" /></a><figcaption>In the box: Arclight PRO pedals, rechargeable lights, charging hub, traction pins, and tool.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Arclight PRO Pedals are fully modular making them super versatile and rebuildable.
