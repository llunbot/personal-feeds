The message says to contact a computer or network administrator for assistance, or indicates that the Mac failed to open a connection to the device.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nThe error message starts with: \"You do not have permission to open the application.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAffected users have shared complaints about this issue across the <a href=\"https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253004346\">Apple Support Communities</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/BigSurPatcher/comments/ou3bye/scanner_permission_issues_after_upgrade_to_115/\">Reddit</a>, <a href=\"https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Printer-Setup-Software-Drivers/You-do-not-have-permission-to-open-the-application-HP/td-p/8120071\">HP Support Community</a>, and elsewhere. The error message appears to be affecting users on multiple versions of macOS Big Sur.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple said this issue is expected to be resolved in a future software update, but no timeframe was given. In the meantime, the support document provides step-by-step instructions on how to temporarily resolve the issue:<ol><li>Quit any apps that are open.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>From the menu bar in the Finder, choose Go &gt; Go to Folder.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Type <strong>/Library/Image Capture/Devices</strong>, then press Return.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>In the window that opens, double-click the app named in the error message. It's the name of your scanner driver. Nothing should happen when you open it.</li>\r\n<br />\r\n<li>Close the window and open the app you were using to scan. A new scan should proceed normally. If you later choose to scan from a different app and get the same error, repeat these steps.</li></ol>This article will be updated when Apple releases a macOS update with a permanent fix.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-big-sur/\">macOS Big Sur</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-big-sur.226\">macOS Big Sur</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/14/apple-to-fix-scanner-permission-error-on-mac/\">Apple Says Fix Planned for 'You Do Not Have Permission to Open the Application' Error When Using a Scanner on Mac</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-says-fix-planned-for-you-do-not-have-permission-to-open-the-application-error-when-using-a-scanner-on-mac.2307528/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=E8oAhkreyv8:ZRS2XYh45Yk:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=E8oAhkreyv8:ZRS2XYh45Yk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/E8oAhkreyv8\" />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"838ac821b823cda17ebd4bc077ae2c9585a1ddf9ee4c0168eabf112b63508150","category":"Apple"}
