There’s a lot of money to be made overseas. But the biggest US tech companies are finding out that there’s also a downside: Every country where you make money is a country that could try to regulate you.</p>\n<p>It’s hard to keep track of all the tech-related antitrust action happening around the world, in part because it doesn’t always seem to be worth paying close attention to. In Europe, which has long been home to the world’s most aggressive regulators, Google alone was hit with a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/06/google-europe-fine/\">$2.7 billion fine</a> in 2017, a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/07/eu-google-illegally-used-android-to-dominate-search-must-pay-5b-fine/\">$5 billion fine</a> in 2018, and a <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/03/google-fined-1-69-billion-by-the-eu-for-anti-competitive-advertising-practices/\">$1.7 billion fine</a> in 2019. These sums would be devastating for most companies, but they are little more than rounding errors for a corporation that reported <a href=\"https://abc.xyz/investor/static/pdf/2021Q2_alphabet_earnings_release.pdf?cache=4db52a1\">$61.9 billion</a> in revenue last quarter.</p>\n<p>Increasingly, however, foreign countries are going beyond slap-on-the-wrist fines. Instead, they’re forcing tech companies to change how they do business. In February, Australia <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/02/australia-passes-law-to-force-facebook-and-google-to-pay-for-news/\">passed a law</a> giving news publishers the right to negotiate payments from dominant internet platforms—effectively, Facebook and Google. In August, South Korea became the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-apple-hit-in-south-korea-by-worlds-first-law-ending-their-dominance-over-app-store-payments-11630403335\">first country</a> to pass a law forcing Apple and Google to open their mobile app stores to alternate payment systems, threatening their grip on the 30 percent commission they charge developers. And in a case with potentially huge ramifications, Google will soon have to respond to the Turkish competition authority’s <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/turkey-fines-google-abusing-dominant-position-2021-04-14/\">demand</a> to stop favoring its own properties in local search results.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1796339#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1796339&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"WIRED","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6df6d3ff2839bd62ca1ecee194628f341b39cb4b6f6d524752f0e70c74df0c00","category":"Tech"}
