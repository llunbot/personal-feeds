Ever since Rene Herse Cycles has worked with Lael Wilcox to develop the 29″ / 700C Fleecer Ridge dual-purpose knobbies, they’ve been deluged with requests for 26″ and 650B versions with the same noise-cancelling tread pattern. They launched the 26″ Humptulips Ridge late last year. Now they are introducing the 650B / 27.5″ version, the Umtanum Ridge.</p>\n<p>Pick up a pair now in Standard, Extralight, Endurance, and Endurance Plus casings at <a href=\"https://www.renehersecycles.com/shop/components/tires/650b/650b-x-55-umtanum-ridge-tc-tire/\" target=\"_blank\">René Herse</a>.</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"dfca8f58ded7b1c63df13b7c6735ca227ca7710e040289d82350a57cf3570528","category":"Cycling"}
