Discovery, as part of its ongoing effort to stretch the definition of \"entertainment company,\" recently told a solo indie developer it would be \"retiring\" his 2016 dreamlike puzzle adventure game <em>Small Radios Big Televisions </em>from the <a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/390040/Small_Radios_Big_Televisions/\">Steam</a> and <a href=\"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0151-CUSA05471_00-SMALLRADIOS00000\">PlayStation</a> stores. The developer, in response, has <a href=\"https://fire-face.com/games/srbt.html\">made it free to download for PC</a>, giving us a rare chance to actually experience the thing that a giga-corp has determined to be not worth your time, before it is wiped from the archives.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://twitter.com/owendeery/status/1765032553147245010\">a thread on X</a> (formerly Twitter) Tuesday, Owen Deery, a self-described \"small Canadian game developer\" who works as Fire Face, provided a few details in replies. Deery doesn't <a href=\"https://twitter.com/owendeery/status/1765212716459868527\">control the sale price</a> of the game but will <a href=\"https://twitter.com/owendeery/status/1765213684391968807\">still get royalties</a> from the games while they're up. Otherwise, you could <a href=\"https://owendeery.bandcamp.com/album/small-radios-big-televisions\">purchase the hard-synth soundtrack</a> as a show of support, which in this author's opinion is very good music for working or feeling a combination of nostalgia and magnetic dissolution at the same time.</p>\n<div><div></div><p>Gameplay trailer for <em>Small Radios Big Televisions</em>, from October 2016. </p></div>\n<p>Ars reached out to Deery, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Adult Swim Games for comment and will update this post with new information.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2008282#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2008282&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kevin Purdy","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"7ed290f8628fab70b193b530e5456b4cbcc3eb4908570249df3c221b05e8928c","category":"Tech"}
