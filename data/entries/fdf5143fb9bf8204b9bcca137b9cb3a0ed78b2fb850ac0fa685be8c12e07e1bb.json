And this was a good day: a visit to Polestar's UK research and development center, based at the Motor Industry Research Association's proving grounds outside Coventry, England, to find out how it's getting on with one of its next electric vehicles, a purposeful-looking performance sedan called the Polestar 5.</p>\n<p>Until now, the Polestar EVs we've seen have used platforms shared across other brands within the Geely group.

That's fine for, say, a luxury SUV—even a sporty one. But if you were a brand wanting to build a competitor for the Porsche Taycan, you might want to start from scratch.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1956085#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1956085&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
