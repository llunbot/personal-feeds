China <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2017/07/31/russia-bans-vpns-apple-pulls-apps-china/\">banned VPN services</a> from the ‌App Store‌ in 2017.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe five social media apps named above have been downloaded from Apple's ‌App Store‌ more than 170 million times in China over the last decade, according to estimates by Sensor Tower.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to the report, Chinese officials told Apple staff that it must strictly implement rules banning unregistered foreign apps, thereby closing a loophole allowing Chinese ‌iPhone‌ users to download them.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nUnder new rules issued in July by China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, Apple will no longer be able to offer such apps in its China ‌App Store‌ from next July unless the app operators are registered with the government. The new rules affect both foreign and domestic app distributors, and aren't specifically targeting Apple.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nHowever, the operators are unlikely to register with the Chinese government, since doing so would force them to comply with data transfer and censorship requirements. Such a scenario would leave Apple with no choice but to remove them or face legal sanctions.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nInvestors are said to be concerned about how the new rules will affect Apple's services bottom line, which includes ‌App Store‌ transactions. Apple is also said to be concerned about issues the company could face in implementing the rules, such as whether users in China who access foreign apps through its overseas app stores would be able to continue to do so.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAccording to the report, Apple was told during the recent discussions that the new rules are needed to crack down on online scams, pornography, and the circulation of information that violates China's censorship rules.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nChina has recently banned government officials from using iPhones and other foreign smartphones for work or from bringing such devices to their government offices, and earlier this month the band was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/07/china-expanding-government-iphone-ban/\">expanded</a> to multiple state agencies and state companies, highlighting China's renewed attempts to block foreign technology.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nChina is an important market for Apple, with the region accounting for about a fifth of its sales. \r<br />\nMost of Apple's manufacturing base remains in the country, despite the company's efforts in recent years to diversify its supply chain to places like Vietnam and India.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/app-store/\">App Store</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/china/\">China</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/29/apple-china-discuss-rules-banning-western-apps/\">Apple 'Concerned' About China's New App Store Rules Banning Unregistered Foreign Apps</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-concerned-about-chinas-new-app-store-rules-banning-unregistered-foreign-apps.2405451/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0f43acbb3352d098a86c38afa7defcf6b2b0e6f77f19d4a04793e27e5e0ee1fe","category":"Apple"}
