It’s that exciting time of year again when we start considering Interop 2025 proposals. We’re thrilled to invite you to help shape the future of web interoperability.</p>\n<p>Interop 2025 is just around the corner, and we want <strong>your</strong> brilliant ideas to make the web platform even more awesome. Whether you’re a seasoned pro or a newcomer with fresh perspectives, we want to hear from you!</p>\n<h2>Key Dates to Remember</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Proposal Submission Opens:</strong> September 17, 2024</li>\n<li><strong>Submission Deadline:</strong> October 3rd, 2024</li>\n<li><strong>Proposal Selection Complete:</strong> December 19th 2024</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Don’t miss this opportunity to influence the direction of web standards and browser implementations!</p>\n<h2>I’m new to the Interop project, what is it about?</h2>\n<p>The Interop Project is a collaborative initiative among major browser vendors to improve cross-browser compatibility and interoperability on the web platform. The project focuses development efforts on improving consistency across browsers for key web features and APIs ensuring they are uniformly implemented using a shared test suite called Web Platform Tests (WPT).</p>\n<p>This coordinated approach aims to reduce developer frustration, enable new web capabilities, improve user experiences, and accelerate the implementation of web standards.</p>\n<figure><img src=\"https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/interop-dashboard-9-12-24-1024x452.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of the Interop 2024 dashboard, showing current scores: Chrome 98, Firefox 92, Safari 97.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"452\" srcset=\"https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/interop-dashboard-9-12-24-1024x452.png 1024w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/interop-dashboard-9-12-24-300x132.png 300w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/interop-dashboard-9-12-24-768x339.png 768w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/interop-dashboard-9-12-24-1536x678.png 1536w, https://webkit.org/wp-content/uploads/interop-dashboard-9-12-24-2048x904.png 2048w\" /><figcaption>The <a href=\"https://wpt.fyi/interop-2024\">Interop 2024 dashboard</a> with this year’s project in progress</figcaption></figure>\n<p>WebKit has made significant strides in improving web interoperability through its participation in <a href=\"https://wpt.fyi/interop-2024\">Interop 2024</a>. Some notable areas of improvement include CSS nesting, the <code>popover</code> attribute in HTML, scrollbar styling, and text directionality. Features you love in WebKit, like relative color syntax and <code>font-size-adjust</code>, have landed in all browsers thanks to Interop 2024. Our work driving the <a href=\"https://webkit.org/blog/15400/improving-web-accessibility-with-web-platform-tests/\">Accessibility investigation in 2023 led to tests</a> that are now included in Interop 2024, improving web accessibility across all browsers. And there’s <a href=\"https://webkit.org/blog/14955/the-web-just-gets-better-with-interop/#the-2024-focus-areas\">much more</a>. These advancements not only make web development more streamlined but also contribute to a more unified and reliable web experience for users across different browsers and devices.</p>\n<h2>What Makes a Great Proposal?</h2>\n<p>We’re looking for proposals that address real-world interoperability challenges. The best submissions are typically:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Specific:</strong> Identify a specific interoperability issue.</li>\n<li><strong>Impactful:</strong> Provide clear use cases and examples, especially from your own experience.</li>\n<li><strong>Tested:</strong> Interop focus areas are scored by the pass rate of web platform tests, this means proposals need good tests to be considered.</li>\n<li><strong>Stable:</strong> Interop is about improving browser compatibility for stable, well-understood web standards.</li>\n<li><strong>Valuable:</strong> Developers and/or users will benefit from improved interoperability. These are some <a href=\"https://github.com/web-platform-tests/interop/blob/main/proposal_guide.md#additional-signals\">signals to consider including in your proposal</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ready to dive in?
