Among many topics discussed, several of its members (and NASA officials) stressed that they were not specifically undertaking a hunt for aliens.</p>\n\n<p>\"I want to emphasize this loud and proud that there is absolutely no convincing evidence for extraterrestrial life associated with UAPs,\" said Dan Evans, the assistant deputy associate administrator of NASAâ€™s Science Mission Directorate. Evans is responsible for orchestrating the study on UAP.</p>\n<p>During the four-hour meeting, which was livestreamed on the web, the team said that insufficient data and stigma about the topic remain significant barriers to uncovering the nature of UAPs. Panel chairman David Spergel remarked that the team's role was \"not to resolve the nature of these events\" but to create a road map for NASA that could potentially guide future inquiries into the topic.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1943505#p3\">Read 14 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1943505&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"10da15b44996908cf9cc7f96f0e1d59fe32dd494fabf48b1281b028dda5c72b7","category":"Tech"}
