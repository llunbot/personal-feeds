Honestly, I think SRAM is the only one with the pure flat top edition, which they developed for their 12-speed road groups. Yes, you can use the KMC X12 to replace a current flattop setup, but if you want the smooth look, you’ll have to buy a SRAM chain. However, it appears that KMC has a SRAM-compatible flattop design in the works, and it looks to be dropping soon. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/KMC-12-speed-Flattop-Chain-art--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/KMC-12-speed-Flattop-Chain-art--scaled.webp\" alt=\"KMC 12 speed Flattop Chain art\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/KMC-12-speed-Flattop-Chain-art--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/KMC-12-speed-Flattop-Chain-art--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/KMC-12-speed-Flattop-Chain-art--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/KMC-12-speed-Flattop-Chain-art--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/KMC-12-speed-Flattop-Chain-art--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/KMC-12-speed-Flattop-Chain-art--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/KMC-12-speed-Flattop-Chain-art--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>KMC 12 Speed Flattop Chain – What is it? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We know that the new KMC 12-speed flattop will be an option for SRAM riders who might want an alternative to the SRAM chains.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/KMC-12-speed-Flattop-Chain-Quick-link--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/KMC-12-speed-Flattop-Chain-Quick-link--scaled.webp\" alt=\"KMC 12 speed Flattop Chain Quick link\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/KMC-12-speed-Flattop-Chain-Quick-link--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/KMC-12-speed-Flattop-Chain-Quick-link--297x167.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/KMC-12-speed-Flattop-Chain-Quick-link--1536x864.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/KMC-12-speed-Flattop-Chain-Quick-link--120x68.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/KMC-12-speed-Flattop-Chain-Quick-link--768x432.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/KMC-12-speed-Flattop-Chain-Quick-link--2048x1152.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/KMC-12-speed-Flattop-Chain-Quick-link--1200x675.webp 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Reusable Flattop Quick Link?   </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>That was the first thing I asked (that would rule, right?) and was left with zero speculation.

It’s uncertain if an “X12SL-FT” model would accompany the release (the chain in question looks more like a standard X12 model), and the same goes for pricing. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/KMC-12-speed-Flattop-Chain-full-packing--scaled.webp\"><img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/KMC-12-speed-Flattop-Chain-full-packing--scaled.webp\" alt=\"KMC 12 speed Flattop Chain full packing\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/KMC-12-speed-Flattop-Chain-full-packing--scaled.webp 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/KMC-12-speed-Flattop-Chain-full-packing--297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/KMC-12-speed-Flattop-Chain-full-packing--1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/KMC-12-speed-Flattop-Chain-full-packing--120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/KMC-12-speed-Flattop-Chain-full-packing--768x576.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/KMC-12-speed-Flattop-Chain-full-packing--2048x1536.webp 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Availibility </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether this is an upgrade or an adjacent option for SRAM riders, one thing is certain: it’s nice to have another option on the table.
