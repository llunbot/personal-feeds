And while you may not think of earbuds and headphones as the types of products that would be updated with new features on a regular basis, Apple does a great job of integrating them into its ecosystem, and new versions bring more functionality. This article keeps track of the most creditable reports of the upcoming AirPods, so keep coming back for the latest news.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2021 AirPods: The latest rumors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>September 14:</strong> The “California streaming” event came and went without any mention of AirPods. While reports have said they will be released this fall, it looks like now it could make its appearance in either a rumored second fall event where the MacBook Pro is the featured product. Or Apple could simply release the AirPods outside of an event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>September 7:</strong> A new FCC filing spotted by <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/davezatz/status/1434955211055972355&amp;xcust=1-1-349085-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Dave Zatz on Twitter</a> shows a <strong>MagSafe charger</strong> attaching to an AirPods Wireless Charging Case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>August 16:</strong> <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-08-15/what-s-new-about-the-next-apple-aapl-iphone-airpods-and-macs-ksdike4t?sref=Yg3sQEZ2&amp;utm_content=business&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;xcust=1-1-349085-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman</a> reports that “<strong>new entry-level AirPods with a design closer to the AirPods Pro</strong>” are on the way this fall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>July 21:</strong> <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Apple-to-go-all-in-on-5G-for-its-2022-iPhone-lineup&amp;xcust=1-1-349085-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Nikkei Asia reports</a> that the third-gen AirPods will <strong>start production in August</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>June 30:</strong> Ming-Chi Kuo reports (<a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/06/30/airpods-pro-2-to-debut-in-2022-kuo-says&amp;xcust=1-1-349085-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">via AppleInsider</a>) that the <strong>second-gen AirPods Pro won’t arrive until 2022</strong>, a bit later than they were initially expected.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2021 AirPods (3rd generation)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Availability:</strong> Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/15/airpods-3-mass-production-q3-2021/&amp;xcust=1-1-339494-0-0-0%7Cxid:fr1623962764783efg&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/339494/multiple-sources-claim-airpods-3-wont-be-part-of-apples-march-event.html\">reported</a> in March that the new third-gen AirPods are not scheduled to go into mass production until the third quarter of this year, which likely signals a fall release.

The Chinese website <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.52audio.com/archives/74422.html&amp;xcust=1-1-349085-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">52audio</a> posted photos of AirPods that look similar to what LeaksApplePro posted, and Bloomberg also <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-08-15/what-s-new-about-the-next-apple-aapl-iphone-airpods-and-macs-ksdike4t&amp;xcust=1-1-349085-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">reported</a> in August that the next AirPods will have “a new in-ear shape and shorter stems” as part of “the most significant update to that part of Apple’s AirPods line since the first model debuted in 2016.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The AirPods could also have a new case that’s similar to the AirPods Pro case, but 52audio and Bloomberg did not say if Apple will continue to offer both wired and wireless options. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>Nice <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://t.co/2PJdCd2hEn&amp;xcust=1-1-349085-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">pic.twitter.com/2PJdCd2hEn</a></p>— LeaksApplePro (@LeaksApplePro) <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://twitter.com/LeaksApplePro/status/1369642089387024386?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;xcust=1-1-349085-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">March 10, 2021</a></blockquote></div></figure><p><strong>Features:</strong> Several reports state that the next AirPods will have the same H1 chip and features as the current AirPods, such as fast device pairing and switching,  optical sensors, and motion and speech-detecting accelerometers. However, even though the AirPods 3 may look like AirPods Pro, they likely won’t have active noise cancellation. However, they may get MagSafe charging.

According to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-28/apple-plans-redesigned-airpods-for-2021-new-airpods-pro-in-2022&amp;xcust=1-1-349085-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Bloomberg</a>, the next AirPods Pro will focus more on fitness tracking and have updated motion sensors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Price:</strong> No reports of price have been made. The current model is $249, but they are frequently on sale. The new Beats Studio Buds are $150, so it’s possible Apple could do a small price reduction, though that’s not Apple’s typical move.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>2021 AirPods Max</strong> (2nd generation)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The AirPods Max were released in late 2020, so it’s unlikely that a new model will launch this year, based on Apple’s AirPods cadence. However, Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234986/airpods-max-review.html\">reported</a> in May that Apple is not working on any design or feature updates, though Apple could release new colors to refresh the product mid-cycle.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2021 AirPods: Apple Music</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple launched Lossless Audio and Lossless High-Res Audio for Apple Music in June, but due to the limitations of Bluetooth and the AAC codec, none of the current crop of AirPods are able to stream the higher-quality tracks. However, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=http://Looking%20for%20a%20few%20final%20deals%20during%20the%20last%20few%20hours%20of%20Prime%20Day?%20We&amp;#039;ve%20put%20together%20must-have%20bundles%20of%20our%20favorite%20discounted%20gear%20for%20Mac,%20iPhone,%20and%20iPad%20users.&amp;xcust=1-1-349085-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">Jon Prosser reported</a> that Apple is working on a new audio codec that would allow lossless streaming over AirPods, which could get an introduction alongside the new models. It’s unclear whether such a new feature would be limited to new AirPods, but if Apple opts to use Wi-Fi and AirPlay 2 to enable Lossless audio, that would require new hardware.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2021 AirPods: iOS 15</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple unveiled iOS 15 at WWDC and it includes <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/348586/airpods-ios-15-firmware-update-find-my-spatial-audio-conversation-boost-announce-notifications-compatability-release-date.html\">several features that will come to the AirPods</a>, including expanded support for the Find My network, Conversation Boost for AirPods Pro, and spatial audio on Apple TV and M1 Macs. All of these features will likely ship with the new AirPods models, which could signal a fall release.</p>\n</div>","author":"Roman Loyola","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"d9bb97ea068bb4f5dad0b455afc012913e4a53dc9832a825c326ad406aebd8ae","category":"Apple"}
