The app would allow users to make purchases immediately and pay for them at a future date.</p>\n<p>In recent years, Edge has built a following of users attracted to the security of the Microsoft browser, in addition to features including <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/use-immersive-reader-in-microsoft-edge-78a7a17d-52e1-47ee-b0ac-eff8539015e1\">immersive reading</a>, <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/use-immersive-reader-in-microsoft-edge-78a7a17d-52e1-47ee-b0ac-eff8539015e1\">collections</a> (which saves webpages or notes to categorized notebooks), <a href=\"https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftedge/forum/all/how-to-enable-vertical-tab-bar-in-edge/1c3e705f-e2dd-4bcf-9664-62428e9ea325\">vertical tabs</a>, and the ability to take screenshots directly from a webpage.</p>\n<p>​​Two weeks ago, Microsoft <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/introducing-buy-now-pay-later-in-microsoft-edge/m-p/2967030\">said</a> it planned to bake an app called Zip directly into Edge.
