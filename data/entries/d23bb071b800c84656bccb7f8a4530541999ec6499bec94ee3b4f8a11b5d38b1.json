In addition to the Dynamic Island, he said the next iPhone SE could have a vertical rear camera bump like the one <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/apple-iphone-16-slim-camera-bump/\">rumored for the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus</a>, but with one camera instead of two. Based on the information he shared, the rear microphone and LED flash would be positioned below the camera lens in a pill-shaped bump.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n@MajinBuOfficial recently shared alleged iPhone 16 schematics that are <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/06/apple-iphone-16-slim-camera-bump/\">believed to be accurate</a>. However, he has a mixed track record with Apple rumors, and he cautioned that this iPhone SE information is still unconfirmed for now. In addition, Apple is likely prototyping multiple iPhone SE models, and it may not have finalized a design.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe next iPhone SE is expected to launch in 2025, around three years after the current model was released, but this timeframe could change.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/majin-bu/\">Majin Bu</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone_SE\">iPhone SE (Caution)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/08/iphone-se-dynamic-island-rumor/\">Sketchy Rumor Says Next iPhone SE Will Feature Dynamic Island Instead of Notch</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/sketchy-rumor-says-next-iphone-se-will-feature-dynamic-island-instead-of-notch.2418916/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"MacRumors Staff","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d23bb071b800c84656bccb7f8a4530541999ec6499bec94ee3b4f8a11b5d38b1","category":"Apple"}
