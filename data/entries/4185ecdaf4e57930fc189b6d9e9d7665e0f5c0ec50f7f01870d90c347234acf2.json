It is unclear if the accessories will have any changes beyond the switch to USB-C. They still look largely the same as they did when they received their last major update in October 2015, although there have been some minor revisions over the years, including a switch to braided cables, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/20/new-m1-imac-accessories/\">new color options</a> that are only available with the 24-inch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/imac/\">iMac</a>. Apple also released a Magic Keyboard with a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/touch-id/\">Touch ID</a> button in 2021.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile the Magic Mouse lasts around a month or longer between charges, the position of the Lightning port on the bottom of the accessory has been a point of contention in the Apple community for many years, as it prevents it from being used while charging. It is unclear if the USB-C port on the new version will be placed in a more convenient location.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEver since Apple began transitioning from Lightning to USB-C, the port change on its peripherals has been widely anticipated. Despite <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/27/usb-c-magic-mouse-expected-at-apple-event/\">rumors</a> suggesting that the switch would occur with the release of the company's new iMacs in October, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/magic-accessories-still-feature-lightning/\">no such change occurred</a> and all three accessories continue to sport a Lightning port for charging and pairing.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's decision to leave the accessories unchanged is notable because the company has otherwise progressively been moving to USB-C. The entire <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a> lineup, all latest-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> models, the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/siri/\">Siri</a> Remote for <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, second-generation <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a>, and new <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-pencil/\">Apple Pencil</a> all now feature a USB-C port. Other than the three peripherals that accompany the ‌‌iMac‌‌, the only latest-generation Apple devices that still have a Lightning port are the AirPods, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/\">AirPods Max</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-se/\">iPhone SE</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSpring officially runs from March to May. An update to the various \"Magic\" Mac accessories in this time frame would be unusual, given that the ‌iMac‌ was refreshed just five to seven months earlier, but it is not out of the question. Apple is rumored to be planning several product releases for the spring, including <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/ipad-air-ipad-pro-2024-refresh/\">new iPads</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/12/06/macbook-air-march-2024/\">Macs</a>, and potentially its Vision Pro headset.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nInstant Digital has a mixed track record in terms of revealing accurate information about Apple's plans. The source was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/03/iphone-14-new-color-rumor/\">first to report</a> the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a>'s Yellow spring refresh, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/04/future-iphone-could-capture-spatial-photos-videos/\">Spatial Video</a> on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch Series 9</a>'s <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/04/apple-watch-series-9-basically-unchanged/\">minor refresh</a>, as well as the only rumor claiming that the ‌iPhone 15‌ and ‌iPhone 15‌ Plus would feature <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/17/iphone-15-and-15-plus-frosted-glass-rumor/\">frosted back glass</a>.
