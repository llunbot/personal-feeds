Apple has supported a handful of third-party music services on ‌HomePod‌ for the last couple of years, so this functionality is already available with Pandora, iHeartRadio, Deezer, and TuneIn Radio.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>YouTube Music is working on adding HomePod support! <a href=\"https://t.co/71KzB0UsZA\">pic.twitter.com/71KzB0UsZA</a></p>— Aaron (@aaronp613) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1701388774985392351?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 12, 2023</a></blockquote> </div>\r<br />\nMusic services like Spotify have not adopted this option even though Apple made the SiriKit Media feature available in iOS 14, so it remains limited in scope. With the direct play function, users can set a third-party service as a default music option, and when ‌Siri‌ on ‌HomePod‌ is asked to play content, ‌Siri‌ will play music from the selected service.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf YouTube Music does indeed add support for playing music directly on the ‌HomePod‌, it could make the streaming service more appealing to Apple users.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/11/youtube-music-homepod-integration/\">YouTube Music Integration May Be Coming to HomePod</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/youtube-music-integration-may-be-coming-to-homepod.2401097/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"8d4c783aca44aa1ed5ca72e62926e8b23ab4d66accabd566372a3bcf84cf34aa","category":"Apple"}
