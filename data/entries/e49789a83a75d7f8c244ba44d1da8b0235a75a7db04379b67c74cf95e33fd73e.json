{"title":"Centralize visibility of Kubernetes clusters across AWS Regions and accounts with EKS Dashboard","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/centralize-visibility-of-kubernetes-clusters-across-aws-regions-and-accounts-with-eks-dashboard/","date":1747857956000,"content":"<p>Today, we’re announcing <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/eks/\">Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)</a> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/cluster-dashboard.html\">Dashboard</a>, a centralized display that enables cloud architects and cluster administrators to maintain organization-wide visibility across their Kubernetes clusters. With EKS Dashboard, customers can now monitor clusters deployed across different AWS Regions and accounts through a unified view, making it easier to track cluster inventory, assess compliance, and plan operational activities like version upgrades.</p> \n<p>As organizations scale their Kubernetes deployments, they often run multiple clusters across different environments to enhance availability, ensure business continuity, or maintain data sovereignty. However, this distributed approach can make it challenging to maintain visibility and control, especially in decentralized setups spanning multiple Regions and accounts. Today, many customers resort to third-party tools for centralized cluster visibility, which adds complexity through identity and access setup, licensing costs, and maintenance overhead.</p> \n<p>EKS Dashboard simplifies this experience by providing native dashboard capabilities within the <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/console/\">AWS Console</a>. The Dashboard provides insights into 3 different resources including clusters, managed node groups, and EKS add-ons, offering aggregated insights into cluster distribution by Region, account, version, support status, forecasted extended support EKS control plane costs, and cluster health metrics. Customers can drill down into speciﬁc data points with automatic ﬁltering, enabling them to quickly identify and focus on clusters requiring attention.</p> \n<p><strong>Setting up EKS Dashboard<br /> </strong>You can access the Dashboard in EKS console through AWS Organizations’ <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs-manage_accounts_management.html\">management</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_integrate_delegated_admin.html\">delegated administrator</a> accounts. The setup process is straightforward and includes simply enabling trusted access as a one-time setup in the Amazon EKS console’s organizations settings page. Trusted access is available from the <strong>Dashboard settings</strong> page. Enabling trusted access will allow the management account to view the Dashboard. For more information on setup and configuration, see the official <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/cluster-dashboard.html\">AWS Documentation</a>.</p> \n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/05/21/eks-dashboard-settings-1-1024x728.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of EKS Dashboard settings\" width=\"1400\" height=\"995\" /></p> \n<p><strong>A quick tour of EKS Dashboard</strong><br /> The dashboard provides both graphical, tabular, and map views of your Kubernetes clusters, with advanced filtering, and search capabilities. You can also export data for further analysis or custom reporting.</p> \n<div>\n <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/05/19/eks-dashboard-01-1024x854.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of EKS Dashboard interface\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1167\" />\n <p>EKS Dashboard overview with key info about your clusters.</p>\n</div> \n<div>\n <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/05/19/eks-dashboard-02-1024x807.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of EKS Dashboard interface\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1104\" />\n <p>There is a wide variety of available widgets to help visualize your clusters.</p>\n</div> \n<div>\n <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/05/19/eks-dashboard-03-1024x743.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of EKS Dashboard interface\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1015\" />\n <p>You can visualize your managed node groups by instance type distribution, launch templates, AMI versions, and more</p>\n</div> \n<div>\n <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2025/05/19/eks-dashboard-04-1024x795.png\" alt=\"Screenshot of EKS Dashboard interface\" width=\"1400\" height=\"1087\" />\n <p>There is even a map view where you can see all of your clusters across the globe.</p>\n</div> \n<p><strong>Beyond EKS clusters</strong><br /> EKS Dashboard isn’t limited to just Amazon EKS clusters; it can also provide visibility into connected Kubernetes clusters running on-premises or on other cloud providers. While connected clusters may have limited data fidelity compared to native Amazon EKS clusters, this capability enables truly unified visibility for organizations running hybrid or multi-cloud environments.</p> \n<p><strong>Available now</strong><br /> Amazon EKS Dashboard is available today in the US East (N. Virginia) Region and is able to aggregate data from all commercial AWS Regions. There is no additional charge for using the EKS Dashboard. To learn more, visit the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/cluster-dashboard.html\">Amazon EKS documentation</a>.</p> \n<p>This new capability demonstrates our continued commitment to simplifying Kubernetes operations for our customers, enabling them to focus on building and scaling their applications rather than managing infrastructure. We’re excited to see how customers use EKS Dashboard to enhance their Kubernetes operations.</p> \n<a href=\"https://linktr.ee/micahwalter\">— Micah;</a>","author":"Micah Walter","siteTitle":"AWS News Blog","siteHash":"6093e072e4117ec22616e844cb857d03ca62c57a411a8affc77cb5e8b6b15bf6","entryHash":"e49789a83a75d7f8c244ba44d1da8b0235a75a7db04379b67c74cf95e33fd73e","category":"Tech"}
