I have a problem with the leg.” A\nfellow reporter staking out the elevator asked what was wrong\nwith the leg.</p>\n\n<p>“Well, nothing that’s anyone concern but mine,” she said.</p>\n\n<p>When the fellow reporter asked her what the response from her\ncolleagues had been like since her return, though, the\nconversation took an odd turn.</p>\n\n<p>“No, I haven’t been gone,” she said.</p>\n\n<p>OK.</p>\n\n<p>“You should follow the — I haven’t been gone. I’ve been working.”</p>\n\n<p>When asked whether she meant that she’d been working from home,\nshe turned feisty.</p>\n\n<p>“No, I’ve been here. I’ve been voting,” she said. “Please. You\neither know or don’t know.”</p>\n\n<p>After deflecting one final question about those, like Rep. Ro\nKhanna, who’ve called on her to resign, she was wheeled away.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Feinstein’s months-long absence from the Senate has been one of the biggest political stories of the year. Her senescence is truly sad at a personal level, but the U.S. Senate, ostensibly the greatest deliberative body in the history of democracy, is no place for a person who doesn’t know where she’s been for the last three months. Anyone on her staff or in her family who isn’t urging her to resign ought to be ashamed.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/05/16/feinstein-doesnt-know\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"78c3701bdab249ef9c99efdc4eeabf05c7dc6dd502e12a341682dba6be8dc8d0","category":"Tech"}
