{"title":"Inside TSMC’s Expansion Struggles in Arizona","link":"https://restofworld.org/2024/tsmc-arizona-expansion/","date":1713901788000,"content":"\n<p>Viola Zhou, reporting for Rest of World on TSMC’s massive, but now much-delayed, chip fabrication campus outside Phoenix:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The American engineers complained of rigid, counterproductive\nhierarchies at the company; Taiwanese TSMC veterans described\ntheir American counterparts as lacking the kind of dedication and\nobedience they believe to be the foundation of their company’s\nworld-leading success.</p>\n\n<p>Some 2,200 employees now work at TSMC’s Arizona plant, with about\n<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7dd63d94-f645-45c6-8b82-b1808ee1cb31\">half of them deployed from Taiwan</a>. While tension at the plant\nsimmers, TSMC has been ramping up its investments, recently\nsecuring billions of dollars in grants and loans from the U.S.\ngovernment. Whether or not the plant succeeds in making\ncutting-edge chips with the same speed, efficiency, and\nprofitability as facilities in Asia remains to be seen, with many\nskeptical about a U.S. workforce under TSMC’s army-like command\nsystem. “[The company] tried to make Arizona Taiwanese,” G. Dan\nHutcheson, a semiconductor industry analyst at the research firm\nTechInsights, told Rest of World. “And it’s just not going to\nwork.” [...]</p>\n\n<p>TSMC’s work culture is notoriously rigorous, even by Taiwanese\nstandards. Former executives have <a href=\"https://tfc-taiwan.org.tw/articles/10344\">hailed the Confucian\nculture</a>, which promotes diligence and respect for\nauthority, as well as Taiwan’s strict work ethic as key to the\ncompany’s success. Chang, <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/TSMC-founder-Morris-Chang-backs-U.S.-on-China-chip-curbs\">speaking last year</a> about\nTaiwan’s competitiveness compared to the U.S., said that “if [a\nmachine] breaks down at one in the morning, in the U.S. it will be\nfixed in the next morning. But in Taiwan, it will be fixed at 2\na.m.” And, he added, the wife of a Taiwanese engineer would “go\nback to sleep without saying another word.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Even the use of <em>wife</em> rather than <em>spouse</em> speaks to the culture clash.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/23/tsmc-rest-of-world\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"35a73cef7cd9f2ecd50fcaef856660551541a0c96ff31e84013304c8d374c8a2","category":"Tech"}
