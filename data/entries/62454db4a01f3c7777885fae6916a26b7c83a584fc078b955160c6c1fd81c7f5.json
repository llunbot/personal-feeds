According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, the new handset isn’t arriving until next week. But something “smaller” might pop up today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a post to his social media accounts, Gurman says the iPhone SE 4 “should” launch next week after reporting late last week that a launch could happen “as early as this week.” Gurman says Apple will be holding product briefings next week for the new phone, which is as sure a sign of a release as anything. Apple rarely if ever holds pre-briefs, so press briefings would almost certainly be after the launch of the phone.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><div>\n<blockquote><p>New iPhone SE is still imminent and should be announced by next week, when the company is holding product briefings. Tomorrow there’s a smaller announcement. For Friday, Apple Vision Pro reps are reaching out to press about an announcement to come.

He doesn’t say whether it’s hardware or software and there aren’t any obvious product rumors that fit the description.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, Gurman says something related to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2231451/apple-vision-pro-review.html\">Vision Pro</a> could be coming soon as well. He says Apple Vision Pro reps will be “reaching out to press” this Friday about “an announcement to come.” It’s unlikely to be related to hardware upgrades or a new model, so expect a new feature or accessory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, Gurman also says a new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2303200/m4-macbook-air-design-price-specs-release.html\">MacBook Air with an M4 chip</a> will show up “within weeks.” Apple is also expected to launch an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2158175/ipad-11th-gen-2025-release-date.html\">update to the 10th-gen iPad</a> within the first quarter of 2025, but Gurman doesn’t say when that’s coming. Apple also needs to release the first beta of iOS 18.4, which will bring the long-awaited Siri upgrade with Apple Intelligence.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"62454db4a01f3c7777885fae6916a26b7c83a584fc078b955160c6c1fd81c7f5","category":"Apple"}
