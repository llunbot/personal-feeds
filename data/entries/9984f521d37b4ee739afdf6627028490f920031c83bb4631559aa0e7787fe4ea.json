This implementation is expected to persist until 2027's \"Pro\" ‌iPhone‌ models, which will also move the camera under the display for a true \"all screen\" appearance.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe forecast differs from <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/05/10/all-iphone-15-models-pill-and-hole-rumor/\">Young's initial roadmap</a> shared in May 2022. Previously, he expected 2024's <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16/\">iPhone 16</a> Pro models to be the first to feature under-panel ‌Face ID‌ technology. Last month, Young said that this one-year delay was due to \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/09/under-display-face-id-2025-ross-young/\">sensor issues</a>.\" The change means that the two display cutouts that currently compose the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/dynamic-island/\">Dynamic Island</a> will apparently persist unchanged through three successive \"Pro\" ‌iPhone‌ generations.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYoung also said that the standard ‌iPhone‌ 17 models <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/03/promotion-standard-iphones-2025/\">will adopt ProMotion</a>, a feature that is currently exclusive to Apple's high-end devices.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/face-id/\">Face ID</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ross-young/\">Ross Young</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/03/under-display-face-id-to-debut-on-iphone-17-pro/\">Under-Display Face ID Reportedly to Debut on 'iPhone 17 Pro'</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/under-display-face-id-reportedly-to-debut-on-iphone-17-pro.2385766/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"9984f521d37b4ee739afdf6627028490f920031c83bb4631559aa0e7787fe4ea","category":"Apple"}
