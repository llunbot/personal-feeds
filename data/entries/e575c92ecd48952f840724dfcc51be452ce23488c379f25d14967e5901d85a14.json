This update is adding the following further details: this threat is not a UEFI firmware implant or rootkit, it's a UEFI bootkit attacking the bootloader. The Bootkitty sample analyzed by ESET was not unkillable. Below is the article with inaccurate details removed.</p>\n<p>Researchers at security firm ESET said Wednesday that they found the first UEFI bootkit for Linux. The discovery may portend that UEFI bootkits that have targeted Windows systems in recent years may soon target Linux too.</p>\n<p>Bootkitty—the name unknown threat actors gave to their Linux bootkit—was uploaded to VirusTotal earlier this month. Compared to many Windows UEFI bootkits, Bootkitty is still relatively rudimentary, containing imperfections in key under-the-hood functionality and lacking the means to infect all Linux distributions other than Ubuntu. That has led the company researchers to suspect the new bootkit is likely a proof-of-concept release. To date, ESET has found no evidence of actual infections in the wild.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/11/found-in-the-wild-the-worlds-first-unkillable-uefi-bootkit-for-linux/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/11/found-in-the-wild-the-worlds-first-unkillable-uefi-bootkit-for-linux/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e575c92ecd48952f840724dfcc51be452ce23488c379f25d14967e5901d85a14","category":"Tech"}
