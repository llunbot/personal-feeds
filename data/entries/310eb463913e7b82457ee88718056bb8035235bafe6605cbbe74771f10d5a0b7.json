But the clock was ticking for <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/02/it-turns-out-that-odysseus-landed-on-the-moon-without-any-altimetry-data/\">Intuitive Machines' <em>Odysseus </em>spacecraft</a> after touching down on February 22 near the Moon's south pole.</p>\n<p>Each day and night on the Moon lasts two weeks. When the Sun sets, a solar-powered lunar lander like <i>Odysseus </i>is starved of energy. Temperatures during the lunar night plummet, bottoming out at around <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/solar-system/nasas-lro-finds-lunar-pits-harbor-comfortable-temperatures/#:~:text=The%20pits%2C%20and%20caves%20to,minus%20173%20C)%20at%20night.\">minus 280° Fahrenheit</a> (minus 173° Celsius).</p>\n<p>Over the course of two weeks, these cold temperatures can damage sensitive spacecraft equipment, killing a lander even if it could start generating power again at lunar sunrise. Surviving the night requires heat and electricity, and NASA officials say nuclear power is one of the most attractive solutions to this problem.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013310#p3\">Read 49 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2013310&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"310eb463913e7b82457ee88718056bb8035235bafe6605cbbe74771f10d5a0b7","category":"Tech"}
