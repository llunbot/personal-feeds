InÂ <em>Dustland Delivery</em>, my character, a sharpshooter, has tried to break the ice with the blacksmith he hired a few towns back, with only intermittent success.</p>\n<p>Remember that bodyguard, the one I unsuccessfully tried to flirt with at that bar? The blacksmith was uninterested. What about that wily junk dealer, or the creepy cemetery? Silence. She only wanted to discuss \"Abandoned train\" and \"Abandoned factory,\" even though, in this post-apocalypse, abandonment was not that rare. But I made a note to look out for any rusted remains; stress and mood are far trickier to fix than hunger and thirst.</p>\n<div><div></div><div>\n    <div></div>\n    <div>\n      <em>Dustland Delivery</em> release trailer.\n\n          </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n<p><a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943280/Dustland_Delivery/\"><em>Dustland Delivery</em></a>, available through Steam for Windows (and Proton/Steam Deck), puts you in the role typically taken up by NPCs in other post-apocalyptic RPGs.
