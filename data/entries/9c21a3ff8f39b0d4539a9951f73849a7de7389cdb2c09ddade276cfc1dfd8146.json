The most visible were the integrated taillights and Kashima-coated sliders, but those weren’t really what made this rack special and unique.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, the follow-up Piston Pro dropped $300 from the X’s price by losing those “gimmicks” while keeping the thing that made this rack really cool: The Pistons.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Piston Gimmick</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kuat-Piston-hitch-bike-rack-review-20.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kuat-Piston-hitch-bike-rack-review-20.webp\" alt=\"closeup details of cradle release button on kuat piston pro bike rack.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kuat-Piston-hitch-bike-rack-review-20.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kuat-Piston-hitch-bike-rack-review-20-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kuat-Piston-hitch-bike-rack-review-20-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kuat-Piston-hitch-bike-rack-review-20-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kuat-Piston-hitch-bike-rack-review-20-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Arguably, even the pneumatic pistons that open the tire cradles could be considered a gimmick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are they necessary? No. Do they make it easier to load bikes? Absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, you push the OneTap paddle to release the piston, which then pushes the tire cradle up and out. Tap both sides and you can easily load your bike in without having to juggle it while leveraging the cradles open.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a small thing, but when you have spouses and kids also loading bikes, or you have heavier e-bikes, it makes life easier. A lot easier. You can even tap it with your foot and it opens.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kuat-Piston-hitch-bike-rack-review-13.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1500\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kuat-Piston-hitch-bike-rack-review-13.webp\" alt=\"kuat piston pro bike rack shown on a vehicle.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kuat-Piston-hitch-bike-rack-review-13.webp 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kuat-Piston-hitch-bike-rack-review-13-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kuat-Piston-hitch-bike-rack-review-13-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kuat-Piston-hitch-bike-rack-review-13-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kuat-Piston-hitch-bike-rack-review-13-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The cradles open wide, and you can easily push them beyond horizontal if you need to. The only catch is that you HAVE to use the piston paddle to open the rack… don’t pull it open like normal or it can mess things up.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kuat-Piston-hitch-bike-rack-review-21.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kuat-Piston-hitch-bike-rack-review-21.webp\" alt=\"closeup details of tray release lever on kuat piston pro bike rack.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kuat-Piston-hitch-bike-rack-review-21.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kuat-Piston-hitch-bike-rack-review-21-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kuat-Piston-hitch-bike-rack-review-21-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kuat-Piston-hitch-bike-rack-review-21-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kuat-Piston-hitch-bike-rack-review-21-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s also a release lever that lets the rack pivot down for tailgate access and up for storage. And that lever can be pulled or pushed, and there’s an oversized lower half so you can use your foot to release it and lower the rack. The only niggle is that it’s located at the front of the rack, so you have to reach through the bikes to get to it, which could be an issue when expanding it to carry 3 or 4 bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>It’s Also a Great Rack</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kuat-Piston-hitch-bike-rack-review-19.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kuat-Piston-hitch-bike-rack-review-19.webp\" alt=\"closeup details of tire cradles on kuat piston pro bike rack.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kuat-Piston-hitch-bike-rack-review-19.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kuat-Piston-hitch-bike-rack-review-19-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kuat-Piston-hitch-bike-rack-review-19-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kuat-Piston-hitch-bike-rack-review-19-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kuat-Piston-hitch-bike-rack-review-19-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you don’t care about the piston feature, the Piston Pro is a great hitch bike rack. It has all of the simple-yet-sophisticated design that has always set Kuat apart. It’s rock solid, even with e-bikes. And it flips up close to the car for compact proportions when not in use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bikes are held securely, and there’s no frame contact at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kuat-Piston-hitch-bike-rack-review-23.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kuat-Piston-hitch-bike-rack-review-23.webp\" alt=\"closeup details of tire cradle adjustments on kuat piston pro bike rack.\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kuat-Piston-hitch-bike-rack-review-23.webp 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kuat-Piston-hitch-bike-rack-review-23-297x223.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kuat-Piston-hitch-bike-rack-review-23-1536x1152.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kuat-Piston-hitch-bike-rack-review-23-120x90.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kuat-Piston-hitch-bike-rack-review-23-768x576.webp 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Tire cradles have tool-free adjustments to fit almost any tire size except the smallest kids bikes.

And I think it looks kinda cool, so whatevs.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kuat-Piston-hitch-bike-rack-review-8.webp\"><img loading=\"lazy\"

All of them start with a 2-bike base, then add single or double trays later to expand capacity. You can buy them upfront as a bundle, or add them separately later… it’s the same price either way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 3- and 4-bike versions/extensions are only rated for use with 2″ hitches, but the 2-bike model is available for 1.25″ and 2″ hitches. And only the 2-bike version is rated for RV use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m being honest, the taillights aren’t <em>really</em> a gimmick. They’re pretty cool. And might be required (or at least very advisable) in some markets. Kashima-coated pistons? Meh. But the lights are cool, even if you can add aftermarket light kits for a fraction of the price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, I love this rack. Zero complaints. If you want something that’s compact, rock solid, durable, and looks great, check out the Kuat Piston Pro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://kuat.com/products/piston-pro\">Kuat.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/review-kuat-piston-hitch-bike-rack/\">Kuat Piston Hitch Bike Rack Review: All the Pistons with Lower Price</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Tyler Benedict","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"9c21a3ff8f39b0d4539a9951f73849a7de7389cdb2c09ddade276cfc1dfd8146","category":"Cycling"}
