Apple was developing Apple Watch and Apple Watch Ultra models that had a camera to view the wearer's surrounding environment, but work on those projects ended this week.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2024/09/Apple-Watch-Series-10-Jet-Black.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"898\" />\r<br />\nThe camera in the Apple Watch would not have been used for features like <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/facetime/\">FaceTime</a> or snapping photos, but instead would have allowed Apple Watch owners to get information about objects and places near them.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAn Apple Watch might have been able to do things like provide hours when pointed at a restaurant or store, identify a plant, describe an object, or offer language translations. The wearable camera functionality would have worked much like <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/visual-intelligence/\">Visual Intelligence</a>, an AI <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> feature that lets users point their camera at something to get more information.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple planned to release the camera-equipped Apple Watch models in 2027, but the plans are off. It's possible Apple could bring the technology back in the future, and it's not known why development ended.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThough Apple is no longer planning for an Apple Watch with a camera, it's still developing AirPods with tiny cameras inside. The AirPods cameras may be infrared sensors to enable features like enhanced spatial audio, in-air gesture control, and AI capabilities.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch/\">Apple Watch 10</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-watch-ultra/\">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch\">Apple Watch (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_Watch_Ultra\">Apple Watch Ultra (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/22/apple-watch-with-camera-canceled/\">Apple Stops Work on Camera-Equipped Apple Watch Planned for 2027</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-stops-work-on-camera-equipped-apple-watch-planned-for-2027.2457528/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"907e58742d209780d77c5bf5d2d8ce3d28a8e87824554908acc138713eed6bc5","category":"Apple"}
