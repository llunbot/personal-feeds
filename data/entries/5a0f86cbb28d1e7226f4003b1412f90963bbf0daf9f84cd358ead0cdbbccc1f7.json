We will make up for a bad strategic choice made 10 years ago.\"</p>\n<p>The new plan calls for the large, France-based rocket firm ArianeGroup to develop a new small-lift rocket called Maïa by the year 2026. This is four years ahead of a timeline previously set by the European Space Agency for the development of a significantly larger, reusable rocket.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1818450#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1818450&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5a0f86cbb28d1e7226f4003b1412f90963bbf0daf9f84cd358ead0cdbbccc1f7","category":"Tech"}
