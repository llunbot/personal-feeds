Especially when it’s at all-time low—<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Mini-A17-Pro/dp/B0DK3YF38G/\">Amazon is selling the A17 Pro iPad Mini for $399</a>, a savings of $100 off its MSRP and matching the best price we’ve ever seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2504744/ipad-mini-a17-pro-review.html\">reviewed the new iPad mini</a>, we gave it a four-star rating, loving the new fast CPU and graphics, as well as the fact that it supports Apple Intelligence. “The iPad mini is still a great tablet, perhaps the best at its size and better than larger, non-Apple tablets,” we concluded. It’s not a huge upgrade from the prior generation other than Apple Intelligence, but if you have an older model or are looking for something smaller, it’s a fantastic option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 8.3-inch Liquid Retina Display looks as gorgeous as we’ve become accustomed to from Apple. The colors are vibrant and bright, the details are sharp, and it’s perfect for reading, streaming content, and playing games. This model also now comes with a baseline storage of 128GB, which means you actually get to install a bunch of apps without worrying about space all the time. The A17 Pro iPad Mini A17 Pro works with either the Apple Pencil Pro (<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D3J71RM7\">on sale for $99</a>) and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CL7J12YK\">USB-C Apple Pencil,</a> so if you have an older model you’ll need to upgrade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since we’ve never seen the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Mini-A17-Pro/dp/B0DK3YF38G/\">A17 Pro iPad Mini for less</a>, it’s a great time to splurge and get yourself a great versatile tablet.</p>\n\n\n<span></span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Mini-A17-Pro/dp/B0DK3YF38G/\" target=\"_blank\">Buy now at Amazon</a></div>\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"bc3788ad7417985a2c3fd92e220c32fef6ffa7cf2ef39c16e79815f247c64812","category":"Apple"}
