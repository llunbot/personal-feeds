It feels like a pretty cool thing to have.’</p>\n<p>Quigley is the youngest and first Scottish person to hold the record.</p>\n<h2>The attempt: bacon cravings and party atmosphere</h2>\n<p>Guinness World Record rules dictated Quigley had to ride a UCI road-legal bike and he completed his attempt on a Pinarello Paris with tubeless tyres, which was serviced each night by his mobile mechanic.</p>\n<p>He was supported by a team of 10 who worked in four hour shifts to keep him going, namely to manage his various cravings which ranged from bacon rolls to cake, sweets and Lucozade.</p>\n<p>‘I was just shouting out random things to them that I wanted and one of the major challenges for the team was to manage this. I would get different cravings every day and they were amazing at dealing with that.’</p>\n<p>For the most part, Quigley’s record attempt suffered minimal hiccups, with no mechanical problems and the Scottish weather holding up save for one night of heavy rain.</p>\n<p>His record was also aided by the crowds of supporters who cheered him on as he rode through villages.</p>\n<p>‘All the people in the local area who were out supporting me were just incredible and I cannot thank them enough.</p>\n<p>‘It could have been soul-destroying riding up and down the same route for 18-20 hours every day but all the supporters along the route made it so special.</p>\n<p>‘There were people in fancy dress, music, horns blaring, it was like the Tour de France with a real party atmosphere.’</p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/09/josh_quigley_1_credit_thomas_haywood_aerial_photography.jpg?itok=oMtOgvCj\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>Despite everything going quite well, there was a major test for Quigley in the form of sleep deprivation.</p>\n<p>‘Sleep was the biggest challenge of the whole thing.</p>\n<p>‘Doing 250-300 miles isn’t a big challenge as I am obviously really fit at the moment but doing it day in and day out, back-to-back, when you are completely sleep deprived was a whole other level.</p>\n<p>‘On the third day and towards the weekend I could really feel it and had a few 20 minute power naps in the back of the van when I needed it.</p>\n<p>‘In the last two days I rode for 38 hours without sleep so since finishing everything has been a bit of a blur.’</p>\n<div>\n<div>    <img src=\"https://cdn1.cyclist.co.uk/sites/cyclist/files/styles/insert_main_wide_image/public/2021/09/josh_quigley_credit_thomas_haywood_aerial_photography.jpg?itok=rBF71D50\" />  </div>\n</div>\n<p>In January this year Quigley had a serious accident whilst training in Dubai, and sustained a broken collarbone, arm, shoulder and seven broken ribs.</p>\n<p>During his recovery he wanted to find a local challenge to aim for and help him get back in the saddle.</p>\n<p>Having followed previous seven day world record attempts, Quigley felt it was the perfect challenge but his first attempt in April was thwarted by a knee injury.</p>\n<p>The conditions for his September record allowed him to put the struggles behind him and get his name in the record books.</p>\n<div>      <div>See related </div>\n  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/10116/bianchi-matta-s9-the-stunning-italian-titanium-bike-youve-never-heard-of\">Bianchi Matta S9: The stunning Italian titanium bike you've never heard of</a></div>      <div><a href=\"/in-depth/1015/paris-roubaix-all-you-need-to-know\">Paris-Roubaix 2021: Route, start list and all you need to know</a></div>    </div></div><h2>Looking to the future, and the Tour de France</h2>\n<p>Following his epic achievement, which Quigley says is ‘the kind of thing you only do once but I would probably do again’, the endurance cyclist has his sights set on road racing.</p>\n<p>‘I want to transition to road racing and get to the Tour de France.</p>\n<p>‘I’d love to ride for Ineos Grenadiers as they are a British team, I’ve done some work with them and reckon I would be a natural fit.</p>\n<p>‘My goal now is to train and get signed in 2022.’</p>\n<p>Quigley is a talented and determined cyclist, whose grit and endurance has landed him in the history books several times, so who knows what he could achieve on the road.</p>\n<p>We look forward to finding out.</p>\n<p><i>Image credits: Thomas Haywood </i> </p>\n  </div>\n<div>  \n  <div>      <div><a href=\"/general-news\">General news</a></div>    </div></div>","author":"ecole","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"e303c7897e0e1eb0663ba7bfecb056b3680e6a459cbbb67d736adcd8c4a0aab3","category":"Cycling"}
