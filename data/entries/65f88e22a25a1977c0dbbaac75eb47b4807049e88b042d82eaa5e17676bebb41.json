While most visitors either scroll on mobile or click through with a mouse, many people only use their keyboards. Up to <a href=\"https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/public-health/what-doctors-wish-patients-knew-about-carpal-tunnel-syndrome\">10 million American adults</a> have carpal tunnel syndrome, which may cause pain when holding a mouse, and vision problems can make it difficult to follow a cursor. Consequently, you should keep your site <strong>keyboard navigable</strong> to achieve universal appeal and accessibility.</p>\nUnderstanding Keyboard Navigation\n<p>Keyboard navigation allows users to engage with your website solely through keyboard input. That includes using shortcuts and selecting elements with the Tab and Enter keys.</p>\n<p>There are <a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-shortcut-keys/\">more than 500 keyboard shortcuts</a> among operating systems and specific apps your audience may use. Standard ones for web navigation include Ctrl + F to find words or resources, Shift + Arrow to select text, and Ctrl + Tab to move between browser tabs. While these are largely the responsibilities of the software companies behind the specific browser or OS, you should still consider them.</p>\n<p><strong>Single-button navigation</strong> is another vital piece of keyboard navigability. Users may move between clickable items with the Tab and Shift keys, use the Arrow keys to scroll, press Enter or Space to “click” a link, and exit pop-ups with Esc.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/what-mean-site-be-keyboard-navigable/1-washington-post-homepage.png\" /></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/\">Washington Post homepage</a> goes further. Pressing Tab highlights clickable elements as it should, but the first button press brings up a link to the site’s accessibility statement first. Users can navigate past this, but including it highlights how the design understands how <strong>keyboard navigability is a matter of accessibility</strong>. </p>\n<p>You should understand how people may use these controls so you can build a site that facilitates them. These navigation options are generally standard, so any deviation or lack of functionality will stand out. Ensuring keyboard navigability, especially in terms of enabling these specific shortcuts and controls, will help you meet such expectations and avoid turning users away. </p>\nWhy Keyboard Navigation Matters In Web Design\n<p>Keyboard navigability is crucial for a few reasons. Most notably, it makes your site more accessible. In the U.S. alone, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2024/s0716-Adult-disability.html\">over one in four people</a> have a disability, and many such conditions affect technology use. For instance, motor impairments make it challenging for someone to use a standard mouse, and users with vision problems typically require keyboard and screen reader use.</p>\n<p>Beyond accounting for various usage needs, enabling a wider range of control methods makes a site convenient. Using a keyboard rather than a mouse is faster when it works as it should and may feel more comfortable. Considering how workers spend <a href=\"https://winfosoft.com/about-us/blogs-insights/benefits-of-implementing-erp-system/\">nearly a third of their workweek</a> looking for information, any obstacles to efficiency can be highly disruptive.</p>\n<p>Falling short in these areas may lead to legal complications. Regulations like the <strong>Americans with Disabilities Act</strong> necessitate tech accessibility. While the ADA <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/LSB10845\">has no binding rules</a> for what constitutes an accessible website, it specifically mentions keyboard navigation in its nonbinding guidance. Failing to support such functionality does not necessarily mean you’ll face legal penalties, but courts can use these standards to inform their decision on whether your site is reasonably accessible.</p>\n<p>In 2023, Kitchenaid <a href=\"https://topclassactions.com/disability-class-action-lawsuit/whirlpool-class-action-alleges-kitchenaid-website-not-accessible-to-visually-impaired-blind-visitors/\">faced a class-action lawsuit</a> for failing to meet such standards. Plaintiffs alleged that the company’s site didn’t support alt text or keyboard navigation, making it inaccessible to users with visual impairments. While the case ultimately settled out of court, it’s a reminder of the <strong>potential legal and financial repercussions of overlooking inclusivity</strong>. </p>\n<p>Outside the law, an inaccessible site presents <strong>ethical concerns</strong>, as it shows preferential treatment for those who can use a mouse, even if that’s unintentional. Even without legal action, public recognition of this bias may lead to a drop in visitors and a tainted public image.</p>\nElements Of A Keyboard-Navigable Site\n<p>Thankfully, ensuring <strong>keyboard navigability</strong> is a straightforward user experience design practice. Because navigation is standard across OSes and browsers, keyboard-accessible sites employ a few consistent elements.</p>\n<h3>Focus Indicators</h3>\n<p>Web Accessibility In Mind states that sites <a href=\"https://webaim.org/techniques/keyboard/\">must provide a visual indicator</a> of elements currently in focus when users press Tab. Focus indicators are typically a simple box around the highlighted icon.</p>\n<p>These are standard in CSS, but some designers hide them, so avoid using <code>outline:0</code> or <code>outline:none</code> to limit their visibility. You can also increase the contrast or change the indicator’s color in CSS.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/what-mean-site-be-keyboard-navigable/3-cnn-homepage.png\" /></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/\">CNN Breaking News homepage</a> is a good example of <strong>a strong focus indicator</strong>. Pressing Tab immediately brings up the box, which is bold enough to see easily and even uses a white border when necessary to stand out against black or dark-colored site elements.</p>\n<h3>Logical Tab Order</h3>\n<p>The order in which the focus indicator moves between elements also matters. Generally speaking, pressing the Tab key should move it from left to right and top to bottom — the same way people read in English.</p>\n<p>A few errors can stand in the way. Disabled buttons <a href=\"https://designerly.com/disabled-buttons/\">disrupt keyboard navigation flow</a> by skipping an element with no explanation or highlighting it without making it clickable. Similarly, an interface where icons don’t fall in a predictable left-to-right, top-to-bottom order will make logical tab movement difficult.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/what-mean-site-be-keyboard-navigable/4-sutton-maddock-vehicle-rental-site.png\" /></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.suttonmaddock.co.uk/\">Sutton Maddock Vehicle Rental</a> site is a good example of what not to do. When you press Tab, the focus indicator jumps from “Contact” to the Facebook link before going backward to the Twitter link. It starts at the right and moves left when it goes to the next line — the opposite order of what feels natural.</p>\n<h3>Skip Navigation Links</h3>\n<p>Skip links are also essential. These interactive elements let keyboard users jump to specific content without repeated keystrokes. Remember, these skips must be one of the first areas highlighted when you press Tab so they work as intended.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/what-mean-site-be-keyboard-navigable/5-hsbc-group-homepage.png\" /></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.hsbc.com/\">HSBC Group homepage</a> has a few skip navigation links. Pressing Tab pulls up three options, letting users quickly jump to whichever part of the site interests them.</p>\n<h3>Keyboard-Accessible Interactive Elements</h3>\n<p>Finally, all interactive elements on a keyboard-navigable site should be accessible via <strong>keystrokes</strong>. Anything people can click on or drag with a cursor should also support navigation and interaction. Enabling this is as simple as letting users select all items with the Tab or Arrow keys and press them with Space or Enter.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/what-mean-site-be-keyboard-navigable/6-arizona-state-university-keyboard-accessibility.png\" /></p>\n<p>Appropriately, this <a href=\"https://accessibility.asu.edu/articles/keyboard\">Arizona State University page on keyboard accessibility</a> showcases this concept well. All drop-down menus are possible to open by navigating to them via Tab and pressing Enter, so users don’t need a mouse to interact with them.</p>\nHow to Test for Keyboard Navigability\n<p>After designing a keyboard-accessible UX, you should test it to ensure that it works properly. The easiest way to do this is to explore the site solely with your keyboard. The chart below outlines the criteria to look for when determining whether your site is legitimately keyboard navigable.</p>\n<table>\n    <thead>\n        <tr>\n            <th></th>\n            <th>Keyboard Navigable</th>\n      <th>Not Keyboard Navigable</th>\n        </tr>\n    </thead>\n    <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td><strong>Clickable Elements</strong></td>\n            <td>All elements are reachable through the keyboard and open when you press Enter.</td>\n      <td>Only some elements are possible to reach through the keyboard. Some links may be broken or not open when you press Enter.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td><strong>Focus Indicators</strong></td>\n            <td>Pressing Tab, Space, or Enter brings up a focus indicator that is easy to see in all browsers.</td>\n      <td>Focus indicators may not appear when pressing all buttons. The box may be hard to see or only appear in some browsers.</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td><strong>Skip Navigation Links</strong></td>\n            <td>Pressing Tab for the first time pulls up at least one skip link to take users to much-visited content or menus. Continuing to press Tab moves the focus indicator past these links to highlight elements on the page as normal.</td>\n      <td>No skip links appear when pressing Tab for the first time. Alternatively, they appear after moving through all other elements. Skip links may not be functional.</td>\n        </tr>\n    <tr>\n            <td><strong>Screen Reader Support</strong></td>\n            <td>Screen readers can read each element when highlighted with the focus indicator.</td>\n      <td>Some elements may not encourage any action from screen readers when highlighted.</td>\n        </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>The <strong>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</strong> <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/keyboard.html\">outline two test rules</a> to verify keyboard navigability:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The first ensures all interactive elements are accessible via the Tab key,</li>\n<li>The second checks for keyboard scroll functionality.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Employ both standards to review your UX before making a site live.</p>\n<p>Typical issues include the inability to highlight elements with the Tab key or things that don’t fall in a natural order. You can discover both problems by trying to access everything with your keyboard. However, you may prefer to conduct a navigability audit through a third party. Many private companies offer these services, but you can also <a href=\"https://www.boia.org/\">use the Bureau of Internet Accessibility</a> for a basic WCAG audit.</p>\nMake Your Site Keyboard Navigable Today\n<p>Keyboard navigability ensures you cater to all needs and preferences for an inclusive, accessible website design. While it’s straightforward to implement, it’s also easy to miss, so remember these principles when designing your UX and testing your site.</p>\n<p>WCAG provides several techniques you can employ to meet keyboard accessibility standards and enhance your users’ experience:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G90\">Technique G90</a>, for keyboard-triggered event handlers</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G202\">Technique G202</a>, for general keyboard functionality</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H91\">Technique H91</a>, for forming controls and links in HTML</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Follow these guidelines and use WCAG’s test rules to create an accessible site.
