Starting with the AirPods Pro with MagSafe Charging Case, you can get this model for <strong>$189.99</strong> on <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09JQMJHXY%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\"><strong>Amazon</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/153062/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-pro-with-magsafe%2F-%2FA-77603773\"><strong>Target</strong></a>, down from $249.00.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/new-airpods-pro-holiday.jpg\" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with these vendors.

Both Amazon and Target have stock and are ready to ship the AirPods Pro out today, and Target is offering the same sale in stores, stock permitting.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09JQMJHXY%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$59 OFF</div>AirPods Pro for $189.99</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\nSecondly, the AirPods 2 with Wired Charging Case is available for <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/153062/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441\"><strong>$89.00</strong></a>, down from $159.00. This early Black Friday sale price is only available at Walmart as of writing, and it's a great deal for anyone okay with investing in an older AirPods model.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/153062/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$70 OFF</div>AirPods 2 w/ Wired Charging Case for $89.00</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\nLastly, if you want the newest AirPods, Amazon does have the AirPods 3 at a discounted price, although a very slight one.
