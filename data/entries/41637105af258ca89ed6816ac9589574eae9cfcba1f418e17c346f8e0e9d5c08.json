It works by attaching the ‌AirTag‌'s upper housing to the built-in custom contact in the TimeCapsule, which provides power instead of the coin cell battery.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe enclosure then screws shut, and it can be tucked away in a vehicle, luggage, camera bag, or other expensive item. The case has IP69 waterproofing that's able to withstand exposure to water and dust in harsh environments, so it can be used outdoors.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTimeCapsule does add additional weight and size to the ‌AirTag‌ because it needs to house AA batteries, but it's still slim enough to fit well in bags without adding too much bulk. The setup measures in at 4.45 inches by 1.57 inches, and it's 0.75 inches thick. The enclosure is nondescript, though, so if something containing the TimeCapsule is stolen, the thief isn't likely to know what it is.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe TimeCapsule can be <a href=\"https://www.elevationlab.com/products/timecapsule\">purchased for $20</a> from the Elevation Lab website <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D1LHBZGL%2F\">or from Amazon</a>.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airtag/\">AirTag</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/elevationlab/\">Elevation Lab</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/18/timecapsule-10-year-airtag-battery/\">Your AirTag's Battery Will Last for Up to 10 Years With Elevation Lab's New TimeCapsule Enclosure</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/your-airtags-battery-will-last-for-up-to-10-years-with-elevation-labs-new-timecapsule-enclosure.2445729/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"41637105af258ca89ed6816ac9589574eae9cfcba1f418e17c346f8e0e9d5c08","category":"Apple"}
