This is $10 off from the rock bottom $159.99 price tag we tracked on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and still a great deal for anyone shopping this holiday season.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/11/airpods-pro-blue-holiday-3.jpg\" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon.

Free delivery on Amazon currently gives a December 17 - 18 date, so although the AirPods Pro aren't technically in stock now, you can order them now at this discounted price and still get them before the end of the month.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09JQMJHXY%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$79 OFF</div>AirPods Pro with MagSafe for $169.99</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nOtherwise, the most consistent deal we've been tracking on AirPods post-Black Friday has been on the AirPods 3, available for <a href=\"https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=3088&amp;GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB09JQL3NWT%3Ftag%3Dmacrumors-20%26linkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1\"><strong>$149.99</strong></a> on Amazon, down from $179.00. You'll see this price tag at checkout after a $19.99 coupon is automatically applied, and Amazon is also currently guaranteeing a delivery date around December 11.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWe track sales for every model of the AirPods in our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-deals/\">Best AirPods Deals</a> guide, so be sure to bookmark that page while you shop around for the wireless headphones.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/\">Apple Deals</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro\">AirPods Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/06/deals-airpods-pro-christmas/\">Deals: AirPods Pro With MagSafe Available for $169.99 and Christmas Delivery on Amazon ($79 Off)</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/deals-airpods-pro-with-magsafe-available-for-169-99-and-christmas-delivery-on-amazon-79-off.2326399/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=kUHBr-omjyI:p8fARCelD7I:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=kUHBr-omjyI:p8fARCelD7I:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Mitchel Broussard","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1b38e26520a84c14fbfc79dbfb3a0805cf0e0d5d79c4beedf6cdea1d3daa03ac","category":"Apple"}
