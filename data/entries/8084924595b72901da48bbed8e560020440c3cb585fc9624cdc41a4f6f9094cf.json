X has accused Media Matters of manipulating the site's algorithm by endlessly scrolling and refreshing.</p>\n<p>Bailey yesterday issued an <a href=\"https://ago.mo.gov/wp-content/uploads/Final-CID-to-Media-Matters.pdf\">investigative demand</a> seeking names and addresses of all Media Matters donors who live in Missouri and a range of internal communications and documents regarding the group's research on Musk and X. Bailey anticipates that Media Matters won't provide the requested materials, so he filed the lawsuit asking Cole County Circuit Court for an order to enforce the investigative demand.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012671#p3\">Read 22 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2012671&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jon Brodkin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8084924595b72901da48bbed8e560020440c3cb585fc9624cdc41a4f6f9094cf","category":"Tech"}
