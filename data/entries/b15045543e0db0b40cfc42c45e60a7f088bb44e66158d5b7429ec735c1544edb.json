competition. That all changed when they launched the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearbikingwomensmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fgiro-latch-cycling-shoe-womens\">Latch Women’s</a> flat pedal shoes a couple years ago, a move that catapulted them to the top of many “best of” lists, including this one. </p><p></p><p>Straight out of the box, the Giro Latch looks great with relatively traditional flat pedal shoe styling, and they come in three color options including the Harbor Blue/Sandstone (greenish) color we tested. We found them to be immediately comfortable with no break-in required thanks to a true-to-size fit, crowd-pleasing medium volume, and a nicely shaped heel cup that grabs your ankle and keeps your heels locked down. Traditional laces do a great job of drawing tension evenly over the top of the foot with an elastic retainer to keep them tidy while you ride. The lightweight Microfiber upper material is fairly weather-resistant but respectably breathable on hot days due to a large number of perforations above the toes, sides, and even the heels of the shoes. Coming in at just over 319 grams at size 42 (9.5 US W’s), they are super lightweight for their category of shoe. </p><p></p><p>More importantly, they perform very well on the bike. While the soles feel fairly stiff initially, they’ve got a nicely balanced flex that’s stiff and supportive enough to feel efficient while pedaling while flexing just enough to maintain a good pedal feel. The Mute Foam midsole is noticeably damp, providing comfort on the pedals through the chunky descents and resisting getting bounced while remaining thin enough to feel the pedal underfoot for a strong grip on the pins. Giro’s proprietary Tack Rubber outsole is also nice and tacky to maintain grip when you need it, but the fairly shallow Gamma tread design allows for predictable foot mobility when necessary. Off the bike, the Latch is comfortable and easy to walk in although the shallow tread can be a little slippery in mud or snow.</p><p></p><p>During testing, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearbikingwomensmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fgiro-latch-cycling-shoe-womens\">Giro Latch Women’s</a> quickly became the go-to flat pedal shoe of the test group. Despite lots of abuse, the uppers are still in great shape and have proven to be super durable. The soles continue to offer an ideal blend of grip and predictable mobility and the Tack rubber barely shows any signs of wear after months of use.

It has seen some minor changes over time, most recently the move to the Max Grip outsole that has improved its grip on the pedals. </p><p></p><p>The Livewire has a snugger fit than any of the other flat shoes tested. They are made with RC’s Low Volume last that “is designed for an athletic fit” and intended to provide support and security without the need to crank the laces super tight. As such, they work best for those with low to medium-volume feet, and even then, the toe box can feel a bit cramped which can be relieved by sizing up which Ride Concepts suggests anyway. The tighter toe is due to the custom molded TPU toe protection that does not stretch over time, and while it does provide great toe protection, it won’t really break in and give you more space. </p><p></p><p>The uppers are constructed of synthetic panels on the sides with “abrasion-resistant mesh” that allows for pretty good breathability on hot days but offers very little in the way of weather resistance. These shoes will get wet on rainy days, stream crossings, and hiking through snow patches. Simple laces effectively snug up the shoes as needed with an elastic lace tuck to keep them in line. The Livewire has a gusseted tongue that helps keep it lined up, provides a snug and secure fit, and also works to keep dirt and debris from entering your shoes. The heel cup is nicely padded to keep the heel in place and provide a little extra protection, and the aforementioned molded TPU around the toes helps keep them well-protected too. </p><p></p><p>The soles have a flex level 3 on RC’s scale of 1-5, providing a good middle-of-the-road stiffness that works well across most riding styles. They feel efficient and supportive enough to prevent foot and calf fatigue on long pedaling missions and chunky descents while still providing ample feedback from the pedals. The outsole is made of Ride Concept’s tackiest Max Grip rubber with a hexagonal dot tread pattern that we feel rivals the best grip of any model tested and these shoes cling well to the pedal pins. Off the bike, they walk fairly well, but we’ve found they tend to slip around a bit in loose dirt, mud, and snow during hike-a-bikes.</p><p></p><p>Overall, we feel the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10270&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearbikingwomensmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.evo.com%2Fshoes%2Fride-concepts-livewire-womens%23image%3D215289%2F897314%2Fride-concepts-livewire-shoes-women-s\">Livewire Women’s</a> is a great shoe for any rider, whether you’re just getting into the sport or are an experienced rider who just wants a reasonably priced shoe that will last. These shoes perform nearly on par with more expensive options and are versatile enough to work well for everything from pedal-heavy trail rides to long days lapping the bike park. Ride Concepts also makes a Youth and Men’s version of this shoe, so you can get the whole family matching out on the trail if that’s your thing. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10270&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearbikingwomensmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.evo.com%2Fshoes%2Fride-concepts-livewire-womens%23image%3D215289%2F897314%2Fride-concepts-livewire-shoes-women-s\">Check Price at Evo</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tRunner-Up Best Flat Pedal Women's Mountain Bike Shoes\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearbikingwomensmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F188182%2Ffive-ten-freerider-pro-mountain-bike-shoes-womens\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFive Ten Freerider Pro Women’s\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$160</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight (per shoe)</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>334 grams (9 US Women's/41.5 EU)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Pedal Type</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Clip</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Outsole</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Stealth S1 rubber</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Upper Material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Synthetic</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Midsole</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>EVA</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Closure</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Laces</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Sizes Available</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>5 – 11 US Women's (whole and half sizes)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Five-Ten-Freerider-Pro-Womens.jpeg\">\n<img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"593\" height=\"395\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Five-Ten-Freerider-Pro-Womens.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Women’s Mountain Bike Shoes of 2024\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Five-Ten-Freerider-Pro-Womens.jpeg 593w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Five-Ten-Freerider-Pro-Womens-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Five-Ten-Freerider-Pro-Womens-120x80.jpeg 120w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Grippy Stealth rubber soles</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Tough and weather resistant synthetic uppers</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Well balanced sole stiffness</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Slightly larger size range than some other brands</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Not the best traction for hike a bikes in loose or slippery conditions</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Roomier toe box – runs a little large – check size chart</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Soles show wear more quickly than others</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Jeremy Benson</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearbikingwomensmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F188182%2Ffive-ten-freerider-pro-mountain-bike-shoes-womens\">Five Ten Freerider Pro</a> set the benchmark for flat pedal shoes years ago and it continues to be one of the most popular models on the market. It has enjoyed a very long run of dominance, but recently it has seen some stronger competition. Still, it is one of the best all-around models there is, with grippy Stealth Rubber soles and a design that hasn’t made any significant changes over the years because it hasn’t needed to. </p><p></p><p>Overall, the Freerider Pro has a comfortable and crowd-pleasing fit, but we found they run a bit larger size-wise than other models and we sized down a half-size to get the right fit. Even then, the toe box is a bit roomier, allowing a bit more movement of the toes and making them more accommodating for those with above-average width feet. That said, riders with narrower feet might find them to be a bit too roomy. Standard laces tighten the shoes over the mid-foot although the lack of a specific lace retainer means you have to use the tongue holder to pin them down while riding. </p><p></p><p>The synthetic leather upper material breaks in nicely after a few rides while feeling quite durable and weather-resistant. Ventilation perforations through the uppers are limited to the area above the toes, however, the larger diameter of the holes still provides reasonable breathability. They also have a stiff, abrasion-resistant layer around the heel cup and toe, extra padding on the medial ankle for support, and a reinforced toe box to ward off rock strikes and the like.</p><p></p><p>On the bike, the soles provide great support for the feet with a sole stiffness that lends itself well to long trail rides or days at the bike park alike. They don’t provide the most pedal feedback, but once the feet are planted on the pedals, they tend to stay put. One of the primary reasons for this is Five Ten’s Stealth S1 Rubber outsole with the classic raised dot tread design which is sticky and grabs hold of the pedal pins for a tenacious grip. The tradeoff for that grip is that we found the soles tend to show wear a bit more quickly than other shoes we tested, but the grip remains solid even as they wear.

With stiff soles, a streamlined design, Boa closures, and a super breathable upper, these shoes are a great option for those who prioritize comfort and pedaling efficiency. They’re also quite versatile and can easily span riding styles from pedal-heavy trail rides to XC races and long days out on the gravel bike. </p><p></p><p>The Sector W’s is made with a super breathable mesh upper material that Giro calls <em>Synchwire</em>. This coarse mesh material has a <em>thermo-bonded exo structure </em>that covers large portions of the Synchwire material, but it is still incredibly porous and allows for very impressive breathability. The airflow in these shoes is incredible and they are great for riding in warm to scorching hot conditions. Additionally, the uppers have a good amount of flexibility and they conform to the feet quite nicely. We found they fit true to size with a snug, performance fit that is enhanced by the dual Boa L6 closure. The Boa dials make it super quick and easy to get these shoes on and off, plus they’re incredibly easy to adjust on the fly to change tension during your ride. Both the toe and heel feature reinforcements to protect them, but otherwise these are a thin and lightweight model that doesn’t offer much foot protection. Regardless, we found them to be super comfortable and secure on the feet.</p><p></p><p>The midsole features a stiff carbon composite plate that enhances pedaling efficiency. Along with the snug and secure fit of the uppers, the soles feel like they are transferring virtually all of your pedaling energy into forward momentum with plenty of support to keep the feet and calves from getting fatigued on long rides. The outsole consists of a<em> dual-injected</em> rubber tread with large tread blocks under the heel and bordering the cleat box, with some smaller lugs at the toe. This tread provides surprisingly good grip off the bike, but the stiffness of the soles means they still aren’t the best for extended periods of walking. Still, the cleat box is deep enough that the cleats don’t protrude from the sole when walking on rocks or stopping to grab a mid-ride espresso. They are also capable of fitting removable toe spikes should you wish to add them for grip in loose dirt or muddy conditions.</p><p></p><p>The construction and features of the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearbikingwomensmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fgiro-sector-mountain-bike-shoe-womens\">Sector Women’s</a> sets them apart and they are in a different performance class from all of the other women’s specific shoes we tested. The fit, comfort, breathability, pedaling performance, and even the look of these shoes are a cut above the rest. That is also reflected in the comparatively hefty price tag, but if you’re looking for a high-performance shoe that has you covered for everything from racing to training in warm to hot weather, the Giro Sector is a great option to consider. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearbikingwomensmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fgiro-sector-mountain-bike-shoe-womens\">Check Price at Backcountry</a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B088XV9173/?tag=brbgfootwearbikingwomensmountainbikeshoes-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\tBest Budget XC Clipless Women's Mountain Bike Shoes\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearbikingwomensmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F178895%2Fshimano-xc3-mountain-bike-shoes-womens\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tShimano XC3 Women’s\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$125</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight (per shoe)</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>311 grams (9.5 US Women's/42 EU)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Pedal Type</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Clip</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Outsole</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Rubber</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Upper Material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Seamless, perforated synthetic leather composite</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Midsole</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Lightweight glass fiber reinforced nylon</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Closure</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Boa L6 dial</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Sizes Available</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>36 – 44 EU (whole sizes only)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Shimano-XC3-Womens.jpeg\">\n<img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1040\" height=\"693\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Shimano-XC3-Womens.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Women’s Mountain Bike Shoes of 2024\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Shimano-XC3-Womens.jpeg 1040w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Shimano-XC3-Womens-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Shimano-XC3-Womens-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Shimano-XC3-Womens-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Shimano-XC3-Womens-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Shimano-XC3-Womens-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Glove-like fit</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Lightweight</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Reasonable price</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Low volume may not work for everyone</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>No half sizes</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Jeremy Benson</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearbikingwomensmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F178895%2Fshimano-xc3-mountain-bike-shoes-womens\">Shimano XC3 Women’s</a> shoes have a high-end look and feel but come at a fraction of the cost of more expensive XC-style models. With a seamless synthetic upper and Boa closure, these shoes provide a glove-like fit and a high level of comfort with a moderately stiff sole that should work well for many riders and types of riding. </p><p></p><p>The XC3 Women’s shoes have a seamless, perforated upper with an overlapping tongue that provides a comfortable and secure wraparound fit. Shimano says it fits like a glove and we found that they do, which is partly because they have a lower volume fit. In fact, we’d say that Shimano’s Dynalast fit is the lowest volume of all the models we tested, particularly around the toes, yet the “anatomically curved last that eliminates angles and conforms better to the natural contours of your foot” shows in the fit being perfectly snug but not in a bad way. The shoes are cupped in the right places while still allowing our tester’s foot to sit in an athletic position inside. </p><p></p><p>The synthetic uppers have lots of perforations above the toes to allow them to breathe, but the rest of the shoe can feel a little stuffy. The flip side is that they repel moisture better than similar options. The toes and heels are protected with a bit of reinforcement with an abrasion-resistant coating to protect those high-wear areas. The single Boa L6 dial works well to snug the shoes around the foot, although the placement in the center takes a little getting used to when putting the shoes on and taking them off the first few times.</p><p></p><p>Moving to the soles, the XC3 has a <em>glass fiber-reinforced nylon</em> midsole with a stiffness rating of 5 on Shimano’s scale of 1 to 11. While that falls around the middle of their stiffness scale, we found they still provide an efficient pedaling experience thanks to the secure fit while avoiding ever feeling like they are too stiff. The “rubber XC racing pattern outsole” tread pattern walks and hikes surprisingly well, it is less aggressive than some while still having plenty of grip. The cleat box has raised lines so the cleats stay put while attaching and adjusting making it easy to match both sides and get a precise cleat placement.  </p><p></p><p>This <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearbikingwomensmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F178895%2Fshimano-xc3-mountain-bike-shoes-womens\">Shimano XC3 W’s</a> is an affordable cross-country or gravel shoe that has sleek looks and high-end features at a very approachable price. They aren’t the stiffest shoes out there, but they are sure to meet the needs of most non-competitive riders. Whether you’re grinding gravel or heading out for casual XC rides, these are a lightweight, well-priced option to consider. </p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a

Concepts Hellion Clip Women’s</a> is the clipless version of the brand’s popular flat pedal shoe, the Hellion. As such, it looks quite similar with a few different features that are designed to enhance its performance for clipless pedal riders. Most notably, they’ve beefed up the sole stiffness, changed the sole rubber compound, and added a velcro strap at the top of the laces to better lock the heel in place. We feel they’re a good option for everything from aggressive trail riding to sessioning laps at the bike park.</p><p></p><p>The Hellion Clip has a low-volume fit that, not surprisingly, works well for low to medium-volume feet. The fit is quite snug and secure and the lace closure allows you to get a custom fit around the mid and upper foot. The Velcro strap at the top of the tongue adds a bit of additional security to lock the heel down into the heel pocket for pulling up on the pedals while climbing or sprinting and to keep the feet feeling secure over rough terrain on the descents. The microfiber uppers feel a little stiff out of the box and take a few rides to break in and they’ve proven to be quite durable and weather-resistant, but they can feel a bit warm on hot days even though they have quite a few perforations to allow some breathability. That said, they are quite protective with a stout feel, a medium level of padding throughout, and TPU abrasion resistance around the toe and heel with substantial internal reinforcement for the toes. </p><p></p><p>The EVA midsole works well to mute vibration while the <em>RC Powerdrive</em> shank adds some stiffness and support to give the shoes a flex rating of 5 on Ride Concept’s scale of 1 to 5. While they are noticeably less stiff than the XC-oriented Giro Sector, for example, they provide a reasonable level of stiffness for a shoe of this style. The slight flex in the soles combined with their heavier weight doesn’t make them feel like the most efficient shoes, a tradeoff for their foot protection and downhill-oriented performance, but they work well enough to get you to the top and then shine on the descents. The outsole consists of Ride Concept’s Clip Grip rubber with a raised hexagonal tread. The long cleat box with 42mm of adjustment range means there are plenty of options for cleat placement and clipping in and out with these shoes is a breeze. They are fairly easy to walk around in, but like flat pedal shoes with similar sole designs, they don’t provide a ton of traction in loose conditions.</p><p></p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=18465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearbikingwomensmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.performancebike.com%2Fride-concepts-womens-hellion-clipless-shoe-charcoal-manzanita-5-2283-510%2Fp1411511%3Fv%3D1345038\">Ride Concepts Hellion Clip Women’s</a> is a beefy all-mountain shoe that caters more towards riders with a focus on the descents. They provide good foot protection, a durable construction, and styling reminiscent of your favorite flat pedal shoes in a clipless package. They aren’t the lightest or the stiffest, but they work well for their intended purpose of dropping your heels and descending with confidence and style.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a

Izumi X-Alp Summit</a> is a unique clipless model that combines medium sole stiffness with a lugged Vibram outsole to create a shoe that performs relatively well on the bike and better than most off the bike. We found they are best for casual-paced, adventurous rides where the terrain might force you off the bike and onto your feet regularly. </p><p></p><p>The X-Alp Summit Shoes have a seamless, perforated synthetic upper that is secured over the foot by a single Boa L6 dial and a velcro strap to pull some tension over the forefoot. They have a fairly roomy fit, especially in the forefoot, that will work best for those with medium to above-average-width feet. This reviewer has a lower volume foot, and while they felt relatively good initially, the higher volume of these shoes became more apparent as they broke in. That said, they are quite comfortable and the single Boa dial works well to tension the shoe over the upper and mid-foot. The Velcro strap, however, doesn’t do much to snug the shoe around the forefoot, unfortunately. Depending on the volume of your feet, this could provide an excellent fit or result in a bit of movement and potentially a slight reduction in control. The X-Alp Summit is also well-ventilated with ample perforations above the toes and along the sides of the foot, as well as a then mesh tongue that helps keep the feet cool on hot days. Light reinforcement of the toes and generous padding around the ankle pocket provide a bit of additional protection for the feet. </p><p></p><p>The X-Alp Summit has a <em>nylon composite</em> sole that Pearl Izumi claims balances pedaling efficiency with walkability. The flex of the sole most certainly benefits their walkability and gives them a very natural walking feel with flex through the toes, and the lugged Vibram ECOSTEP outsole provides confident traction more akin to a hiking shoe when you’re pushing your bike up or down a steep section or walking out to a rocky vista point. On the pedals, however, they are by far the softest flexing of the clipless models we tested and you can definitely feel that in comparison.

It’s got similar looks and some of the features of its higher-end siblings, just in a slightly relaxed package that should suit more casual riders a bit better. </p><p></p><p>The MTB Comp Boa has what Scott refers to as their <em>Sport Fit</em> with a relaxed and larger volume last. This should work well for those with wider and higher volume feet, especially in the forefoot and toe box where the added volume is the most noticeable. Even with lower-volume feet, the Boa L6 dial works well to get them snug around the upper and midfoot while the uniquely angled Velcro strap over the forefoot worked admirably to add a little tension up front. Still, if you don’t have a higher volume foot, there will likely be a bit of wiggle room by the toes. The synthetic uppers are supple out of the box and quite comfortable with a mesh panel over the toes and loads of perforations on the sides of the feet that provide great breathability. The toe box is nicely reinforced to take the sting out of rock strikes and abrasion-resistant material has been added at the toe and heel as well.</p><p></p><p>The nylon/glass composite sole has a stiffness rating of 6 on Scott’s scale of 1-10, giving them pedaling efficiency that is better than expected for the price. They feel stiff and supportive underfoot, helping transfer your energy directly into the pedals without being punishingly stiff the way some uber-stiff soles can feel. That said, if these shoes are too high volume for your foot, some of your power could be wasted by excessive foot movement. The outsole consists of a number of sole lugs made from Scott’s <em>Sticki Rubber</em> which provide decent off-the-bike grip on most surfaces along with two fixed toe spikes to claw into loose soils or mud. The stiffness of the soles, however, doesn’t lend itself well to prolonged periods of hike-a-bike. The cleat box is a bit longer than average for an XC-style shoe, which makes it easier to find your ideal cleat placement.</p><p></p><p>If you’ve got wider than average feet and you’re looking for an XC-style mountain bike shoe that provides an efficient pedaling experience and is offered at a very reasonable price, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C15RV7JX/?tag=brbgfootwearbikingwomensmountainbikeshoes-20\">Scott MTB Comp Boa</a> could be the ideal shoe for you. Whether you’re a trail rider, XC enthusiast, or gravel rider, these shoes perform well, look the part, and won’t cost you an arm and a leg.</p></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C15RV7JX/?tag=brbgfootwearbikingwomensmountainbikeshoes-20\">Check Price at Amazon</a></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearbikingwomensmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fshimano-sh-gr5-cycling-shoe-womens\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tShimano GR5 Women’s\t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<h3>\n\t\tSpecs\t</h3>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>MSRP</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>$115</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Weight (per shoe)</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>363 grams (42 EU/ 9.5 US Women's)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Pedal Type</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Flat</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Outsole</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Shimano rubber</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Upper Material</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Synthetic</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Midsole</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>not specified</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Closure</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Laces with elastic lace retainer</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<strong>Sizes Available</strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>36 – 44 EU (whole sizes only)</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Shimano-GR5-Womens.jpeg\">\n<img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"975\" height=\"650\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Shimano-GR5-Womens.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Women’s Mountain Bike Shoes of 2024\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Shimano-GR5-Womens.jpeg 975w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Shimano-GR5-Womens-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Shimano-GR5-Womens-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Shimano-GR5-Womens-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Shimano-GR5-Womens-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Shimano-GR5-Womens-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tPros\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Reasonable price</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\"Volume last\" is good for those with wider feet</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Good off-the-bike traction and walkability</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Toe and ankle protection</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\tCons\t\t</h4>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>Rubber sole is not as grippy as other brands</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>May be too voluminous for those with narrower feet</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\n<span>\n\t<span>Jeremy Benson</span>\n</span>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<div>\t<p>Shimano makes a handful of women’s mountain bike shoes and the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearbikingwomensmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fshimano-sh-gr5-cycling-shoe-womens\">GR5</a> is their budget-friendly flat pedal model. While they recently added some new models to their line, the GR5 is still widely available and very reasonably priced, especially now that it can be found on sale from most retailers. We found it to be a very comfortable shoe that will work best for those with high-volume feet and who might prefer a sole that is a bit less grippy than the competition and allows for easier foot mobility.</p><p></p><p>The Shimano <em>Volume Last</em> is on the higher volume and of the spectrum, meaning there is a lot of space around the toes and the upper part of the feet, making them a solid option for those with voluminous or wider feet. That said, the heel cup with the asymmetric cuff provides additional ankle protection and some added security to hold the heel in place even with a medium-volume foot. The durable synthetic upper lined in mesh features a lightly textured toe protection to provide abrasion resistance and there is an added layer of the same textured material stitched around the heel. The upper did stretch and pack out quickly, but the materials seem very durable and the shoes are well made. There are ample perforations above the toes and on the sides of the uppers, allowing for good breathability while remaining fairly weather-resistant.</p><p></p><p>As expected with a less expensive shoe, the flex is on the softer side but they have a very distinct pedal feel and provide enough midsole support even on long descents. Given the softer flex and thinner midsole, you can feel the pedal pins and there is a high level of feedback. Shimano’s rubber sole is not the grippiest either, so adjusting the foot on the pedals comes easily and you will always know where you are placed on the pedals, but they don’t cling to the pins like other shoes we tested. This can be a pro or a con, depending on what you prefer, as it means your feet can be less planted without proper pressure control. But, if you like it to be easier to move your feet around, these could be a great option. That said, we found that when the rubber got cold, the grip was noticeably reduced. Off the bike, they do hike relatively well for a flat-soled shoe.

For well over a decade we’ve been reporting on the latest news, tech, and products in cycling. And, in addition to being bike nerds, we’re also avid cyclists who love riding bikes as much as we like writing about them. As such, we also know the difference that having the right gear can make for our comfort, performance, and enjoyment while we ride. Mountain bike shoes are of particular importance because they are one of two connections to our bike that we use to propel ourselves uphill and control our bikes on the way back down. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For our women’s mountain bike shoes buyer’s guide, we recruited Kira Deschaux to test and compare nine different models of clipless and flat pedal models. Kira is a skilled mountain biker and mountain bike coach based in the Lake Tahoe/Reno, NV area. She has a racing background but recently has gravitated towards steep, aggressive, technical trails. Kira has been mountain biking for 13+ years and enjoys all types of riding from lapping the lifts all day at the bike park to going out for long gravel grinds. She has worked in the outdoor industry for 20 years including in retail soft and hard goods in the snowboard and mountain bike industries in the western US and New Zealand. Kira’s riding and work experience combine to give her unique insight into product quality, technical features, and design from the inside out, and her ongoing search for the best and highest quality mountain bike gear to perform at her best means that she loves to try new brands and products as much as possible. As a coach with a background in retail, she also understands the range of needs of people from a variety of backgrounds, skill levels, and riding styles. Additionally, Kira has lent her expertise in testing and review of the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-womens-mountain-bike-shorts/\">best women’s mountain bike shorts</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After researching the best women’s mountain bike shoes on the market, we gathered a diverse selection of 9 models, 4 flat pedal, and 5 clipless, for side-by-side testing. Kira spent the summer and fall putting these shoes through their paces on a huge variety of trails and in varying weather conditions. From strenuous hike-a-bikes to steep downhills, casual trail rides to long gravel grinds, and everything in between, these shoes were tested for months to determine their strengths and weaknesses and how they compare to each other. While testing, Kira focused on important performance characteristics and took copious notes before making her recommendations. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Kira-testing-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Kira-testing-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Kira Deschaux testing women's mountain bike shoes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Kira-testing-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Kira-testing-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Kira-testing-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Kira-testing-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Kira-testing-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Kira-testing-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Kira-testing-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Kira-testing-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Kira Deschaux spent months testing the shoes in this review, seen here riding in the Ride Concepts Hellion Livewire.

Getting shoes that fit properly is obviously an incredibly important piece of the puzzle, and beyond that, finding shoes that work well for your riding style (or styles) and work with your pedals of choice (clipless or flats) will help you narrow down the options to find what you need.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What Type of Pedals Do You Use?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is pretty obvious, but it’s critical to get shoes that are designed to work with the pedals you use or intend to use. In mountain biking, these are either flat pedals or clipless (clip-in) pedals, and shoes are specifically designed to work with one or the other. Pedal choice is typically based on personal preference with most riders choosing one or the other and some people using both depending on the type of riding they’re doing. We go into a little more detail about the pros and cons of both pedal styles in the <a href=\"#frequently-asked-questions\">FAQ section</a> below.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Flat-pedal-shoes-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Flat-pedal-shoes-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Using flat pedal shoes with flat pedals\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Flat-pedal-shoes-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Flat-pedal-shoes-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Flat-pedal-shoes-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Flat-pedal-shoes-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Flat-pedal-shoes-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Flat-pedal-shoes-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Flat-pedal-shoes-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Flat-pedal-shoes-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>If you ride flat pedals you’ll want to be sure to get some flat pedal shoes to work with them. (photo/Kira Deschaux)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Flat pedal shoes are made to work with <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-flat-pedals/\">flat, or platform, pedals</a> and they typically feature flat soles covered edge to edge with a grippy rubber compound and a shallow tread design intended to interface well with the platforms and traction pins of modern flat pedals. Flat pedals and the accompanying shoes are chosen by many riders, from beginners to professionals, for a variety of reasons and they are suitable for everything from trail riding to downhill, enduro, and dirt jumping. Some people even ride with flat pedals on gravel and XC bikes. The four flat pedal shoes we tested are the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearbikingwomensmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fgiro-latch-cycling-shoe-womens\">Giro Latch</a>, Ride Concepts Livewire, <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearbikingwomensmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F188182%2Ffive-ten-freerider-pro-mountain-bike-shoes-womens\">Five Ten Freerider Pro</a>, and the Shimano GR5.

(photo/Kira Deschaux)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Clipless mountain bike pedals require shoes that are specially designed to accept a metal cleat that attaches to the sole of the shoe and clips into the retention mechanism on the pedal. This provides a mechanical connection to the pedal that keeps your feet in place and can help maximize your pedaling power throughout the whole pedal stroke. The soles of clipless shoes are generally a little bit stiffer than those on flat pedal shoes which can help to enhance pedaling efficiency further. For these reasons, clipless shoes are typically the choice of XC and gravel riders looking to get the most out of their pedaling effort. They are also popular among trail and gravity riders who prefer a “locked-in” connection feel to their pedals. The clipless shoes we tested are the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearbikingwomensmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fgiro-sector-mountain-bike-shoe-womens\">Giro Sector</a>, Shimano XC3, Scott MTB Comp Boa, <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=20053&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearbikingwomensmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pearlizumi.com%2Fcollections%2Fwomens-mountain%2Fproducts%2Fwomens-x-alp-summit-mtb-shoes-15292103%3Fvariant%3D42153442345131\">Pearl Izumi X-Alp Summit</a>, and Ride Concepts Hellion Clip. There are also lots of other <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-shoes/\">unisex and men’s clipless mountain bike shoes</a> for those interested in other options.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What Type of Riding Do You Do?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Equally important to matching your shoes with your pedals is getting shoes that suit the type of riding you do. It stands to reason that the needs of someone riding downhill at the bike park are much different than someone who is cranking out miles on a lightweight short-travel bike, and there are shoes made to suit the performance needs of different riding styles. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Gravel-riding-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1705\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Gravel-riding-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Riding a gravel bike in the Giro Sector women's mountain bike shoes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Gravel-riding-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Gravel-riding-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Gravel-riding-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Gravel-riding-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Gravel-riding-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Gravel-riding-1536x1023.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Gravel-riding-2048x1364.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Gravel-riding-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>If you’re an efficiency-minded rider who likes XC or even gravel riding, then a clipless shoe like the Giro Sector might be a great fit. (photo/Kira Deschaux)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a trail, XC, or gravel rider who prioritizes efficiency on the bike, then a clipless shoe with a relatively stiff sole is likely the best bet. These types of shoes are typically lightweight, have sleek designs for a secure fit, and relatively rigid soles that help maximize your pedaling energy throughout the pedal stroke since you are clipped in. They sacrifice a bit in terms of foot protection and walkability, but they still do okay in both departments. Shoes like the Giro Sector, <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearbikingwomensmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F178895%2Fshimano-xc3-mountain-bike-shoes-womens\">Shimano XC3</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C15RV7JX/?tag=brbgfootwearbikingwomensmountainbikeshoes-20\">Scott MTB Comp Boa</a> are geared toward this type of riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/downhill-riding-1.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1534\" height=\"1022\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/downhill-riding-1.jpeg\" alt=\"Riding aggressive terrain in women's mountain bike shoes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/downhill-riding-1.jpeg 1534w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/downhill-riding-1-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/downhill-riding-1-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/downhill-riding-1-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/downhill-riding-1-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/downhill-riding-1-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Aggressive riders or those more focused on the descents may prefer flat pedal shoes or more protective clipless all-mountain shoes. (photo/Kira Deschaux)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re an aggressive trail rider, enduro racer, or downhiller, then you might prefer something with a bit more of a downhill focus like a versatile flat pedal shoe or clipless all-mountain shoe. These shoes tend to put more of an emphasis on foot protection with thicker upper materials and reinforced areas along with vibration-dampening midsoles made of EVA foam or similar materials. The soles of these types of shoes tend to be a bit softer flexing, though still supportive enough for pedaling and descending. Flat pedals and flat pedal shoes are preferred by many for these styles of riding, although there are lots of clipless shoes on the market with similar looks and performance characteristics for those who prefer to clip in. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/good-fit-smile-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/good-fit-smile-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Smiling while riding downhill in shoes that fit well\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/good-fit-smile-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/good-fit-smile-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/good-fit-smile-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/good-fit-smile-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/good-fit-smile-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/good-fit-smile-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/good-fit-smile-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/good-fit-smile-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Shoes that fit well will put a smile on your face and allow you to ride at your best. (photo/Kira Deschaux)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Fit</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Like any athletic footwear, ensuring that your mountain bike shoes fit well is important for both comfort and performance. Ideally, we want that “just right” fit that is snug and secure and avoids being either too tight or too loose. Too tight and they can restrict blood flow, cause hot spots, and generally cause discomfort that can be distracting. Too loose and your feet can move around resulting in a reduction of control and/or pedaling efficiency as well as discomfort caused by the foot moving and rubbing against parts of the shoe. But get the fit just right, and your shoe should feel like an extension of your foot and go virtually unnoticed while riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finding shoes that fit perfectly isn’t always easy since everyone’s feet are shaped differently and sizing isn’t necessarily consistent between brands. Most brands provide size charts on their websites that are typically fairly accurate and can steer you in the right direction, and taking a few quick measurements can be helpful in determining your correct mountain bike shoe size. Whenever possible, trying shoes on at your local bike shop before you buy is the best way to make sure they’ll fit properly, just be sure to wear your biking socks when you do as sock thickness can have a significant effect on the way a shoe fits. They may be able to provide assistance and suggestions and they’ll probably appreciate your business. If ordering online, make sure there’s a good return or exchange policy in case you need to send them back or swap them for a different size.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Closure-comparison-scaled.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1571\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Closure-comparison-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Comparison shot of different closure style on clipless women's mountain bike shoes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Closure-comparison-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Closure-comparison-297x182.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Closure-comparison-800x491.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Closure-comparison-120x74.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Closure-comparison-768x471.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Closure-comparison-1536x942.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Closure-comparison-2048x1257.jpg 2048w\" /></a><figcaption>Shoe manufacturers use a variety of different systems for tightening shoes on your feet with Boa dials and laces being the most popular. (photo/Kira Deschaux)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Closures</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern mountain bike shoes go about tightening the shoes around your feet in different ways. Traditional laces and Boa dials are among the most popular, and they are often used in conjunction with a velcro/hook and loop strap. Laces are the most common on flat pedal shoes, although many clipless models use them as well, and allow for a relatively customizable fit. Laces have classic looks and are cheap and easy to replace if damaged, but they are a little more time-consuming to use when putting shoes on, taking them off, or adjusting the tension mid-ride. Boa dials are more common on clipless pedal shoes, although they are gaining popularity on flat shoes as well, and they use thin wires and ratcheting dials to pull tension over the feet. Boa closures make it very quick and easy to get shoes on and off and make mid-ride tension adjustments but they can be damaged (reliability and durability is improving, however) and they can increase the cost of a pair of shoes, comparatively speaking. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Outsole</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The outsoles of your mountain bike shoes are also an important consideration. This is especially true for flat pedal shoes where we depend on the rubber compound and tread to provide grip on our pedals, but it matters on clipless shoes as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Flat-Shoe-soles-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Flat-Shoe-soles-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Comaprison shot of the soles of 4 flat pedal shoes\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Flat-Shoe-soles-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Flat-Shoe-soles-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Flat-Shoe-soles-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Flat-Shoe-soles-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Flat-Shoe-soles-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Flat-Shoe-soles-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Flat-Shoe-soles-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Flat-Shoe-soles-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>The soles of the 4 flat pedal models we tested, from left to right: the Giro Latch, Five Ten Freerider Pro, Ride concepts Livewire, and the Shimano GR5.

One of the main goals of these soles is to interface with your pedals and provide grip both when pedaling and descending. Different brands use different rubber compounds with the same goal allowing the pins to sink in slightly to provide a good, consistent connection with the pedal to keep your feet in place. Generally speaking, the softer the rubber, the tackier or grippier it feels. Five Ten set the standard by which all other flat pedal shoes were judged many years ago with their Stealth rubber compounds, and other brands have been slow to catch up. Recently, however, other brands have cracked the code and we feel that the Tack rubber on the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearbikingwomensmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fgiro-latch-cycling-shoe-womens\">Giro Latch W’s</a> and the Ride Concepts Max Grip compound on the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10270&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearbikingwomensmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.evo.com%2Fshoes%2Fride-concepts-livewire-womens%23image%3D215289%2F897314%2Fride-concepts-livewire-shoes-women-s\">Livewire W’s</a> are competitively grippy. Most flat pedal shoes are relatively easy to walk around in and provide good grip on firm surfaces, although most tend to be a little slippery in mud, snow, and loose dirt given the shallow tread designs.   </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/clipless-soles-comparison-scaled.jpeg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/clipless-soles-comparison-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Comparison shot of the soles of the clipless women's mountain bike shoe models we tested\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/clipless-soles-comparison-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/clipless-soles-comparison-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/clipless-soles-comparison-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/clipless-soles-comparison-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/clipless-soles-comparison-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/clipless-soles-comparison-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/clipless-soles-comparison-2048x1366.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/clipless-soles-comparison-720x480.jpeg 720w\" /></a><figcaption>You can see there’s much greater variation in the soles of clipless mountain bike shoes.

(photo/Kira Deschaux)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Outsole designs on clipless shoes vary more dramatically as the sole isn’t as critical for keeping the foot in place on the pedal. XC-style shoes typically have a lugged sole with more defined rubber tread blocks under the heels and on the sides of the cleat box. These designs tend to walk reasonably well off the bike and bite into loose soils but the comparatively stiffer soles aren’t the best for extended periods of walking or hiking. Clipless all-mountain or gravity shoes, like the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=18465&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearbikingwomensmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.performancebike.com%2Fride-concepts-womens-hellion-clipless-shoe-charcoal-manzanita-5-2283-510%2Fp1411511%3Fv%3D1345038\">Ride Concepts Hellion Clip</a>, often have similar soles to their flat pedal counterparts with full coverage rubber except for the open cleat box. Adventure riding shoes often have a more hike-friendly outsole like the Vibram rubber and aggressively lugged sole on the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=20053&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearbikingwomensmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pearlizumi.com%2Fcollections%2Fwomens-mountain%2Fproducts%2Fwomens-x-alp-summit-mtb-shoes-15292103%3Fvariant%3D42153442345131\">Pearl Izumi X-Alp Summit</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Value</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Mountain bike shoes come at a range of prices with higher performance shoes made with fancier materials, more advanced constructions, and the latest and greatest features typically commanding a higher price. The most expensive model we tested, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearbikingwomensmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fgiro-sector-mountain-bike-shoe-womens\">Giro Sector</a>, is a great example. These shoes are made from a unique <em>Synchwire</em> material and feature stiff, carbon composite soles and dual Boa dials. The Sector is a performance shoe that’s made to provide a high level of comfort while maximizing efficiency and is suitable for everyone from XC enthusiasts to racers. In that same category of shoe but on the other end of the price spectrum, the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearbikingwomensmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fproduct%2F178895%2Fshimano-xc3-mountain-bike-shoes-womens\">Shimano XC3</a> has similar looks but a toned-down sole stiffness that’s not quite race-ready but still plenty adequate for mode recreational riding, and that’s reflected in the lower price. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among flat pedal shoes, the price differences aren’t quite as extreme with the models we tested ranging in price between $110 and $160. In general, flat pedal shoes are a little simpler in terms of design and construction and that is reflected in the price. We think the <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearbikingwomensmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fgiro-latch-cycling-shoe-womens\">Giro Latch</a> and the Five Ten Freerider Pro offer the best all-around performance, but even the $110 <a href=\"https://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10270&amp;pw=293233&amp;ctc=brbgfootwearbikingwomensmountainbikeshoes&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.evo.com%2Fshoes%2Fride-concepts-livewire-womens%23image%3D215289%2F897314%2Fride-concepts-livewire-shoes-women-s\">Ride Concepts Livewire</a> does a great job and will save you some cash (assuming they fit you right).  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>\n\n\n\n<div><div><div><div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Why should I get women’s specific mountain bike shoes?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>There aren’t huge differences between men’s and women’s mountain bike footwear, but there are some. One of the biggest considerations is sizing as women’s feet are generally smaller than men’s, on average. As such, women’s shoes typically come in a size range that is comparatively smaller than men’s. For example, the Scott MTB Team Boa Women’s shoe comes in sizes 36 – 42 EU, whereas the Men’s version is offered in sizes 40 – 48 EU. Likewise, the women’s version of the Five Ten Freerider Pro comes in sizes 5 – 11 US Women’s, while the Men’s version comes in sizes 6 – 15 US Men’s. For those with feet smaller than a size 5 US Women’s, a few brands, like Ride Concepts and Five Ten, thankfully make Youth versions of some of their models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some women’s shoes also have a “women’s” fit or last. Generally speaking, women’s feet may be more slender and slightly narrower in the heels compared to men’s, and some shoes are designed to fit that foot shape better. Again, this is a generalization that certainly doesn’t apply to all. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, colors. Many women’s shoes are offered in several color options that include both muted tones and more feminine options like shades of pink or purple that are generally not found in men’s models.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Can I just wear unisex or men’s shoes?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>Absolutely. Assuming they fit you well, of course. Not too long ago, the bike industry made a major push towards women’s specific products with many brands making women’s models of bikes, helmets, shoes, and other accessories. Over the past several years, however, many brands have consolidated their product lines and done away with women’s shoe models in favor of unisex options with a broader size range to fit those with smaller feet. Since the primary differentiating factors between men’s and women’s models of shoes are usually size range and color options, the shift towards unisex models and sizing isn’t a huge surprise. And, since one of the most important aspects of a shoe is that it fits well, a unisex, men’s, or women’s model should all provide a similar level of performance and comfort assuming they are the right length, width, and volume for your feet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all brands have jumped on the unisex bandwagon, however, as all of the shoes in this review are, in fact, women’s models. Ride Concepts, Five Ten, Giro, Shimano, and others, still make women’s models with the primary differences being that shoes come in smaller sizes, more feminine colorways, and some have a “women’s” fit. That said, we have tested lots of the best men’s and unisex <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-shoes/\">clipless mountain bike shoes</a> and <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-flat-pedal-shoes/\">flat pedal mountain bike shoes</a> if you’re interested in learning more about models that are not included in this buyer’s guide.</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Do I need to wear mountain bike shoes when mountain biking?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>While you can mountain bike in just about any pair of shoes that you like, we prefer riding in shoes that are purpose-built for the task. Mountain bike shoes for both flat and clipless pedals are made with features, constructions, and materials that make them much better suited to riding a mountain bike than any pair of running sneakers or hiking boots. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>How the shoes interface with your pedals is one of the main benefits of mountain bike shoes whether you clip in or ride flats. For flat pedals, shoes have outsoles that are designed to have a broad platform underfoot where they contact the pedal body and pins along with grippy rubber to provide a solid connection between the sole and pedal. Shoes designed for clipless pedals feature a range of outsole designs but they always have a channel in the sole with two small tracks backed by a cleat plate where you mount the cleat used to clip into a clipless pedal. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Support is another of the primary benefits of mountain bike shoes. While the soles of mountain bike shoes vary in stiffness depending on their type and intended use, they are typically much stiffer, and therefore more supportive, than a pair of running shoes, for example. These soles support the feet more both when pedaling and descending, helping to prevent the feet and calves from getting fatigued. In general, shoes designed for XC-style riding and efficiency tend to have stiffer soles while shoes designed for use with flat pedals are a bit softer flexing for added grip and pedal feel. Similarly, the uppers are designed to provide support for the feet which is critical for both comfort and control. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mountain bike shoes are also made with robust materials and constructions so they can take the abuse associated with being attached to your feet while riding a bike through the forest. This includes tough, seamless synthetic leather and similar materials, rugged rubber soles, quality craftsmanship, and refined designs. Additionally, most mountain bike shoes make an attempt to provide a bit of added protection for the feet in the form of reinforced heel cups, toe boxes, strategically placed padding, and cushioned midsoles. Protective features vary depending on the model and intended use, of course. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Clipless or flat pedals, which is better?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>The age-old debate between clipless and flat pedals is one that will likely rage on forever. The thing is, there is no right or wrong pedal type to use. You should choose whatever works best for you and you’re most comfortable using. Most people choose one or the other and some people ride both, switching between pedal types depending on the type of riding they are doing. There are, however, benefits and drawbacks to the different types of pedals which we will detail below. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Clipless pedals</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clipless pedals provide a mechanical connection between your shoe and the pedal with a small cleat attached to the bottom of your shoe and a clip/retention mechanism on the pedal itself. They come in a range of styles including small lightweight options with no cage/platform, “trail” pedals with a mid-sized cage/platform, and “gravity” models with larger cages/platforms surrounding the clip mechanism. The benefits of clipless pedals are that when set up properly, they keep your foot on the pedal in the optimal position and are claimed to be more efficient for pedaling as you maximize your pedaling power on both the up and downstrokes of each rotation. Since your foot is attached to the pedal, it is also much less likely to come off the pedal unexpectedly over rough terrain or while jumping, etc. Being connected to the pedal can also be a handling benefit for some riders as it allows them to pull up on the bike with their feet to jump over obstacles or climb up over ledges, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The drawbacks to clipless pedals are that they take some getting used to when clipping in and out, and when learning it can result in some pretty awkward crashes. It becomes second nature over time, but there is definitely a learning curve. It is also less convenient to put a foot out and back on the pedal through corners or technical sections given the need to clip in and out of the pedal. Walking in shoes with cleats can also be a little less pleasant given that there is a piece of metal attached to the sole and the soles themselves are typically quite stiff, though walkability varies depending on the model and style. Many people will also argue that riding clipless pedals teaches you poor technique given that you can rely on your connection to the pedals for certain things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Flat Pedals</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Flat pedals, or platform pedals, provide support for the foot with a larger pedal platform/body and grip the soles with strategically placed pins. While they all share the same basic shape and design, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-flat-pedals/\">flat pedal models</a> differ with varying platform sizes, profiles, thicknesses, pin layouts, etc, to provide different performance characteristics out on the trail. Flat pedal shoes generally have wide, flat soles with fairly shallow treads and grippy rubber intended to provide a friction-based connection to the pedal and its pins. The benefits of flat pedals are that it’s very easy to place your foot on and remove it from the pedal. You also have more freedom and mobility so you can shift your feet around into different positions more freely should you like to adjust them for different situations. It is also claimed that riding flat pedals forces you to learn better riding technique since you can’t rely on the crutch of being attached to your pedals all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The drawbacks to flat pedals are that they are claimed to be slightly less efficient for pedaling than clipless pedals because they don’t allow you to pull up on the pedals in the same way during the pedal stroke. Since your feet are not mechanically connected to the pedals, it is also possible to unexpectedly “slip” a pedal or get bounced off the pedals over rough terrain (depending on your technique and shoe/pedal combo, of course). Pedal pins are also quite sharp, so a pedal to the shin or calf can be incredibly dangerous and painful. We’ve got friends who look like their lower legs have been attacked by bears…</p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>Why do they call it clipless when you clip in?</div>\n\t</div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n<p>The term clipless is a bit of a misnomer, but it goes back a few decades. Before clipless pedals existed and properly grippy flat pedals came about, mountain bike pedals often had toe clips or cages, that extended from the front of the pedal and up over the toe of your shoes to keep your feet connected to the pedals and to prevent them from slipping off the front. When the first clip-in SPD pedals came about, they didn’t have a toe clip and became known as “clipless” as a result. So, the term clipless is undoubtedly confusing given that you clip in to a clipless pedal. These days, many shoes have the words “clip” or “clip-in” added to the name, which is a little more clear. </p>\n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div>\n</div></div></div>\n\n\n\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\n<div>\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\n<div>\n\t<h2>Related Content</h2>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<article>\n\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-shoes/\">\n\t\t<img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1706\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Best-Mountain-Bike-Shoes-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"The Best Mountain Bike Shoes of 2024\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Best-Mountain-Bike-Shoes-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Best-Mountain-Bike-Shoes-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Best-Mountain-Bike-Shoes-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Best-Mountain-Bike-Shoes-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Best-Mountain-Bike-Shoes-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Best-Mountain-Bike-Shoes-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Best-Mountain-Bike-Shoes-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Best-Mountain-Bike-Shoes-720x480.jpeg 720w\" />\t</a>\n\t\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/buyers-guides/\">Buyers Guides</a></div>\n\n<h2>\n\t<a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/best-mountain-bike-shoes/\">\n\t\tThe Best Mountain Bike Shoes of 2024\t</a>\n</h2>\n\n<div>\n\t<p>As a critical connection between you and your bike, finding the best mountain bike shoes is very important.
