Announced at last year's CES keynote alongside a new Equinox EV, the electric Blazer makes use of General Motors' new Ultium battery platform, albeit with styling cues that call back to the gasoline version. Now, Chevy has released pricing information for the 2024 Blazer EV, and if you were hoping for a 1LT entry-level trim, there's some bad news, as that option has been dropped entirely.</p>\n<p>Originally, the 1LT was announced with a starting price around $44,995 and was scheduled for the first quarter of 2024. Now, the cheapest Blazer EV will be the front-wheel drive 2LT, although that version won't see showrooms until next year, and pricing won't be revealed until closer to that time.</p>\n<p>Currently <a href=\"https://insideevs.com/news/674453/chevrolet-blazer-ev-production-begins-gm-mexico/\">the Ramos Arizpe factory in Mexico</a> is only building all-wheel drive Blazer EVs, and right now just in RS trim, which starts at $60,215. This Blazer has an EPA range estimate of 279 miles (449 km). That actually makes this Blazer EV more expensive than the entry-level Cadillac Lyriq—<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2022/06/not-your-grandpas-ride-the-2023-cadillac-lyriq-tested/\">which starts at $58,590</a>—an EV that has more range but also only a single electric motor driving the rear wheels.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1958702#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1958702&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
