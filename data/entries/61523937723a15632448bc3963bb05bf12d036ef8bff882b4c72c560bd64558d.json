And what they actually mean by that, is they’ve ditched their old carbon rim molding for a new rim manufacturing process that maxes out compression of the carbon fiber layers during production in more precise tooling that requires no post-finishing. The result is straight out-of-the-mold carbon rims that DT can quality control layer-by-layer, which are now more durable and lighter. Whether you are racing XC, exploring all-mountain, smashing enduro stages, or even shredding lightweight eMTBs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>All-new DT Swiss 1200 series lightweight carbon MTB wheels</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DT-Swiss-XMC1200_new-lightweight-carbon-all-mountain-bike-wheels_Jeronimo-Txabardo-hardtail-at-Bukova-Hora-bikepark.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DT-Swiss-XMC1200_new-lightweight-carbon-all-mountain-bike-wheels_Jeronimo-Txabardo-hardtail-at-Bukova-Hora-bikepark.jpg\" alt=\"All-new DT Swiss XMC 1200 lightweight carbon all-mountain bike wheels, Jeronimo Txabardo hardtail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DT-Swiss-XMC1200_new-lightweight-carbon-all-mountain-bike-wheels_Jeronimo-Txabardo-hardtail-at-Bukova-Hora-bikepark.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DT-Swiss-XMC1200_new-lightweight-carbon-all-mountain-bike-wheels_Jeronimo-Txabardo-hardtail-at-Bukova-Hora-bikepark-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DT-Swiss-XMC1200_new-lightweight-carbon-all-mountain-bike-wheels_Jeronimo-Txabardo-hardtail-at-Bukova-Hora-bikepark-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DT-Swiss-XMC1200_new-lightweight-carbon-all-mountain-bike-wheels_Jeronimo-Txabardo-hardtail-at-Bukova-Hora-bikepark-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DT-Swiss-XMC1200_new-lightweight-carbon-all-mountain-bike-wheels_Jeronimo-Txabardo-hardtail-at-Bukova-Hora-bikepark-768x461.jpg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos/Cory Benson)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>4 wheelsets. 4 new carbon rims.

More consistency, combined with longer uninterrupted fibers, generally means greater lifetime durability and the ability to achieve the same strength at a lighter weight.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DT-Swiss-1200-series-all-new-lightweight-carbon-mountain-bike-wheels_split-mold-tech.jpg\"><img width=\"1080\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DT-Swiss-1200-series-all-new-lightweight-carbon-mountain-bike-wheels_split-mold-tech.jpg\" alt=\"DT Swiss 1200 series all-new lightweight carbon mountain bike wheels, split mold detail rendering\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DT-Swiss-1200-series-all-new-lightweight-carbon-mountain-bike-wheels_split-mold-tech.jpg 1080w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DT-Swiss-1200-series-all-new-lightweight-carbon-mountain-bike-wheels_split-mold-tech-297x297.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DT-Swiss-1200-series-all-new-lightweight-carbon-mountain-bike-wheels_split-mold-tech-120x120.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DT-Swiss-1200-series-all-new-lightweight-carbon-mountain-bike-wheels_split-mold-tech-768x768.jpg 768w\" /></a><figcaption>(Rendering/DT Swiss)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Molded from the outside surface layer of the rim first, and working inward step-by-step, DT is able to highly compress each layer into the one before it.

They describe wheels that flex when hitting sharp-edged rocks &amp; roots on technical XC courses, maintaining traction – especially up techy climbs, feeling reduced rolling resistance, and reducing the occurrence of pinch flats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That all sounds quite good. And I’m psyched to see if the all-mountain XMC 1200 wheels will translate that to more technical train riding.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>DT Swiss 1200 wheels – Pricing, availability, and options</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DT-Swiss-1200-series-revamped-carbon-mountain-bike-wheels-on-Jeronimo-Txabardo-steel-hardtail.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1080\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DT-Swiss-1200-series-revamped-carbon-mountain-bike-wheels-on-Jeronimo-Txabardo-steel-hardtail.jpg\" alt=\"All-new DT Swiss XMC 1200 lightweight carbon all-mountain bike wheels,  Jeronimo steel hardtail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DT-Swiss-1200-series-revamped-carbon-mountain-bike-wheels-on-Jeronimo-Txabardo-steel-hardtail.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DT-Swiss-1200-series-revamped-carbon-mountain-bike-wheels-on-Jeronimo-Txabardo-steel-hardtail-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DT-Swiss-1200-series-revamped-carbon-mountain-bike-wheels-on-Jeronimo-Txabardo-steel-hardtail-1536x922.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DT-Swiss-1200-series-revamped-carbon-mountain-bike-wheels-on-Jeronimo-Txabardo-steel-hardtail-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DT-Swiss-1200-series-revamped-carbon-mountain-bike-wheels-on-Jeronimo-Txabardo-steel-hardtail-768x461.jpg 768w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>DT Swiss offers 4 total wheelsets in the newly revamped 1200 carbon wheel lineup. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DT-Swiss-XMC1200_new-lightweight-carbon-all-mountain-bike-wheels_30mm-internal-tubeless-ready.jpg\"><img width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DT-Swiss-XMC1200_new-lightweight-carbon-all-mountain-bike-wheels_30mm-internal-tubeless-ready.jpg\" alt=\"DT Swiss 1200 series all-new lightweight carbon mountain bike wheels, all 30mm internal\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DT-Swiss-XMC1200_new-lightweight-carbon-all-mountain-bike-wheels_30mm-internal-tubeless-ready.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DT-Swiss-XMC1200_new-lightweight-carbon-all-mountain-bike-wheels_30mm-internal-tubeless-ready-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DT-Swiss-XMC1200_new-lightweight-carbon-all-mountain-bike-wheels_30mm-internal-tubeless-ready-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DT-Swiss-XMC1200_new-lightweight-carbon-all-mountain-bike-wheels_30mm-internal-tubeless-ready-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DT-Swiss-XMC1200_new-lightweight-carbon-all-mountain-bike-wheels_30mm-internal-tubeless-ready-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DT-Swiss-XMC1200_new-lightweight-carbon-all-mountain-bike-wheels_30mm-internal-tubeless-ready-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/DT-Swiss-XMC1200_new-lightweight-carbon-all-mountain-bike-wheels_30mm-internal-tubeless-ready-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>They all feature a 30mm internal, hookless tubeless bead.
