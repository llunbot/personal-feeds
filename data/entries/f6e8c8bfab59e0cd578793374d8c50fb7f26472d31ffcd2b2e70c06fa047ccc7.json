The first of the two to be released is Aventon’s flagship commuter bike, the <a href=\"https://www.aventon.com/products/level-3-commuter-ebike?variant=44177369759939&amp;utm_source=Google&amp;utm_medium=cpc-search-bofu&amp;utm_campaign=SB-BOFU-SEARCH-Branded-Level3&amp;utm_content=178202494209&amp;utm_term=aventon%20level%203&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiAt4C-BhBcEiwA8Kp0CVj1dl4wbVi2B917i0_LBH4TGDV--m-O5p54pnVTu_YlA8Jhp5TFKRoCVn4QAvD_BwE\" target=\"_blank\">Level 3</a>. Details on the second bike are yet to be revealed, but the Level 3 comes equipped with everything you need for a successful ride to the office, or anywhere else around town, for that matter.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-kicked.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-kicked.webp\" alt=\"Aventon Level 3 eBike kicked\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-kicked.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-kicked-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-kicked-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-kicked-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-kicked-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-kicked-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photos / Ron Frazelle)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Level 3 comes in two sizes, regular and large. The regular is said to fit everyone from 5’3″ to 5’10” (26″ to 31″ inseam), while the large size will fit people from 5’10” to 6’4″ (31″ to 35″ inseam). It also comes in two colors, Matte Aurora and Matte Black. On top of that, there are two types of frames available: the “step-through” frame with a very low top tube and the “step-over” frame with a more traditional, but still low top tube.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-throttle.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-throttle.webp\" alt=\"Aventon Level 3 eBike throttle\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-throttle.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-throttle-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-throttle-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-throttle-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-throttle-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-throttle-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Class 2 with throttle and pedal assist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-adjustable-stem.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-adjustable-stem.webp\" alt=\"Aventon Level 3 eBike adjustable stem\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-adjustable-stem.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-adjustable-stem-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-adjustable-stem-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-adjustable-stem-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-adjustable-stem-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-adjustable-stem-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Adjustable stem and integrated headlight</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a class 2 eBike with a throttle and a range of up to 70 miles and is able to carry 300 lbs with a 500W hub motor (864W peak). Also new for the Level 3 is Aventon’s ACU (Aventon Control Unit).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Aventon Control Unit (ACU)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-ACU-Tech.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-ACU-Tech.webp\" alt=\"Aventon Level 3 eBike ACU Tech\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-ACU-Tech.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-ACU-Tech-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-ACU-Tech-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-ACU-Tech-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-ACU-Tech-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-ACU-Tech-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>ACU unit down low. </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Aventon Control Unit (ACU) can help keep you fully protected and always connected at the same time. The security features include GPS tracking, auto-lock, unusual movement detection, an alarm system, and additional features to keep your ride safe and secure. When tooling around, you can rely on GPS tracking, 4G connection, and cloud synchronization to get your bike stats in real-time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The smart remote locking lets you immobilize your bike from the Aventon App. Geofencing lets you define the areas allowed and the distances prohibited. With the startup password and keyless battery, there is one less key on your key ring. Plus you can activate the locking mechanism that keeps the rear wheel from rotating, adding yet another level of security. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Geometry</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Regular</th><th>Large</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>A – Seat Tube Length</td><td>440mm (17.3″)</td><td>500mm (19.7″)</td></tr><tr><td>B – Top Tube Length Horizontal</td><td>605mm (23.8″)</td><td>635mm (25″)</td></tr><tr><td>C – Bottom Bracket Drop</td><td>50mm (1.97″)</td><td>50mm (1.97″)</td></tr><tr><td>D – Head Tube Length</td><td>140mm (5.5″)</td><td>140mm (5.5″)</td></tr><tr><td>E – Head Tube Angle</td><td>70°</td><td>70°</td></tr><tr><td>F – Seat Tube Angle</td><td>74°</td><td>74°</td></tr><tr><td>G – Rear Chainstay Length</td><td>480mm (18.9″)</td><td>480mm (18.9″)</td></tr><tr><td>H – Front Wheel Center</td><td>675mm (26.6″)</td><td>705mm (27.8″)</td></tr><tr><td>I – Wheelbase</td><td>1150mm (45.3″)</td><td>1180.7mm (46.5″)</td></tr><tr><td>J – Reach</td><td>420mm (16.5″)</td><td>450mm (17.7″)</td></tr><tr><td>K – Stack Height</td><td>620mm (24.4″)</td><td>618mm (24.3″)</td></tr><tr><td>L – Fork Length</td><td>480mm (18.9″)</td><td>480mm (18.9″)</td></tr><tr><td>M – Fork Offset</td><td>43mm (1.7″)</td><td>43mm (1.7″)</td></tr><tr><td>N – Trail</td><td>81mm (3.2″)</td><td>81mm (3.2″)</td></tr><tr><td>Wheel Size in Inches</td><td>27.5″</td><td>27.5″</td></tr><tr><td>Stand Over Height</td><td>687mm (27.0″)</td><td>695mm (27.4″)</td></tr><tr><td>Rider Height (Range)</td><td>160cm – 175 cm (5’3 – 5’10”)</td><td>175cm – 195 cm (5’10 – 6’4″)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-rear-rack.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-rear-rack.webp\" alt=\"Aventon Level 3 eBike rear rack\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-rear-rack.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-rear-rack-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-rear-rack-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-rear-rack-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-rear-rack-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-rear-rack-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Solid rear rack</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The adjustable stem and comfort geometry help ensure an ideal fit. Add the Ride Tune capabilities and the adjustments to the Level 3’s power curves, and you can squeeze out up to an additional 10 miles of range. Park the car and Level up your daily commute.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Level 3 &amp; My Initial Thoughts </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I got to ride the new Level 3 at the launch in Long Beach. It wasn’t a long ride, but it was enough to get the feel of the bike. I wasn’t super wowed. <em>But</em>, that’s not because this isn’t a quality bicycle, because I believe that it is. And for the $1899 price tag, I feel it’s an amazing bargain. It’s because I feel that the compromises a manufacturer needs to make to build a bike with only two sizes can be felt as soon as you pedal the bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-magura-hydros.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-magura-hydros.webp\" alt=\"Aventon Level 3 eBike magura hydros\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-magura-hydros.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-magura-hydros-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-magura-hydros-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-magura-hydros-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-magura-hydros-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-magura-hydros-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-hydro-cal.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-hydro-cal.webp\" alt=\"Aventon Level 3 eBike hydro cal\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-hydro-cal.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-hydro-cal-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-hydro-cal-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-hydro-cal-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-hydro-cal-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-hydro-cal-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The bike rode and pedaled well, and the Magura hydraulic brakes felt great, a vast improvement from previous models. But I could tell that it would take a serious amount of tweaking with the fit to get myself close to comfortable. I don’t think I could get it comfy enough to execute a ride that’s equal to the claimed 70-mile range of the Level 3.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure>\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike.webp\" alt=\"Aventon Level 3 eBike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>A shot of the Step-through frame</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-tom-sweeny.webp\"><img width=\"1280\" height=\"853\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-tom-sweeny.webp\" alt=\"Aventon Level 3 eBike tom sweeny\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-tom-sweeny.webp 1280w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-tom-sweeny-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-tom-sweeny-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-tom-sweeny-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-tom-sweeny-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Aventon-Level-3-eBike-tom-sweeny-720x480.webp 720w\" /></a><figcaption>Tom strikes a pose…</figcaption></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That being said, two-sizes-fits-most sizing will work better for some than others, and it would be a great bike for many short trips around town and the obvious commute to work. I would recommend it to anyone who needs an eBike that rides and feels like a regular bike.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The many new features are top-notch and will enhance the experience of owning the bike. It’s a handsome bike and looks a lot better than its predecessor. The fit, finish, and frame design look like that of a much more expensive bicycle.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>In Conclusion</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Aventon is continually turning up its game with quality bicycles that have innovative features. They are very far removed from the Aventon of 2017. That all comes down to the people that are in charge now. They’re bike people who are running a bike company and are proudly making safe, affordable eBikes. I believe Aventon has a bright future, with some cool products on the horizon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.aventon.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Aventon.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/aventon-level-3-commuter-city-ebike/\">Aventon Takes Your Commute to the Next Level with Sub $2000 Level 3</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Ron Frazelle","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"f6e8c8bfab59e0cd578793374d8c50fb7f26472d31ffcd2b2e70c06fa047ccc7","category":"Cycling"}
