Google <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/google-is-killing-play-movies-tv-will-only-have-three-video-stores-left/\">previously sent out</a> an email to users saying \"Google Play Movies &amp; TV is going away on 05 October 2023,\" but <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2023/12/11/google-play-movies-tv-apps-january-2024/\">9to5Google</a> spotted a <a href=\"https://support.google.com/androidtv/thread/247411854/upcoming-changes-to-google-play-movies-tv\">new support page</a> that says January 17, 2024, is the new shutdown date. It's not entirely clear why there are two shutdown dates, but the October 5 shutdown definitely happened in the US; perhaps this message is for international users.</p>\n<p>Google's page says that in January, \"Google Play Movies &amp; TV will no longer be available on Android TV devices or the Google Play website.\" This should be the last of the Google Play Movies brand. Phones and tablets have already <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/06/google-tv-launches-on-ios-as-a-replacement-for-google-play-movies-tv/\">switched</a> to a \"Google TV\" app (not to be confused with the Google TV OS), and the Play Store <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/03/google-will-stop-selling-movies-and-tv-shows-through-the-play-store/\">abandoned media sales</a> in 2022.</p>\n<p>With the one-stop-shop Play Store dead, Google says your purchased content will now be in different apps, depending on what Google platform you're on. The support page says: \"On TVs and streaming devices powered by Android TV,\" purchased content is in the \"Shop\" tab but on \"cable boxes or set-top boxes powered by Android TV\" the content will be in the YouTube app. On the web, purchased content is on YouTube.com.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1989985#p3\">Read 2 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1989985&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ron Amadeo","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"081ae787388bfff989913a45ede734cc3f5699be1a36fdd4b512a91ec323a7c5","category":"Tech"}
