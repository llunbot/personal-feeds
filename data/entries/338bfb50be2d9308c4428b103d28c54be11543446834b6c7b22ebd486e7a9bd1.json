Tadej Pogaƒçar (UAE Team Emirates) and Lotte Kopecky (SD Worx) both stormed to victory in the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tags/classics\" target=\"_blank\">Tour of Flanders</a>. Taking their preferred approach when it comes to punishing the chasing peloton, the duo both won their races solo, dropping all their rivals at the Ronde van Vlaanderen. ¬†</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. Filip Maciejuk apologises after Tour of Flanders disqualification</h2>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>The moment Bahrain Victorious rider Filip Maciejuk caused the crash in the peloton, attempting to ride back onto the road <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4a5.png\" alt=\"üí•\" /><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/RVV23?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">#RVV23</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/ixym03232A\" target=\"_blank\">pic.twitter.com/ixym03232A</a></p>‚Äî Eurosport (@eurosport) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/eurosport/status/1642490668726599680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">April 2, 2023</a></blockquote> \n\n\n\n<p>The main talking points from the Tour of Flanders start with Filip Maciejuk‚Äôs (Bahrain Victorious) disqualification. In his attempt to move up by the side of the peloton, the 23-year-old ran out of tarmac and hit a ditch in the grass. What followed was a terrible case of cycling dominoes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the peloton hit the ground with Maciejuk staying upright. Tim Wellens (UAE Team Emirates) broke his collarbone in four places as Ben Turner (INEOS Grenadiers) fractured his left arm. Peter Sagan (TotalEnergies) was forced to retire from his final Flanders. Maciejuk was soon disqualified from the race and he posted an apology on Twitter.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>I‚Äôm really sorry for my mistake and causing the crash today. I hope all those involved are in good health and safe.This should not happen and was a big error in my judgement.</p>‚Äî Filip (@FilipMaciejuk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FilipMaciejuk/status/1642505158004285440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\" target=\"_blank\">April 2, 2023</a></blockquote> \n\n\n\n<p>The full thread reads: ‚ÄòI‚Äôm really sorry for my mistake and causing the crash today. I hope all those involved are in good health and safe. This should not happen and was a big error in my judgement. I had no intention of causing this. All I can do now is apologise for my mistake and learn from this in the future. Sorry again to the peloton, my teammates and the fans.‚Äô</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2.

Pogaƒçar, Mathieu van der Poel (Alpecin-Deceuninck) and Wout van Aert (Jumbo Visma) took off and absorbed honorary members along the way, with van Aert eventually dropped on the Kruisberg/Hotond climb.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><p><em>Results powered by <a href=\"https://firstcycling.com/race.php?r=5&amp;y=2023\" target=\"_blank\">FirstCycling.com</a></em></p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>It was on the second ascent of the Oude Kwaremont that Van der Poel slipped from Pogaƒçar‚Äôs wheel. The Slovenian powered away to catch and pass lone leader Mads Pedersen (Trek-Segafredo), staying ahead until the finish.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"572\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/tour-of-flanders-2023-grubers-44-970x572.jpg\" alt srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/tour-of-flanders-2023-grubers-44-970x572.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/tour-of-flanders-2023-grubers-44-300x177.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/tour-of-flanders-2023-grubers-44-768x453.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/tour-of-flanders-2023-grubers-44-750x443.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/tour-of-flanders-2023-grubers-44-1140x673.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/04/tour-of-flanders-2023-grubers-44.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption>Gruberimages</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the women‚Äôs Tour of Flanders, the majority of riders on the Koppenberg were forced to dismount on the slippery slopes. The SD Worx superwomen trio of Lotte Kopecky, Lorena Wiebes and Marlen Reusser took off with Silvia Persico (UAE) for company. In a strong refusal to be reeled in, Kopecky and Persico put the hammer down on the Kruisberg/Hotond climb.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><p><em>Results powered by <a href=\"https://firstcycling.com/race.php?r=9049&amp;y=2023\" target=\"_blank\">FirstCycling.com</a></em></p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>It was with 18km of the day remaining on the Oude Kwaremont that Kopecky dropped her breakaway companion, finishing solo to take her second consecutiveedition of the Tour of Flanders.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3.

Organisers Sweetspot released a statement last week that the Women‚Äôs Tour, which was scheduled to take place from 7th to 11th June 2023, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/womens-tour-2023\" target=\"_blank\">would not run</a> this year due to increased running costs ‚Äì which were approximately 20 percent higher than the previous edition ‚Äì and reduced commercial support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All donations to the GoFundMe will apparently be refunded. It‚Äôs another blow to the racing scene in Britain after the cancellation of the Tour Series. The Women‚Äôs Tour will hopefully return in 2024 for its 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary, with its Grand D√©part scheduled for Wales.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4.
