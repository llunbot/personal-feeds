Cycles Devinci has just announced their 2023 E-Troy, and they’ve taken a focused approach to building the bike around its drive system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new E-Troy’s suspension is not only tuned to reflect the weight and weight distribution of the bike, but it’s also designed to resist inputs from the motor keeping the power delivery smooth and predictable. While the previous E-Troy was manufactured in Asia, the new version’s frame is made in Devinci’s facility in Canada.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2023 Devinci E-Troy – Frame Features and Key Specs:</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Devinci-E-Troy-black-angle.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Devinci-E-Troy-black-angle.jpg\" alt=\"Devinci e-Troy ebike\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Devinci-E-Troy-black-angle.jpg 1200w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Devinci-E-Troy-black-angle-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Devinci-E-Troy-black-angle-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Devinci-E-Troy-black-angle-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Devinci-E-Troy-black-angle-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Devinci-E-Troy-black-angle-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2023 E-Troy is built around a 6061-T6 aluminum frame that is made in Chicoutimi, Quebec and is covered by a lifetime warranty. The frame offers 150mm of rear travel, and upfront you’ll find a 170mm fork on the top-tier GX 12s LTD model and 160mm forks on the other two builds. The new E-Troy features dedicated frame geometry to optimize its mixed-wheel setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Devinci-E-Troy-drift.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Devinci-E-Troy-drift-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Devinci e-Troy ebike riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Devinci-E-Troy-drift-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Devinci-E-Troy-drift-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Devinci-E-Troy-drift-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Devinci-E-Troy-drift-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Devinci-E-Troy-drift-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Devinci-E-Troy-drift.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Devinci sought to make the new E-Troy feel like an agile trail bike but with all the benefits of a thoughtfully incorporated drive system. In their words, they describe it as “…<em>a bike that will change the way you look at riding without changing the way you ride.”</em></p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Devinci-E-Troy-linkage.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Devinci-E-Troy-linkage-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Devinci e-Troy ebike drivetrain\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Devinci-E-Troy-linkage-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Devinci-E-Troy-linkage-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Devinci-E-Troy-linkage-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Devinci-E-Troy-linkage-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Devinci-E-Troy-linkage-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Devinci-E-Troy-linkage.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new E-Troy’s suspension kinematics were tuned in accordance with the weight distribution of the bike, and Devinci even revised their Split-Pivot linkage to counteract inputs from the motor to keep the suspension active under pedaling efforts – this enhances traction and keeps the power delivery smooth and consistent. The linkage is also designed to separate acceleration forces from braking inputs, and offer a high degree of small-bump compliance.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Devinci-E-Troy-stays.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Devinci-E-Troy-stays-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Devinci e-Troy ebike chain stay\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Devinci-E-Troy-stays-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Devinci-E-Troy-stays-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Devinci-E-Troy-stays-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Devinci-E-Troy-stays-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Devinci-E-Troy-stays-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Devinci-E-Troy-stays.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Devinci employs Enduro double-lip sealed bearings in the E-Troy’s frame, and top-mounted GN4 Mini Guide chain guides are included on all models.

All the new E-Troys carry a 625Wh battery – in Eco mode (and under ideal conditions) the bike can provide assist for up to 94kms. If that’s not enough for you, the bikes are compatible with Bosch’s Powermore 250 Range Extender, which adds another 250Wh of battery capacity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Bosch Performance Line CX motor’s output is highly tunable and can adapt to your riding style in eMTB mode. Furthermore, the Flow App allows you to adjust the motor’s power output settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Devinci-E-Troy-battery-cover.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Devinci-E-Troy-battery-cover-800x533.jpg\" alt=\"Devinci e-Troy ebike downtube\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Devinci-E-Troy-battery-cover-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Devinci-E-Troy-battery-cover-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Devinci-E-Troy-battery-cover-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Devinci-E-Troy-battery-cover-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Devinci-E-Troy-battery-cover-720x480.jpg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2023-Devinci-E-Troy-battery-cover.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The down tube battery is easily dropped from the frame and features a keyed lock to secure it to the bike.
