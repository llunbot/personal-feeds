The PlayStation 5's PlayStation VR2? Not so much, unfortunately. In either an effort to clear unsold inventory, an attempt to revitalize the platform, or both, Sony has announced it's dropping the price of the headset significantly.</p>\n<p>Starting in March, the main SKU of the headset will drop from $550 to $400 in the US. Europe, the UK, and Japan will also see price cuts to 550 euros, 400 pounds, and 66,980 yen, respectively, as detailed on the <a href=\"https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/27/a-great-new-price-for-playstation-vr2/\">PlayStation Blog</a>. Strangely, the bundle that includes the game <em>Horizon: Call of the Mountain </em>(originally $600) will also drop to the same exact price. That's welcome, but it's also a little bit difficult not to interpret that as a sign that this is an attempt to empty inventory more than anything else.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/02/psvr2-review-plenty-of-improvements-but-is-it-too-little-too-late/\">headset launched in early 2023</a> but has suffered from <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/01/psvr-2-launch-includes-only-a-handful-of-exclusive-titles/\">weak software support</a> ever since—a far cry from the first PSVR, which had one of the strongest libraries of its time. It didn't help that unlike the regular PlayStation 5, the PSVR2 was not backward-compatible with games released for its predecessor.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/the-playstation-vr2-will-get-a-drastic-price-cut-but-that-might-not-be-enough/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/the-playstation-vr2-will-get-a-drastic-price-cut-but-that-might-not-be-enough/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Samuel Axon","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"60658ef882c59cb8cbcc133b786d14ffc1bd3c0ed225f76911966666fa4c68af","category":"Tech"}
