Anker's fast-charging technology delivers up to three hours of battery life to the earbuds in just 15 minutes, and the case supports both USB-C and wireless charging.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/soundcore-liberty-3-pro-colors.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nTouch controls on the exterior of the earbuds can be user-configured for functions like play/pause, volume, and track control.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWhile you won't get some of the Apple-specific features you get with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a> like automatic pairing and switching, the Liberty 3 Pro buds offer a broad array of features at a solid price and should deliver strong audio quality that can be further optimized using the Soundcore app to match your hearing response.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/10/soundcore-liberty-3-pro-3.jpg\" />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Liberty 3 Pro are launching today at <a href=\"https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-462641-13909589\">Soundcore</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/1C25C5E3-3476-463A-A154-EFAB9CC18B2F\">Amazon</a> priced a $169.99, and they're available in four colors: Midnight Black, Frost White, Fog Gray, and Dusk Purple.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<small><em>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Soundcore and Amazon.
