And sometimes it is “glamorous”, at least in the ways that appeal to me. Even after 8 years, I still get giddy with excitement staring at maps and imagining the possibilities, finding the perfect campsite tucked up in the mountains somewhere, or descending from a remote mountain pass just as the sun sets.</p>\n<p>To get to these amazing moments though, you’ve got to sift your way through plenty of ups and downs that come with life on the road.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-02.jpg?fit=1200,1667&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-02.jpg?w=2500&amp;quality=75 2500w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-02.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-02.jpg?resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-02.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-02.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-02.jpg?resize=2048,1366&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>After a few nice days off the bike in the bustling market town of Otavalo, Joe and I were recharged and excited to get back out on the <a href=\"https://bikepacking.com/routes/trans-ecuador-dirt-road/\" target=\"_blank\">Trans Ecuador Mountain Bike Route</a>. Supplies were purchased and the bikes were all packed up following the usual gear tornado that rips through any hotel that I stay in for more than a day or two. It usually starts with having to make a couple of small gear repairs but ends up with your entire kit splayed out across every surface of the room.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div><span>﻿</span><span><span></span></span><span></span></div>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Morning hits on the day we’re set to leave and I wake up before my alarm, feeling the sudden rush of nausea that sends me scrambling for the trash bin next to my bed to not make a further mess of the room, but nothing comes out. I lay there for another hour trying to be as still as possible. Every movement sends that wave of nausea rushing back. I look at my phone and see that my alarm is going to go off in 5 minutes. At this point, I’m just hoping I need to get the poison out of my body and I’ll be fine, but nothing works.</p>\n<p>“<i>Una noche más</i>” (one more night). It’s a phrase uttered to hotel clerks by many a cycle tourists traveling across Latin America over the years. By illness, by mechanical issues, or simply from not wanting to get back on the bike just yet and embracing the easy life of the city. The unplanned extra night that sometimes gets strung back-to-back-to-back to the point of feeling shame when asking for that 3rd consecutive <em>noche mas</em>. Like the clerk is thinking “Is this gringo ever going leave?!”. By this point, it was basically a meme between Joe and I, with our often out-of-sync ailments.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-09.jpg?fit=1200,1667&amp;quality=75\" width=\"463\" height=\"309\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-09.jpg?w=2500&amp;quality=75 2500w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-09.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-09.jpg?resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-09.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-09.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-09.jpg?resize=2048,1366&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-08.jpg?fit=1200,1667&amp;quality=75\" width=\"414\" height=\"276\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-08.jpg?w=2500&amp;quality=75 2500w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-08.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-08.jpg?resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-08.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-08.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-08.jpg?resize=2048,1366&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>Thankfully, I was starting to feel better by that evening, so we were able to hit the road the following day for Lago Mojanda. It was another classic Ecuadorian climb from Otavalo. Grinding away on a steep cobbled road surface for basically the entire day, both of us felt the days off in our legs, but it was good to be out again.</p>\n<p>Once we reached the lake, we skirted along the edge, which had buried the road, and connected to a rough track that would reach a second lake, tucked a bit further back away from the first lake, which sees quite a few locals coming up to visit.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-10.jpg?fit=1200,1667&amp;quality=75\" width=\"412\" height=\"275\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-10.jpg?w=2500&amp;quality=75 2500w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-10.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-10.jpg?resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-10.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-10.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-10.jpg?resize=2048,1366&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-11.jpg?fit=1200,1667&amp;quality=75\" width=\"402\" height=\"268\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-11.jpg?w=2500&amp;quality=75 2500w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-11.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-11.jpg?resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-11.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-11.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-11.jpg?resize=2048,1366&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>We got to Lago Chico and set up our tents in the one spot that wasn’t getting hammered by the wind. Little did we know that just a matter of weeks later, some other cyclists camping in the same spot would get robbed here while camping, in what sounds like a pretty brutal act. Looking back with hindsight, as gang violence and political unrest has risen sharply in Ecuador even as I write this, it’s probably a place I would avoid for now. Certainly I would not camp near this area, which is a bit too close and easy to access from some of the bigger cities, making tourists here an easy target these days, unfortunately.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-12.jpg?fit=1200,1667&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-12.jpg?w=2500&amp;quality=75 2500w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-12.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-12.jpg?resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-12.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-12.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-12.jpg?resize=2048,1366&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>In the morning we packed up and hit the road to Guayllabamba.

Destroyed by rainfall, and likely impassable by any type of vehicle. Our gear was taking a beating on the way down, but none more than Joe’s, who had a major mechanical issue that broke a piece on his rear rack, and badly damaged most of his drivetrain.</p>\n<p>We hobbled our way to the town of Pifo with Joe’s gears jumping all over the place and decided to get a taxi into Quito so he could try to hunt down some replacement parts to get rolling smoothly again. It was definitely an “una noche más” type of situation.</p>\n<p>A few days and a couple of trips back and forth to Quito later, Joe’s drivetrain was almost entirely replaced, and we were ready to head for one of the highlights of the Trans Ecuador, Cotopaxi volcano.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-23.jpg?fit=1200,1667&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-23.jpg?w=2500&amp;quality=75 2500w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-23.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-23.jpg?resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-23.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-23.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-23.jpg?resize=2048,1366&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>We rode through another nice section of rail trail which was a perfect way to get off of the busy streets this close to Quito. The trail hugged the edge of a steep hillside and passed through tunnel after tunnel before spitting us out onto a small road toward the town of Pintag.</p>\n<p>Seeing that we had missed all of the volcano views to the north due to the weather, we were dead set on getting a good view of Cotopaxi. You don’t come all the way down to Ecuador just to not see any of the volcanos, so we hunkered down in a hotel in Pintag and waited out another wave of stormy days in the small town. At the same time, Joe came down with an infection. It was like the perfect “una noche más” storm.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-26.jpg?fit=1200,1667&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-26.jpg?w=2500&amp;quality=75 2500w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-26.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-26.jpg?resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-26.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-26.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-26.jpg?resize=2048,1366&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>It wasn’t all bad though, between the hours of staring at weather apps, here we were introduced to the joys of the Ecuadorian Lechón. A few days per week, the local lechonería will cook up a whole pig, and serve it with <i>mote </i>(corn),<i> tortilla</i> (mashed potato), veggies, and<i> aji </i>(hot sauce). The restaurant opens in the morning, closes when the meat runs out, and basically the whole town comes through to get some in the meantime. With good reason, it is easily the best thing going in Ecuadorian cuisine if you’re a meat eater.</p>\n<p>No bluebird days were lining up for our Cotopaxi ride, so we bit the bullet and left on the best day we could find, hoping to just get a good glimpse the next morning, if we picked our campsite properly.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-30.jpg?fit=1200,1667&amp;quality=75\" width=\"382\" height=\"255\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-30.jpg?w=2500&amp;quality=75 2500w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-30.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-30.jpg?resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-30.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-30.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-30.jpg?resize=2048,1366&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /> <img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-31.jpg?fit=1200,1667&amp;quality=75\" width=\"391\" height=\"261\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-31.jpg?w=2500&amp;quality=75 2500w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-31.jpg?resize=1200,800&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-31.jpg?resize=2000,1334&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-31.jpg?resize=768,512&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-31.jpg?resize=1536,1024&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-31.jpg?resize=2048,1366&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>It was gloomy and drizzly when we left Pintag, as usual. Many of the roads were waterlogged from the storms of the previous days. I question if they’re ever not totally waterlogged to be honest.</p>\n<p>The route cut across farms, over big fences, up steep hillsides, and through soggy fields.

She immediately struck up a conversation beyond the usual exchange of pleasantries and started speed-walking next to me on the climb for the better part of 30 minutes. She told me about family she had living in the US, and how life was in this part of Ecuador in comparison to what she hears from them about the US. She has a very long walk back and forth to the field that she works from, which she does a few times per day, and she has a very tough job but has no interest in city life, be it in Ecuador or abroad. It all seems overwhelming. Here, life is challenging but simple. That doesn’t stop young people from fleeing the countryside to cities in droves, however.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1250\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-54.jpg?fit=1200,1250&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-54.jpg?w=2500&amp;quality=75 2500w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-54.jpg?resize=1200,600&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-54.jpg?resize=2000,1000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-54.jpg?resize=768,384&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-54.jpg?resize=1536,768&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/01/RyanWilson_TransEcuador_PartII-54.jpg?resize=2048,1024&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p>Continuing through the undulating hills, I made my way to Lago Quilotoa, an impressive mountain lake in the crater of a volcano.

Not wanting to get caught out in a very bad spot, and getting no views anyways, I blasted down the mountain toward the city of Riobamba where the search for a new tire would be on, and soon I could make my way toward some unfamiliar parts of a familiar country, Perú.</p>\n<p><em>For more info on the full route, check out Cass Gilbert and the Dammer Brother’s full <a href=\"https://bikepacking.com/routes/trans-ecuador-dirt-road/\" target=\"_blank\">route guide</a></em></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/bike-touring-ecuador-volcanic-corridor/\">Highs and Lows in Ecuador’s Volcanic Corridor</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"Ryan Wilson","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"d48ebad7ba25332b78c88be94c720a73d4c620b1022bc0c7340defbffcff89ba","category":"Cycling"}
