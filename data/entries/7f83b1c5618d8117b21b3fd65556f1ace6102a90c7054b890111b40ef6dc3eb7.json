The two watches look the same, but there are some subtle differences you won’t notice until you actually use each watch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you can’t get your hands on the watches, don’t fret. In this article, we point out the similarities and differences in each Apple Watch Ultra. If you’re in the market for one–or you’re wondering if you should upgrade from an original Ultra–we’ve got the details right here.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apple Watch Ultra vs. Ultra 2: Specifications</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><table><thead><tr><th></th><th><strong>Apple Watch Ultra 2  </strong></th><th><strong>Apple Watch Ultra</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Release year</td><td>2023</td><td>2022</td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td>49mm</td><td>49mm</td></tr><tr><td>Display</td><td>Always‑On Retina LTPO OLED Display</td><td>Always‑On Retina LTPO OLED Display</td></tr><tr><td>Front glass</td><td>Flat sapphire glass</td><td>Flat sapphire glass</td></tr><tr><td>Brightness</td><td>3,000 nits max; 1 nit min</td><td>2,000 nits max</td></tr><tr><td>GPS</td><td>GPS + Cellular</td><td>GPS + Cellular</td></tr><tr><td>System-in-a-Package (SiP)</td><td>· S9 SiP with 64-bit dual-core processor<br />· 4-core neural engine<br />· W3 wireless chip<br />· 2nd generation ultra-wideband chip</td><td>· S8 SiP with 64-bit dual-core processor<br />· W3 wireless chip<br />· U1 chip (ultra-wideband)</td></tr><tr><td>Input</td><td>· Digital Crown with haptic feedback<br />· side button<br />· Action Button<br />· double-tap gesture<br />· on-device Siri</td><td>· Digital Crown with haptic feedback<br />· side button<br />· Action Button<br />· Siri (phone-based)</td></tr><tr><td>Sensors</td><td>· temperature<br />· blood oxygen sensor<br />· electrical heart<br />· optical heart<br />· depth gauge<br />· water temperature</td><td>· temperature<br />· blood oxygen sensor<br />· electrical heart<br />· optical heart<br />· depth gauge<br />· water temperature</td></tr><tr><td>Health tracking</td><td>· high and low heart rate notifications<br />· irregular heart rhythm notification<br />· ECG app<br />· sleep phases </td><td>· high and low heart rate notifications<br />· irregular heart rhythm notification<br />· ECG app<br />· sleep phases</td></tr><tr><td>Safety</td><td>· international emergency calls<br />· emergency SOS<br />· accident detection<br />· fall detection<br />· siren   </td><td>· international emergency calls<br />· emergency SOS<br />· accident detection<br />· fall detection<br />· siren</td></tr><tr><td>Water resistance</td><td>Up to 100 meters</td><td>Up to 100 meters</td></tr><tr><td>Diving</td><td>40 meters recreational diving depth, EN13319 certified</td><td>40 meters recreational diving depth, EN13319 certified</td></tr><tr><td>Dust protection</td><td>IP6X</td><td>IP6X</td></tr><tr><td>Wireless connectivity</td><td>· LTE and UMTS<br />· WLAN 4 (802.11n)<br />· Bluetooth 5.3</td><td>· LTE and UMTS<br />· WLAN 4 (802.11n)<br />· Bluetooth 5.3</td></tr><tr><td>Audio</td><td>Two speakers and ring of three microphones with beamforming</td><td>Two speakers and ring of three microphones with beamforming</td></tr><tr><td>Storage</td><td>64GB</td><td>32GB</td></tr><tr><td>Battery life</td><td>Up to 36 hours; up to 18 hours with LTE; up to 72 hours in power-saving mode</td><td>Up to 36 hours; up to 18 hours with LTE; up to 60 hours in power-saving mode</td></tr><tr><td>Navigation</td><td>Precise dual-frequency GNSS: GPS, GNSS, Galileo and BeiDouL1 and L5 GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, QZSS and BeiDou, compass and always-on altimeter</td><td>Precise dual-frequency GNSS: GPS, GNSS, Galileo and BeiDouL1 and L5 GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, QZSS and BeiDou, compass, and always-on altimeter</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>61.4g</td><td>61.3g</td></tr><tr><td>Price</td><td>$799/£799</td><td>$799/£849</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apple Watch Ultra 1 vs. Ultra 2: Obvious differences</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The new chip in the <strong>Apple Watch Ultra 2 is the</strong> <strong>S9 System-in-a-Package</strong> (SiP), which has a four-core Neural Engine that can process machine learning operations faster than the S8 in the Ultra 1. The S9 is also <strong>capable of running Siri directly on the Ultra 2</strong>, instead of via the connected iPhone, as it does with the Ultra 1. Voice-to-text translations as also faster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ultra 2 has support for a <strong>new double-tap gesture</strong> that activates the main button within an open app. It involves tapping your index finger and thumb twice on your watch hand. While the double-tap gesture isn’t on the Ultra 1, it (as well as the Ultra 2) supports a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2067053/how-to-double-tap-gesture-old-apple-watch.html\">set of gestures that can be activated through the Accessibility settings</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>Ultra 2’s graphics processor is up to 30 percent faster</strong> than the Ultra 1’s. The <strong>Ultra 2’s second-generation ultra-wideband chip</strong> also enables more precise locations for tracked devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A difference that will catch your eye is the <strong>Ultra 2’s brighter display</strong>–its maximum 3,000 nits outshines the Ultra 1’s 2,000-nit max. The Ultra 2 display can also darken significantly more–the minimum brightness is just one nit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the U.S., the Apple Watch Ultra 2 costs the same $799 as the original Apple Watch Ultra. In Europe, the price is a big difference: The <strong>Ultra 2 is €100 lower</strong>; in the <strong>U.K. the Ultra 2 is £50 lower.</strong></p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Apple-Watch-S9-double-tap-gesture-230912.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple Watch Double Tap\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Apple-Watch-S9-double-tap-gesture-230912.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1920w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Apple-Watch-S9-double-tap-gesture-230912.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Apple-Watch-S9-double-tap-gesture-230912.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Apple-Watch-S9-double-tap-gesture-230912.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Apple-Watch-S9-double-tap-gesture-230912.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Apple-Watch-S9-double-tap-gesture-230912.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Apple-Watch-S9-double-tap-gesture-230912.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" /><figcaption><p>The Apple Watch Ultra 2 supports a double-tap gesture that activates</p> the primary button in a watch app, so you don’t<p> have to touch the screen.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Apple</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apple Watch Ultra 1 vs. Ultra 2: Not-so-obvious differences</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s start with file storage. The <strong>Ultra 2 has 64GB of storage</strong>, while the Ultra 1 has 32GB. This gives the user more flexibility; for example, you can save a lot of topographical maps offline for hikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>battery life for normal use with low power settings is longer with the Ultra 2 at 72 hours</strong>. The Apple Watch Ultra 1 was able to last up to 60 hours. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>Ultra 2 states its accuracy of the depth gauge at ±1 meter</strong>. It is currently unknown whether Apple has actually built in a more precise depth gauge or whether it has simply not mentioned it in the Ultra 1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to navigation, <strong>support for the Japanese network QZSS has disappeared</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>Ultra 2 works with iPhones from iPhone XS onwards</strong>, the Ultra 1 works with the iPhone 8, X, and later.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Which Apple Watch Ultra to buy?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re thinking about buying an outdoor watch, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 is at the top of the list. Apple gave the watch a new chip, making it more future-proof than its predecessor. The longer battery life in low-power mode is attractive. And the brighter display can make a difference in certain environments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That being said, since the new features are not must-haves, you can probably find a good deal on an Apple Watch Ultra 1. You can save a nice chunk of change and get a great watch for your adventures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This article originally appeared on <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.macwelt.de/article/2068016/apple-watch-ultra-vs-ultra-2-vergleich.html&amp;xcust=1-1-2087162-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">MacWelt</a> and was translated by <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/author/rloyola\">Roman Loyola</a>.</em></p>\n\nApple Watch</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"7f83b1c5618d8117b21b3fd65556f1ace6102a90c7054b890111b40ef6dc3eb7","category":"Apple"}
