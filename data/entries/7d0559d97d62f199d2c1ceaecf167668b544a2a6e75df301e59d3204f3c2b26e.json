The striking set of hoops have a one-piece construction where the rim, spokes and hub flanges are moulded and cured together. The hub shell is bonded later in the process, providing tension to the spokes and housing the DT Swiss 240 EXP internals.</p>\n<p>Microshift also announced its new <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/microshift-sword/\">Sword gravel bike groupset</a>. The affordable 10-speed gravel groupset features a clutch rear derailleur, 1x or 2x drivetrain options and is fully cable-actuated.</p>\n<p>Dutch electric bike brand <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/vanmoof-bankruptcy/\">VanMoof declared bankruptcy</a> after the co-founding brothers failed to secure a last-minute investment. The brand’s bikes offer high levels of technological functionality and in-built connectivity.</p>\n<p>VanMoof’s demise certainly raises some thought-provoking questions on whether you should invest in proprietary tech if spares might be hard to come by in the future. Let us know in the comments where you stand on the subject.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/2023-orbea-orca-omx/\">Orbea also announced its latest-generation Orca road bike</a>. The seventh-generation <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-climbing-bikes/\">climbing bike</a> prioritises light weight and ride quality over aerodynamics and the top-tier Orca OMX frame weighs in at a claimed 750g in a size 53cm.

There’s a raised collar at the back of the neck to further shield your skin from the elements.</p>\n<p>The jersey sports three open pockets at the back, with a fourth zipped valuables pocket.

<i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The Ether Light XT Insulated Air Sleeping Mat uses the brand’s ‘Air Sprung Cells’ for comfort, as well as two types of insulation to keep you warm from spring until the end of autumn.</p>\n<p>The sprung cells are constructed using loops of strong, flexible material, which Sea to Summit claims provides a plush sleeping experience – just what you need after an arduous day in the saddle.</p>\n<p>The sleeping mat is made from 30D/40D face fabric, which Sea to Summit says is light, quiet and durable.

The Cargo Cage functions like a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bottle-cages/\">bottle cage</a> and mounts onto eyelets on the fork blade. You can also mount it under the down tube if your frame has eyelets there and Apidura says it’ll clear the chainrings.</p>\n<p>You can adjust the tightness of the straps by cutting them down and there’s a hands-free release valve to compress the bag down.</p>\n<div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Apidura Expedition Cargo Fork Pack (1.3L) on Trek Checkpoint ALR Driftless\" title=\"Apidura Expedition Cargo Fork Pack (1.3L) on Trek Checkpoint ALR Driftless\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Like the other Expedition packs, it’s a roll-top design.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Oscar Huckle / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>I used the bags to store the majority of my food, as well as lightweight clothing such as a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-base-layers/\">baselayer</a> and boxer shorts for the evening.</p>\n<p>You could also use it to store tools or spares, but I chose to store these in my frame pack so I could have instant access to them.</p>\n<p>The bag weighs in at 75g on my digital scales, with the Cargo Cage coming in at 98g.</p>\n<ul><li><strong>Apidura Expedition Cargo Cage Pack (1.3l):</strong> £37/$48/€43/AU$68 (pack only) or £77/$100/€90/AU$141 with Cargo Cage</li>\n<li><strong>Apidura Cargo Cage:</strong> £40/$47/€47/AU$73</li>\n</ul><div>\n    <h5>Latest deals</h5>\n    <div></div>\n    <div></div></div>\n\n<h2>Specialized Romin EVO Pro with Mirror saddle</h2>\n<ul><li>\n    </li>\n</ul><div>\n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Specialized Romin Evo Pro with Mirror (1 of 4)\" title=\"Specialized Romin Evo Pro with Mirror (1 of 4)\" /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Romin Evo Pro with Mirror is now available with titanium rails.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Jack Luke / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Last year, Specialized trickled down its 3D-printed technology to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/specialized-pro-power-with-mirror-saddle/\">Power Pro with Mirror</a>, the first non S-Works <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-bike-saddles/\">saddle</a> model.</p>\n<p>The brand has now brought out an equivalent to its venerable Romin saddle line.
