And it was with only slight precedent anywhere in terms of how quickly it intensified.</p>\n<p>Otis was the textbook definition of rapid intensification, going from a 50 mph tropical storm on Monday evening to a 165 mph category 5 hurricane last night. Through about mid-morning on Tuesday, everything was going basically as you'd expect for a modest hurricane with Otis. It may have been tracking toward a category 2 type landfall, or even a category 3 type landfall in the worst case, if you assumed the general rules of rapid intensification in this region. But Otis did not follow the rules.</p>\n<p>Much like an onion, there are layers to this story that are important. First, take it from one of the more seasoned NOAA hurricane huntersâ€”this was not what they expected when they flew their mission on Tuesday. Meteorologist Jeremy DeHart wrote on the site formerly known as Twitter, \"I have arrived to a storm &amp; been surprised by the intensity, but nothing like this. Expected a marginal hurricane, found a Cat 3! Reminiscent of the stories I've heard about flying into Patricia ('05), in the same part of the world.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1978886#p3\">Read 17 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1978886&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b3678456b088b77d590f5b806c78330178adaff64e05d84d23abdf7be1373e02","category":"Tech"}
