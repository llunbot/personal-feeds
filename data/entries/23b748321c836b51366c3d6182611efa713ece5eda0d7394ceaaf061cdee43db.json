On one hand, cycling saw a boom with many companies shifting to a work from home model, and employees looking for a new outdoor hobby to spend their free time. On the other, supply chain shortages ran rampant throughout the industry and suddenly the supply couldn’t meet the demand. Depending on who you talk to, parts shortages happened for a number of reasons but the bottom line is if you have the ability to sell bikes, or even frames in 2021, consider yourself lucky. </p>\n<p>Before the pandemic, Sabrina and Max Clauson wanted a change of pace from their normal day-to-day lives so they purchased VYNL Bikes. Now they’re running it as a passion project from their home in Boulder, Colorado. While I was in town earlier this year, I swung by their house to take a look at the new VYNL brand and to shoot <a href=\"https://www.vynlbikes.com/vynl-road-rim-configurator/\" target=\"_blank\">Max’s /rd Rim brake bike</a> along with  <a href=\"https://www.vynlbikes.com/gravel-configurator/\" target=\"_blank\">Sabrina’s /gr Disc Gravel bike</a>. These no-nonsense machines come in stock geometry, have the option for custom paint, are made in the USA, and are perfect for a rider looking for a straight-up utilitarian bike for pavement or gravel. </p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at these two builds below…<span></span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/08/VYNL-Bikes-Road-Rim-Brake-1.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The /rd rim is a stunning example of a do-it-all, fast, and nimble road machine. These frames are made from 7005 aluminum in the shop of <a href=\"http://www.frankthewelder.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Frank the Welder</a> and finished by <a href=\"https://fluxcustoms.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Flux Customs</a> in Denver. They’ll fit a 32mm tire to soften those vibrations from the roughest of pavement, have a quick-release front and rear, are designed to be outfit with a 2x drivetrain, and have external cable routing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.vynlbikes.com/vynl-road-rim-configurator/\" target=\"_blank\">Rim Brake Road Specs</a>:<br />\n-7005 aluminum<br />\n-External cable routing<br />\n-32c tire clearance<br />\n-Quick release front and rear.<br />\n-Designed for 2x chainring set up<br />\n-BSA bottom bracket<br />\n-ZS44/EC44 headset size<br />\n-27.2mm seat post diameter<br />\n-2 bottle mounts</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/09/VYNL-gr-Gravel-Disc-1.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Sabrina’s /gr disc bike is a stunning example of just one of the possible ways you could build it up for gravel rides, racing, or even some touring. Like the /rd rim, the /gr disc is made from 7005 aluminum but this model is welded by <a href=\"https://www.simplebicycleco.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Simple Bicycle</a> in Portland. Unlike its rim-brake sibling, it has internal routing, fits a 45mm tire, has 12mm thru-axles front and rear, is designed for a 1x drivetrain but can use a 2x with Di2 or AXS, and has a T47 bottom bracket. The /gr disc is also finished by <a href=\"https://fluxcustoms.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Flux Customs</a> in Denver.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.vynlbikes.com/gravel-configurator/\" target=\"_blank\">Gravel Disc Specs</a>:<br />\n-7005 aluminum<br />\n-Internal cable routing<br />\n-45c tire clearance<br />\n-12mm thru-axle front and rear<br />\n-Designed for 1x chainring set up, can accommodate 2x in Di2/AXS<br />\n-T47 bottom bracket<br />\n-EC34/EC44 headset size<br />\n-27.2mm seat post diameter<br />\n-2 bottle mounts<br />\n-flat mount disc brakes</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/08/VYNL-Bikes-Road-Rim-Brake-10.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/09/VYNL-gr-Gravel-Disc-8.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>VYNL even offers custom decals and painted to match ENVE forks. Right now, they’re priding themselves on their quick turnaround. From the day you order your bike, you only have to wait 2-4 weeks for the road rim (frames in-stock, turnaround includes paint + finishing). 4-6 weeks for the disc frames (gravel and road). Not bad. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/08/VYNL-Bikes-Road-Rim-Brake-2.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/09/VYNL-gr-Gravel-Disc-3.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>As for pricing, the /rd rim and /gr disc (they even make a /rd disc bike) runs $1750.00 for a raw frame with decals. You can pick from standard color finishing or custom colors, and a Cane Creek or King headset, and painted to match ENVE fork all as add-on options if you’d like to get a bit more custom. </p>\n<p>Full geometry and specs are available at <a href=\"https://www.vynlbikes.com/frames/\" target=\"_blank\">VYNL bikes</a>.</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"23b748321c836b51366c3d6182611efa713ece5eda0d7394ceaaf061cdee43db","category":"Cycling"}
