Soon after, details emerged about the sub's <a href=\"https://www.insider.com/titan-submarine-ceo-complained-about-obscenely-safe-regulations-2023-6\">non-standard design</a> that did not meet regulations, including steering apparently handled by a $30 Logitech F710 wireless PC game controller from 2010.</p>\n\n<p>Reuters <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/whos-board-missing-titanic-sub-2023-06-20/\">reports</a> that the five-person crew of the missing vessel, known as <em><a href=\"https://oceangate.com/our-subs/titan-submersible.html\">Titan</a></em>, includes Hamish Harding, a British billionaire and adventure enthusiast, and OceanGate's founder and CEO, Stockton Rush. It disappeared on Sunday while on an expedition to explore the <em>Titanic</em> shipwreck site after losing contact with the Polar Prince research ship, roughly 1 hour and 45 minutes after their dive began.</p>\n<p>The submarine was last reported in the North Atlantic, approximately 900 miles east of Cape Cod, in a water body known to have a depth of about 13,000 feet. Search and rescue operations began shortly thereafter and are still underway. According to the BBC, the entire sub is <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65953872\">bolted shut</a> from the outside, so even if the vessel surfaces, the occupants cannot escape without outside assistance and could suffocate within the capsule.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1948808#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1948808&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"3b6d0a532ad2c41cc6c70daad74c62255b4a4c75e3a825f2691f1de53b2aa22f","category":"Tech"}
