While <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/golden-pliers-is-portlands-newest-gilded-age-bike-shop/\" target=\"_blank\">their last location</a> incorporated a cafe, the new location is mainly a bike shop. Fear not, coffee is still close at hand right next door. All the things that made Golden Pliers great at their last location carry over to the latest iteration. The space is filled with nic-nacs, fancy bike bits, ephemera, and relics from Kevin and Becky’s bike adventures. I am greeted with a hug from Mary who I haven’t seen since <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2024-ruta-del-jefe-en-cuenca-los-ojos-de-mexico/\" target=\"_blank\">Ruta Del Jefe</a> this past spring. Walking into the shop felt like a deep exhalation after a weekend of rubbing elbows at Made.</p>\n<p>Me and Becky catch up and talk about their upcoming trip to ride the <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/bikepacking-roots-northwoods-route/\" target=\"_blank\">Northwoods Route</a>. I send her a few pins of not-so-legal camp spots that are nonetheless primo spots. I’ve run into Kevin and Becky running away from winter in Tucson as well as Mary visiting her sister down south and it feels nice to finally make it back to their home turf for a hello.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-1.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-1.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-1.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-1.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-26.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-26.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-26.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-26.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-2.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-2.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-2.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-2.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Whats In A Name?</h3>\n<p>Golden Pliers may seem like a strange name for a bike shop but, as with most good names, there is a story behind it. Kevin explains:</p>\n<p><em>The name “Golden Pliers” comes from an old story about a Super Famous Bicycle Racer from the 1950s. The racer was asked by a journalist what the key to all of their success was, and that Super Famous Bicycle Racer replied “Well, it is my mechanic of course, my Golden Pliers!” Something about that stuck with me. Bicycle mechanics don’t tend to get much credit for the work they do, and here we have this Super Famous Bicycle Racer giving all the credit to their mechanic. It felt honest and it felt right.</em></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-39.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-39.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-39.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-39.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-40.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-40.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-40.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-40.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>You may be surprised when you walk into Golden Pliers by the lack of complete bikes for sale on the floor. Golden Pliers focuses on service and repairs and has an exceptionally curated stock of “nice things” as maintaining a fleet of complete bikes on the floor is expensive and space-intensive. However, the Golden Pliers crew is happy to help with dream builds from the frame up. Golden Pliers did have a small selection of shiny Singular and Rivendell frames hanging from the ceiling just waiting to become someone’s next dream bike. Golden Pliers is Portland’s Rivendell dealer, so holler at them for all your classy commuting needs.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-48.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-48.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-48.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-48.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-54.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-54.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-54.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-54.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-57.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-57.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-57.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-57.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>New Bike Day!</h3>\n<p>Speaking of custom Rivendell builds, I happened upon Cody while he was commuting via e-scooter to pick up his new Rivendell build. We rolled over to the shop as Kevin was putting the finishing touches on his Clem Smith Jr. With the fender bolts properly ground down, he was ready to roll, what serendipity. Cody’s dad sent him a Little Caesars gift card recently that is now doing double duty as a spoke card. It really ties the whole orange bike together.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-64.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-64.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-64.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-64.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-59.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-59.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-59.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-59.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-63.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-63.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-63.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-63.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<h3>Patrick’s Humuhumu Ti Unicorn</h3>\n<p>Patrick, one of the mechanics, was also excited to show me his unicorn Kona Humuhumu Ti. He has multiple iterations of the Humuhumu, but this is his crown jewel. With plenty of fun details, you can really see the dedication and time spent collecting all the bits to make his dream bike happen.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-32.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-32.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-32.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-32.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-37.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-37.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-37.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-37.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-9.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-9.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-9.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-9.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>The shop is just littered with amazing bits and bobs. Becky’s forever classic bags from <a href=\"https://www.makeshiftercanvasworks.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Makeshifter Canvas Works</a> instantly caught my eye. I was able to get myself a new Makeshifter wallet as my current one was on its last legs. Art from multiple friends such as <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sean.hipkin/\" target=\"_blank\">Sean Hipkin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/rustypedal/\" target=\"_blank\">Colin Holmes</a> line the walls and make the space feel even more homey. There is even a crate of vinyl records if you’re in need of some tunes, and don’t forget to check out Kevin’s bands <a href=\"https://rtrmnt.bandcamp.com/album/buyers-remorse\" target=\"_blank\">Retirement</a> and <a href=\"https://solitaryruin.bandcamp.com/album/rite-of-despondency\" target=\"_blank\">Solitary Ruin</a>. There was no shortage of shiny parts or cool memorabilia to gawk at in the glass cases. Between Kevin’s spare records and Becky’s bags, the shop truly embodies the owners and their passions.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-6.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-6.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-6.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-6.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-68.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-68.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-68.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-68.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-18.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-18.jpg?w=300&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-18.jpg?w=600&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Golden_Pliers_Shop_Visit-18.jpg?w=800&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Golden Pliers is as lovely and well-curated a shop as one could ask for. I see so much of what I would dream of if I were to ever own a bike shop in their decisions. Come for the “Nice Things” and stay for the lovely folks and bike repair. Make sure to find your way to this wonderful shop if you make it to Portland!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/golden-pliers-bike-shop-portland/\">Golden Pliers Bike Shop Visit: Portland’s Home for Quality Repair and Nice Things</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://theradavist.com\">The Radavist</a>.</p>","author":"spencer harding","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"30c77ea747d2f9e829ab81c19985707110ab7b5c0839c5e81fe89e5fe8b64c36","category":"Cycling"}
