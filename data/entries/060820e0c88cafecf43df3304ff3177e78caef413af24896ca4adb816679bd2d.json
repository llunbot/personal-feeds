Liège-Bastogne-Liège is the last chance saloon for any riders to take a major one-day win before the peloton’s focus shifts over to stage racing and the Grand Tours next month. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Known by its nickname of La Doyenne – a complimentary French term for an old lady – Liège-Bastogne-Liège is characterised by the short and steep hills of the Ardennes in Wallonia, the French-speaking region in Southern Belgium. As one of cycling’s five great <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-classics-monuments-cobbles\">Monuments</a>, the stakes will be high for the last of our Ardennes thrillers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Liège-Bastogne-Liège is the hardest of the three Ardennes Classics. It’s over 250km in length for the men and often features as much climbing as a hard Tour de France mountain stage, making it a worthy end to the spring season. Changed slightly in 2019, the route now fittingly finishes by returning to Liège as opposed to nearby Ans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year saw a roaring return to Liège-Bastogne-Liège for Tadej Pogačar, who claimed the Monument title just a year after breaking his wrist at the race in 2023. He’ll be looking to defend his title on Sunday, this time with fellow two-time champion Remco Evenepoel for company. Unlike the Slovenian, the reigning women’s champion Grace Brown won’t be here to defend her title, having retired at the end of 2024. In her absence, Demi Vollering, Elisa Longo Borghini and Pauline Ferrand-Prévot will be the ones to watch.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Liège-Bastogne-Liège 2025 key information</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-07T124341.728-970x647.png\" alt=\"cote de la roche aux focons tour de france femmes 2024\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-07T124341.728-970x646.png 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-07T124341.728-300x200.png 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-07T124341.728-768x512.png 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-07T124341.728-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-07T124341.728-750x500.png 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-07T124341.728-1140x760.png 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-07T124341.728-465x310.png 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-07T124341.728-620x413.png 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-07T124341.728-350x233.png 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/08/file-2024-08-07T124341.728.png 1800w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Billy Ceusters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Date:</strong> Sunday 27th April</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Start:</strong> Men’s: Liège; Women’s: Bastogne</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Finish:</strong> Liège</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Distance:</strong> Men’s: 252km; Women’s: 152.9km</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Live TV coverage:</strong> TNT Sports, Discovery+, Peacock, FloBikes, SBS, SuperSport, Sporza</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>2024 winners:</strong> Tadej Pogačar (UAE Team Emirates); Grace Brown (FDJ-Suez)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Most wins:</strong> Five: Eddy Merckx; Two: Annemiek van Vleuten, Anna van der Breggen, Demi Vollering</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions?utm_source=Web&amp;utm_medium=Banner&amp;utm_campaign=Banner+2\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-2-970x300.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-2-970x300.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-2-300x93.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-2-768x238.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-2-1536x476.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-2-2048x634.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-2-750x232.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/04/Subs-flash-163-for-web-2-1140x353.webp 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Liège-Bastogne-Liège 2025 routes and profiles</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Men’s parcours</h3>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"686\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/lbl-2025-map-686x970.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/lbl-2025-map-686x970.webp 686w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/lbl-2025-map-212x300.webp 212w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/lbl-2025-map-768x1086.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/lbl-2025-map-750x1061.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/lbl-2025-map.webp 960w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>The route of the men’s Liège-Bastogne-Liège has had a bit of a rejig this year. The arrowhead shape used over the past decade has been reformed into more of a figure of eight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ride to Bastogne has been swapped out for a tamer opening with fewer hills during the race’s opening phase. Once in Bastogne, the peloton turns back on itself, now in a northwesterly direction towards the Col de Hausserie. After that test, the course soon returns to the familiar <em>parcours </em>with around 100km to go, just before the Côte de Mont-le-Soie. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, it’s non-stop with the climbs as the race traverses its toughest challenges at the Col du Rosier (5.6km at 5.5%) and the Côte de Desiné (1.6km at 8.1%) before tackling the iconic Côte de la Redoute (1.9km at 9.6%).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The final uphill test on the course will come at the Côte de La Roche-aux-Faucons (4.4km at 5.4%). After the crest of the Roche-aux-Faucons at 13.3km to go, the race will dive down into the industrial city of Liège just as it has since 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"960\" height=\"429\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/lbl-2025.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/lbl-2025.webp 960w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/lbl-2025-300x134.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/lbl-2025-768x343.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/lbl-2025-750x335.webp 750w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Women’s parcours</h3>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"960\" height=\"1357\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/lbl-women-2025-map.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/lbl-women-2025-map.webp 960w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/lbl-women-2025-map-212x300.webp 212w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/lbl-women-2025-map-686x970.webp 686w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/lbl-women-2025-map-768x1086.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/lbl-women-2025-map-750x1060.webp 750w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>After years of heading out in the morning before the men, the women will take on La Doyenne after the men’s peloton in 2025. Contrary to the race’s name, the women start from Bastogne. In a similar course to last year the women will head northwards, mirroring the route taken on by the men.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The women’s race has increased in length by around 5km in comparison to last year’s. Most of the route remains unchanged, but the period after around 50km has been altered to add an extra climb.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise, the final 100km are almost identical to the men’s race, with more hills than you can shake a stick at.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"960\" height=\"791\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/lbl-women-2025.webp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/lbl-women-2025.webp 960w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/lbl-women-2025-300x247.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/lbl-women-2025-768x633.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/lbl-women-2025-750x618.webp 750w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/pro-cycling-news-2025-amstel-gold\">Pro Log: Evenepoel returns;

With the Grand Tours on the horizon and a last chance for Classics glory on the line, the stakes will be high for plenty of teams looking to end the spring period with confidence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The men’s race will be all about the two previous champions: Tadej Pogačar and Remco Evenepoel. After looking rather fatigued last weekend at the Amstel Gold Race, the momentum seems to be shifting towards the fresher Evenepoel. It feels quite 50-50 at the moment between the two, so it’ll be interesting to see how they finally match up on the Walloonian course. Elsewhere, the battle for third looks quite open. Mattias Skjelmose will be hoping to carry his Amstel fortunes over here, while Tom Pidcock will be aiming to podium his first Monument since leaving Ineos last year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The women’s race will pit the best GC contenders in the world against one another, this time with the Vuelta Femenina on the horizon. Demi Vollering will come in as the favourite, given her undisputed strength on the hills and her strong FDJ-Suez support. Elisa Longo Borghini and Anna van der Breggen will be in close pursuit, with the Dutchwoman in particular having thrived at this race before her 2021 retirement. Pauline Ferrand-Prévot and Lotte Kopecky should also find themselves towards the head of the race on Sunday.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><em>Cyclist’s </em>ratings: Men’s race</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>★★★★★: Tadej Pogačar (UAE Team Emirates XRG), Remco Evenepoel (Soudal Quick-Step)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>★★★★: Mattias Skjelmose (Lidl-Trek)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>★★★: Tom Pidcock (Q36.5 Pro Cycling), Lennert Van Eetvelt (Lotto), Kévin Vauquelin (Arkéa-B&amp;B Hotels), Ben Healy (EF Education-EasyPost)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>★★: Mauro Schmid (Jayco-AlUla), Dani Martínez (Bahrain Victorious), Thibau Nys (Lidl-Trek), Romain Grégoire (Groupama-FDJ), Giulio Ciccone (Lidl-Trek)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>★: Santiago Buitrago (Bahrain Victorious), Laurens De Plus (Ineos Grenadiers), Louis Barré (Intermarché-Wanty), Oscar Onley (Picnic-PostNL), Romain Bardet (Picnic-PostNL)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><em>Cyclist’s </em>ratings: Women’s race</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>★★★★★: Demi Vollering (FDJ-Suez), Elisa Longo Borghini (UAE Team ADQ)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>★★★★: Anna van der Breggen (SD Worx-ProTime), Pauline Ferrand-Prévot (Visma-Lease a Bike)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>★★★: Kasia Niewiadoma (Canyon-SRAM-Zondacrypto), Juliette Labous (FDJ-Suez), Puck Pieterse (Fenix-Deceuninck), Liane Lippert (Movistar)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>★★: Kim Le Court (AG Insurance-Soudal),  Ashleigh Moolman-Pasio (AG Insurance-Soudal), Lotte Kopecky (SD Worx-Protime), Niamh Fisher-Black (Lidl-Trek)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>★: Noemi Rüegg (EF Education-Oatly), Yara Kastelijn (Alpecin-Deceuninck), Cédrine Kerbaol (EF Education-Oatly), Ellen van Dijk (Lidl-Trek)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to watch Liège-Bastogne-Liège 2025 </h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><div></div><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/20240421LBL0075-A.S.O.-Gaetan-Flamme-970x647.webp\" alt=\"21/04/2024 - Liège Bastogne Liège - Liège / Liège (254,5 km) - POGACAR Tadej (UAE TEAM EMIRATES)\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/20240421LBL0075-A.S.O.-Gaetan-Flamme-970x646.webp 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/20240421LBL0075-A.S.O.-Gaetan-Flamme-300x200.webp 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/20240421LBL0075-A.S.O.-Gaetan-Flamme-768x512.webp 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/20240421LBL0075-A.S.O.-Gaetan-Flamme-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/20240421LBL0075-A.S.O.-Gaetan-Flamme-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/20240421LBL0075-A.S.O.-Gaetan-Flamme-750x500.webp 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/20240421LBL0075-A.S.O.-Gaetan-Flamme-1140x760.webp 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/20240421LBL0075-A.S.O.-Gaetan-Flamme-465x310.webp 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/20240421LBL0075-A.S.O.-Gaetan-Flamme-620x413.webp 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/04/20240421LBL0075-A.S.O.-Gaetan-Flamme-350x233.webp 350w\" /><figcaption>A.S.O./Gaëtan Flamme</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Liège-Bastogne-Liège will be shown live on TNT Sports 4 throughout the afternoon in the UK and Ireland.

It was one by Léon Houa in 10 hours 48 minutes but the remaining 16 riders trickled in over the next five hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two years later, in 1894, the race was held for professionals and Maurice Garin, the first winner of the Tour de France, finished fourth.

A Belgian himself, Merckx won Liège five times, three of which were consecutive. Merckx claimed his fifth and final win in 1975, making him the only person to date to win La Doyenne five times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to the April date, the weather can be very changeable and the 1980 edition is perhaps the most well-known due to the heavy snowfall that befell the race, ultimately earning the nickname ‘Neige-Bastogne-Neige’ [neige being snow in French].</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1990 the management of the race was moved over to ASO, which resulted in a complete revamp of the route. The start/finish was moved out of Liège to Ans and five new climbs were added. Since then, the race has boasted an eclectic list of winners from Grand Tour champions, domestiques and Ardennes specialists. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Liège-Bastogne-Liège: Famous editions</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>1969 – first Merckx victory</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/04/02125353/eddy_merckx_liege_bastogne_liege_1969-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"eddy_merckx_liege_bastogne_liege_1969\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/04/02125353/eddy_merckx_liege_bastogne_liege_1969-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/04/02125353/eddy_merckx_liege_bastogne_liege_1969-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/04/02125353/eddy_merckx_liege_bastogne_liege_1969-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/04/02125353/eddy_merckx_liege_bastogne_liege_1969-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/04/02125353/eddy_merckx_liege_bastogne_liege_1969-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/04/02125353/eddy_merckx_liege_bastogne_liege_1969-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/04/02125353/eddy_merckx_liege_bastogne_liege_1969-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/04/02125353/eddy_merckx_liege_bastogne_liege_1969.jpg 1200w\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>By 1969, Eddy Merckx had been a professional for eight years but had yet to win at Liège. ’69 had been a great year for Merckx as prior to Liège he had won every major classic in the calendar apart from Paris-Roubaix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With just under 100km to go to the finish, Merckx broke clear on the Stockeu and caught two of his team mates, Roger Swerts and Vic Van Schil, who had been in the early breakaway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Swerts was eventually dropped, so Merckx and Van Schil rode to the finish together. Merckx wanted to give the win to Van Schil but Van Schil insisted Merckx claim it. This was the first of five victories – a record that still stands.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1980 – Hinault in the snow</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/04/02125403/bernard_hinault_1980_liege-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"bernard_hinault_1980_liege\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The 1980 edition of Liège is perhaps the most well-known thanks to the appalling conditions that the riders had to endure. A blizzard began within minutes of the race starting and after an hour only 60 riders, approximately one-third of the starters, were still left in the race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two riders broke away and had a lead of just over two minutes by Le Stockeu but were caught by Hinault and two other chasers on the Haute Levée. With 80km to go Hinault attacked again and, after seven hours of racing, finished in Liège 10 minutes ahead of the second-place finisher Hennie Kuiper. Hinault suffered frostbite in his right hand and he claims it took over three weeks for movement to return.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1985, ’86 and ’87 – the Argentin years</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"646\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/04/02125409/argentin_helly_liege_1987-970x646.jpg\" alt=\"argentin_helly_liege_1987\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Liège-Bastogne-Liège in the mid-1980s is remembered for the complete domination of Moreno Argentin. Argentin, also known as ‘Il Capo’ [The Boss] was a one-day specialist that had great success in the Ardennes Classics. What makes his wins most special is the calibre of rider he defeated: Sean Kelly, Stephen Roche, Phil Anderson, Guiseppi Sarroni, Greg LeMond, Robert Millar – the list goes on. Argentin ultimately went on to win the race a fourth time in 1991.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2011 – Philippe Gilbert, a modern classic</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/04/02125415/gilbert_schleck_liege_2011-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"gilbert_schleck_liege_2011\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>2011 was Philippe Gilbert’s year and he topped off a storming ‘Ardennes week’ with his win at Liège, making him one of only two people to ever do the triple – Amstel Gold, La Flèche Wallone and Liège (he also won Brabanste Pijl too). The win was especially sweet as he displayed his complete dominance over the race. Gilbert broke away with the two Schleck brothers with approximately 20km to go. Everyone expected the two brothers, who were teammates, to work together to beat Gilbert but he put the power down on the final straight and dropped them both to become the first Belgian winner since 1999.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2020 – A comedy of errors…and Primož Roglič</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2016/04/02125424/pressesports_582932_cycle_-4_primoz_roglic_julian_alaphippe_2020_liege_bastogne_liege-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"pressesports_582932_cycle_-4_primoz_roglic_julian_alaphippe_2020_liege_bastogne_liege\" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Moved to October due to Covid, the 2020 edition of Liège-Bastogne-Liège provided a serious dose of schadenfreude. With the Tour de France behind them, its climax saw an in-form group of four, including Tour winner, Tadej Pogačar, second-placed Primož Roglič, plus stage winners Julian Alaphilippe and Marc Hirschi contest the sprint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Assumed to be the strongest finisher in the bunch, Alaphilippe kicked things off but quickly cut across the road putting both Hirschi and Pogačar out of the running. Assuming the race was sewn up, he then took his hands off the bars to celebrate, unaware his sweep across the road had failed to collect the still pedalling Roglič. A lunge of the bike was all it took for the Slovenian to nab victory, a win few begrudged a man who’d weeks before seen his Tour win slip away. Even more embarrassment followed for Alaphilippe, who found himself demoted to fifth for deviating from his line.
