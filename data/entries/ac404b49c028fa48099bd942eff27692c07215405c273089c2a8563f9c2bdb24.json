And if you’re more interested in those new iPhones than the software that will run on them, you’ll want to keep reading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Serial leaker Majin Bu has posted <a href=\"https://x.com/MajinBuOfficial/status/1927720026062139565\">a video to his X account</a> that purports to show the iPhone 17 Pro Max from every angle. The 30-second video leaves nothing to the imagination as the handset gets a full 360-degree showcase. The color appears to be either white or silver, and the screen is never turned on, so it’s likely a non-working dummy model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you do get a good look at the newest design feature: the rear camera. While the lenses are still arranged in a triangular pattern, the camera array is no longer square. Rather, it stretches across the entire top portion of the back of the phone, with the LED flash and LiDAR sensor pushed to the right side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bu says the phone looks “beautiful,” and it’s hard to argue. The new camera array blends naturally with the back of the phone, and the contours fit seamlessly into the design. While obviously bigger then previous arrays, it’s also more striking and acts as a true design element designed with the phone rather than something tacked on out of necessity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also speaks to the rumored new iOS design, which is expected to feature greater transparency. Apple isn’t going to talk about the new iPhones during the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678333/wwdc-ios-macos-watchos-hardware-keynote.html\">WWDC keynote</a>, but it reportedly will be sending resources to third-party retail employees “to help you talk to customers about what’s possible when hardware and software are designed together.” So it definitely seems like iOS 26’s new look will extend to hardware as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is expected to unveil the new iPhones at an event in September. Along with the iPhone 17 Pro Max, the lineup is also expected to feature a new ultra-thin phone called the iPhone 17 Air.
