It sets different prices for each product range. The discounts are only currently available for iPads, MacBooks and Macs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Education discounts are not available on the iPhone, Apple TV, Apple Watch, HomePods, accessories, or software. AirPods are not available, either, but you can often find deals on Amazon and other retailers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Students can save up to $200/£220 on Macs and up to $50/£50 on iPads. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a closer look at the prices in <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subId1=1-1-670705-1-0-0&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fus-edu%2Fshop&amp;subid1=1-1-670705-1-0-0\" target=\"_blank\">Apple’s U.S. Education Store</a>, <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435298/7615?subId1=1-1-670705-1-0-0&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fuk-edu%2Fshop%2Fgo%2Fhome&amp;subid1=1-1-670705-1-0-0\" target=\"_blank\">Apple’s U.K. Education Store, the Canadian Education Store,</a> or <a href=\"http://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435410/7643?subId1=1-1-670705-1-0-0&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fau-hed%2Fstore&amp;subid1=1-1-670705-1-0-0\" target=\"_blank\">Apple’s Australian Education Store</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s not all that students can get from Apple though. Between June and October each year in the northern hemisphere, and between January and March in the southern hemisphere, Apple runs a promotion for students with qualifying purchases from the Apple Education Store. In 2022, Apple offered gift cards, but the company usually gives away AirPods–and AirPods are what Apple is giving away in Australia for the promotion in 2023. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The promotion means that if a registered student buys a Mac or iPad, they can get a pair of AirPods for free, or get money of a pair of AirPods Pro. In 2022 a gift card was offered that ranged in value depending on the device bought. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673191/apple-back-school-sale.html\">Learn more about Apple’s back-to-school promotion</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>MacBook student discount</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Below are the discounts on the base model Macs, with bigger discounts on the more expensive models.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>U.S. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-670705-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/us-edu/shop/buy-mac/macbook-air/with-m1-chip\"><strong>M1</strong> <strong>MacBook Air</strong></a>: Regular price $999, student price $899. <strong>$100 off.</strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-670705-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/us-edu/shop/buy-mac/macbook-air/with-m2-chip\">M2 MacBook Air</a></strong>: Regular price $1,199, student price $1,099. <strong>$100 off.</strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-670705-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/us-edu/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro\">13in MacBook Pro</a></strong>: Regular price $1,299, student price $1,199.<strong> $100 off.</strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-670705-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/us-edu/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/14-inch\">14in MacBook Pro:</a></strong> Regular price $1,999, student price $1,849. <strong>$150 off.</strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-670705-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/us-edu/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/16-inch\">16in MacBook Pro:</a></strong> Regular price $2,499, student price $2,299. <strong>$200 off.</strong></li><li><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-670705-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/us-edu/shop/buy-mac/imac\"><strong>iMac</strong>:</a> regular price $1,299, student price $1,249.<strong> $50 off.</strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-670705-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/us-edu/shop/buy-mac/mac-mini\">Mac mini:</a> </strong>regular price $599, student price $499. <strong>$100 off.</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>U.K. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-670705-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/us-edu/shop/buy-mac/macbook-air/with-m1-chip\"><strong>M1</strong> <strong>MacBook Air</strong></a>: Regular price £999, student price £899. <strong>£100 off.</strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-670705-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/us-edu/shop/buy-mac/macbook-air/with-m2-chip\">M2 MacBook Air</a></strong>: Regular price £1,249, student price £1,149. <strong><strong>£100 off.</strong></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-670705-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/us-edu/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro\">13in MacBook Pro</a></strong>: Regular price £1,349, student price £1,249.<strong> <strong>£100 off.</strong></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-670705-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/us-edu/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/14-inch\">14in MacBook Pro:</a></strong> Regular price £2,149, student price £1,989. <strong>£160 off.</strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-670705-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/us-edu/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/16-inch\">16in MacBook Pro:</a></strong> Regular price £2,699, student price £2,479. <strong>£220 off.</strong></li><li><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-670705-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/us-edu/shop/buy-mac/imac\"><strong>iMac</strong>:</a> regular price £1,399, student price £TBC. </li><li><strong><a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-670705-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/us-edu/shop/buy-mac/mac-mini\">Mac mini:</a> </strong>regular price £649, student price £539. <strong>£110 off.</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has recently put up iMac prices in the U.K., so we are awaiting education pricing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may be able to get better discounts if you shop elsewhere.

If you are a student in high school you will be disappointed to learn that you don’t qualify for this discount, although your school could buy equipment for students at a discount. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are three types of people who can qualify for a student discount:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Students in higher education (post-secondary education, e.g. university, college).</li><li>People who are buying for education institutions.</li><li>Parents of higher education students buying on their behalf.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple spells this out in more detail in its terms and conditions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the U.S. these state that the following groups are “eligible to purchase from the Apple Store for Education:”</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>K-12</strong> <strong>staff</strong>: Any employee of a public or private K-12 institution in the United States is eligible, including homeschool teachers (this doesn’t include people educating their children during lockdowns). In addition, school board members who are currently serving as elected or appointed members are eligible. PTA or PTO executives currently serving as elected or appointed officers are eligible.</li><li><strong>Higher education staff and students</strong>: Faculty and staff of higher educational institutions in the U.S.; and students attending, or accepted into a higher educational institution in the U.S. are eligible to purchase. Purchases from the Apple Store for Education Individuals are not for institutional purchase or resale.</li><li><strong>Higher education parents</strong>: Parents purchasing on behalf of their child, who is a student currently attending or accepted into a public or private higher educational institution in the U.S. are eligible to purchase.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has a similar set of terms and conditions for eligibility in the U.K.:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Employees of any education institution</strong>: Any employee of a public or private education institution in the U.K.</li><li><strong>Post-secondary education students</strong>: Students attending or accepted into a post-secondary education institution in the U.K.</li><li><strong>Parents of post-secondary students</strong>: Parents purchasing on behalf of their child, who is a student currently attending or accepted into a public or private post-secondary education institution in the U.K.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re attending higher education, or have been accepted into a higher education/post-secondary institution, you qualify for an Apple discount. (In the U.K. post-secondary means university, or any other formal education that takes place after secondary education is complete. Therefore, this excludes sixth-form colleges, although it may be worth inquiring at an Apple Store to see if the company is prepared to relax the rules.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Parents of post-secondary/higher education students do not qualify when buying for themselves, but they can pick up a discounted Mac for their child from the education store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anybody who works in an education environment qualifies for a discount on certain Apple products. It’s not just limited to teachers and lecturers, but also covers administrative workers and other staff members. Essentially, it’s anybody who works at or for a school, college, or university. (This is not limited to post-secondary institutions. Apple refers to “any education institution.”)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This does mean that you can’t get a discount for a Mac or iPad for your child who is currently at school, although the school could make the purchase and provide the equipment for students. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you don’t qualify for an Apple Education Store discount, we’d recommend instead checking out the <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-670705-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Refurbished Store</a>, which offers discounts for everyone.

If you are a student you should follow these steps: </p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Visit <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subId1=1-1-670705-1-0-0&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fus-edu%2Fshop&amp;subid1=1-1-670705-1-0-0\" target=\"_blank\">Apple’s U.S. Education Store</a>.</li><li>Choose the Mac of iPad you want and click on your selection. </li><li>Once you have customized your Apple product, click <em>Continue</em>.</li><li>Enter your delivery details and check out. </li><li>Beware that Apple can request to see evidence that you are a student at any point during or after the purchase and will charge an additional fee if you fail to provide it.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have any problems, we recommend you get your student status verified with <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.myunidays.com/US/en-US/partners/appleeducationstore/spotlight/online&amp;xcust=1-1-670705-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">UNiDAYS</a> or log on from your university network. Make sure you have quick access to some form of official identification that proves you qualify for the education discount. Your student ID is a good choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In January 2022, Apple changed the U.S. Education Discount Store to require validation from UNiDAYS before students can get a discount, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/606352/apple-removes-unidays-verification-education-store.html\">but it then removed the requirement</a>. Apple could re-implement this validation step that students in other countries have to go through. If it does it may still be possible for non-students in the U.S. to avoid the validation step, as per this <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/s7g5t6/apple_education_store_now_requires_unidays_and/&amp;xcust=1-1-670705-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Reddit post</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canadian students can follow the same steps as the U.S. Start shopping on the <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-670705-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/ca_edu_93120/store\" target=\"_blank\">Canadian Apple Education Store</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How to get an Apple student discount in the U.K.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>U.K. students will need to register with UNiDAYS before they can get a discount from the Apple Education Store. </p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Click this <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435298/7615?subId1=1-1-670705-1-0-0&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fuk-edu%2Fshop%2Fgo%2Fhome&amp;subid1=1-1-670705-1-0-0\" target=\"_blank\">link to Apple’s U.K. Education Store</a> to access the Apple Education site.</li><li>Once there you’ll be encouraged to sign up on the student discount website <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.myunidays.com&amp;xcust=1-1-670705-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">UNiDAYS</a>.
