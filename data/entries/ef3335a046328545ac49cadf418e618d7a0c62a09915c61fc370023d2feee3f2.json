{"title":"MacOS 15 Sequoia’s Annoying-as-Hell ‘Turn On Reactions’ Menu Bar Prompt","link":"https://birchtree.me/blog/this-alert-must-die/","date":1743358851000,"content":"\n<p>Matt Birchler:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I really thought that the screen recording notifications in macOS\nSequoia would be the bane of my existence, but thankfully those\nhave been changed quite a bit from the early betas last summer and\nthey’re totally a non-issue in my book today. However, these god\ndamned “turn on reactions” alerts have got to die in a fire, and\nthey need to have done it yesterday.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I understand why Apple decided to show this once. Why though, is it seemingly designed to reappear every time I start a video call? Who is <em>not</em> annoyed by this?</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/30/birchler-sequoia-turn-on-reactions\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"ef3335a046328545ac49cadf418e618d7a0c62a09915c61fc370023d2feee3f2","category":"Tech"}
