       <p>The 2022 Orange Alpine Evo builds on the British’s brand’s iconic monocoque frame design and single pivot suspension with geometry updates, suspension kinematic changes and frame construction advancements.</p>\n<p>These updates, Orange claims, make its latest <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/mtb/mountain-bike-wheel-sizes-26in-650b-and-29in-explained/\">27.5in wheeled</a> Alpine a true one bike quiver that should be capable of “dominat[ing]… in challenging and aggressive terrain.”</p>\n<p>Although, compared to the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/reviews/bikes/mountain-bikes/full-suspension-mountain-bikes/orange-alpine-6-factory-first-ride-review/\">outgoing Alpine 6 I reviewed back in 2019</a> it’s down on rear-wheel travel by 10mm, from 165mm to 155mm, and has less front wheel travel too, with 160mm.</p>\n<h2>2022 Orange Alpine Evo frame details</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Although it’s not hugely different looking to the old Alpine, Orange hopes the updates mean it’ll ride much better.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Orange Bikes</i></span></div>\n<p>The latest Alpine has been treated to a host of under-the-bonnet performance updates which mean it’s kept its iconic silhouette.</p>\n<p>The front end’s monocoque design and swing arm’s 6061-T6 aluminium custom-butted tubes have been reduced in thickness, which Orange hopes will create the perfect balance of characteristics out on the trail.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Alpine Evo is made in the UK.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Orange Bikes</i></span></div>\n<p>According to Orange, the new asymmetrically shaped swing-arm is less prone to twisting under pedalling loads but still manages to retain lateral flex, which it claims helps to improve grip when the bike is leant over in turns.</p>\n<p>Orange claims repositioning the driveside chainstay lower than the outgoing model, better integrating the bearing housings and decreasing tube thickness has increased longitudinal stiffness by 20 per cent and overall strength by 15 per cent.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Getting the Evo treatment means the geometry has been slackened and lowered.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Orange Bikes</i></span></div>\n<p>Orange has done this by using finite element analysis (FEA for short) to ensure the new lighter swing-arm is strong enough to withstand the rigours of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/beginners-guide-to-enduro-racing/\">enduro riding</a>.</p>\n<p>Other changes include compatibility with SRAM’s UDH (Universal Derailleur Hanger) and revised rear wheel dropouts that retain the <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/features/mtb-axle-standards/\">Boost 148×12 axle spacing</a> of the old bike.</p>\n<p></p><div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n

moniker, the Alpine has been given the long, slack and low treatment.</p>\n<p>Orange has slackened out the head tube angles to 63 degrees and steepened seat tube angles to 76 degrees.</p>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Just in case you forget.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Orange Bikes</i></span></div>\n<p>Elsewhere, reach figures have grown, spanning 458mm for the smallest size Alpine Evo up to 513mm for the biggest.</p>\n<p>Wheelbases are just as long, topping out at 1,301mm.</p>\n<p>All four sizes of the 2022 Alpine Evo share a 445mm chainstay length, which is once again up on the old bike.</p>\n<div>\n                <table><colgroup><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col><col></col></colgroup><thead><tr><th>﻿Size</th><th>Small</th><th>

was available in five sizes from small to extra-extra-large, but even though the new model drops the extra-extra-large name, the largest bike now on offer is actually bigger than the outgoing model.</p>\n<h2>2022 Orange Alpine Evo suspension details</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Revised pivot and shock location mean the suspension is now more progressive than ever.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Orange Bikes</i></span></div>\n<p>Now offering 155mm of rear-wheel travel, Orange says it’s tuned the 2022 Alpine to be the “most progressive suspension of any Alpine model to date.”</p>\n<p>This, it says, makes it more playful and agile and offers more support throughout the suspension’s travel.</p>\n<p>However, Orange hasn’t provided details on how much more progressive it is compared to the old Alpine, and whether it’s more or less progressive than other models in its range.</p>\n<h2>2022 Orange Alpine Evo models, prices and
