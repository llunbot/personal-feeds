BMC says it comes down to design simplification, integration, and classic optimized carbon construction. The result then, this new Speedmachine is a full 500g lighter than the <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/bmc-timemachine-01-disc-slips-in-as-the-ultimate-triathlon-tt-bike/\" target=\"_blank\">old Timemachine 01 Disc</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>More Integration</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BMC-Speedmachine-all-new-time-trial-triathlon-bike-developed-with-Red-Bull-F1_cockpit-integration.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BMC-Speedmachine-all-new-time-trial-triathlon-bike-developed-with-Red-Bull-F1_cockpit-integration.jpg\" alt=\"BMC Speedmachine time-trial triathlon bike, integrated cockpit\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BMC-Speedmachine-all-new-time-trial-triathlon-bike-developed-with-Red-Bull-F1_cockpit-integration.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BMC-Speedmachine-all-new-time-trial-triathlon-bike-developed-with-Red-Bull-F1_cockpit-integration-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BMC-Speedmachine-all-new-time-trial-triathlon-bike-developed-with-Red-Bull-F1_cockpit-integration-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BMC-Speedmachine-all-new-time-trial-triathlon-bike-developed-with-Red-Bull-F1_cockpit-integration-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BMC-Speedmachine-all-new-time-trial-triathlon-bike-developed-with-Red-Bull-F1_cockpit-integration-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BMC-Speedmachine-all-new-time-trial-triathlon-bike-developed-with-Red-Bull-F1_cockpit-integration-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>That integration is also no huge surprise. Getting cables out of the way is a minimum requirement for any modern bike. And for racing against the clock, a more integrated fork-to-frame and a fully integrated cockpit that retains fit &amp; position adjustability is also key. The new bike gets flat or low base bars, plus a wider fit range via adjustable extensions and stack solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For triathlon, add on integrated storage solutions that can also improve aerodynamics by smoothing airflow, and you get free speed. Make those storage solutions removable, and then the bike can double as a UCI-legal TT bike, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BMC-Speedmachine-all-new-time-trial-triathlon-bike-developed-with-Red-Bull-F1_seatpost-storage.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1350\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BMC-Speedmachine-all-new-time-trial-triathlon-bike-developed-with-Red-Bull-F1_seatpost-storage.jpg\" alt=\"BMC Speedmachine time-trial triathlon bike, rear storage\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BMC-Speedmachine-all-new-time-trial-triathlon-bike-developed-with-Red-Bull-F1_seatpost-storage.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BMC-Speedmachine-all-new-time-trial-triathlon-bike-developed-with-Red-Bull-F1_seatpost-storage-297x223.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BMC-Speedmachine-all-new-time-trial-triathlon-bike-developed-with-Red-Bull-F1_seatpost-storage-800x600.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BMC-Speedmachine-all-new-time-trial-triathlon-bike-developed-with-Red-Bull-F1_seatpost-storage-120x90.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BMC-Speedmachine-all-new-time-trial-triathlon-bike-developed-with-Red-Bull-F1_seatpost-storage-768x576.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BMC-Speedmachine-all-new-time-trial-triathlon-bike-developed-with-Red-Bull-F1_seatpost-storage-1536x1152.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The core of storage integration is a big integrated hydration box that sits low, just above the bottom bracket, where a couple of standard water bottles would be. A semi-internal, semi-external hydration hose routes water up to the rider in an aero tuck, but is still easy to keep clean. The big reservoir holds 1.2L of water, plus a smaller UCI-legal 400ml bottle/water tank that can be kept in place for time trials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Triathletes also get an extra aero storage box behind the seattube, with an integrated taillight. But it snaps off for TT racing, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Upgraded Packability</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BMC-Speedmachine-all-new-time-trial-triathlon-bike-developed-with-Red-Bull-F1_removable-cockpit.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BMC-Speedmachine-all-new-time-trial-triathlon-bike-developed-with-Red-Bull-F1_removable-cockpit.jpg\" alt=\"BMC Speedmachine time-trial triathlon bike, pacakble\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BMC-Speedmachine-all-new-time-trial-triathlon-bike-developed-with-Red-Bull-F1_removable-cockpit.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BMC-Speedmachine-all-new-time-trial-triathlon-bike-developed-with-Red-Bull-F1_removable-cockpit-297x178.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BMC-Speedmachine-all-new-time-trial-triathlon-bike-developed-with-Red-Bull-F1_removable-cockpit-800x480.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BMC-Speedmachine-all-new-time-trial-triathlon-bike-developed-with-Red-Bull-F1_removable-cockpit-120x72.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BMC-Speedmachine-all-new-time-trial-triathlon-bike-developed-with-Red-Bull-F1_removable-cockpit-768x461.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BMC-Speedmachine-all-new-time-trial-triathlon-bike-developed-with-Red-Bull-F1_removable-cockpit-1536x922.jpg 1536w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>At first, it might seem strange that a premium race bike needs to be packable. But triathlons are one of the few styles of racing that mean most triathletes are going to have to pack up their bike and fly somewhere to compete. How many of the 2000 triathletes that race Ironman Worlds live in Kona, after all? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And all this modern integration and hydraulic disc brakes mean you can’t just pop the stem off and stuff it in a box to fly with your bike. Now you need a carefully thought-out cockpit solution like on this new BMC Speedmachine. You can remove the bar+stem combo without the fork falling out of the frame, and with enough cabling flexibility to fit it in a bike bag. Plus, no need to mess with your perfectly dialed-in aerobars positioning.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Radical New Geometry, too!</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BMC-Speedmachine-all-new-time-trial-triathlon-bike-developed-with-Red-Bull-F1_racing-against-the-clock-and-sunset.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BMC-Speedmachine-all-new-time-trial-triathlon-bike-developed-with-Red-Bull-F1_racing-against-the-clock-and-sunset.jpg\" alt=\"2024 BMC Speedmachine time-trial triathlon bike, riding\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BMC-Speedmachine-all-new-time-trial-triathlon-bike-developed-with-Red-Bull-F1_racing-against-the-clock-and-sunset.jpg 1600w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BMC-Speedmachine-all-new-time-trial-triathlon-bike-developed-with-Red-Bull-F1_racing-against-the-clock-and-sunset-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BMC-Speedmachine-all-new-time-trial-triathlon-bike-developed-with-Red-Bull-F1_racing-against-the-clock-and-sunset-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BMC-Speedmachine-all-new-time-trial-triathlon-bike-developed-with-Red-Bull-F1_racing-against-the-clock-and-sunset-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BMC-Speedmachine-all-new-time-trial-triathlon-bike-developed-with-Red-Bull-F1_racing-against-the-clock-and-sunset-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BMC-Speedmachine-all-new-time-trial-triathlon-bike-developed-with-Red-Bull-F1_racing-against-the-clock-and-sunset-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BMC-Speedmachine-all-new-time-trial-triathlon-bike-developed-with-Red-Bull-F1_racing-against-the-clock-and-sunset-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BMC-Speedmachine-all-new-time-trial-triathlon-bike-developed-with-Red-Bull-F1_racing-against-the-clock-and-sunset-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>BMC stresses “supremely confident handling” for the new Red Bull developed Speedmachine. Again adding on the rider-centric fit, the improved stability of the new Speedmachine platform was refined to increase rider confidence, allowing them to hold their best aero tuck longer, race with deeper aero wheels, and earn more speed as a reward.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BMC-Speedmachine-all-new-time-trial-triathlon-bike-developed-with-Red-Bull-F1_secret-geometry-scaled.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1117\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BMC-Speedmachine-all-new-time-trial-triathlon-bike-developed-with-Red-Bull-F1_secret-geometry-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"2024 BMC Speedmachine time-trial triathlon bike, super secret geometry\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BMC-Speedmachine-all-new-time-trial-triathlon-bike-developed-with-Red-Bull-F1_secret-geometry-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BMC-Speedmachine-all-new-time-trial-triathlon-bike-developed-with-Red-Bull-F1_secret-geometry-297x130.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BMC-Speedmachine-all-new-time-trial-triathlon-bike-developed-with-Red-Bull-F1_secret-geometry-800x349.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BMC-Speedmachine-all-new-time-trial-triathlon-bike-developed-with-Red-Bull-F1_secret-geometry-120x52.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BMC-Speedmachine-all-new-time-trial-triathlon-bike-developed-with-Red-Bull-F1_secret-geometry-768x335.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BMC-Speedmachine-all-new-time-trial-triathlon-bike-developed-with-Red-Bull-F1_secret-geometry-1536x670.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/BMC-Speedmachine-all-new-time-trial-triathlon-bike-developed-with-Red-Bull-F1_secret-geometry-2048x894.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>To get that, BMC gave the all-new Speedmachine some “radical head tube angle, rake, and trail dimensions”.
