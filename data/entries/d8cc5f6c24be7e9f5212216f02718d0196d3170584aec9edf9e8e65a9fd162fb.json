Anthropic says it plans to roll out web search to free users and additional countries \"soon,\" but the company gave no specific timeline.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWeb search functionality has become a standard feature among leading AI chatbots. OpenAI began introducing ChatGPT Search to paying subscribers last fall and eventually made the feature available to all users – including those without a ChatGPT account – early <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/06/chatgpt-search-without-an-account/\">last month</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAnthropic is pitching the web search function as particularly valuable for professionals across various fields. The company suggests sales teams can use it to analyze industry trends, financial analysts can assess current market data, and researchers can build stronger literature reviews by searching across primary sources.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/03/claude-web-search.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3840\" height=\"2160\" />\r<br />\nFor everyday users, the feature also promises to simplify comparison shopping by evaluating product features, prices, and reviews from multiple sources simultaneously.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPaying Claude users in the US can access web search by enabling the feature through their profile settings menu. The functionality is currently limited to Claude 3.7 Sonnet, which is Anthropic's first \"hybrid reasoning model\" capable of both quick responses and step-by-step problem solving.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/anthropic/\">Anthropic</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/21/anthropic-claude-gets-web-search/\">Anthropic's Claude Finally Gets Web Search, Months After ChatGPT</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/anthropics-claude-finally-gets-web-search-months-after-chatgpt.2453685/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d8cc5f6c24be7e9f5212216f02718d0196d3170584aec9edf9e8e65a9fd162fb","category":"Apple"}
