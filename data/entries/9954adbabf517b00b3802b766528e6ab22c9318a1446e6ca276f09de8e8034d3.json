{"title":"The New York Times: ‘How the Humane AI Pin Flopped’","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/technology/humane-ai-pin.html","date":1717711200000,"content":"\n<p>Tripp Mickle and Erin Griffith, with a “not what Humane needed the day after announcing their charging case is a potential fire hazard” report for The New York Times:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Days before gadget reviewers weighed in on the Humane Ai Pin, a\nfuturistic wearable device powered by artificial intelligence,\nthe founders of the company gathered their employees and\nencouraged them to brace themselves. The reviews might be\ndisappointing, they warned.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I realize this is only a passing summary of the meeting, but I would hope that everyone at the company was aware of the AI Pin’s shortcomings. They’re the ones who were most familiar with it! However much trouble Humane is in, they were comically doomed if their own employees needed to be told the AI Pin was not a good product just days before reviews dropped. One would think the real topic of this all-hands was to explain why they shipped what they shipped and what the plan was to make it good.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>About a week after the reviews came out, Humane started talking to\nHP, the computer and printer company, about selling itself for\nmore than $1 billion, three people with knowledge of the\nconversations said. Other potential buyers have emerged, though\ntalks have been casual and no formal sales process has begun.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/05/24/humane-is-for-sale\">I’m going to be insufferable</a> if they sell to HP.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Its setbacks are part of a pattern of stumbles across the world of\ngenerative A.I., as companies release unpolished products. Over\nthe past two years, Google has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/01/technology/google-ai-overviews-rollback.html\">introduced and pared back A.I.\nsearch</a> abilities that recommended people eat rocks,\nMicrosoft has trumpeted a Bing chatbot that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/16/technology/microsoft-bing-chatbot-limits.html\">hallucinated</a>\nand Samsung has added A.I. features to a smartphone that were\ncalled “<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24053907/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review-ai-screen-camera-battery\">excellent at times and baffling at others</a>.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The above paragraph exemplifies the sort of catch-22 corner the media is trying to portray Apple as having been painted into regarding AI. It’s just stated as fact that Apple “<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/apple-ai-siri-development-behind-9ea65ee8\">has fallen behind in the AI arms race</a>” (that’s from yesterday in the WSJ) but the companies Apple has supposedly fallen behind are, on their own, described with words like <em>unpolished</em>, <em>embarrassing</em>, <em>hallucinating</em>, <em>untrustworthy</em>, and even <em>baffling</em>. Like <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/05/24/publishing-ai-slop-is-a-choice\">I wrote two weeks ago</a>, isn’t “behind” where you want to be when those who are ahead are publishing nonsense?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Many current and former employees said Mr. Chaudhri and Ms.\nBongiorno preferred positivity over criticism, leading them to\ndisregard warnings about the Ai Pin’s poor battery life and power\nconsumption. A senior software engineer was dismissed after\nraising questions about the product, they said, while others left\nout of frustration.</p>\n\n<p>Mr. Chaudhri said his company, which had 250 employees at its\npeak, encouraged workers to offer feedback. The departures were a\nnatural consequence of transitioning from creating a new device to\nsustaining it after its release, which he said appealed to “a\ndifferent type of person.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It is the kiss of death for any endeavor, creative or technical, to have a culture where brutally honest internal criticism is not welcome, especially when it goes up the chain. In fact it <a href=\"https://www.littlealmanack.com/p/biggest-lesson-steve-jobs\">needs to be the expectation</a>, if you’re pursuing excellence. This is probably one of the reasons why Chaudhri, in particular, is not remembered fondly in Cupertino. The key is to always remember to critique the work, not the person. It’s never personal; it’s <em>always</em> about the work.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>From the beginning, current and former employees said, the Ai Pin\nhad issues, which reviewers later picked apart. One was the\ndevice’s laser display, which consumed tremendous power and would\ncause the pin to overheat. Before showing the gadget to\nprospective partners and investors, Humane executives often\nchilled it on ice packs so it would last longer, three people\nfamiliar with the demonstrations said. Those employees said such\nmeasures could be common early in a product development cycle.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I’ll bet “<a href=\"https://music.apple.com/us/album/ice-ice-baby-single/1493045043\">Ice Ice Baby</a>” is within Humane’s budget to license, even pre-acquisition.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/06/nyt-humane\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"9954adbabf517b00b3802b766528e6ab22c9318a1446e6ca276f09de8e8034d3","category":"Tech"}
