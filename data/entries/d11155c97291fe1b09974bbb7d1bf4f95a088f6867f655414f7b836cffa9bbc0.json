This change means the iPhone will support a more universal charging standard, benefit from faster data transfer speeds, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/05/Apple-Prefer-USB-C-Lightning-Feature-Remake.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nBelow, we have recapped rumors about the iPhone switching to USB-C, including potential speed differences, other Apple accessories adopting USB-C, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>Speed Differences</h3>\r<br />\nWhile all iPhone 15 models are expected to have a USB-C port, only the Pro models <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/11/16/iphone-15-high-speed-data-transfer/\">will support at least USB 3.2 or Thunderbolt 3</a> for faster data transfer speeds up to 40 Gbps, according to Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. He expects the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus to remain limited to USB 2.0 speeds of up to 480 Mbps like Lightning.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niPad Pros gained Thunderbolt 3 support in 2021, while the USB-C port on the latest iPad Air is capable of up to 10 Gbps transfer speeds. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>Made for iPhone Optimizations</h3>\r<br />\nApple plans to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/21/kuo-iphone-usb-c-faster-charging-speeds/\">optimize the fast-charging performance</a> of chargers certified under its \"Made for iPhone\" program on iPhone 15 models, according to Kuo. Uncertified cables will allegedly have <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/02/28/iphone-15-usb-c-accessories-limited-without-mfi/\">limited charging and data transfer speeds</a>. It's worth noting that Apple does not limit uncertified cables for iPads with USB-C ports, so this would be a different approach with the iPhone if this rumor proves to be accurate.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>Apple Accessories Moving to USB-C</h3>\r<br />\nWith the iPhone 15 switching to USB-C, several Apple accessories are expected to follow suit:<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/27/usb-c-earpods-rumor/\">EarPods</a></li>\r<br />\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/24/airpods-pro-2-usb-c-later-this-year/\">AirPods Charging Cases</a></li>\r<br />\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/05/15/kuo-usb-c-apple-accessories/\">MagSafe Battery Pack</a></li>\r<br />\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/05/15/kuo-usb-c-apple-accessories/\">Magic Mouse</a></li>\r<br />\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/05/15/kuo-usb-c-apple-accessories/\">Magic Trackpad</a></li>\r<br />\n<li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/05/15/kuo-usb-c-apple-accessories/\">Magic Keyboard</a></li></ul>The latest Siri Remote for the Apple TV already features a USB-C port.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is expected to announce the iPhone 15 series in September. Many more changes are rumored for the Pro models, including a titanium frame, faster A17 Bionic chip, thinner bezels around the display, Wi-Fi 6E support, and more.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15/\">iPhone 15</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-15-pro/\">iPhone 15 Pro</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/usb-c/\">USB-C</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/usb-c-iphone/\">USB-C iPhone</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/iphone.99\">iPhone</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/05/17/iphone-15-usb-c-rumor-recap/\">Rumor Recap: What to Expect From the iPhone 15's USB-C Port</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/rumor-recap-what-to-expect-from-the-iphone-15s-usb-c-port.2389794/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"d11155c97291fe1b09974bbb7d1bf4f95a088f6867f655414f7b836cffa9bbc0","category":"Apple"}
