{"title":"How to Generate a Report of Apple Intelligence Requests Sent to Private Cloud Compute","link":"https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/apple-intelligence-and-privacy-iphe3f499e0e/ios","date":1742084981000,"content":"\n<p>From Apple’s support documentation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You can generate a report of requests your iPhone has sent to\nPrivate Cloud Compute.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Go to Settings, then tap Privacy &amp; Security.</p></li>\n<li><p>Tap Apple Intelligence Report, then choose a report duration\nfor the last 15 minutes (default) or last 7 days.

My first generated report was empty for the last 7 days, and it was empty again even after running the Writing Tools Proofread function on the text of my 4,000-word “<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2025/03/something_is_rotten_in_the_state_of_cupertino\">Something Is Rotten in the State of Cupertino</a>” article from this week. But when I ran the Writing Tools Summarize feature on the same text, I wound up with a long entry that was sent to Private Cloud Compute. So, at the moment, Summarize seems like a good way to invoke Private Cloud Compute, even from a relatively powerful Mac.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/03/something-is-rotten-in-cupertino-apple-intelligence-summary.text\">Here’s the summary Apple Intelligence generated</a>. I have to say: it’s pretty good. It’s completely petty but also completely <em>me</em> to notice and object to the way it uses two spaces after periods — and worse, only <em>some</em> of the time. Also, the sentence “This raises concerns about the company’s ability to maintain its position as a leader in AI innovation” is, let’s say, off the mark.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/15/how-to-generate-a-report-of-apple-intelligence-requests-sent-to-private-cloud-compute\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"4c852384ce84fbc74943bff7277806a5bc3b816df753f92dc7b7b61031c7e224","category":"Tech"}
