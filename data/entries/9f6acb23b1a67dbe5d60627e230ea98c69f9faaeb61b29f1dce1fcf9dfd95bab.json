 </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I started All In Racing to try to make racing a better place for LGBT+ people and to show that proper inclusion can help the sport grow – there’s two main ways I approach this. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are public projects like the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/rapha-lgbtq-socks-all-in\" target=\"_blank\">rainbow socks</a> and funding the UCI Andover Supercross in 2022, and there’s the background work: engaging with brands, organisations, events, teams and individuals to help educate and inform people on the value of LGBT+ inclusion. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview_5-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"ALL IN cycling banner\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview_5-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview_5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview_5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview_5-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview_5-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview_5-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview_5-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview_5-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview_5-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview_5.jpg 2048w\" /><figcaption>Ian Wrightson</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>That’s a large undertaking, what goals are you currently focussing on?   </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The current goal is to effect policy change and get British Cycling (BC) to update its participation policy to provide a pathway for transgender cyclists to compete authentically. The justifications BC made public for their current exclusionary policy demonstrate an inaccurate and incomplete assessment of medical science and fail to appropriately consider the social impacts on the LGBT+ and racing communities. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest issue was the lack of any attempt from BC to inform the cycling community on the nuanced reality of the scientific and social aspects of transgender inclusion, so that’s what I’m working on now – finding ways to educate and inform groups and individuals. Most of that work necessarily has to happen out of the public view so that people can feel comfortable engaging confidentially or even anonymously. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"654\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview_2-970x654.jpg\" alt=\"Josh Jones racing in ALL IN cycling kit\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview_2-970x654.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview_2-300x202.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview_2-768x518.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview_2-1536x1035.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview_2-750x505.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview_2-1140x768.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview_2.jpg 2048w\" /><figcaption>Olivia Coukham</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>You seem less than impressed with British Cycling’s decision-making process on the matter. What do you think are the main issues with its report?  </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I was told by BC that the direction the board of directors gave the task force was to prove that cisgender women wouldn’t be at a performance disadvantage. The task force was asked to explicitly justify transgender inclusion. This approach seems to me to be backwards; it embeds the preconception that transgender women pose a threat to cisgender women and so it unfairly assumes guilt. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we want to treat people equally then we should have inclusion as the baseline and ask policy groups to explicitly justify exclusion – ‘Can we conclusively prove that transgender women retain an advantage?’ With this approach we treat people as innocent until proven otherwise, something I think we’d all want for ourselves. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"392\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview_6-970x392.jpg\" alt=\"ALL IN cycling banner\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview_6-970x392.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview_6-300x121.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview_6-768x311.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview_6-1536x621.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview_6-750x303.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview_6-1140x461.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview_6.jpg 2048w\" /><figcaption>Ian Wrightson</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there’s BC’s approach to the medical science – the UCI published their own assessment a couple of weeks before the BC policy was announced and came to the conclusion that it was ‘impossible to confirm’ whether an advantage persists or not (post-HRT). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>BC referenced just four papers, which is clearly not enough and the conclusions of most of these have since been challenged or even formally updated to address author bias and methodological issues. Until more sport-specific studies have been conducted, the medical science in isolation is insufficient to base policy on. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other challenge from BC is that they have so far been unwilling to meaningfully engage with the LGBT+ community. They haven’t published more details of their medical assessment and recommendations that were made to the board to back up their short public arguments and have been unable to address specific, detailed concerns raised with the papers they’ve referenced. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>It’s a controversial topic at the moment, especially given the political climate, but would you clarify All In Racing’s position on transgender participation in cycling?  </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I believe the sport should be inclusive to everyone. As the science is inconclusive, it’s crucial to look at both the social and moral arguments as well. LGBT+ people, especially trans people, are more at risk of homelessness, mental health issues, substance abuse issues, self harm, suicide, etc. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As cyclists, we know the benefits that riding a bike can bring to both our physical and mental health, as well as promoting a sense of community, so why wouldn’t we want to share that with as many people as possible, particularly those in vulnerable communities? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We must ensure there is a pathway for transgender women to compete authentically, just as for the rest of us. While imperfect, the old UCI policy or the new USA Cycling policy would both be good places to start and specific requirements should be fine-tuned over time as more sport-specific research becomes available. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview_1-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Josh Jones racing in ALL IN cycling kit\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview_1-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview_1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview_1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview_1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview_1-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview_1-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview_1-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview_1-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview_1-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview_1.jpg 2048w\" /><figcaption>Adam Oliver</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Many are worried that we are watching the death of the British racing scene, and some would say that British Cycling is to blame. Do you think that BC is still fit for purpose?   </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>BC is clearly struggling at the moment. Income is down, membership is down, participation is down. Many parts of the racing scene are struggling or have already disappeared – events, teams, individuals. BC has a very real image problem and is, on an institutional level, perceived pretty poorly within the cycling community. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It has a monopoly over most types of racing, but still struggles to create any real value in the sport domestically for event organisers, volunteers, riders, clubs, teams etc. A lot of this stems from poor community engagement over many years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>BC is making efforts here – there is a road racing task force currently running, but the approach of these efforts misses a lot of nuance, and general confidence is low that productive change will come from it. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><img width=\"647\" height=\"970\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview_7-647x970.jpg\" alt=\"Josh Jones in ALL IN cycling kit\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview_7-647x970.jpg 647w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview_7-200x300.jpg 200w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview_7-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview_7-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview_7-750x1125.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview_7-1140x1710.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview_7.jpg 1365w\" /><figcaption>Ian Wrightson</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<p>So it strikes me as obvious that now, more than ever, is the time for a renewed focus on inclusion – helping the sport to grow and attract new people from new walks of life. It’s a clear route to start to reverse the declining membership and participation trends, and approaching new communities not currently engaged in cycling would enable BC to distance itself from the baggage it carries in existing communities.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How do you feel about the state of diversity in British cycling at the moment?  </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I can summarise this with an example. BC is currently running a task force to look at elite road racing and recently published its initial analysis, looking at key issues based on data from race entries. One of the key observations when first published was that ‘better steps can be taken to address the low level of ethnic diversity in the sport’. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It called out ethnicity specifically but there is no mention of LGBT+ inclusion or other protected characteristics. I think this perfectly captures the issue for LGBT+ inclusion – there is so little allyship and advocacy for LGBT+ inclusion within the organisation that nobody within BC (who wrote the document) or the task force picked up this omission. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/british-nationals-2023-3-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"British National Championships\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/british-nationals-2023-3-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/british-nationals-2023-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/british-nationals-2023-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/british-nationals-2023-3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/british-nationals-2023-3-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/british-nationals-2023-3-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/british-nationals-2023-3-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/british-nationals-2023-3-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/british-nationals-2023-3-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/06/british-nationals-2023-3-350x233.jpg 350w\" /><figcaption>James York</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Although I reached out to the task force chair and never got a response, I did manage to get BC to update the document after contacting a different member of the task force who works closely with All In Racing, but one advocate is not enough. BC removed the word ‘ethnic’, so the statement now refers to ‘diversity’ in an undefined and unspecific way and I have virtually no confidence that LGBT+ inclusion will be considered in any outputs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, outside of BC there are many individuals, event organisers and teams that have reached out to me and that I know are supportive of LGBT+ inclusion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the current transgender participation policy makes any other activity showcasing LGBT+ inclusion connected with BC or UCI events impossible as it would be little more than tokenistic queerwashing: BC’s policy is standing in the way of authentic inclusion for the whole LGBT+ community.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Where do we go from here then? How do we make things better?  </h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We need to educate and inform, first and foremost. Most people don’t have a good understanding of the challenges faced by the LGBT+ community and the real value that authentic inclusion and welcoming environments can provide. It’s why I’m finding ways to work with people all across the sport who are allies, or just curious. BC is far from perfect but I am also exploring ways to work with them to improve their understanding of the LGBT+ community. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Individually we can all take steps to educate ourselves. A quick Google of LGBT+ equality and looking at recent news articles will help, Stonewall also provides great resources on allyship and the challenges faced by the LGBT+ community. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Cyclists sat astride bikes, with rainbow flag ALL IN socks\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/all_in_interview.jpg 2048w\" /><figcaption>Josh Jones</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In a sport-specific way there is an article from <em>Cyclist </em>looking at <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/british-cycling-trans-policy-opinion\" target=\"_blank\">some of the issues with the BC justification</a>, and I have also recently written a piece for <a href=\"https://thebritishcontinental.co.uk/2023/09/27/inclusion-matters-why-our-governing-bodies-transgender-policies-fail-the-cycling-community/\" target=\"_blank\">The British Continental that breaks down a lot of challenges and frames the topic</a> in a wider social context. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If people want to do more then I’ll also take the opportunity to tout the <a href=\"https://www.allinracing.org/product-page/rainbow-socks\" target=\"_blank\">All In Racing rainbow socks</a> through our website.
