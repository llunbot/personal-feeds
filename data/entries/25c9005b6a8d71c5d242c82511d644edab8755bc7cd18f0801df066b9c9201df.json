And like many other Falcon 9 launches this year, the \"Starlink 10-9\" mission carried 23 of the broadband internet satellites into orbit. However, after a rare failure earlier this month, this particular Falcon 9 rocket was making a return-to-flight for the company, and attempting to get the world's most active booster back into service.</p>\n<p>And by all measures, it performed. The first stage booster, B-1069, made its 17th flight into orbit before landing on the <em>Just Read the Instructions</em> drone ship in the Atlantic Ocean. Then, a little more than an hour after liftoff, the rocket's second stage released its payload into a good orbit, from which the Starlink spacecraft will use their on-board thrusters to reach operational altitudes in the coming weeks.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039608#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2039608&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"25c9005b6a8d71c5d242c82511d644edab8755bc7cd18f0801df066b9c9201df","category":"Tech"}
