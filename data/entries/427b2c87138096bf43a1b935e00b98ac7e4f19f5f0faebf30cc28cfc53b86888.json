You can watch a recording of the\nlivestream on our <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@FrameworkComputer\">YouTube channel</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sean Hollister has <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/24190757/modular-laptops-repairable-upgradable-diy\">a good roundup of the announcements</a> at The Verge. Back in 2021 when Framework debuted with their first laptop, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/04/12/the-framework-laptop\">I expressed pithy skepticism</a> regarding their modular approach. I’m still skeptical, but it’s hard not to root for them and cheer for their success. In principle, Framework’s “everything is a swappable, replaceable module” approach to system design is a fun nerdy throwback to the days when it was expected that you could get inside any computer and replace or upgrade its components yourself. And Framework’s style of modularity is designed with ease-of-use in mind, like snapping Lego blocks together. But <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/news/619586/framework-laptop-16-update-one-key-but-not-done\">as Hollister points out</a>, Framework still hasn’t shipped a promised GPU upgrade component for its now two-year-old Framework 16 laptop.</p>\n\n<p>Also of note is how much Framework is building around chips <a href=\"https://world.hey.com/dhh/amd-in-everything-0ec0cc6e\">from AMD</a>, not Intel. Is there a single category where anyone would say “Intel makes the best chips for this”? In an alternate universe where Apple had never moved the Mac to Apple Silicon, I’m not sure if it would be tenable for Apple to still be exclusively relying on Intel for x86 chips. Intel’s chips just aren’t competitive with AMD’s.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/28/framework-introduces-new-laptops-and-first-desktop\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"427b2c87138096bf43a1b935e00b98ac7e4f19f5f0faebf30cc28cfc53b86888","category":"Tech"}
