And yet, despite having versions available for iPhone, Android, Mac, Windows, and the web, the world’s most popular messaging platform has never had an app for the world’s most popular tablet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That all changed on May 27, 2025, when Meta finally released WhatsApp for iPad. Now you can simply head to the App Store on your iPad, download WhatsApp, and log in. All your past messages will be in sync.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to download and set up WhatsApp on iPad </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the stops to follow to install WhatsApp and get the messaging service set up on your iPad. </p>\n\n\n<div>\n<div></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div><span>1.</span>\n<h3>Download Whatsapp Messenger from the App Store </h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Whatsapp-on-iPad.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"WhatsApp on iPad\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Click Get and wait for WhatsApp to download.</p><br /></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>On your iPad visit the App Store and search for WhatsApp, or use <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/whatsapp-messenger/id310633997\">this link</a> to go directly to WhatsApp Messenger. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Click on Get, authorise and wait for the app to download. </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div><span>2.</span>\n<h3>Login to WhatsApp</h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Log-into-Whatsapp.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"Setting up Whatsapp for iPad via iPhone\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>You’ll need your iPhone or other WhatsApp device to set it up on iPad. </p><br /></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Click Continue to enter the app and start set up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A QR code will display on your iPad. You need to use a device (we assume an iPhone) that’s already linked to your WhatsApp account to scan that QR code. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t just open your camera and scan the QR code. That won’t lead you anywhere. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to open WhatsApp on your iPhone. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In WhatsApp on your iPhone tap on Settings (bottom right). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tap on Linked Devices. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tap Linked device. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now hold the iPhone over the iPad displaying the AR Code and wait for the two devices to log into WhatsApp. </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div><span>3.</span>\n<h3>Use WhatsApp on your iPad</h3>\n\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Whatsapp-in-iPad.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" alt=\"WhatsApp on iPad\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>WhatsApp will download to your iPad. </p><br /></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Eventually all your WhatsApp history will be available on your iPad.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you can send and receive WhatsApp messages on your iPad as well as your iPhone.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>WhatsApp on iPad price</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WhatsApp Messenger for iPad is a free app. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>WhatsApp on iPad features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WhatsApp on iPad supports video chat with up to 32 participants, can use the front and rear camera, and supports Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil. It also supports standard iPad multitasking features like Split View, Slide Over, and Stage Manager.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more details about the May 2025 launch of the WhatsApp for iPad read <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2795428/whatsapp-is-finally-available-for-ipad-and-we-mean-finally.html\" target=\"_blank\">WhatsApp is finally available for iPad (and we mean finally)</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>WhatsApp on iPad size</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The app is 245.8MB. Just remember that any images inside your Whatsapp app will take up <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668286/how-to-free-space-on-iphone.html\">space on your iPad</a>, so if you are short on space you may need to do some housekeeping before you start using it. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Can you set up WhatsApp on iPad without a phone number? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No doubt many will be wondering if now WhatsApp is on iPad it means that kids can use WhatsApp on their iPads to communicate with friends, even if they don’t have a phone number. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, for now the answer is no. To set up WhatsApp on iPad you must have a second device running WhatsApp that is attached to your WhatsApp account, and that WhatsApp account can only work with a dedicated phone number. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are workarounds that can enable you to set up WhatsApp without a phone number, these involve using a landline number (as long as it can receive SMS) or a virtual phone number, but these don’t always work.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Other versions of WhatsApp </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also a <a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/whatsapp-desktop/id1147396723?mt=12\" target=\"_blank\">WhatsApp Desktop</a> version if you want to use WhatsApp on your Mac.
