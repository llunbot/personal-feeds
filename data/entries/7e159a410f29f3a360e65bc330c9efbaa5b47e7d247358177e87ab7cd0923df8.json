[...] Last month, Ford announced that it will\nintegrate NACS, Tesla’s charge connector that it open-sourced last\nyear in an attempt to make it the North American charging\nstandard, into its future electric vehicles.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, CharIn is trying to defend itself and survive here, but\nI don’t think it is necessarily fighting fair.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to the charge connector itself, there’s no doubt\nthat they lost the battle. It is almost comical how bad the design\nof the CCS connector is compared to Tesla’s.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The CCS charger is big fat and ugly, and has reliability problems. Tesla’s NACS charger is smaller, more reliable, and more elegant. The CCS charger is the EV equivalent of pre-USB-C USB ports. NACS is like Lightning. <a href=\"https://electrek.co/2023/06/20/rivian-latest-to-climb-aboard-the-nacs-hype-train-will-offer-tesla-supercharger-access-to-drivers/\">Rivian and GM are now on board with NACS too</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The best way to get a good standard port is to let proprietary designs fight it out in the market, and let the winner be the de facto standard.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/06/21/nacs-chargers\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"7e159a410f29f3a360e65bc330c9efbaa5b47e7d247358177e87ab7cd0923df8","category":"Tech"}
