{"title":"Kevin Roose: ‘Facebook Is Weaker Than We Knew’","link":"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/04/technology/facebook-files.html","date":1633359145000,"content":"\n<p>Kevin Roose’s take on the inside look at Facebook revealed by The Wall Street Journal’s “Facebook Files” series, which in turn is based on Frances Haugen’s whistleblower leaks:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It’s far too early to declare Facebook dead. The company’s stock\nprice has risen nearly 30 percent in the past year, lifted by\nstrong advertising revenue and a spike in use of some products\nduring the pandemic. Facebook is still growing in countries\noutside the United States, and could succeed there even if it\nstumbles domestically. And the company has invested heavily in\nnewer initiatives, like augmented and virtual reality products,\nthat could turn the tide if they’re successful.</p>\n\n<p>But Facebook’s research tells a clear story, and it’s not a happy\none. Its younger users are flocking to Snapchat and TikTok, and\nits older users are posting anti-vaccine memes and arguing about\npolitics. Some Facebook products are actively shrinking, while\nothers are merely making their users angry or self-conscious.</p>\n\n<p>Facebook’s declining relevance with young people shouldn’t\nnecessarily make its critics optimistic. History teaches us that\nsocial networks rarely age gracefully, and that tech companies can\ndo a lot of damage on the way down.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/10/04/roose-facebook-weakness\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b796bcb5c6a714bdcc6b08055324ef42d9665300a68948372b1fc0f7f149c5f3","category":"Tech"}
