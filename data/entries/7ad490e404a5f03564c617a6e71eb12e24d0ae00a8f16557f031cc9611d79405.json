{"title":"Amazon Bedrock Marketplace: Access over 100 foundation models in one place","link":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-bedrock-marketplace-access-over-100-foundation-models-in-one-place/","date":1733332596000,"content":"<p>Today, we’re introducing <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/marketplace/\">Amazon Bedrock Marketplace</a>, a new capability that gives you access to over 100 popular, emerging, and specialized <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/foundation-models/\">foundation models (FMs)</a> through <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\">Amazon Bedrock</a>. With this launch, you can now discover, test, and deploy new models from enterprise providers such as IBM and Nvidia, specialized models such as Upstages’ Solar Pro for Korean language processing, and Evolutionary Scale’s ESM3 for protein research, alongside Amazon Bedrock general-purpose FMs from providers such as <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/claude/\">Anthropic</a> and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/llama/\">Meta</a>.</p> \n<p>Models deployed with Amazon Bedrock Marketplace can be accessed through the same standard APIs as the serverless models and, for models which are compatible with Converse API, be used with tools such as <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agents/\">Amazon Bedrock Agents</a> and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/knowledge-bases/\">Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases</a>.</p> \n<p>As <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/ai/generative-ai/\">generative AI</a> continues to reshape how organizations work, the need for specialized models optimized for specific domains, languages, or tasks is growing. However, finding and evaluating these models can be challenging and costly. You need to discover them across different services, build abstractions to use them in your applications, and create complex security and governance layers. Amazon Bedrock Marketplace addresses these challenges by providing a single interface to access both specialized and general-purpose FMs.</p> \n<p><span><strong>Using Amazon Bedrock Marketplace<br /> </strong></span>To get started, in the Amazon Bedrock console, I choose <strong>Model catalog</strong> in the <strong>Foundation models</strong> section of the navigation pane. Here, I can search for models that help me with a specific use case or language. The results of the search include both serverless models and models available in Amazon Bedrock Marketplace. I can filter results by provider, modality (such as text, image, or audio), or task (such as classification or text summarization).</p> \n<p>In the catalog, there are models from organizations like <a href=\"https://www.arcee.ai/\">Arcee AI</a>, which builds context-adapted small language models (SLMs), and <a href=\"https://www.widn.ai/en/\">Widn.AI</a>, which provides multilingual models.</p> \n<p>For example, I am interested in the <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/granite\">IBM Granite</a> models and search for models from <strong>IBM Data and AI</strong>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/28/bedrock-marketplace-search-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/28/bedrock-marketplace-search-1.png\" alt=\"Console screenshot.\" width=\"3212\" height=\"1464\" /></a></p> \n<p>I select <strong>Granite 3.0 2B Instruct</strong>, a language model designed for enterprise applications. Choosing the model opens the model detail page where I can see more information from the model provider such as highlights about the model, pricing, and usage including sample API calls.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/28/bedrock-marketplace-model-details-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/28/bedrock-marketplace-model-details-1.png\" alt=\"Console screenshot.\" width=\"2253\" height=\"1609\" /></a></p> \n<p>This specific model requires a subscription, and I choose <strong>View subscription options</strong>.</p> \n<p>From the subscription dialog, I review pricing and legal notes. In <strong>Pricing details</strong>, I see the software price set by the provider. For this model, there are no additional costs on top of the deployed infrastructure. The <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/\">Amazon SageMaker</a> infrastructure cost is charged separately and can be seen in <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/pricing/\">Amazon SageMaker pricing</a>.</p> \n<p>To proceed with this model, I choose <strong>Subscribe</strong>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/28/bedrock-marketplace-subscribe-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/28/bedrock-marketplace-subscribe-1.png\" alt=\"Console screenshot.\" width=\"2901\" height=\"1686\" /></a></p> \n<p>After the subscription has been completed, which usually takes a few minutes, I can deploy the model.

Amazon Bedrock Marketplace automatically creates a service role to access <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/s3/\">Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)</a> buckets where the model weights are stored, but I can choose to use an existing role.</p> \n<p>I keep the default values and complete the deployment.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/28/bedrock-marketplace-deploy-advanced.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/28/bedrock-marketplace-deploy-advanced.png\" alt=\"Console screenshot.\" width=\"2983\" height=\"1717\" /></a></p> \n<p>After a few minutes, the deployment is <strong>In Service</strong> and can be reviewed in the <strong>Marketplace deployments</strong> page from the navigation pane.</p> \n<p>There, I can choose an endpoint to view details and edit the configuration such as the number of instances. To test the deployment, I choose <strong>Open in playground</strong> and ask for some poetry.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/28/bedrock-marketplace-playground-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/28/bedrock-marketplace-playground-1.png\" alt=\"Console screenshot.\" width=\"2492\" height=\"1586\" /></a></p> \n<p>I can also select the model from the <strong>Chat/text</strong> page of the <strong>Playground</strong> using the new <strong>Marketplace</strong> category where the deployed endpoints are listed.</p> \n<p>In a similar way, I can use the model with other tools such as <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/agents/\">Amazon Bedrock Agents</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/knowledge-bases/\">Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/prompt-management/\">Amazon Bedrock Prompt Management</a>, <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/guardrails/\">Amazon Bedrock Guardrails</a>, and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/evaluation.html\">model evaluations</a>, by choosing <strong>Select Model</strong> and selecting the <strong>Marketplace</strong> model endpoint.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/28/bedrock-marketplace-select-model-1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/da4b9237bacccdf19c0760cab7aec4a8359010b0/2024/11/28/bedrock-marketplace-select-model-1.png\" alt=\"Console screenshot.\" width=\"2065\" height=\"1448\" /></a></p> \n<p>The model I used here is text-to-text, but I can use Amazon Bedrock Marketplace to deploy models with different modalities.
