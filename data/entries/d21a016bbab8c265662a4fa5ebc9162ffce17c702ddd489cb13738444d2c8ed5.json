Chinese law requires government approval before companies can release generative AI services to the public.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBoth ByteDance and Tencent have developed their own AI models - Doubao and Hunyuan respectively - which could potentially be integrated into Chinese iPhones if the talks prove successful. However, negotiations are said to be still in early stages, according to sources cited by <em><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/apple-talks-with-tencent-bytedance-roll-out-ai-features-china-sources-say-2024-12-19/\">Reuters</a></em>.

The company briefly dropped out of China's top five smartphone vendors in the second quarter of 2023 before recovering in the third quarter, though its sales still declined 0.3% year-over-year.\r<br />\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ios-18-2-iphone-chatgpt-integration/\">iOS 18.2: Everything You Can Do With ChatGPT Integration</a></li></ul>\r<br />\nMeanwhile, Huawei has gained momentum in the Chinese market, with sales surging 42% in the third quarter.
