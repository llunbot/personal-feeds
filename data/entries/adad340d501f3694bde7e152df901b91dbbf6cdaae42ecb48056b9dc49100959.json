The intent, Microsoft says, is to give players \"clarity into how their behavior impacts their experience.\" But the system's time-based \"eight strikes and you're out\" system and the relative severity of certain sample infractions are already drawing perplexed comments from some corners.</p>\n<p>As outlined in <a href=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/08/15/xbox-enforcement-strike-system/\">a Tuesday post on Xbox Wire</a>, the new strike enforcement program will impose more stringent penalties for successive infractions, a system Microsoft says is modeled after \"demerit strikes used in driver’s license systems in many countries.\" Successive strikes will lead to suspensions from Xbox Live for one day to a maximum of 365 days, according to the following scale:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1 strike: 1-day suspension</li>\n<li>2 strikes: 1-day suspension</li>\n<li>3 strikes: 3-day suspension</li>\n<li>4 strikes: 7-day suspension</li>\n<li>5 strikes: 14-day suspension</li>\n<li>6 strikes: 21-day suspension</li>\n<li>7 strikes: 60-day suspension</li>\n<li>8 strikes: 365-day suspension</li>\n</ul>\n<div><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/xboxsample.jpeg\"><img alt=\"A sample &quot;User Journey&quot; outlining how the new strike-based enforcement system can shake out.\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/xboxsample-640x360.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/xboxsample-1280x720.jpeg 2x\" /></a><p><a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/xboxsample.jpeg\">A sample \"User Journey\" outlining how the new strike-based enforcement system can shake out.</a> (credit: <a href=\"https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2023/08/15/xbox-enforcement-strike-system/\">Microsoft</a>)</p></div>\n<p>Not all potential infractions are treated equally under this rubric, though; Microsoft notes that the number of strikes per enforcement action can \"range in severity based on inappropriate activity\" and are \"based on the severity of [the user's] actions.\" While Microsoft hasn't published a complete list of how many strikes are associated with each different type of infraction, a sample \"User Journey\" graphic in the blog post includes a list of the following \"examples of strikes added for each type of action.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1961158#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1961158&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"adad340d501f3694bde7e152df901b91dbbf6cdaae42ecb48056b9dc49100959","category":"Tech"}
