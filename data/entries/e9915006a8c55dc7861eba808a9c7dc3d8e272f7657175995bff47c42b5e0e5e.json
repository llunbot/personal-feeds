The good news is that the company has brought back the foldable design that was absent from its predecessor, the WH-1000XM5. The bad news is that it's stuck with the same naming convention, which sounds less like headphones and more like a dot-matrix printer from the 70s.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/05/sony-wh-1000xm6-headphones.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" />\r<br />\nThe WH-1000XM6 headphones now happily fold up into a redesigned carrying case with a magnetic closure instead of a zipper, making it more compact and travel-friendly than the XM5's. Otherwise, the overall aesthetics remain largely unchanged, but Sony claims the new model delivers significantly improved noise cancellation, a better Ambient Sound (transparency) mode, and enhanced audio quality.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPowering the enhanced noise cancellation is Sony's new HD Noise Cancelling Processor QN3, which works in conjunction with an expanded array of 12 microphones – 1.5 times more than the previous model. The company says this processor is seven times faster than its predecessor, allowing for more precise real-time noise adaptation.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSony has also introduced several new software features, including Scene-based Listening, which automatically adjusts settings based on your activity and environment. The headphones also support LE Audio with Auracast for broadcast listening capabilities.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nBattery life remains unchanged from the WH-1000XM5 at 30 hours, although Sony notes that a quick three-minute charge provides up to three hours of listening time. You can also charge this model and listen to your music at the same time. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nSony says it has collaborated with recording engineers from prestigious studios including Sterling Sound, Battery Studios, and Coast Mastering to fine-tune the improved sound profile.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt sounds promising. The only real downer seems to be the fact that Sony has priced these cans at $449.99 – $50 more than the previous model. Whether the improvements justify the price jump is the main question. These are unashamedly plastic headphones, after all. <em>MacRumors</em> should have a hands-on review of Sony's latest flagship headphones soon. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe WH-1000XM5's come in Black, Platinum Silver, and Midnight Blue, and are available to buy from the <a href=\"https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-462641-15810919?url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.sony.com%2Faudio%2Fheadphones%2Fheadband%2Fp%2Fwh1000xm6-b\">Sony website</a> and all the major electronics retailers.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/sony/\">Sony</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/16/sony-wh-1000xm6-headphones/\">Sony Announces WH-1000XM6 Noise-Canceling Headphones With Foldable Design</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/sony-announces-wh-1000xm6-noise-canceling-headphones-with-foldable-design.2457178/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e9915006a8c55dc7861eba808a9c7dc3d8e272f7657175995bff47c42b5e0e5e","category":"Apple"}
