However, it is unclear if that means the Dynamic Island feature would be discontinued.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nDisplay industry analyst Ross Young <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/16/iphone-under-screen-face-id-rumors/\">also previously claimed</a> that iPhone 18 Pro models would feature under-screen Face ID, so this rumor is now backed by multiple sources. Apple is expected to introduce the devices in September 2026.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/face-id/\">Face ID</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone-18/\">iPhone 18</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/theinformation-com/\">The Information</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/03/iphone-18-pro-under-screen-face-id-rumor/\">iPhone 18 Pro Models Rumored to Feature Under-Screen Face ID With Top-Left Camera Hole</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/iphone-18-pro-models-rumored-to-feature-under-screen-face-id-with-top-left-camera-hole.2456439/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"0857b181855686c43b0be41600242f3bd981b0070f5823176dbe366486178dc7","category":"Apple"}
