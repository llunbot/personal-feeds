If you, like me, haven't been paying attention to the diamond industry, it turns out that the availability of these machines reflects an ongoing trend toward democratizing diamond productionâ€”a process that began decades ago and continues to evolve.</p>\n\n<p>The history of lab-grown diamonds dates back at least half a century. According to Harvard graduate student Javid Lakha, writing in a <a href=\"https://worksinprogress.co/issue/lab-grown-diamonds/\">comprehensive piece</a> on lab-grown diamonds published in <em>Works in Progress</em> last month, the first successful synthesis of diamonds in a laboratory setting occurred in the 1950s. Lakha recounts how <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracy_Hall\">Howard Tracy Hall</a>, a chemist at General Electric, created the first lab-grown diamonds using a high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT) process that mimicked the conditions under which diamonds form in nature.</p>\n<p>Since then, diamond-making technology has advanced significantly. Today, there are two primary methods for creating lab-grown diamonds: the HPHT process and chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Both types of machines are now <a href=\"https://www.alibaba.com/showroom/synthetic-diamond-making-machine.html\">listed on Alibaba</a>, with prices starting at around <a href=\"https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/HPHT-Cubic-Press-Synthetic-Diamond-Making_1600318712802.html\">$200,000</a>, as <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41492001\">pointed out</a> by engineer John Nagle (who goes by \"<a href=\"https://www.animats.com/classic/index.html\">Animats</a>\" on Hacker News). A CVD machine we found is more pricey, at <a href=\"https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/VOAINO-WD-2204-915MHz-2450MHz-synthetic_1601024732626.html\">around $450,000</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048698#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2048698&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"05697d2527256aaacfae95a279643b80129b215a20e912c7c4fa405e7b664d9d","category":"Tech"}
