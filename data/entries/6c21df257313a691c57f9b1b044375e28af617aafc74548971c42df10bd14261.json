Today, any website that wants to be findable has to play by Google's rules, and after years of search dominance, the company has <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/08/google-loses-dojs-big-monopoly-trial-over-search-business/\">lost a major antitrust case</a> that could reshape both it and the web.</p>\n<p>The closing arguments in the case <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/google-and-doj-tussle-over-how-ai-will-remake-the-web-in-antitrust-closing-arguments/\">just wrapped up last week</a>, and Google could be facing serious consequences when the ruling comes down in August. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/chrome-on-the-chopping-block-as-googles-search-antitrust-trial-moves-forward/\">Losing Chrome</a> would certainly change things for Google, but the Department of Justice is pursuing other remedies that could have even more lasting impacts. During his testimony, Google CEO Sundar Pichai seemed genuinely alarmed at the prospect of being forced to license Google's search index and algorithm, the so-called data remedies in the case. He claimed this would be <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/sundar-pichai-says-doj-demands-are-a-de-facto-spin-off-of-google-search/\">no better than a spinoff of Google Search</a>. The company's statements have sometimes derisively referred to this process as \"white labeling\" Google Search.</p>\n<p>But does a white label Google Search sound so bad? Google has built an unrivaled index of the web, but the way it shows results has become increasingly frustrating. A handful of smaller players in search have tried to offer alternatives to Google's search tools. They all have different approaches to retrieving information for you, but they agree that spinning off Google Search could change the web again. Whether or not those changes are positive depends on who you ask.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/06/googles-nightmare-how-a-search-spin-off-could-remake-the-web/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/google/2025/06/googles-nightmare-how-a-search-spin-off-could-remake-the-web/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ryan Whitwam","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6c21df257313a691c57f9b1b044375e28af617aafc74548971c42df10bd14261","category":"Tech"}
