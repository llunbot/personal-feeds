From June 10 to July 29, test positivity rose from 4.1 percent to 8.9 percent. For reference, the most recent winter wave had a peak test positivity of 10.6 percent on December 31, 2022.</p>\n<p>On the brighter side, however, weekly COVID-19 hospital admissions and deaths continue to be at their lowest points since the start of the pandemic. For now, deaths do not appear to be rising, though there are lags in data reporting. Weekly new hospital admissions are ticking up only slightlyâ€”with admissions rising to about 8,000 in the week of July 22, up from around 6,300 the week of June 24.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1959483#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1959483&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"c206e7130b034072fb87bb9593bb8596d5543ac5cea09eb7edb96d5ef4e4f7ec","category":"Tech"}
