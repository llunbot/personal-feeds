Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) has tested positive for a COVID-19 breakthrough infection after defying the House of Representatives' mask mandate and filing a lawsuit against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) over a resulting $500 fine for going maskless.</p>\n<p>On Thursday, Norman <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RepRalphNorman/status/1423320887265267713\">tweeted</a>, \"After experiencing minor symptoms this morning, I sought a COVID-19 test and was just informed the test results were positive. Thankfully, I have been fully vaccinated and my symptoms remain mild.\" He added that he will work virtually while he is in \"quarantine\" for 10 days.
