That's the price of admission if you want to compete the brutal small launch industry. He is the co-founder, chairman and CEO of Astra, founded in 2016 with a goal of essentially commoditizing small satellite launch services, or at least getting a lot closer to that than anyone else.</p>\n<p>But there are a lot pressure points for Astra in 2023. The company abandoned its first orbital rocket design, called Rocket 3, last year after a string of failures. With higher interest rates, raising money in 2023 isn't as easy as it was a few years ago. And calling <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2023/03/the-small-launch-industry-is-brutal-yes-even-more-than-you-thought/2/\">Astra's competition</a> stiff is definitely an understatement.</p>\n<p>Kemp argues that Astra finds itself in a different position than, say, Virgin Orbit, a small satellite launch company that went bankrupt earlier this year. Astra has diversified, and can lean on a separate source of revenue in a promising business building electric thrusters for small satellites. This business, which Astra calls spacecraft engines, was made possible by the acquisition of a company called Apollo Fusion in 2021.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1962049#p3\">Read 28 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1962049&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6a221271b9bf3e211ccbb89ebb73998f89db50d8411b0e7aaea28db912549a9f","category":"Tech"}
