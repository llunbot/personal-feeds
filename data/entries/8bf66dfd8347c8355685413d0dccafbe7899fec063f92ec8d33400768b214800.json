Whether it be cobbles, gravel, murs or bergs, Pogačar doesn’t shy away from taking on any challenge across the cycling calendar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With fingers in many pies, the kid from Komenda has taken to the start line of 14 Monuments since his <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-classics-monuments-cobbles\" target=\"_blank\">Classics</a> debut in 2019. In that time, the baby-faced Pogačar has slotted onto the podium on eight occasions, including taking six wins, proving he is more than just a Grand Tour big cheese.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More remarkable is his consistency. Since his watershed Tour de France win in 2020, <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/tadej-pogacar-greatest-of-all-time\" target=\"_blank\">Tadej Pogačar</a> has finished inside the top 5 at each Monument he has tackled, apart from the cursed Liège-Bastogne-Liège in 2023, which saw him crash out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This ranking of his performances is not based on the arbitrary finishing position. It will factor in panache, pizzazz and pathos into its ranking position. Prepare for Pogi’s ego to be inflated as we dissect each of his 14 Monument performances.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/cycling-classics-boring-opinion\">Opinion: It’s OK to be bored of the Classics</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/mathieu-van-der-poel-monument-ranked\">Every Mathieu van der Poel Monument performance ranked</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/tadej-pogacar-greatest-of-all-time\">Opinion: Tadej Pogačar is the Greatest Of All Time</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/giro-ditalia-watch-live-stages-route-riders-teams-start-list\">Giro d’Italia 2024: Stage-by-stage preview and how to watch</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<h2>The lower rankings</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Tadej-Pogaca-wins-Lombardia-via-UCI-Cropped-970x647.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Tadej-Pogaca-wins-Lombardia-via-UCI-Cropped-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Tadej-Pogaca-wins-Lombardia-via-UCI-Cropped-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Tadej-Pogaca-wins-Lombardia-via-UCI-Cropped-768x512.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Tadej-Pogaca-wins-Lombardia-via-UCI-Cropped-750x500.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Tadej-Pogaca-wins-Lombardia-via-UCI-Cropped-1140x760.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Tadej-Pogaca-wins-Lombardia-via-UCI-Cropped-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Tadej-Pogaca-wins-Lombardia-via-UCI-Cropped-620x413.jpg 620w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Tadej-Pogaca-wins-Lombardia-via-UCI-Cropped-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/10/Tadej-Pogaca-wins-Lombardia-via-UCI-Cropped.jpg 1512w\" /><figcaption>UCI</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>14.

An effortless win at Strade Bianche followed by a walk-over in Tirenno-Adriatico made the Slovenian the favourite for glory. That said, this wasn’t without its question marks. As a Grand Tour star, the ways of winning San Remo are few and far between. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless, Pogačar decided that the best form of defence was to attack. This eventually backfired. However, it did make for much tension up the Cipressa and the Poggio as he rolled the dice with little to lose. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still finishing in fifth place, he put in a good day’s work, good enough to beat some mean sprinters in the group. Overall, it’s not bad, but not out of this world either. A rare B-Grade race.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ll never forgive 2022 for birthing the annual ‘will Pogačar attack on the Cipressa’ discussion.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>9.

After a fatiguing season for Pogačar that saw him claim a Grand Tour title, Monument wins and an Olympic medal, a Lombardia debut was the epilogue for his Merckxian year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An early attack on the day yielded an early lead for the reigning Tour de France champion. A concerted effort by Fausto Masnada, the eel of Bergamo, made Pogačar’s challenge for the title a little trickier. In a two-up sprint to the line against QuickStep’s Masnada, Pogačar took the title with few frills expended.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was the McDonald’s Quarter Pounder of Monument wins. It’s necessary sustenance, but there are better things on the menu. Do better next time Tadej. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>8.

Pogačar entered the 2023 MSR in similar fashion to the year prior. With lessons learnt from the year before, we all expected a step up from Pogačar – if there were even any more steps to be made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More attacks on the Poggio came, but this time he had more company. Distilled down into an all-star group including Wout van Aert, Mathieu van der Poel and Olympic track champion Pippo Ganna, Pogi had a shout at taking the race win.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Van der Poel went up the road, Pogačar’s chances became fleeting. Holding on for fourth place on the day, this was a commendable step in the right direction for Pogačar.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>7.

Just six months after the previous edition, Liège 2021 was fuelled with talks about Alaphilippe redemption and a renewed Pog vs Rog battle. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Proceedings were a little punctured in reality. Michael Woods rolled the dice, and the favourites duly stepped up. With Alaphilippe fixed onto his back wheel, Pogi made it into the front group with ease. Able to bet on his fast kick at the end, he outfoxed some big names of old and new, even pipping the World Champion Alaphilippe to the line – who at least this time knew he finished second.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A win’s a win, but in terms of Pogačar performances, this is on the modest end of the spectrum. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>6.

A mightily strong UAE Team Emirates line-up on paper and a more mature Pogačar made for a convincing challenge for the Classicissima crown.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In reality, the 2024 edition proved testing. With depleted team support on the road, and only an inexperienced Isaac del Torro to assist, the odds were stacked against him. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his best San Remo attack to date, Pogačar finally got some distance on the peloton. This didn’t last long, though, as World Champion Van der Poel closed the gap coming onto the descent into town. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After firing all those bullets up the climb, Pogačar had enough left in the tank to reach the final podium in a sprint (ahead of Mads Pedersen no less). In every scenario, Pogačar was visible. The win in San Remo can’t be far off now, can it?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5.

This wasn’t a worry for Pogačar, he and his team were bullish throughout the day, controlling affairs with a water-tight seal. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Much like his 2021 win, 2022 saw Pogi have company in the final kilometres. In a renaissance ride, Enric Mas revitalised his post-Vuelta legs to guide him into a lucrative position in the wheel of reigning champion Pogačar. No stinging attack could drop the Catalan, and Pogačar kept his powder dry for the final dash to the line in Como.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the end, the result was inevitable. Spare a thought for poor Mas though. Maybe one day he’ll take that big race win.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4.

Pogačar was far more than a bit-part player, acting as protagonist in an on-screen pairing with Van der Poel up front. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlucky not to drop his rival on the Paterberg, Pogačar had tested the Dutchman up the cobbled climbs more than anyone else over the previous seasons. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The excitement fizzed over, Pogačar lost his cool and slipped out of contention for the win once the duo of Valentin Madouas and Dylan van Baarle crashed the party.

Banishing debates about poor descending, he hung on through the downhill to stay solo up in front with a lead of almost a minute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A brief glimpse of cramp brought forward some doubt, but it was all in vain as he sailed away to a third Lombardy win in a row, and the first one in the Slovenian champion’s jersey in his most emphatic win at Lombardy to date.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In McDonald’s terms, this is the 20 Chicken Nuggets Sharebox of Monument wins.

Simply, he said he was going to attack on Côte de La Redoute and he did just that. Without flinching, he was away on the hardest test in the race.
