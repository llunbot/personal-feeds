Apple decided not to release an iPhone 14 mini last year, but it had kept the iPhone 13 mini available as a lower-cost option.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe smallest iPhone that Apple sells brand new is now the iPhone SE with a 4.7-inch display, but it has a very outdated design with a Home button and thicker bezels, and the next iPhone SE is rumored to have a larger 6.1-inch display.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>13-Inch MacBook Pro</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/07/Touch-Bar-13-Inch-MacBook-Pro.jpg\" width=\"1364\" height=\"769\" />\r<br />\nApple finally <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/apple-discontinues-13-inch-macbook-pro/\">discontinued the 13-inch MacBook Pro</a> last week following its \"Scary Fast\" event. The laptop had a seven-year-old design, and it was the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/31/touch-bar-discontinued/\">final Mac equipped with a Touch Bar</a> instead of physical function keys.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe 13-inch MacBook Pro was effectively replaced with the new entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro with the standard M3 chip, although the former started at $1,299 and the latter starts at $1,599. The 14-inch model does offer several upgrades over the 13-inch model, such as the M3 chip, a 120Hz ProMotion display, a 1080p camera, and more ports.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>MagSafe Battery Pack</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/07/magsafe-battery-pack-feature2.jpg\" width=\"2490\" height=\"1401\" />\r<br />\nApple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-discontinues-magsafe-battery-pack-and-duo/\">discontinued the MagSafe Battery Pack</a> in September after introducing the iPhone 15 series. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nReleased in 2021, the ‌MagSafe Battery Pack‌ was priced at $99 and attaches magnetically to the back of the iPhone 12 and newer, providing hours of additional battery life. While all iPhone 15 models are now equipped with a USB-C port, the battery pack has a Lightning charging port, so it effectively became outdated.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>MagSafe Duo Charger</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2020/11/magsafe-duo-perspective-feature.jpg\" width=\"1332\" height=\"750\" />\r<br />\nApple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-discontinues-magsafe-battery-pack-and-duo/\">discontinued the MagSafe Duo Charger</a> in September after introducing the iPhone 15 series.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nReleased in 2020, the MagSafe Duo Charger was a $129 foldable charging mat with both a MagSafe charger for iPhones and an Apple Watch magnetic charging puck. Like the MagSafe Battery Pack, it had a Lightning charging port.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h2>Leather Accessories</h2>\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/02/apple-leather-wallet-magsafe.jpg\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nApple stopped selling leather accessories in September, including leather versions of iPhone cases, the MagSafe Wallet, Apple Watch bands, and more, as part of the company's environmental responsibility efforts. Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/12/apple-announces-finewoven/\">introduced a new FineWoven fabric material for accessories</a> that it says has a \"significantly lower\" carbon footprint than leather, but customers have complained about the new iPhone cases <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/25/finewoven-iphone-case-continued-criticism/\">being prone to scratches and stains</a>. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<h3>Honorable Mentions</h3>\r<br />\nApple also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/08/31/apple-discontinues-itunes-movie-trailers-app/\">discontinued its iTunes Movie Trailers app</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/01/apple-music-voice-plan-no-longer-available/\">Apple Music Voice Plan</a> this year.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/08/apple-discontinued-these-5-products-in-2023/\">Apple Discontinued These 5 Products in 2023</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-discontinued-these-5-products-in-2023.2410313/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"e0d9997bce5cc3ba9566234a9eb203d9e9340abd1ba641301a576a51d4e75a7e","category":"Apple"}
