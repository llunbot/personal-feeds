Steve Garro specializes in off-road oriented bikes like this Cruiser he made for <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/dirty_biker/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Reichel</a>, who works for Why Cycles and Revel Bikes. <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/2021/05/inside-out-at-why-cycles-and-revel-bikes-a-reel-good-time-in-carbondale-colorado/\" target=\"_blank\">When I was in Carbondale</a>, Colorado last month, I managed to sneak away with this bike for proper documentation so check out more below.<span></span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/Chris-Coconino-Cycles-Singlespeed-27.5-Cruiser-26.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Singlespeeds are so simple and to be honest, they’re a breeze to shoot due to this simplicity. Chris kept this build straight forward with a mix of <a href=\"https://www.paulcomp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Component Engineering</a>, <a href=\"https://endlessbikes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Endless Bike Co</a>, <a href=\"http://odditycycles.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Oddity Bars</a>, and <a href=\"https://industrynine.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Industry Nine wheels</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/Chris-Coconino-Cycles-Singlespeed-27.5-Cruiser-2.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/Chris-Coconino-Cycles-Singlespeed-27.5-Cruiser-3.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Where the beauty lies with this bike are in the frame details. Coconino Cycles has an exceptional headbadge, a sleeved, unicrown fork, and seat stays.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/Chris-Coconino-Cycles-Singlespeed-27.5-Cruiser-28.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Since it’s a Cruiser, Chris requested that Steve make it coaster brake friendly. All Chris needs is a nice coaster wheelset – perhaps one of the wheelsets <a href=\"http://www.monebikes.com/store/hot-rod-coaster-brake-wheel\" target=\"_blank\">Moné</a> offers? – to really make it a proper cruiser.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/Chris-Coconino-Cycles-Singlespeed-27.5-Cruiser-11.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/Chris-Coconino-Cycles-Singlespeed-27.5-Cruiser-8.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>This fillet brazed bike is coated in a durable powdercoat that only looks better covered in dust.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/Chris-Coconino-Cycles-Singlespeed-27.5-Cruiser-1.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Thanks for letting me point a lens at this beauty, Chris, and Steve, if you’re reading this, I want one!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/06/Chris-Coconino-Cycles-Singlespeed-27.5-Cruiser-27.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Check out more of Steve’s work at <a href=\"https://coconinocycles.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Coconino’s blog</a>!</p>","author":"prolly","siteTitle":"The Radavist","siteHash":"96eb481d8084f04a4602bac57874ba717baf56b758f45547b5caf2312da766ef","entryHash":"e6e79915bd0b792b248a1af843c089d8a7ab6ec047bed63d5211b52b3048b22c","category":"Cycling"}
