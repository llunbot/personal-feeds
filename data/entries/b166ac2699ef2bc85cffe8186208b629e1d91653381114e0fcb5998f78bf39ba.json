Snowflakes, snowfall, and snowmen symbolize cocaine. Love hearts, lightning bolts, and pill capsules mean MDMA, or molly. Brown hearts and dragons represent heroin. Grapes and baby bottles are the calling cards for codeine-containing cough syrup, or lean. The humble maple leaf, meanwhile, is the universal symbol for all drugs.</p>\n<p>The proliferation of open drug dealing on Instagram, Snapchat, and X—as well as on encrypted messaging platforms Telegram and WhatsApp—has transformed the fabric of illegal substance procurement, gradually making it more convenient, and arguably safer, for consumers, who can receive packages in the mail without meeting people on street corners or going through the rigmarole of the dark web.

In the US in 2018 and Spain in 2019, a tenth of young people who used drugs appear to have connected with dealers through the internet, with the large majority doing so through social media, according to <a href=\"https://journals.copmadrid.org/ejpalc/art/ejpalc2021a5\">one small study</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/who-needs-the-dark-web-drug-sales-flourish-on-social-media/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/who-needs-the-dark-web-drug-sales-flourish-on-social-media/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Mattha Busby, wired.com","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b166ac2699ef2bc85cffe8186208b629e1d91653381114e0fcb5998f78bf39ba","category":"Tech"}
