The Entertainment Software Association (ESA) and show promoter ReedPop announced late Thursday that the planned June event—which was <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/09/e3-confirms-2023-schedule-split-between-industry-public-but-questions-remain/\">set to be</a> the first in-person E3 since 2019—\"did not garner the sustained interest necessary” from major publishers and potential attendees to justify a massive convention.</p>\n<p>At this point, the cancellation of the 2023 show wasn't a huge surprise. All three major console makers had <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-nintendo-sony-skipping-e3-2023\">already confirmed</a> that they wouldn't be attending, and major publishers <a href=\"https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-has-pulled-out-of-e3-2023/\">Ubisoft</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ign.com/articles/rumors-swirl-around-e3s-future-as-sega-even-more-publishers-back-out\">Sega</a> publicly abandoned the show more recently. In <a href=\"https://www.gamesindustry.biz/e3-2023-is-cancelled-esa-tells-us-why\">an interview with GamesIndustry.biz</a>, ESA president and CEO Stanley Pierre-Louis cited economic headwinds, digital marketing opportunities, and COVID-related game development timeline changes as reasons the companies backed out.</p>\n<p>But the decades-long decline of E3 was also apparent well before this year's problems—and even well before COVID <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/03/e3-2020-has-been-canceled/\">forced the cancellation of the 2020 show</a> (and every show in subsequent years). Part of me will miss the glitz and spectacle of the 15 E3s I've attended since 2004. But a larger part recognizes that E3 is a show that was built for a very different game industry and which has utterly failed to change with the times.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1928248#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1928248&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"2b66855e06a3d877336899ee6080830cdf97fd17250d583cabfb2daa8e682b33","category":"Tech"}
