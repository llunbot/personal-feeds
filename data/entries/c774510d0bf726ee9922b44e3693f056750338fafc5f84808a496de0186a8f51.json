{"title":"Apple One: What you need to know about Apple’s services bundle","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/234604/apple-one-faq.html","date":1682753160000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has several subscription services available, and now you can save some cash by signing up for <a href=\"https://apple.co/35PicpB\">Apple One</a>, a pricing plan that bundles Apple’s services (including Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade and more) together at a discounted price. In effect, it replaces expensive a la carte pricing with cheaper pricing bundles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, is it worth signing up for this scheme or would your money be better spent on the individual services instead? We take a look at whether or not you should get Apple One – and what you can actually save if you do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what you need to know about Apple One.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What services are included in Apple One?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The following Apple’s services are available for bundled pricing: Apple Arcade, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple News+, Apple TV+, and iCloud. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If Apple introduces new services, they’ll probably adjust the Apple One plans accordingly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please note: AppleCare, Apple’s warranty and support program, is not part of Apple One.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How much does Apple One cost? And how much can I save?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has three Apple One plans. Each plan offers a different set of services. Here are the plans.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Individual</strong><span> ($16.95/£16.95 per month): includes Apple Arcade, Apple Music, Apple TV+, and 50GB of iCloud storage for one user. This plan offers a $6/£6 savings per month over a la carte pricing.</span> </li><li><strong>Family</strong><span> ($22.95/£22.95 per month): includes Apple Arcade, Apple Music, Apple TV+, and 200GB of iCloud storage. Can be shared with up to six family members (yourself and five others). This plan offers an $8/£8 monthly savings over a la carte.</span> </li><li><strong>Premier</strong><span> ($32.95/£32.95 per month): includes Apple Arcade, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple News+, Apple TV+, and 2TB of iCloud storage. Can be shared with up to six family members (yourself and five others). You’ll save $25/£25 per month with this plan.</span> </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>And to save even more, if you have the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/232603/apple-card-faq-rewards-payments-interest-rates.html\">Apple Card</a>, you get 3 percent cash back on your monthly payment if you use the card to pay your bill (U.S. only).  Go to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://one.apple.com&amp;xcust=1-1-234604-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">one.apple.com</a> to sign up.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What if I want more iCloud storage?</h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><a href=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/09/icloud-apple-one-100857535-orig.jpg\"><img src=\"https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2020/09/icloud-apple-one-100857535-medium.jpg?auto=webp&amp;quality=85,70\" alt=\"icloud apple one\" loading=\"lazy\" /></a><figcaption><p>You can add more iCloud storage by signing up for a storage upgrade.</p></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>You can upgrade your iCloud storage, but you’ll pay an additional monthly fee. The Apple One website says the additional storage is a “supplement” to the storage included in the plan. For example, if you want to get the 2TB upgrade ($9.99/£6.99), for the Apple One Family plan ($22.95/£22.95), you’ll end up with 2.2TB and pay $31.94/£29.94 per month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you sign up for iCloud’s 2TB plan, you can actually end up with 4TB of total iCloud storage if you also sign up for the Apple One Premier plan, which includes 2TB of storage. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672409/how-much-does-icloud-cost.html\">Learn more about iCloud storage plans and prices</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Can family members get access to Apple One services?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. Sign up for the Family or Premier plans, and up to six family members (yourself plus five others) can use the services. (Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade come with Family Sharing built-in.)</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Is there an Apple One trial and how does it work?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple One includes a 30-day free trial for any services that you do not already have. When the trial expires, the plan automatically renews the service as part of your plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you visit  <a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?subid1=1-1-234604-1-0-0&amp;u=https://www.apple.com/apple-one/\" target=\"_blank\">this Apple webpage</a> on your iPhone or iPad you will have the option to Start Free Trial. This will include one month for free. You can cancel at any time. Follow the steps here to do so: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673095/how-to-cancel-a-subscription-on-an-iphone.html\">How to cancel a subscription on an iPhone</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Apple states that the free trial is only for services you don’t already subscribe to, so signing up for the Apple One trial won’t get you a free month for a service you already pay for.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Can I get Apple One for free?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You won’t get Apple One for free, but there are some third parties that offer Apple One for a longer trial period than the standard one month offered by Apple. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, in the U.S. Verizon offers Apple One with the One Unlimited for iPhone plan.</p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.verizon.com/solutions-and-services/add-ons/entertainment/apple-one/&amp;xcust=1-1-234604-7-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Get Apple One for free with Verizon</a></p>\n\n\n<p>In the U.K. Barclays offers up to five months of Apple TV+, Apple Music, Apple Fitness+, Apple News+ and Apple Arcade for free with a Barclaycard. </p>\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.barclaycard.co.uk/personal/apple&amp;xcust=1-1-234604-7-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Get 5 months Apple One with Barclaycard U.K.</a></p>\n\n\n<h2>What if I have a free trial to a service?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have recently bought a qualifying new Apple product you will most likely be enjoying a  <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673723/all-the-ways-you-can-get-apple-tv-for-free.html\">free subscription to Apple TV+</a>. You may also be taking advantage of <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/675739/how-to-get-apple-music-for-free-2.html\">three or more months Apple Music for free.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also get a three months <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/675093/apple-fitness-launch-date-price-and-features.html\">free subscription to Fitness+</a> with a new Apple Watch. And three months free access to Apple Arcade if you purchase an iPhone, iPad, Apple TV or Mac.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are already taking advantage of all four offers you are already saving money so the deal would have no appeal right now, wait until your trials end. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to cancel Apple One</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can cancel your Apple One subscription at any time. To cancel your subscription follow these steps: </p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>On your iPhone go to Settings.</li><li>Tap on your Apple ID section. </li><li>Next tap on Subscriptions. </li><li>Tap on the one you want to cancel. </li><li>At the bottom of the next page tap on Cancel Subscription. </li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of the current period (the month you have paid for) access to the services will stop.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How do I sign up for Apple One?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The easiest way to sign up is to go to <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://one.apple.com&amp;xcust=1-1-234604-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">one.apple.com</a> on your Mac, iPhone or iPad. That will take you right to the Apple One sign-up page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a separate article that covers how to sign up on an iPhone, iPad, or Mac. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234766/how-to-sign-up-for-apple-one.html\">Learn how to sign up for Apple One</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Does Apple One work with users who have multiple Apple IDs?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you use one Apple ID for iCloud storage and a different Apple ID for subscriptions and purchases, Apple One is applied to your ID for the latter. Apple does have a way to apply the Apple One iCloud storage to the Apple ID you use for iCloud. Essentially, you need to reassign the iCloud storage plan to the Apple ID that will be used for Apple One. Apple has complete instructions on <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211862&amp;xcust=1-1-234604-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">how to reassign your iCloud storage during Apple One setup</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Where is Apple One available?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple One plans are not available everywhere. The Individual and Family plans will be available in more than 100 countries and regions. The Premier plan is available only in Australia, Canada, the U.K, and the U.S.–essentially, the countries where Apple News+ is available.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Can I use the Apple One services on non-Apple devices?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use the services “on any platform where the services are available,” according to Apple. Apple Music is available on Android and Windows, so you can use it there. Apple TV+ can be accessed through the Apple website, so you should be able to access it through a browser on any platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple News+, Apple Fitness+, and Apple Arcade can be accessed only through an Apple device. iCloud storage can be accessed through a browser on any platform at icloud.com.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What do Apple’s services offer?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s a brief outline of what you get with each of Apple subscription services.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apple Music</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Access to over 60 million tracks that can be downloaded or streamed on your iPhone, iPad, iPod or Mac, plus dedicated radio stations for different genres.
