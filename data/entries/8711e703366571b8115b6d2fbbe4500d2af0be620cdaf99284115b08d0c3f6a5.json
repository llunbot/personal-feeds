Google has not admitted to any wrongdoing, but each eligible consumer will receive at least $2, and some will receive more. Individual payouts will vary, depending on how much consumers spent in the Google Play Store between August 16, 2016 and September 30, 2023.</p>\n<p>The remaining $70 million will go to states that joined the settlement, which includes all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1991914#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1991914&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"8711e703366571b8115b6d2fbbe4500d2af0be620cdaf99284115b08d0c3f6a5","category":"Tech"}
