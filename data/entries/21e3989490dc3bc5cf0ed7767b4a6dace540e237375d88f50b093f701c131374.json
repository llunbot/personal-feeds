We can't predict exactly how much we would have made on iOS, but in the two years that we were on the platform, Fortnite had made about $300 million on iOS. So you could have projected hundreds of millions of dollars of lost revenue as a result of the fight.</blockquote>\r<br />\nSweeney went on to say that one could \"easily imagine\" that the total cost to ‌Epic Games‌ was a billion dollars or more based on lost revenue from iOS users, and lost revenue from people who didn't play because their friends on iOS weren't able to play.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhile ‌Epic Games‌ largely lost its court case against Apple when a judge found that Apple did not have a monopoly, ‌Epic Games‌ scored a win because Apple was forced to drop its anti-steering ‌App Store‌ policies.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAs part of the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/\">Epic Games vs. Apple</a> legal battle, Apple was given an order to allow developers to direct customers to purchase options outside of the ‌App Store‌. Apple was able to put off implementing the functionality for several years, but in 2024, did so in a way that still involved fees.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nJust last week, the judge overseeing the Apple vs. ‌Epic Games‌ legal fight said that Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/30/apple-app-store-rule-change-appeal/\">was in contempt of court</a> for failing to properly comply with the injunction. Apple was ordered to immediately implement new U.S. ‌App Store‌ rules allowing developers to add links to external websites where customers can make purchases. Apple is not allowed to collect commissions for purchases made using these links, nor can it control the look of the links or buttons that developers use.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple is <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/05/apple-appeals-app-store-payment-rule-changes/\">appealing the decision</a>, but in the meantime, it's a win for developers, and a win that was funded by ‌Epic Games‌. Sweeney said last week that ‌Epic Games‌ would be bringing Fortnite <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/30/epic-games-apple-peace-proposal/\">back to the iOS App Store</a> in the U.S. as a result of the ruling, and in the interview with <em>Business Insider</em>, he said that Fortnite would be taking advantage of Apple's new policies \"later this week.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple banned ‌Epic Games‌' U.S. developer account, but the company <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/05/epic-games-fortnite-us-app-store/\">has an account in Sweden</a> that it will use to bring Fortnite back to the U.S. ‌App Store‌. Sweeney said that he would be \"very surprised\" if Apple \"decided to brave the geopolitical storm of blocking a major app from iOS.\" He confirmed that ‌Epic Games‌ has informed Apple of what its plans are, so Apple is presumably aware that Fortnite will soon be submitted to the U.S. ‌App Store‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLater this year, ‌Epic Games‌ also plans to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/01/epic-games-webshops-ios-developers/\">launch Epic Games Store Webshops</a>, a feature that will let developers launch digital storefronts that are hosted by the ‌Epic Games‌ Store. Webshops will be free for developers making under $1 million annually per app, and for bigger developers, Epic will collect a 12 percent fee.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games/\">Epic Games</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/epic-games-vs-apple/\">Epic Games vs. Apple</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/06/epic-games-legal-fees/\">Epic Games Has Paid Over $100 Million in Legal Fees to Fight Apple's App Store Rules</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/epic-games-has-paid-over-100-million-in-legal-fees-to-fight-apples-app-store-rules.2456635/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"21e3989490dc3bc5cf0ed7767b4a6dace540e237375d88f50b093f701c131374","category":"Apple"}
