The ViewFinity S9 can also be pivoted to a portrait orientation using the included stand.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/samsung-viewfinity-s9-4.jpg\" alt width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" />\r<br />\nThe ViewFinity S9 includes one Thunderbolt 4 port, three USB-C ports, a Mini DisplayPort, and a DC 20V port for a power supply. It can connect to both PCs and Macs, and offers 90W power transfer and data speeds of up to 40Gb/s for machines connected through the Thunderbolt 4 port.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAt the top of the display, there is a 4K SlimFit camera that can tilt to fit the angle of the monitor, with an Auto Framing feature keeping the user visible and in the shot, similar to Apple's Center Stage feature. Built-in speakers are included, and an Adaptive Sound+ option allows noise levels to automatically adjust.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/07/samsung-viewfinity-s9-3.jpg\" alt width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" />\r<br />\nBuilt-in Smart TV apps and a remote control are also included that allow the display to function as a TV without being connected to a computer. Popular streaming apps are supported, as well as the Samsung Gaming Hub for playing cloud-based games from Xbox, NVIDIA, and more.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new ViewFinity S9 should also be <a href=\"https://howl.me/ckalWEzpQpn\">going up for sale on Samsung's site</a> for the same August 28 launch, and other retailers should also be adding it as the date approaches.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<small><em>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Samsung and Amazon.
