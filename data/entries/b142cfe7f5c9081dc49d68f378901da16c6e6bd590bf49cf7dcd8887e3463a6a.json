Not that we weren’t already among the most striking magazines to grace the newsstands, but when you get near to 150 (issues, not years), it doesn’t hurt to tear down the old wallpaper and give everything a fresh lick of paint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The eagle-eyed among you will no doubt spot that the body copy is a touch larger than before, while the mole-eyed (of which I am becoming more every day) will simply notice that the magazine has become a little easier to read. You see, we do take on board reader feedback, you’re welcome, and you can stop emailing me about it now.</p>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <h4><span>Related Posts</span></h4>\r\n                      </div>\r\n                      <div>\r\n                         <div>\r\n                            <div>\r\n                            <article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/mens-pro-cycling-highlights-2023\">My top 10 moments in the 2023 men’s road cycling season</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/opinion-electronic-shifting\">Opinion: Down with electronic shifting!</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article><article>\r\n                    <div>\r\n                       <h4>\r\n                          <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/buyers-guide-to-road-bike-groupsets\">Buyer’s guide to road bike groupsets</a>\r\n                       </h4>\r\n                    </div>\r\n                 </article></div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <span></span><span></span><span></span>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                        <div>\r\n                                            <div>\r\n                                                <div></div>\r\n                                            </div>\r\n                                        </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                    <div>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                        <span></span>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                    </div>\r\n                                </div>\r\n                                \r\n                            </div>\r\n                        </div>\r\n                        </div>\n\n\n<p>From cover to cover, we have introduced new fonts, new feature formats and whole new sections. The three front-end sections from previous issues – gear, pro racing and training – have been replaced by a single section called Leadout. This will help to prevent too much similarity between issues (another bit of reader feedback) and give us more flexibility in the kind of articles we produce and the subjects we cover.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the back of the magazine, the Bikes section has been replaced by a new section called Tested. It’s still reviews, but with an expanded remit to cover gear and components as well as bikes, and with more space devoted to standout products such as the new Cannondale SuperSix Evo reviewed this issue. The pink paper just makes us look a bit more like <em>La Gazzetta dello Sport</em> (or the <em>Financial Times</em>, depending on your opinion).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What hasn’t changed is our dedication to bringing you the best rides and events from around the world, captured by some of the industry’s top photographers. We’ll continue to champion long-form journalism, in-depth interviews and expert commentary. And we’ll still aim to serve up all the best stuff that the wide world of cycling has to offer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope you like what we have done, and I would love to hear your thoughts about it. Just remember to send it in a large font.</p>\n\n\n<div>\n<figure><a href=\"https://store.cyclist.co.uk/subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"343\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-970x343.jpg\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-970x343.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-300x106.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-768x271.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-1536x543.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-2048x724.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-750x265.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2023/11/clickable-subs-promo5-1140x403.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n<h2>What’s in issue 147?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Gateway to Hell:</strong> Mont Caro in Catalonia may not be well known to cyclists, but that just makes this rugged, remote climb all the more rewarding</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How to go fast and influence people:</strong> From national titles to Grand Tour stages to the Hour record, Alex Dowsett’s career has been dedicated to the pursuit of  one thing: more speed</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Where’s the money?</strong> Women’s pro cycling is booming, so why are races and teams collapsing for lack of financial support? <em>Cyclist</em> investigates</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Col de Vars:</strong> A gentle giant in the Alps</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What we ride:</strong> As a cycling magazine, we test a lot of bikes and we talk a lot about bikes, but what bikes do we actually ride ourselves?
