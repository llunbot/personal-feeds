Archer is an aerospace company that is developing an all-electric aircraft that supports vertical takeoff and landing for navigation within cities.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSchwekutsch first joined the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/\">Apple Car</a> project in March of 2019, and he served as a senior director of engineering on the special project group, aka the ‌Apple Car‌ team. Prior to that, he was Tesla's vice president of engineering.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple's car development has seen continual management shifts over the course of the last few years. Back in September, special projects vice president Doug Field <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/07/apple-car-doug-field-joins-ford/\">left Apple for Ford</a> after a three-year stint heading up ‌Apple Car‌ development alongside Bob Mansfield and John Giannandrea.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAI chief John Giannandrea is still overseeing ‌Apple Car‌ development, but with Field's departure, Apple recently <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/16/kevin-lynch-working-on-apple-car-development/\">brought on Apple Watch chief Kevin Lynch</a> to pitch in. Under Lynch's leadership, the ‌Apple Car‌ project is moving ahead, with Apple aiming to produce a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/18/apple-car-fully-autonomous-2025-launch/\">fully autonomous electric vehicle</a>. Apple wants to design a self-driving car that does not require human intervention, a goal that car manufacturers have yet to achieve.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nApple is planning to launch a self-driving car within four years with an aggressive launch timeline around 2025, but whether Apple can achieve that goal remains to be seen.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-car/\">Apple Car</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-inc-and-tech-industry.8\">Apple, Inc and Tech Industry</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/01/apple-car-hardware-engineer-departs-company/\">Apple Car Hardware Engineer Leaves for Air Taxi Startup</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-car-hardware-engineer-leaves-for-air-taxi-startup.2325829/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=flLRqL0-qgU:G1mRybyYlm0:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=flLRqL0-qgU:G1mRybyYlm0:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ae3cfa955b623bae24aaca6050178ba5d0ebf9da22bf94a05d3a87cc96bca8bd","category":"Apple"}
