As of this writing, Steam's dashboard claims that just under 2 million players are currently exploring <em>Palworld</em>, twice as many as <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> (the second game on the list).</p>\n<p>You can tell just from looking at screenshots from developer Pocketpair that many of <em>Palworld</em>'s monster designs are clearly inspired by designs from the Pokémon series, but the game's surprise success has led to greater scrutiny. Some observers <a href=\"https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/palworld-pokemon-plagiarism-accusations-pile-up-as-ceo-responds/\">have claimed</a> that Pocketpair has taken actual 3D models from the games and modified them to seem original. (That has also <a href=\"https://kotaku.com/pokemon-palworld-comparison-models-plagiarism-ai-1851192901\">prompted counter-claims</a> that those 3D models were fudged to make them seem more similar, though it seems the alterations just scaled the models up and down to make them easier to compare.)</p>\n\n<p>Today, the Pokémon Company <a href=\"https://corporate.pokemon.co.jp/media/news/detail/335.html\">released a brief statement</a> about \"another company's game released in January 2024,\" which could be a reference to a non-<em>Palworld</em> game but can only realistically be a reference to <em>Palworld</em>. The company will \"investigate and take appropriate measures\" in response to any asset theft or other infringement that it discovers.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1998940#p3\">Read 5 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1998940&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"5b8392bc2f95f2189ab1ffcebe91c1b437bf12d417ce6fae9e116671baa7800f","category":"Tech"}
