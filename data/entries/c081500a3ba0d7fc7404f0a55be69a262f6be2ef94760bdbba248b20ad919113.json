If you're shopping for the AirPods Pro, you can get these for <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=macrumors-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\"><strong>$189.99</strong></a> on Amazon, down from $249.00.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/03/AirPods-Combo-Discount-Feature-Triad.jpg\" /><em><small>Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with Amazon.

This is also the most common sale that we've tracked on the AirPods Pro in 2021, typically seen at both Woot and on Amazon.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?tag=macrumors-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$59 OFF</div>AirPods Pro for $189.99</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nFor the lower-cost model, Amazon has the AirPods with Wired Charging Case for <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=macrumors-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\"><strong>$119.99</strong></a>, down from $159.00. We've seen this model drop to $109 in the past, but this is another example of rare sales that haven't reemerged very often since their popularity earlier in 2021.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=macrumors-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$39 OFF</div>AirPods w/ Wired Charging Case for $119.99</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nLastly, the AirPods with Wireless Charging Case is marked down to <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=macrumors-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\"><strong>$149.99</strong></a>, from $199.00. Similar to the previous sale, this is a solid second-best option given that we haven't seen any steeper discounts on this model of AirPods since early 2021.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=macrumors-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1\" target=\"_blank\"><div><div>$49 OFF</div>AirPods w/ Wireless Charging Case for $149.99</div></a></div>\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWe track sales for every model of the AirPods in our <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-deals/\">Best AirPods Deals</a> guide, so be sure to bookmark that page while you shop around for the wireless headphones.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/best-apple-deals/\">Apple Deals</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Pro\">AirPods Pro (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/19/deals-get-airpods-pro-for-189/\">Deals: Get AirPods Pro for $189.99 ($59 Off) and Regular AirPods for $119.99 ($39 Off) in Newest Sales</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/deals-get-airpods-pro-for-189-99-59-off-and-regular-airpods-for-119-99-39-off-in-newest-sales.2304736/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Y604Ndz3RbA:HnzX9OmRnAg:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=Y604Ndz3RbA:HnzX9OmRnAg:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/Y604Ndz3RbA\" />","author":"Mitchel Broussard","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"c081500a3ba0d7fc7404f0a55be69a262f6be2ef94760bdbba248b20ad919113","category":"Apple"}
