{"title":"More Old Mac Font Memories","link":"https://leancrew.com/all-this/2025/05/font-memories-of-old-macs/","date":1747339809000,"content":"\n<p>Dr. Drang, writing at And Now It’s All This:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Back before the LaserWriter and PostScript (it’s an all InterCaps\nday here at ANIAT) made resolution independence commonplace, most\nprinters were of the dot-matrix variety, usually at a fairly low\nresolution. The original ImageWriter had a higher resolution than\nmost: 144 dpi. And this led to the interesting feature.</p>\n\n<p>You may have noticed that the 144 dpi resolution of the\nImageWriter is exactly twice that of the Mac’s 72 dpi screen. The\nImageWriter printer driver on the Mac took advantage of that. If\nyou were writing a document using a 12-point font, and your Mac\nhad a 24-point version of that font, the Mac would send the\n24-point font’s bitmaps (all Mac fonts were bitmapped in those\ndays) to the printer so it could render smoother text.</p>\n\n<p>The upshot of this was a very slight breaking of the WYSIWYG\nprinciple. On the screen, your Geneva 12 document would appear\nwith curly <em>y</em>s, but when you printed it out, it would have\nstraight <em>y</em>s. A fun idiosyncrasy that disappeared when PS fonts\nand Adobe Type Manager took over.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I used ImageWriters a lot when I was using Apple II’s, but almost never from the Mac. When I got my first Mac in 1991 it came with a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StyleWriter\">StyleWriter</a>, a rather dreadful inkjet printer. (At the very least it was dreadfully slow.) But I do remember this curiosity with the different style <em>y</em> glyphs when printing text set in Geneva to an ImageWriter. The 144/72 DPI thing was perhaps Apple’s first @2× “double resolution” trick.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s a copy of Apple’s 227-page (!) <a href=\"https://mirrors.apple2.org.za/ftp.apple.asimov.net/documentation/hardware/printers/Apple%20ImageWriter%20II%20Technical%20Reference%20Manual.pdf\">user manual for the ImageWriter II from 1985</a>, which includes copious examples of source code in both Applesoft BASIC and Macintosh Pascal. It even contains instructions for designing your own custom bitmapped character glyphs.</p>\n\n<p>Bonus points to Drang for including a screenshot illustrating that you chose font sizes from the Style menu (in a separate section underneath the actual, you know, styles) in early versions of MacWrite.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/15/more-old-mac-font-memories\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"42b4be4b22050c4905091e273d1163909dea913dd73831e72ebd166df9cc7d3b","category":"Tech"}
