At the time, Apple said the charging product would launch sometime in 2018, but that didn't happen. Following months of rumors about development issues, Apple <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/03/29/apple-officially-cancels-airpower/\">canceled</a> the project in March 2019.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nSince then, Apple has rolled out <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe</a> charging for its iPhones, including the ‌MagSafe‌ Duo accessory, which can wirelessly charge an Apple Watch and ‌iPhone‌ in tandem, although the Duo is just two separate wireless chargers joined together. If Gurman is correct, Apple still plans to release a charging device that can charge up all three products at the same time.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nContinuing the theme, Gurman says he believes Apple is still investigating charging solutions that don't rely on contact-based inductive charging technology. Specifically, he mentions Apple is working on \"short and long distance wireless charging devices\" and that the company \"imagines\" a future where all of its major devices can charge each other. \"Imagine an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> charging an ‌iPhone‌ and then that ‌iPhone‌ charging AirPods or an Apple Watch,\" adds Gurman.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWe've <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2019/04/01/two-way-wireless-charging-2019-iphones/\">long heard rumors</a> of so-called reverse wireless charging capabilities for recent ‌‌iPhone‌ series‌‌. The closest it has come is with its <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe battery pack</a>, which can receive power from an ‌iPhone‌ when the latter device is plugged in and charging.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nGiven the ‌<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe-battery-pack/\">MagSafe Battery Pack</a>‌'s reverse wireless charging feature, it seems technically possible that an ‌<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-12/\">iPhone 12</a> or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-13/\">iPhone 13</a> could deliver power to AirPods or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a>, but Apple has not yet implemented this feature.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpower/\">AirPower</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/29/apple-airpower-long-range-reverse-wireless/\">Apple Still Working on AirPower-Like Charger, Also Long-Range Wireless Charging and Reverse Charging</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-still-working-on-airpower-like-charger-also-long-range-wireless-charging-and-reverse-charging.2325440/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=aDeAMRrXegc:D6ExXOaetsE:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=aDeAMRrXegc:D6ExXOaetsE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div>","author":"Tim Hardwick","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"481c4845fbfb65a64f03678d30c34ff69cf09b192744bc8c415b133d6f16e23d","category":"Apple"}
