The <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/12/07/redesigned-notepad-for-windows-11-begins-rolling-out-to-windows-insiders/\">updated version of the Notepad app</a> is rolling out to Windows Insiders in the Dev channel, where the company is also testing <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/12/preview-builds-begin-to-fix-windows-11s-start-menu-and-taskbar/\">tweaks to the taskbar and Start menu</a>, a new-old button for <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/12/browser-switching-gets-marginally-easier-in-latest-windows-11-preview/\">setting the default web browser</a>, an <a href=\"https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/11/16/new-media-player-for-windows-11-begins-rolling-out-to-windows-insiders/\">updated Media Player app</a>, and other changes.</p>\n<p>The main changes appear pretty much as they did in the leaked Notepad screenshots from early October: there are a new unified title bar and menu bar that pick up Windows 11's \"mica\" styling, as well as dark-mode support, support for switching between dark and light mode, and modernized font controls.</p>\n      <ul>\n          <li>\n        <div>  \n        <div><img src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/win11-notepad2-980x613.jpeg\" /></div>\n        <p>\n          The find and replace menu takes up less space than before and doesn't get its own title bar.

Microsoft isn't trying to make Notepad a more advanced or rich-text editor. For starters, the program picks up a multilevel Undo function, whereas the current Notepad app can only undo and redo the very last thing that you did. There's also a new find and replace dialog that takes up less space.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1818654#p3\">Read 1 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1818654&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"204b213ad41f74a295c60434e94391e00798a1a9eeb8df9c0069054f9bcfaeb7","category":"Tech"}
