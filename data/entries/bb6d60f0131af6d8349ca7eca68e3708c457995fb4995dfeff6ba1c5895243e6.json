The update could include the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/30/ios-17-2-beta-addresses-wifi-issues/\">same fix for Wi-Fi connectivity issues</a> that Apple rolled out in the first iOS 17.2 beta, and it could resolve an issue where <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/18/ios-17-1-shutdown-bug-no-fix/\">some iPhones temporarily shut off overnight</a> for users still experiencing that. Apple also <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-to-fix-iphone-15-bmw-charging-issue/\">promised to fix a BMW wireless charging issue</a> affecting the iPhone 15 lineup in an update later this year, but it remains to be seen if that fix will be included in iOS 17.1.1.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt's unclear when iOS 17.1.1 will be released to the public, but our best guess is that the update will be available within the next week or two.\r<br />\n\r<br />\niOS 17.2 remains in beta testing, and is expected to be released in December, so iOS 17.1.1 will be a stopgap update. iOS 17.2 includes <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/26/ios-17-2-beta-1-features/\">many new features and changes</a>, including the promised Journal app, the ability for Apple Music subscribers to collaborate on playlists, a Translate option for the Action button on iPhone 15 Pro models, an iMessage Contact Key Verification security option, additional Weather and Clock widgets, and more.<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242\">iPadOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/11/02/ios-17-1-1-is-coming/\">Apple Preparing to Release iOS 17.1.1 Update for iPhone</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-preparing-to-release-ios-17-1-1-update-for-iphone.2409666/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"bb6d60f0131af6d8349ca7eca68e3708c457995fb4995dfeff6ba1c5895243e6","category":"Apple"}
