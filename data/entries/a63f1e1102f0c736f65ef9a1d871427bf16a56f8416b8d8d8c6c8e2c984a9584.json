{"title":"Five key road and gravel bikes from Cipollini’s 2021 range","link":"https://www.bikeradar.com/advertising-feature/cipollini-2021-bikes/","date":1627405218000,"content":"<img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/07/Cipollini-bikes-–-Crimson-Performance-Orientation-Marketing-aa8fd7e.jpg?quality=45&amp;resize=620,413\" />                                            <p>Bearing the name of legendary Italian sprinter Mario Cipollini, who won an astonishing 57 Grand Tour stages as a professional cyclist, the Cipollini brand looks to provide a high-end, exclusive bike range that offers something a bit different, and carries over Cipo’s racing flair into bikes that work just as well for the weekend rider.</p>\n<p>Cipollini offers a range of models to cater for road and gravel riders, including the Bond 2, which combines a relaxed <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/sizing-and-fit/road-bike-geometry-explained/\">road geometry</a> with racy characteristics, the MCM All-Road for road and off-road versatility, the super-light Dolomia, the race-ready NK1K and the speed-focused RB1K. In short, there’s something for all types of riders.</p>\n<p>All Cipollini frames are hand-built and painted in its factory in Italy and many use a full monocoque construction, in which the frame is moulded as one piece, rather than the rear triangle being joined to the front of the bike after moulding, as is often the case.</p>\n<p>It’s a more expensive, time-consuming process but one that Cipollini says allows it to build frames that are stronger, stiffer and more durable. Cipollini also uses tube-to-tube internally lugged construction for some of its frames, allowing it to offer bespoke frame dimensions.</p>\n<p>The association with bike racing continues, with Cipollini bikes being ridden in the UK by the <a href=\"https://www.crimsonperformance.com/bike-fit-race-team\" target=\"_blank\">Crimson Performance Orientation Marketing</a> men’s and women’s squads.</p>\n<div>\n    <i></i>\n    <div>\n  <div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/07/Cipollini-%E2%80%93-Crimson-Performance-Orientation-Marketing-3-1f37d50.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>Cipollini sponsors the Crimson Performance Orientation Marketing men’s and women’s teams.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Paligap</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n          <div>\n        \n<figure><div>\n    <img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/07/Cipollini-%E2%80%93-Crimson-Performance-Orientation-Marketing-4-7545d7b.jpg?quality=90&amp;resize=556%2C723\" /></div>    <figcaption><div>\n    <figcaption><span>The brand’s bikes are hand-built in Italy.</span>\n    </figcaption><span>\n                    <i>Paligap</i>\n            </span>\n</div>\n\n    </figcaption></figure></div>\n      </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n<p>UK distributor <a href=\"https://paligap.cc/product-category/bikes/framesets/\" target=\"_blank\">Paligap</a> sells Cipollini bikes as framesets only, letting you build up your bike to your own spec preferences.

He dressed up as a Roman emperor on a Tour de France rest day and raced in a range of outrageous skinsuits, including a tiger print kit and a muscle suit. </p>\n<p>He also dressed in all yellow and rode a yellow bike as Tour de France race leader – and was fined for it in the days before this became commonplace.</p>\n<p>With 12 stage wins at the Tour de France and a record tally of 42 stage wins in the Giro d’Italia, as well as a string of Classics victories and a rainbow jersey, Cipollini’s racing record speaks for itself, and his bikes reflect the Italian’s no-holds-barred attitude to riding.</p>\n<p>\n\n    </p></div>\n            <div>\n            <div>\n                <div><img src=\"https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/21/2021/07/Mario-Cipollini-Julius-Caesar-60209e8.jpg?quality=45&amp;resize=556,556\" /></div><div><figcaption>Doug Pensinger / Getty Images</figcaption></div></div>\n        </div>\n    </section><h2>Cipollini Dolomia</h2>\n<div>\n    <img /></div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> The Dolomia is Cipollini’s lightweight-aero bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Cipollini</i></span></div>\n<p>The Dolomia is Cipollini’s flagship lightweight-aero frameset designed to offer a light, stiff and fast frame.</p>\n<p>At 780g for a size medium, the Dolomia is the lightest in the Cipollini range and the frame is paired with a 380g fork for a total weight of just over 1kg.</p>\n<p>The Dolomia frame is available with disc brakes only, running on <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/road-bike-axle-standards/\">thru-axles</a> and with clearance for tyres up to 29mm wide.</p>\n<p>The frame is designed for front-end integration too, with scope to fit a one-piece bar/stem with internal cables routing into the headset.</p>\n<p>Other modern features include a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/the-complete-guide-to-bottom-bracket-standards/\">press-fit bottom bracket</a> shell and an aero-profiled carbon seatpost with 10mm setback.</p>\n<p>Mario Cipollini says the Dolomia is a bike designed for low weight and comfort, rather than to meet his foremost needs when he was a sprinter: stiffness and reactivity.

This may appeal to riders who have specific geometry requirements following a bike fit.</p>\n<p>Cipollini also offers the MCM Road with a custom geometry – it’s not part of the main range but can be ordered through the brand’s UK distributor, Paligap.</p>\n<p>The MyCipo online platform lets you save your design and come back to it later if you want to change anything and there are also some pre-configured options for inspiration.</p>\n<p>It’s a relatively affordable add-on to a Cipollini frameset, with the price of customisation varying between £100 and £300 depending on the model. Customisation doesn’t add to the lead time of ordering a frame either.</p>","author":"Paul Norman","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"a63f1e1102f0c736f65ef9a1d871427bf16a56f8416b8d8d8c6c8e2c984a9584","category":"Cycling"}
