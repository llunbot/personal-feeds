Apple held out on adopting ‌RCS‌ for quite some time, but <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/rcs/\">finally added support</a> with the launch of <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a>. On devices running ‌iOS 18‌, ‌RCS‌ is the default messaging protocol for texts between an <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> user and an Android user.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's adoption of ‌RCS‌ has undoubtedly increased the number of ‌RCS‌ messages sent per day, but Google's 1 billion figure includes Android to Android text messages along with Android to ‌iPhone‌ text messages (and vice versa).\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌RCS‌ is a notable improvement over SMS and MMS, and it makes for a better texting experience between ‌iPhone‌ users and Android users, as Android users can't take advantage of iMessage. Some of the ‌RCS‌ features:\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n \t<li>Support for higher resolution photos and videos.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Support for larger file sizes and file sharing.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Audio messages.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Cross-platform emoji reactions.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Real-time typing indicators and read receipts.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>Better group chats with support for removing people.</li>\r<br />\n \t<li>The option to send messages over cellular or Wi-Fi.</li>\r<br />\n</ul>\r<br />\nFor ‌iPhone‌ to ‌iPhone‌ conversations, iMessage is still the default, but ‌RCS‌ has made \"green bubble\" texting with Android users less of a hassle.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n‌RCS‌ is supported by the major carriers in the United States, but some smaller carriers like Boost Mobile, Mint Mobile, Ting, and others have yet to add support.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/05/13/android-ios-rcs-messages-1-billion/\">More Than 1 Billion RCS Messages Are Sent Daily on Android and iOS</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/more-than-1-billion-rcs-messages-are-sent-daily-on-android-and-ios.2457030/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"57aec4e9c0bfaa8da61764dc5c3b7f135352fdff407fb785c68ed29b42905296","category":"Apple"}
