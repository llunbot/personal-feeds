That curiosity inspired him to team up with fellow physicist Trevor Lipscombe of Catholic University of America in Washington, DC, to examine the underlying fluid mechanics and come up with a simple analytical model. Their analysis, described in a new paper published in the American Journal of Physics, yielded insight into Newsham's innovative design, which incorporated a device known as a \"windkessel.\"</p>\n<p>A quick Google search on the \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windkessel_effect\">windkessel effect</a>\" yields an entry on a physiological term to describe heart-aorta blood delivery, dating back to the man who coined it in 1899: German physiologist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Frank_(physiologist)\">Otto Frank</a>. \"Windkessel\" is German for \"wind chamber,\" but the human circulatory system doesn't have a literal wind chamber, so Frank's use was clearly metaphorical. However, there are earlier English uses of the wind chamber terminology that refer to an airtight chamber attached to a piston-driven water pump to smooth the outflow of water in fire engines like those designed by Newsham, per Lemon and Newsham.</p>\n<p>Rudimentary firefighting devices have been around since at least 2 BCE, when Ctesibius of Alexandria invented the first fire pump; it was re-invented in 16th-century Europe. Following the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Fire_of_London\">1666 fire</a> that destroyed much of London, there was a pressing need for more efficient <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_firefighting\">firefighting</a> strategies. This eventually led to the invention of so-called \"sucking worm engines\": leather hoses attached to manually operated pumps. John Lofting is <a href=\"https://www.sal.org.uk/collections/explore-our-collections/collections-highlights/john-lofting-fire-engine/\">usually credited</a> with inventing, patenting, and marketing these devices, which pulled water from a reservoir while the hose (\"worm\") enabled users to pump that water in a supposedly continuous stream, the better to combat fires. But nothing is known of his sucking worms after 1696.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1997177#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1997177&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jennifer Ouellette","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"61d62bfe28eb49eba878c35b77bec0a4e4f8c6b3e86ca7e8ea12bb3bb262f3f0","category":"Tech"}
