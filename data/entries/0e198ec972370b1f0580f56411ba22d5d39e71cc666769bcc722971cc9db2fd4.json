Customers who sought testing from LabElite—sometimes for clearance to travel or have contact with vulnerable people—received either no results or results indicating they were negative for the deadly virus.</p>\n<p>The scam, which ran from around February 2021 to about February 2022, made over $83 million total in fraudulent payments from the federal government's Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), which covered the cost of COVID-19 testing for people without insurance during the height of the pandemic. Local media coverage indicated that people who sought testing at LabElite were discouraged from providing health insurance information.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053766#p3\">Read 3 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2053766&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0e198ec972370b1f0580f56411ba22d5d39e71cc666769bcc722971cc9db2fd4","category":"Tech"}
