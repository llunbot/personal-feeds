{"title":"WhatsApp, the Dominant Messaging Platform in the U.K., Tells the Government to Bugger Off Regarding Legislation That Would Ban End-to-End Encryption","link":"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-64863448","date":1678406267000,"content":"\n<p>Shiona McCallum and Chris Vallance, reporting for the BBC News:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>WhatsApp says it would rather be blocked in the UK than undermine\nits encrypted-messaging system, if required to do so under the\nOnline Safety Bill. [...]</p>\n\n<p>The government said it is possible to have both privacy and\nchild safety.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Cryptographers and privacy experts agree that end-to-end encryption is the only way to guarantee privacy. Dum-dum elected officials around the globe have a <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2020/05/doj_apple_iphone_encryption\">persistent</a> “it must be possible” fantasy that it’s possible to create an encryption system with backdoor keys that would only be available to “the good guys”.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Undermining the privacy of WhatsApp messages in the UK would do so\nfor all users, Mr Cathcart said.</p>\n\n<p>“Our users all around the world want security - 98% of our users\nare outside the UK, they do not want us to lower the security of\nthe product,” he said. And the app would rather accept being\nblocked in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>“We’ve recently been blocked in Iran, for example. We’ve never\nseen a liberal democracy do that,” he added.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s not even a matter of willingness. It’s not technically possible for WhatsApp or Signal or iMessage or any platform that’s end-to-end encrypted to use some weaker backdoor-able encryption on a country-by-country basis. The platform is either truly end-to-end encrypted or it’s not. They can’t just flip and switch and let U.K. WhatsApp users use an entirely different non-E2E protocol. The principled stand in the name of cryptographically guaranteed privacy isn’t happening now, in response to this deeply misguided legislation — it happened at the outset of these platforms, when they were designed from the ground up with E2E.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/03/09/whatsapp-uk\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"6a7c56510a7d78c0fbd6bdc29e8bd199d634d5c85e1af303a5ec15f641c8c0d4","category":"Tech"}
