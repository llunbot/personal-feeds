On November 16, I participated in the inaugural Apacheria Gravel event in Douglas, Arizona. Organized with heart and grit, this event embodied the spirit of adventure that makes gravel cycling unique.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ApacheriaGravel-Nov.162024-191.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1920\" srcset=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ApacheriaGravel-Nov.162024-191.jpg 1536w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ApacheriaGravel-Nov.162024-191-240x300.jpg 240w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ApacheriaGravel-Nov.162024-191-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ApacheriaGravel-Nov.162024-191-768x960.jpg 768w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ApacheriaGravel-Nov.162024-191-1229x1536.jpg 1229w\" /></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>A Fresh Start with a New Companion</strong></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.exploredouglas.org/Apacheria-Gravel/#:~:text=This%20thrilling%20event%20invites%20cyclists%20of%20all,by%20the%20beauty%20of%20the%20Arizona%20countryside.\">Apacheria Gravel</a> event was only the second time I’d ridden my new <a href=\"https://moots.com/bikes/gravel/routt-rsl/\">Moots Routt RSL</a>. I picked it up in Steamboat Springs back in early October, greeted by the golden hues of changing leaves and the warm hospitality of the Moots family. Nate gave me a thorough rundown of the bike’s features, and I left Steamboat with excitement and anticipation for the adventures ahead.</p>\n<p>Life and work kept me busy, leaving little time to bond with the bike before the event. But as soon as I threw my leg over the Routt for the 66-mile distance, all concerns melted away. The bike is a masterpiece-responsive yet forgiving, with geometry that perfectly balances a racy feel and all-day comfort. The 44mm WTB tires were a game-changer, soaking up the rough terrain and providing a smooth, comfortable ride that kept me fresh all day.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ApacheriaGravel-Nov.162024-63.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ApacheriaGravel-Nov.162024-63.jpg 1920w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ApacheriaGravel-Nov.162024-63-300x169.jpg 300w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ApacheriaGravel-Nov.162024-63-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ApacheriaGravel-Nov.162024-63-768x432.jpg 768w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ApacheriaGravel-Nov.162024-63-1536x864.jpg 1536w\" /></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>A Day to Remember</strong></p>\n<p>The route was challenging and beautiful, showcasing the rugged landscapes of southern Arizona and a stout headwind on the way home. Surrounded by friends from the Tucson cycling community, the day was filled with camaraderie, laughter, and a shared passion for the sport. To top it all off, I stood on the podium’s top step- a sweet bonus to an already unforgettable experience.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ApacheriaGravel-Nov.162024-203.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1536\" height=\"1920\" srcset=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ApacheriaGravel-Nov.162024-203.jpg 1536w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ApacheriaGravel-Nov.162024-203-240x300.jpg 240w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ApacheriaGravel-Nov.162024-203-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ApacheriaGravel-Nov.162024-203-768x960.jpg 768w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ApacheriaGravel-Nov.162024-203-1229x1536.jpg 1229w\" /></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Gratitude for the Moots Family</strong></p>\n<p>Reflecting on the day, I couldn’t be more grateful for my Routt RSL and the Moots family. They’ve created a bike that performs and connects me to the adventures I hold dear. Since Apacheria, the Routt has been my partner for more rides and new explorations, and I’m excited to see where it will take me next.</p>\n<p>Thank you to everyone who poured their heart into making Apacheria Gravel a success. And to my Moots family, your support means the world to me. Here’s to more first-year events, unforgettable rides, and new memories on bikes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ApacheriaGravel-Nov.162024-290.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1280\" srcset=\"https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ApacheriaGravel-Nov.162024-290.jpg 1920w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ApacheriaGravel-Nov.162024-290-300x200.jpg 300w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ApacheriaGravel-Nov.162024-290-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ApacheriaGravel-Nov.162024-290-768x512.jpg 768w, https://moots.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/ApacheriaGravel-Nov.162024-290-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" /></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://moots.com/blog/apacheria-gravel-a-first-year-cycling-adventure-with-the-moots-routt-rsl/\">Apacheria Gravel: A First-Year Cycling Adventure with the Moots Routt RSL</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://moots.com\">Moots Cycles</a>.</p>","author":"Elizabeth","siteTitle":"Moots","siteHash":"dbee4c0f87f6913283dcacd1f8b3e2603e0d744c0d8d7eea7b1691bee838c4cd","entryHash":"6f5d0dab73d5da27b6c33453a713a9b6c2a8b60bc4e1d59e8177ad45ade4ffac","category":"Cycling"}
