This is the vehicle that, with plenty of permutations and upgrades, Musk says will ferry cargo and people across the Solar System to build a settlement on Mars, making humanity a multi-planetary species and achieving the billionaire's long-standing dream.</p>\n<p>Of course, that is a long way off. SpaceX is still working on getting Starship into orbit or close to it, an achievement that appears to be possible this year. Then, the company will start launching Starlink satellites on Starship missions while <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/12/nasa-wants-to-see-gas-stations-in-space-but-so-far-its-tanks-are-empty/\">testing in-space refueling technology</a> needed to turn Starship into a human-rated Moon lander for NASA.</p>\n<p>SpaceX's South Texas team is progressing toward the third full-scale Starship test flight. <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2023/12/spacex-completes-static-fire-test-in-push-toward-third-starship-launch/\">On December 20</a>, the Starship's upper stage slated for the next test flight completed a test-firing of its Raptor engines at the Starbase launch site on the Texas Gulf Coast. Nine days later, the 33-engine Super Heavy booster fired up on the launch pad for its own static fire test. On the same day, SpaceX hot-fired the Starship upper stage once again on a test stand next to the launch pad.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1993759#p3\">Read 18 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1993759&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fac85c32ded254a23ea18df0a793ae857bbe6d45332d77930e67c2b0bf47cce2","category":"Tech"}
