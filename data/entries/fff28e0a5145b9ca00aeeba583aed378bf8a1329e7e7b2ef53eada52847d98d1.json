{"title":"AT&T Launches New Guarantee, Promises to Compensate Customers for Outages","link":"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/08/att-outage-guarantee-compensation/","date":1736380860000,"content":"AT&amp;T <a href=\"https://about.att.com/story/2025/guarantee.html\">today announced</a> a new AT&amp;T Guarantee customer service initiative that offers \"an elevated experience\" with connectivity customers can depend on, with a promise to \"make it right\" if there are issues.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/att-guarantee.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"850\" height=\"500\" />\r<br />\nCustomers received emails about the new guarantee this morning, with AT&amp;T offering credits for service interruptions and downtime. AT&amp;T says that a fiber outage lasting for 20 minutes or more or wireless downtime lasting 60 minutes or more will result in a credit for a full day of service. For cellular customers, an outage needs to impact 10 or more towers to count. Weather-related events, natural disasters, and outages caused by third parties will not be eligible for a credit.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAT&amp;T Fiber customers must be using an AT&amp;T-provided gateway to be eligible for downtime compensation, and again, outages caused by weather-related events and natural disasters are not included. AT&amp;T also does not count outages caused by downed or cut cable wires at a customer residence, issues with wiring inside a customer's home, and outages resulting from planned maintenance.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nCustomers who experience an outage will be notified of an upcoming bill credit via email or text, with AT&amp;T providing these credits proactively.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAT&amp;T also says promises that there will be no hidden fees or equipment charges with fiber, and it plans to offer reward cards for customer service failures. If a wait time for technical support exceeds five minutes and a customer is not offered a callback or does not receive the callback, AT&amp;T will provide a reward card.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/08/att-outage-guarantee-compensation/\">AT&amp;T Launches New Guarantee, Promises to Compensate Customers for Outages</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/at-t-launches-new-guarantee-promises-to-compensate-customers-for-outages.2447011/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"fff28e0a5145b9ca00aeeba583aed378bf8a1329e7e7b2ef53eada52847d98d1","category":"Apple"}
