Apple\ntraditionally moves to mass production, where it begins making\nmillions of iPhone units, in August. The phones typically start to\nship to customers in late September.</p>\n\n<p>One person with direct knowledge said the LG-made displays have\nfailed reliability tests after it goes through a new process known\nas low injection pressure overmolding or LIPO. The process\ninvolves Apple fusing the display into its metal shell prior to\nassembly. Apple is repeatedly tweaking the design of LG’s display\nso that it can pass the tests.</p>\n\n<p>However, Apple still can use displays made by its leading supplier\nSamsung, ensuring that it can continue to assemble a significant\namount of units.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What going legit was to Michael Corleone, breaking free of dependence upon Samsung is to Tim Cook: “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UneS2Uwc6xw\">Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in</a>.”</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/07/20/ma-iphone-15-pro-delay\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"9c65d4471ce55a01e1e6080ba27421f8fc7a5f5c798f124c408249b2181f2468","category":"Tech"}
