Meta's new $299 headset is a significant drop from <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/10/meta-quest-3-review-mixed-reality-version-0-5/\">the $499 Quest 3</a> and the cheapest price point for a Meta VR headset since the company raised the price of the aging Quest 2 to $400 <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/07/meta-quest-2-vr-headset-price-jumps-100-to-399-gets-zero-new-features/\">back in the summer of 2022</a>. When you account for a few years of inflation in there, the Quest 3S is close to the $250 headset Carmack envisioned.</p>\n<figure>\n    <div>\n                        <div>\n            <div>\n              <a href=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-10-22-13.14.27-1440x1080.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">\n                <img width=\"2560\" height=\"1920\" src=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-10-22-13.14.27-scaled.jpg\" srcset=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-10-22-13.14.27-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-10-22-13.14.27-300x225.jpg 300w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-10-22-13.14.27-640x480.jpg 640w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-10-22-13.14.27-768x576.jpg 768w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-10-22-13.14.27-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-10-22-13.14.27-2048x1536.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-10-22-13.14.27-980x735.jpg 980w, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/2024-10-22-13.14.27-1440x1080.jpg 1440w\" />\n              </a>\n              <div>\n                A new button on the underside of the Quest 3S lets you transition to pass-through mode at any time.\n                                  <div>\n                    Credit:\n                                          Kyle Orland\n                                      </div>\n                              </div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n                  </div>\n      </figure>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, Meta must still seriously tackle the \"250 grams\" part of Carmack's vision. The 514g Quest 3S feels at least as unwieldy on your face as the 515g Quest 3, and both are still quite far from the \"super light comforts\" Carmack envisioned. Add in all the compromises Meta made so the Quest 3S could hit that lower price point, and you have a cheap, half-measure headset that we can only really recommend to the most price-conscious of VR consumers.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/review-meta-quest-3s-is-cheaper-in-both-senses-of-the-word/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/review-meta-quest-3s-is-cheaper-in-both-senses-of-the-word/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0047fc379b655f16529c99af9a8af85d2f84502f3b69400a53eebc251ecbd0f9","category":"Tech"}
