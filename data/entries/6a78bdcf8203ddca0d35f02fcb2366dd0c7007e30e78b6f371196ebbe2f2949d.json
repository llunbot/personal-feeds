There is no inter-PC connection or communication; itâ€™s all done through a central server. Each piece of the project is independent of the others; a distributed computing project wouldn't work if a process needed the results of a prior process to continue. SETI@home was a prime candidate for distributed computing: Each individual work unit was a unique moment in time and space as seen by a radio telescope.</p>\n<p>Twenty-one years later, SETI@home shut down, having found nothing. An incalculable amount of PC cycles and electricity wasted for nothing. We have no way of knowing all the reasons people quit (feel free to tell us in the comments section), but having nothing to show for it is a pretty good reason.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1952689#p3\">Read 15 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1952689&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ars Contributors","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"6a78bdcf8203ddca0d35f02fcb2366dd0c7007e30e78b6f371196ebbe2f2949d","category":"Tech"}
