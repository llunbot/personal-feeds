Make sure you're connected to the internet and try again, or contact Apple support for assistance,\" reads the error.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIt turns out that Apple failed to provide the appropriate decryption key for the M4 ‌MacBook Air‌ and ‌Mac Studio‌ models to install the update. Apple encrypts its software updates and a server-side decryption key is required for installation. The key for new Macs is not available from Apple's software server at this time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIf you have one of the new Macs that's running the software that it came with when it arrived, you won't be able to update to the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/\">macOS Sequoia</a> 15.4 release candidate until Apple fixes the issue.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThis problem will not affect new ‌MacBook Air‌ and ‌Mac Studio‌ models that were previously running macOS 15.4 beta 4, as these machines can install the release candidate.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/macos-sequoia/\">macOS Sequoia</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/macos-sequoia.246\">macOS Sequoia</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/24/macos-sequoia-15-4-rc-installation-issue/\">Can't Update to the macOS 15.4 RC?
