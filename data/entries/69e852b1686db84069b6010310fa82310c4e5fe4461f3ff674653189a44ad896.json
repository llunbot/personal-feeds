The offer is available from today through May 16 in many countries, including the U.S., Canada, U.K., Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, China, Japan, and others.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2025/01/Trade-in-Feature-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1770\" height=\"996\" />\r<br />\nKeep in mind that this promotion seems to be geared towards devices that are not eligible for trade-in credit at Apple Stores. The idea is that you can help the planet by bringing in old electronics to Apple for free recycling, as has long been possible, but now with the added bonus of receiving 10% off an accessory for a limited time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe offer is available at physical Apple Store locations only. Each customer may recycle up to five eligible devices for a promotional discount on eligible accessories. Recycling of the eligible device and purchase of an eligible accessory must be completed in the same transaction. Full terms and conditions <a href=\"http://apple.com/promo\">can be found on Apple's website</a>.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEligible devices for recycling, according to Apple:<ul><li>AirPods</li>\r<br />\n  <li>AirPort</li>\r<br />\n  <li>AirTag</li>\r<br />\n  <li>Apple TV</li>\r<br />\n  <li>Computers</li>\r<br />\n  <li>Displays</li>\r<br />\n  <li>Hard Drives &amp; Storage</li>\r<br />\n  <li>Headphones &amp; Speakers</li>\r<br />\n  <li>HomePod</li>\r<br />\n  <li>Mice &amp; Keyboards</li>\r<br />\n  <li>Networking</li>\r<br />\n  <li>Printers &amp; Scanners</li>\r<br />\n  <li>Smartphones</li>\r<br />\n  <li>Tablets</li>\r<br />\n  <li>Watches</li>\r<br />\n  <li>iPod</li></ul>Accessories eligible for the 10% discount:<ul><li>AirPods 4</li>\r<br />\n  <li>AirPods 4 with Active Noise Cancellation</li>\r<br />\n  <li>AirTag (1-pack)</li>\r<br />\n  <li>AirTag (4-pack)</li>\r<br />\n  <li>Apple Pencil</li>\r<br />\n  <li>Apple TV 4K</li>\r<br />\n  <li>HomePod mini</li>\r<br />\n  <li>Apple Watch bands</li>\r<br />\n  <li>Apple-branded adapters, cables, and chargers</li>\r<br />\n  <li>Apple-branded iPhone and iPad cases</li>\r<br />\n  <li>Magic Mouse</li>\r<br />\n  <li>Magic Trackpad</li>\r<br />\n  <li>Magic Keyboard (excluding the iPad version)</li></ul>While a 10% discount is not massive, Apple rarely offers direct savings on its products beyond its annual Back to School and Black Friday events.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nEarth Day is on Tuesday, April 22.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-store/\">Apple Store</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/earth-day/\">Earth Day</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/04/16/apple-earth-day-recycling-promotion/\">Apple Launches 2025 Earth Day Promotion With Discounted Accessories</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-launches-2025-earth-day-promotion-with-discounted-accessories.2455421/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"69e852b1686db84069b6010310fa82310c4e5fe4461f3ff674653189a44ad896","category":"Apple"}
