Arguably the biggest test yet has resulted in some potentially great news: you don't need to overspend on compatible SSDs as many had previously feared.</p>\n<p>We've pointed to Digital Foundry's coverage of PS5 storage and performance in the past, and founder Richard Leadbetter <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWQs4UpiKlg\" target=\"_blank\">returned to the topic on Tuesday</a> to confirm that any compatible PS5 drive will deliver apparently identical performance when running native titles for the console (and backwards-compatible ones, too).</p>\n\n<p>In order to upgrade the PS5's storage capacity, the minimum requirements for a compatible drive are that it must be NVME M.2 format and PCIe 4.0 speed rated, as well as meeting <a href=\"https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps5-install-m2-ssd/#min\">certain dimensional and technical requirements</a> to slot into the console's storage expansion bay. Beyond those requirements, compatible SSDs have a significant range of storage amounts (as low as 256GB) and speed ratings (in terms of both sequential and random read/write operations, which can significantly impact general-purpose performance on an average computer).</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1797124#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1797124&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Steve Haske","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e9d3fc5507694b60a44efd1723bad6e3bdcabbe4c258c49a1ff552489761dc4e","category":"Tech"}
