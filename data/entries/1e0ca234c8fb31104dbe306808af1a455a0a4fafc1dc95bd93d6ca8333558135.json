{"title":"Backward compatible: Many old Oblivion mods still work on Oblivion Remastered","link":"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/backward-compatible-many-old-oblivion-mods-still-work-on-oblivion-remastered/","date":1745435801000,"content":"<p>Bethesda <a href=\"https://help.bethesda.net/#en/answer/69672\">isn't officially supporting mods</a> for <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/you-can-play-the-unreal-powered-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remaster-today/\">the newly released <em>Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em></a>. But that hasn't stopped some players from discovering that many mods created for the 2006 original seem to work just fine in the new game with a bare minimum of installation headaches.</p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivionmods/comments/1k5c77z/from_the_bethesda_discord/\">noted on Reddit</a> and <a href=\"https://discord.com/channels/784542837596225567/842456895942819840/1364285658595852358\">the Bethesda Game Studios Discord</a>, some .esp mod files designed years ago for the original <em>Oblivion</em> have the same effect when plugged into the new <em>Remastered</em> game. Ars confirmed this during some quick testing, using <a href=\"https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/20947\">a mod uploaded in 2008</a> to easily add high-end weapons and armor to the opening jail cell scene in the <em>Remastered</em> version.</p>\n<p>While players of the original game could use <a href=\"https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/2097\">the Oblivion Mod Manager</a> to easily install these mods, doing so in the <em>Remastered</em> version requires a bit more manual work. First, users have to download the applicable .esp mod files and put them in the \"Content/Dev/ObvData/Data\" folder (the same one that already houses DLC data files like \"DLCHorseArmor.esp\"). Then it's just a matter of opening \"Plugins.txt\" in the same folder and adding that full .esp file name to the plaintext list.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/backward-compatible-many-old-oblivion-mods-still-work-on-oblivion-remastered/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/backward-compatible-many-old-oblivion-mods-still-work-on-oblivion-remastered/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"1e0ca234c8fb31104dbe306808af1a455a0a4fafc1dc95bd93d6ca8333558135","category":"Tech"}
