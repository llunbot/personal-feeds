{"title":"The iPhone 15 and everything else coming from Apple in a packed September","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2044404/apple-september-2023-iphone-15-apple-watch-series-9-ios-17.html","date":1693477800000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple has lots of releases throughout the year, but two months stand out in Apple’s calendar: June, when WWDC gives us our first look at a lot of new software and often new product launches, and September, when the new iPhones are released and the latest major update to Apple’s operating systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After invites went out earlier this week, we now know that Apple’s “Wonderlust” event will be held on Tuesday, September 12, where it will likely unveil the iPhone 15 and Apple Watch Series 9. If history repeats itself, those will go up for preorder on Friday, September 15, and start shipping a week later, September 22.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They will be accompanied by the release of iOS 17, iPadOS 17, watchOS 10, and maybe macOS Sonoma, though Apple sometimes releases Mac OS updates a few weeks behind the others. Plus new Macs are rumored to launch in October.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With all that in mind, here’s what we expect from Apple’s jam-packed month:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Wonderlust event: September 12 at 10am PT</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/831417/apple-september-iphone-event-date-time.html\">Apple’s special event for new iPhones</a> almost always falls on the second Tuesday or Wednesday of September. This year Apple is holding the event on a Tuesday: September 12 at 10am PT. It’s no secret that Apple will unveil the new iPhones and Apple Watches, along with some potential new software features that are exclusive to those devices and maybe a few surprises: </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Bye-bye Lightning: </strong>All iPhones this year will <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2043520/usb-c-iphone-15-faq-cable-speeds-port-thunderbolt.html\">switch from Lightning to USB-C</a>, marking the end of the connector that launched with the iPhone 5 in 2012. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iPhone 15:</strong> The iPhone 15 will come in two sizes–a 6.1-inch model and a 6.7-inch “Plus” model–and use the same A16 processor that is currently shipping in the iPhone 14 Pro. They’ll also gain the Dynamic Island and 48MP camera sensor from the iPhone 14 Pro. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1351959/iphone-15-plus-pro-ultra-rumors-specs-release-price.html\">Read everything we know about the iPhone 15 here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iPhone 15 Pro:</strong> The Pro models will get the new <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1532925/a17-bionic-preview-benchmarks-cpu-gpu-ram.html\">A17 processor</a> and a camera upgrade, with the Pro Max variant using a new “periscope” telephoto camera for extreme zoom. We’re told to expect the stainless steel body to be replaced by titanium, which will make them lighter. Oh, and the Pro Max version might be named iPhone 15 Ultra–and cost quite a bit more than usual. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1487037/iphone-15-pro-max-ultra-design-display-camera-price-rumors.html\">Read everything we know about the iPhone 15 Pro/Ultra</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Apple Watch Series 9:</strong> Rumors say the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1472709/apple-watch-series-9-rumors-specs-features-price-release.html\">Apple Watch Series 9</a> is going to be one of the smallest upgrades yet. There’s a new faster S9 processor on the way, but the rumors say that’s the biggest change—we haven’t heard any reports of new sensors or other hardware changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Apple Watch Ultra 2:</strong> You can’t call it an Apple Watch Ultra if it has a slower processor than the regular, non-Ultra Apple Watch, right? So the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1997157/apple-watch-ultra-2-launch-2024-3d-printed-parts.html\">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> is expected to be essentially the same as the first Apple Watch Ultra, only with the S9 processor. It might be a few grams lighter, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>AirPods: </strong>A <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-29/apple-sets-sept-12-date-for-launch-of-iphone-15-new-watches&amp;xcust=1-1-2044404-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">recent report from Mark Gurman</a> says “Apple will introduce <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/673885/airpods-pro-lite-release-date-price-specs-rumours.html\">updated AirPods</a> at the event that include a USB-C charging port.” It’s not clear if these are an existing model with USB-C instead of Lightning or some new model with new capabilities or a lower price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iPad mini: </strong>Apple is reportedly working on <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/678361/ipad-mini-7-specs-design-processor-release.html\">a minor refresh</a> to the 6th-gen iPad mini with a new chip and color, but it’s unclear whether it will arrive in 2023.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apps and software updates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We all get excited about new hardware, but new operating system updates have a bigger impact on more people. This September, over a billion people will update their iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches, and Macs and find lots of great new features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some iOS 17 features (that will be available for other OSes as well) will come in updates later this year. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1961587/ios-17-features-not-available-at-launch-september-2023.html\">We have a list of those</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iOS 17:</strong> StandBy mode, contact posters, Live Voicemail transcription, an entirely new voice model for Siri and dictation (and you don’t need to say “Hey Siri…” anymore, just “Siri…”), vastly improved autocorrect, hold your phones together to AirDrop (and NameDrop), and more. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1519552/ios-17-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">Read everything you need to know about iOS 17</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iPadOS 17:</strong> In addition to the iPad getting many of the iOS 17 features, the new version of iPadOS finally brings the customizable lock screen from iOS 16 to iPad, Live Activities, and improvements to Stage Manager. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1794980/ipados-17-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">Read all about iPadOS 17</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>‌<strong>tvOS 17:</strong> There are fewer big new features in tvOS 17 than the other operating systems. Most notably, you can make and receive FaceTime calls on your TV using your iPhone as the camera and mic thanks to Continuity Camera. Also, the Control Center is improved and you can locate your Siri remote with your iPhone. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>macOS Sonoma:</strong> The biggest new features coming to macOS this year are desktop widgets (including those from your iPhone!), Game Mode, web apps, and some new video conferencing features. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1670742/macos-14-release-date-features-compatibility-beta.html\">Read all about macOS Sonoma</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Services</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apple TV+</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the shows, series, and movies we expect to release on Apple TV+ in TK.
