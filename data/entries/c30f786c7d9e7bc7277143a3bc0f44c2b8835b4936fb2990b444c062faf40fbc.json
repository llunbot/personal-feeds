The\npresident says tariffs are needed to close America’s trade\ndeficit, which he sees as a transfer of wealth to foreigners. Yet\nas any of the president’s economists could have told him, this\noverall deficit arises because Americans choose to save less than\ntheir country invests — and, crucially, this long-running reality\nhas not stopped its economy from outpacing the rest of the g7 for\nover three decades. There is no reason why his extra tariffs\nshould eliminate the deficit. Insisting on balanced trade with\nevery trading partner individually is bonkers — like suggesting\nthat Texas would be richer if it insisted on balanced trade with\neach of the other 49 states, or asking a company to ensure that\neach of its suppliers is also a customer.</p>\n\n<p>And Mr Trump’s grasp of the technicalities was pathetic. He\nsuggested that the new tariffs were based on an assessment of a\ncountry’s tariffs against America, plus currency manipulation and\nother supposed distortions, such as value-added tax. But it looks\nas if officials set the tariffs using a formula that takes\nAmerica’s bilateral trade deficit as a share of goods imported\nfrom each country and halves it — which is almost as random as\ntaxing you on the number of vowels in your name.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is no way to report on these tariffs in a way that is honest and accurate without describing them as bonkers and nonsensical. News publications that are trying to present them as rational, or describing them as “reciprocal” just because that’s the word the White House is using, <a href=\"https://presswatchers.org/2025/04/mainstream-media-falls-for-trumps-insane-reciprocal-tariff-talk/\">are beclowning themselves</a>.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/04/03/the-economist-on-trumps-mindless-tariffs\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"c30f786c7d9e7bc7277143a3bc0f44c2b8835b4936fb2990b444c062faf40fbc","category":"Tech"}
