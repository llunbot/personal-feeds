The ‌AirPods 4‌ come in two variants, one with Active Noise Cancellation and one without, allowing Apple to hit two separate price points.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2018/02/airpods-4-blue.jpg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\" />\r<br />\nThe ‌AirPods 4‌ without Active Noise Cancellation are priced at $129, which is the same price that Apple used to sell the AirPods 2 for. The ANC version is priced at $179, the same cost as the prior-generation AirPods 3. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere wasn't notable difference between the AirPods 2 and AirPods 3 in terms of core functionality, which was undoubtedly confusing to the average consumer not familiar with Apple's products. The new lineup makes it very clear what's what, and what you get for the extra $50. Apple has also eliminated the confusing charging case options, and both models use USB-C. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nAlong with Active Noise Cancellation, there are a couple other differences between the ‌AirPods 4‌ and ‌AirPods 4‌ with ANC. The ANC model has a case that supports <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a> charging and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/find-my/\">Find My</a>, and it also has ANC-related features that include Adaptive Audio, Transparency Mode, and Conversation Awareness. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nOther than these features, the ‌AirPods 4‌ and ‌AirPods 4‌ ANC are identical in design and functionality. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple rounds out the AirPods lineup with the $249 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-pro/\">AirPods Pro</a> 2 and the $549 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/\">AirPods Max</a>. The latter headphones were just refreshed with USB-C charging and new color options, but are otherwise unchanged. The ‌AirPods Pro‌ 2 were updated in September 2023, and we're expecting to see another refresh in 2025. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods/\">AirPods 4</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods\">AirPods (Buy Now)</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/10/airpods-lineup-streamlined/\">Apple Streamlines AirPods Lineup With Fourth-Generation Dual-Model Launch</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-streamlines-airpods-lineup-with-fourth-generation-dual-model-launch.2435805/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"176dbb0727b2d2cd39832e18b02a93babeca6962e3affea49980b58ebf90c52e","category":"Apple"}
