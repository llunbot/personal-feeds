{"title":"Apple’s big WWDC keynote is coming. I don’t care","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/2646255/apples-big-wwdc-keynote-is-coming-i-dont-care.html","date":1743417000000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week, probably because I was the least busy with actual work at the time, I happened to be the Macworld staffer who first spotted the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2648459/apple-announces-incredible-wwdc-2025-slated-for-june-9-13.html\">WWDC 2025 announcement</a> in my inbox. And for a moment I was quite excited: WWDC, after all, is the second biggest date in Apple’s calendar, an event whose raft of software reveals sets the tone for the year to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then I thought about it a bit more and realized that I didn’t care. I’m done with WWDC. And if I wasn’t contractually obliged to cover it for work, I strongly doubt that I’d even watch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look, don’t get me wrong: I understand that WWDC 2025 is important <em>for Apple</em>. The company’s last 12 months have been pretty shockingly bad on the software side, punctuated by failures, delays, and broken promises, and it needs to show developers and customers that it can turn things around. As Jason Snell puts it, Apple must <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2649634/will-apple-repeat-its-mistakes-at-wwdc-2025-or-alter-course.html\">repent its mistakes</a>, not repeat them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m just struggling to feel anything other than apathy at the prospect of watching Apple’s top brass either admit their failings or, more likely, act like nothing went wrong. One outcome is depressing and boring; the other depressing and infuriating. Neither sounds like a fun way to spend an evening (as it will be here in the U.K.).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s talk for a minute about what Apple <em>should</em> do on June 9. Tim Cook, Craig Federighi, and whoever else is on stage should be completely honest. A lot of reputational damage was done when last year’s claims about the next-gen contextually aware Siri, a feature that was used to sell iPhone 16 handsets, turned out to be <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2631729/apple-intelligence-was-both-too-early-and-too-late.html\">nothing more than hot air</a>. If that feature is still coming, Apple should say precisely when, and in precisely what form. If not, it should admit that and explain precisely what went wrong. The company needs to regain trust. Now is not the time for razzle-dazzle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Talking of razzle-dazzle, I took part in the Macworld podcast this week, and my colleague Karen Haslam made what I thought was a brilliant suggestion. This year, Apple shouldn’t announce any new features at all. It should do what it did with the launch of Mac OS X Snow Leopard in 2009: a zero-frills stability update. (Or what Snell more sympathetically calls “a clean-up and consolidation phase.”) Fix what’s there instead of cramming in more things to go wrong in turn. Have the courage to be boring but good, instead of zeitgeisty but useless. That would be the right thing to do. But it would be less interesting than soil science.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not that there’s much chance of WWDC 2025 playing out that way. Here’s a far more plausible itinerary:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>10.01: Welcome to WWDC! The iPhone, the iPad, and the Mac are about to change in a big way. Bigger than ever before! Bigger than a house!</li>\n\n\n\n<li>10:02: Look at this graph. Apple Intelligence is the most beloved AI platform in the world! [citation needed]</li>\n\n\n\n<li>10:04: Let’s start with the iPhone. In iOS 19, Siri will be able to read minds, predict the future, and cook boiled eggs exactly the way you like them…</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>And while this is all going on, the assembled devs smile and nod and grind their teeth. They think about all the features announced last year that never arrived and scratch their heads trying to think of a single feature in iOS 18 that delivered any tangible benefit. And then Craig Federighi makes a joke about working for Lumon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I get it, of course. Shareholders demand growth and hype, and Apple feels it has to play ball. So instead of focusing on and actually delivering the features promised last year, it rushes ahead with the next set of features. It’s juggling knives on a treadmill. But I’ve lost my taste for blood.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, WWDC 2025 is going to be a distasteful spectacle. Either Apple admits it got everything wrong, and we have to watch John Giannandrea apologize for 90 minutes before being ceremoniously lowered into a volcano. Or we get plastered-on smiles, yet more promises, and endless boring Apple Intelligence hype. WWDC 2025 is going to be awful. There’s only one question: awful in what way?</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Apple Breakfast logo\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1600w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/apple_breakfast_logo.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Welcome to our weekly Apple Breakfast column, which includes all the Apple news you missed last week in a handy bite-sized roundup.
