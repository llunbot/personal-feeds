The law, which primarily concerns\ntrade embargoes and sanctions, does not even mention tariffs.</p>\n\n<p>But Mr. Trump adopted a novel interpretation of its powers as he\nannounced, and then suspended, high levies on scores of countries\nin April. He also used the law to impose tariffs on products from\nCanada and Mexico in return for what he said was their role in\nsending fentanyl to the United States.</p>\n\n<p>On Wednesday, the Court of International Trade, the primary\nfederal legal body overseeing such matters, found that Mr. Trump’s\ntariffs “exceed any authority granted” to the president by the\nemergency powers law. Ruling in separate cases brought by states\nand businesses, a bipartisan panel of three judges essentially\ndeclared many, but not all, of Mr. Trump’s tariffs to have been\nissued illegally.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Enough with the euphemisms. “Novel interpretation” is shorthand for “bullshit mad-king fantasy stuff”. <a href=\"https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/is-there-a-dignified-legal-way-preferably\">Paul Krugman, on his blog</a> (which he <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2024/11/regarding_and_well_against_substack\">really should</a> move away from Substack):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The thing is, it has been obvious all along that Trump’s use of\nthe 1977 International Economic Emergency Powers Act to justify\nSmoot-Hawley level tariffs was a massive abuse of power. I mean,\nsince when are 4 percent unemployment and 2.5 percent inflation an\nemergency justifying the reversal of 90 years of policy? But I\nguess I just assumed that things like that didn’t matter anymore.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Look past the bluster and Trump <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/28/resistance-is-working\">is getting his kicked left and right</a>. Every organization — universities, law firms, computer makers — that’s been hesitant to just call his nonsense <em>nonsense</em> and his bullshit <em>bullshit</em> should put their big boy pants on and stand up. The whole thing is falling apart. The system might actually still work. But everyone needs to make their choice known: courage or cowardice?</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/05/29/trump-tariffs-illegal\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"ad47aa9a3f2c7e7d3e498aee3a577b3f0d7b192b1acae5e392c732254407a29d","category":"Tech"}
