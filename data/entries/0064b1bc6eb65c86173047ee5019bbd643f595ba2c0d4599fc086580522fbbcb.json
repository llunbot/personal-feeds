The B580 launches on December 13, while the B570 won't be available until January 16.</p>\n<p>The two cards are Intel's first dedicated GPUs based on its next-generation \"Battlemage\" architecture, a successor to the \"Alchemist\" architecture used in the A-series cards. Intel's Core Ultra 200 laptop processors were its first products to ship with Battlemage, though they used an integrated version with fewer of Intel's Xe cores and no dedicated memory. Both B-series GPUs use silicon manufactured on a 5 nm TSMC process, an upgrade from the 6 nm process used for the A-series; as of this writing, no integrated <em>or</em> dedicated Arc GPUs have been manufactured by one of Intel's factories.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/intel-targets-budget-friendly-1440p-gaming-with-249-and-219-arc-b500-gpus/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/intel-targets-budget-friendly-1440p-gaming-with-249-and-219-arc-b500-gpus/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"0064b1bc6eb65c86173047ee5019bbd643f595ba2c0d4599fc086580522fbbcb","category":"Tech"}
