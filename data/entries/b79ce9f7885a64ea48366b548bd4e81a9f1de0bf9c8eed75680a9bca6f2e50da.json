As a testament to this outlook, Nvidia will buy back $25 billion of shares—which happen to be worth triple what they were just before the generative AI craze <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/12/openai-invites-everyone-to-test-new-ai-powered-chatbot-with-amusing-results/\">kicked off</a>.</p>\n<p>\"A new computing era has begun,\" said Huang breathlessly in an Nvidia <a href=\"https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-second-quarter-fiscal-2024\">press release</a> announcing the company's financial results, which include a quarterly revenue of $13.51 billion, up 101 percent from a year ago and 88 percent from the previous quarter. \"Companies worldwide are transitioning from general-purpose to accelerated computing and generative AI.\"</p>\n\n<p>For those just tuning in, Nvidia enjoys what Reuters calls a \"near monopoly\" on hardware that accelerates the training and deployment of neural networks that power today's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/the-generative-ai-revolution-has-begun-how-did-we-get-here/\">generative AI models</a>—and a <a href=\"https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20230530-11692.html\">60-70 percent</a> AI server market share. In particular, its <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/06/nvidias-new-ai-superchip-combines-cpu-and-gpu-to-train-monster-ai-systems/\">data center GPU lines</a> are exceptionally good at performing billions of the matrix multiplications necessary to run neural networks due to their parallel architecture. In this way, hardware architectures that <a href=\"https://ancientelectronics.wordpress.com/2014/01/09/beginners-guide-to-early-3d-computer-graphics/\">originated</a> as video game graphics accelerators now power the generative AI boom.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1962826#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1962826&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"b79ce9f7885a64ea48366b548bd4e81a9f1de0bf9c8eed75680a9bca6f2e50da","category":"Tech"}
