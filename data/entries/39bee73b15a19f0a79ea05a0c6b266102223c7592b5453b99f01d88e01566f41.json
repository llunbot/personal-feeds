But the endless item party officially comes to an end today, with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OatmealDome/status/1661909288426586125\">data miners reporting</a> that the new <a href=\"https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/61936/#v112\">ver. 1.1.2 game update</a> fixes these unintended endless item glitches (you can still stock up your inventory before installing the update, by all accounts).</p>\n<p>While Nintendo lumps this fix under \"several issues [that] have been addressed to improve the gameplay experience,\" I'm reluctant to call this an improvement at all. On the contrary, I think Nintendo should embrace this \"glitch\" and make secret codes for infinite items (and money and health, etc.) an integral, intentional option for players who just want to tinker with the game's amazing creation engine.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1942544#p3\">Read 10 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1942544&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Kyle Orland","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"39bee73b15a19f0a79ea05a0c6b266102223c7592b5453b99f01d88e01566f41","category":"Tech"}
