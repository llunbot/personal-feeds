These documents spread widely online after Teixeira allegedly <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/04/report-discord-admin-who-leaked-military-docs-idd-as-national-guard-airman/\">spent months leaking classified information</a> on a private Discord server. At his first court appearance, Teixeira was not required to enter a plea, but he is due back in court Wednesday, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/massachusetts-air-national-guardsman-accused-leaking-classified-docume-rcna79724\">NBC News reported</a>.</p>\n<p>If he’s eventually found guilty, Teixeira could face up to 10 years in prison for each count, according to an <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23777131-jack-teixeira-affidavit\">affidavit</a> from the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s special agent Patrick M. Lueckenhoff. His affidavit did not detail all the information that the FBI has gathered on Teixeira, but Lueckenhoff said that it shared enough information to demonstrate “sufficient probable cause for Teixeira’s arrest.”</p>\n<p>Since Teixeira’s arrest, many have wondered how the FBI tracked him down. Lueckenhoff’s affidavit provides a timeline for the FBI’s manhunt and confirms that Discord played a major role in his arrest.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1932356#p3\">Read 21 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1932356&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Ashley Belanger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"27470182f4418d03b389d3e80cdd1cad914518f9aa6ee26045c2ab94128cc6e7","category":"Tech"}
