Just because an API exists and some browsers support it does not mean all browsers should support it. I never ever want a website to be able to vibrate my device. <a href=\"https://issues.chromium.org/issues/41187053\">Ever</a>. Nor do I want websites to be able to prompt me with an alert asking for permission to vibrate my device. Not supporting the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/vibration/\">Vibration API</a> is <a href=\"https://blog.lukaszolejnik.com/privacy-of-w3c-vibration-api/\">a feature</a>, not an omission.</p>\n\n<p>If you want web apps to have the same full range of capabilities as native apps, iOS is not the platform for you. PWA advocates treat it as axiomatic that web apps should be peers to native apps, but thatâ€™s not true for everyone. I think of native apps as software I carefully consider before installing, even from the App Store. I think of websites and web apps as software I will visit/run without consideration, <em>because</em> theyâ€™re so comparatively restricted.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/04/16/not-all-web-apis-are-good-apis\">Â â˜…Â </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"728f257cfc2ff5f1fdd4326502f2e24f8e392320c3095007b7abb08d2c9b533c","category":"Tech"}
