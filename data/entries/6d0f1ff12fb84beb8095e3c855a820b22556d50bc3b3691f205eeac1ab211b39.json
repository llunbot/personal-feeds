Use their Video API to build video streaming into your application and make it play beautifully at scale on any device. A Mux stream is just one <code>GET</code> request away from magical-feeling features like automatic thumbnails, animated GIFs, and data-driven encoding decisions. Looking for more insight into your video performance? They’ve got that covered too with data: which viewers are seeing errors or re-buffering, which player or CDN is performing better, and whether or not you should use Mux (trick question, yes).</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/11/20/mux\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"6d0f1ff12fb84beb8095e3c855a820b22556d50bc3b3691f205eeac1ab211b39","category":"Tech"}
