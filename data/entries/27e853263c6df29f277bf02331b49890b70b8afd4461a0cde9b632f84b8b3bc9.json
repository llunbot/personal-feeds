Now that it’s here on all models, including the low-end 16e, many users still limit its use to charging, overlooking the slew of other advantages it offers over Lightning. If you’ve got an iPhone 15 or 16 model, you can expand the USB-C port’s functionality beyond battery fill-ups, and we’ve got a few ideas to share.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. Charge another device</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Rival companies, like Samsung, have long supported reverse wireless charging, letting users turn their smartphones into portable Qi pads. However, it’s not all that practical, forcing users to flip over their phones and rendering both unusable. With the iPhone 15 and newer models, Apple introduced its own version that works via the USB-C port.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your iPhone can now deliver up to 4.5W of power, letting you charge your AirPods, Apple Watch, or even a friend’s Android phone. To do so, simply plug your USB-C cable into the iPhone and the other end into the USB-C port on the other device.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Increase your storage</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even with 128 GB as the standard, we’ve probably all come across the iPhone’s full storage alert. While data stored in iCloud can easily be offloaded from the local memory, not all users trust cloud storage. Fortunately, the iPhone 15 and 16 support a wide range of external storage devices, including USB sticks and hard drives. This makes it easy to free up space by moving large files to a separate drive. To get started, connect a compatible flash drive to your iPhone using its USB-C port. You can then view, manage, and transfer data using the built-in Files app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the solid options out there is this tiny <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Type-CTM-Transfers-Compatible-Waterproof/dp/B09WB2NL8W/\">Samsung Type-C Flash Drive</a>, which supports regular file transfers and real-time ProRes video storage. As a Pro exclusive, those with the highest-end iPhone 15 and 16 models can directly record <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/109041\">ProRes video</a> to a compatible external storage device. Given the considerable size of raw footage, being able to write the data directly onto a separate device can help you shoot for longer periods and avoid filling up your iPhone’s memory.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/iPhone-floating-above-USB-C-cable.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPhone floating above USB C cable\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/iPhone-floating-above-USB-C-cable.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/iPhone-floating-above-USB-C-cable.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/iPhone-floating-above-USB-C-cable.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/iPhone-floating-above-USB-C-cable.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/iPhone-floating-above-USB-C-cable.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/iPhone-floating-above-USB-C-cable.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/iPhone-floating-above-USB-C-cable.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/iPhone-floating-above-USB-C-cable.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Your iPhone’s USB-C cable can do more than just charge your iPhone.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. Connect a keyboard</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While iPads and Macs are better suited for long-form typing, iPhones—especially the near-7-inch Plus and Pro Max models—can still handle productivity tasks effectively. To make the most of the relatively small screen, though, you may want to pair it with a dedicated keyboard. Fortunately, iOS natively supports this through the USB-C port.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most standard keyboards should work with your iPhone just fine. Or if you want to always have a keyboard with you, you can opt for a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2595992/clicks-for-iphone-16-iphone-keyboard-case.html\">Clicks case</a>, which connects to your USB-C port so it’s always ready for a text or email.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4. Amplify your microphone</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the era of TikTok, everyone is a content creator, so a high-quality microphone is an essential tool. Fortunately, your iPhone’s USB-C port can support a wide range of them, letting you pair your footage with crystal-clear high-quality audio. One reliable option is the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/R%C3%98DE-Wireless-Micro-Microphone-Smartphone/dp/B0DFXQDTDT/\">Rode Wireless Micro</a>, which utilizes your iPhone’s port while maintaining the convenience of wireless recording.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5. Add an SD card</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Photographers and videographers love the handy SD card slots on board the newest MacBook Pro and Mac Studio, but that convenience doesn’t extend to the device that does most of your shooting. Fortunately, that can be easily remedied with a wired SD card reader. While newer cameras generally support wireless photo transfers via their respective companion apps, the process tends to be slower than the wired alternative. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-USB-C-SD-Card-Reader/dp/B0D7FSCFPM/\">Apple’s USB-C to SD Card Reader</a> connects to your iPhone through its charging port and should work with all relevant SD cards. You can also use this same dongle with your Mac or iPad when editing on a larger screen.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/studi.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Studio Display\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/studi.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 1500w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/studi.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/studi.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/studi.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/studi.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/studi.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>With the right cable, you can connect your iPhone to any display.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Willis Lai / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>6. Hook up an external display</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re staying at a hotel that blocks wireless media casting, you may be able to mirror your iPhone’s screen to the TV using a wired solution. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-USB-C-Digital-Multiport-Adapter/dp/B0D9MMFQNL/\">Apple’s USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter transforms your iPhone’s charging port into an</a> HDMI connector, allowing you to watch 4K content on bigger displays using a regular HDMI cable.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>7. Plug in a game controller</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to the A17 and A18 chips, the latest Pro-tier iPhones can run some AAA games. Notably, though, these titles typically need a controller, as touch controls don’t always offer the best gameplay if they’re available at all. While <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-USB-C-Digital-Multiport-Adapter/dp/B0D9MMFQNL/\">Sony’s DualSense controller</a> supports Bluetooth pairing, opting for the wired mode using the iPhone’s USB-C port can minimize latency and enhance overall performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>8. Connect to ethernet </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of gaming, the iPhone 15 and 16 models fully support ethernet dongles, allowing for faster download and upload speeds. While Wi-Fi and 5G are sufficient for most users, Ethernet can come in handy when seeking an even more dependable connection. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Belkin-Connect-Ethernet-Adapter-Gigabit/dp/B014FBQ738/\">Belkin’s USB-C to Ethernet Adapter</a> is one of the solid options that is guaranteed to get the job done.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>9. Do it all</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest detriment of the iPhone is that there’s just one port, but a USB hub can give you much more. We recommend the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08NXV94QM\">Plugable 7-in-1 USB-C Hub Multiport Adapter</a>, which will bring a headphone jack, USB-C charging, HDMI, an SD card reader, ethernet, and even a couple of USB-A ports for good measure. It’s not exactly small, but if you need to use several ports at once, there’s no substitute.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/iPhone-16-Pro-Max-USB-C-Charging-Port.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPhone 16 Pro Max USB-C Charging Port\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/iPhone-16-Pro-Max-USB-C-Charging-Port.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/iPhone-16-Pro-Max-USB-C-Charging-Port.jpg?resize=300%2C168&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/iPhone-16-Pro-Max-USB-C-Charging-Port.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/iPhone-16-Pro-Max-USB-C-Charging-Port.jpg?resize=1200%2C675&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/iPhone-16-Pro-Max-USB-C-Charging-Port.jpg?resize=1536%2C864&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/iPhone-16-Pro-Max-USB-C-Charging-Port.jpg?resize=1240%2C697&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/iPhone-16-Pro-Max-USB-C-Charging-Port.jpg?resize=150%2C84&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"675\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>Your iPhone’s USB-C port is a multi-purpose connector for displays, hard drives, and other accessories.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Connor Jewiss / Foundry</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>One port, many possibilities</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While some of these functionalities were previously possible with Lightning iPhones, the shift to USB-C has greatly expanded the port’s capabilities. You can now perform a wide range of desktop-class tasks right from your smartphone, thanks to tethered accessories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the best part is that most USB-C accessories you’ve been using with your iPad or Mac should work with your iPhone 15 or 16—eliminating the need for Lightning-to-USB-C dongles. Whether Apple will introduce new USB-C upgrades with the iPhone 17 remains to be seen.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"27e853263c6df29f277bf02331b49890b70b8afd4461a0cde9b632f84b8b3bc9","category":"Apple"}
