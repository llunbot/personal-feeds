{"title":"Axios: Tim Cook Donates $1 Million to Trump Inauguration","link":"https://www.axios.com/2025/01/03/tim-cook-apple-donate-1-million-trump-inauguration","date":1735943400000,"content":"\n<p>Axios co-founder Mike Allen:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook will personally donate $1 million to\nPresident-elect Trump’s inaugural committee, sources with\nknowledge of the donation tell Axios. [...]</p>\n\n<p>Cook, a proud Alabama native, believes the inauguration is a\ngreat American tradition, and is donating to the inauguration in\nthe spirit of unity, the sources said. The company is not\nexpected to give.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Donald Trump tried to overthrow the legitimate results of the 2020 election to remain in office, and as part of his efforts, inspired a violent mob of insurrectionists to <a href=\"https://celadonbooks.com/book/the-january-6th-report/\">invade the U.S. Capitol and disrupt the peaceful transfer of power</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For that reason alone — there are, of course, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/11/04/vote-to-end-the-trump-era-nyt-editorial-board\">many others</a>, but to me, Trump’s betrayal of U.S. democracy itself remains paramount — this donation is gross and perverse. But I’m not sure it was feasible not to play ball here. In times like this, <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/realpolitik\">realpolitik</a> is the only politics. I wouldn’t have the stomach to make this donation, and those of you disgusted by this likely don’t either. Few people are cut out to be the CEO of a large multinational company like Apple. Sometimes you have to eat the shit sandwich.</p>\n\n<p>It seems pretty obvious that it was Apple/Cook that leaked this to Axios, not Trump’s side, given the eye-roll-inducing “proud American tradition” spin, but more especially the nugget that only Cook personally, not Apple as a company, is contributing. That’s Cook asking for any and all ire to be directed at him, personally, not Apple. Good luck with that.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/03/allen-tim-cook-1m-trump-inauguration\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"a148258b383d72c550a0a7585822dd53cd14fd9f2523c3dafcf83655f9b91027","category":"Tech"}
