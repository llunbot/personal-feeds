It checked all the boxes. Steel, rigid fork, 1 1/8″ headtube, vintage cruiser style, no brake posts/mounts, looptail drops and most important, tire clearance.</p>\n<p>I literally spent years trolling the web trying to find a reasonably priced frame. Early morning, spring 2023 I take a look at marketplace, search for the usual suspects, and a 2007 complete Humuhumu’ appears. I audibly gasped when I saw the listing, and the price. $400 American dollars.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/PXL_20250130_172004662.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/PXL_20250130_172004662.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/PXL_20250130_172004662.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/PXL_20250130_172004662.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/PXL_20250130_172230335.MP_.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/PXL_20250130_172230335.MP_.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/PXL_20250130_172230335.MP_.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/PXL_20250130_172230335.MP_.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>I messaged the seller immediately, and explained that I had a full day of work ahead of me, but I would be there in the evening to buy it. I asked to pay immediately so I knew it would be held, but they said not to worry. I was first, so it was mine. Trouble is we’ve all heard that before. I also realized in my excitement I forgot to see where it was actually located. Just 100 miles south, in Richmond, Virginia.</p>\n<p>Four hours there and back… No-brainer. I finally get to the end of the day and message the seller, get an address and hop in the truck. I arrive well after dark. I knock on the door. A lovely woman, in her 70s, answers and asks “Are you here to buy my bike?”. Yes ma’am I am. I instantly love the fact that it’s hers, and that I never would’ve guessed it.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/PXL_20250130_172043976.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/PXL_20250130_172043976.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/PXL_20250130_172043976.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/PXL_20250130_172043976.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/PXL_20250130_172052411.MP_.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/PXL_20250130_172052411.MP_.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/PXL_20250130_172052411.MP_.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/PXL_20250130_172052411.MP_.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>She proceeds to tell me that she had been bombarded with messages throughout the day and had been offered more than twice her asking price. Yet she waited more than 12 hours for me to show up and honor our deal. Amazing. She led me to the basement, there sat one of the most amazing private collections of vintage steel I’ve seen. Road, touring, mountain, tandem, randonneuring.</p>\n<p>She explained that she and her husband had ridden together their entire marriage, all over the world. He had fallen ill and could no longer ride. If he couldn’t she didn’t want to. So she was beginning to sell them all off. I tried to give her more than we agreed but she wouldn’t take it.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/PXL_20250130_172027680.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/PXL_20250130_172027680.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/PXL_20250130_172027680.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/PXL_20250130_172027680.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/PXL_20250130_172037289.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/PXL_20250130_172037289.jpg?w=400&amp;quality=75 800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/PXL_20250130_172037289.jpg?w=1000&amp;quality=75 1600w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/PXL_20250130_172037289.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>Knowing I was traveling to Charleston, S.C., for vacation soon, I decided to strip the frame and take it to the Atlantic coast for a week of salt and sand. Patina achieved. Just cruised on the stock build for a few months. I knew I could yank the 26×3.0 setup and build up a 27.5+ wheelset so I had to holler at <a href=\"https://www.monebikes.com/store/souped-up-coaster-brake-hub\" target=\"_blank\">Mone Bikes for a Souped Up Coaster Hub</a>. And an aluminum cooler as well, if I may.</p>\n<p>28h adapters for the hub, heavy-duty axle nuts, and that rad brake arm as well. So nice to work with, they’re the best. Got a used pair of DT M1700 hoops for a hundred bucks and ordered a vintage dirt track moto bar. I thought about this build for a long while, and putting my favorite Golden Retriever’s tag on the downtube really tied the room together. RIP Miles 1997-2008, best dog I’ve had. Other than the dropper, the rest of it was in the bin.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/PXL_20250130_171924808.MP2_.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/PXL_20250130_171924808.MP2_.jpg?w=650&amp;quality=75 640w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/PXL_20250130_171924808.MP2_.jpg?w=1400&amp;quality=75 1800w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2025/01/PXL_20250130_171924808.MP2_.jpg?w=2000&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Specs:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>2007 Kona Humuhumu’ Medium</li>\n<li>Chris King headset</li>\n<li>Johnson BMX stem</li>\n<li>Silver Dollar headset cap</li>\n<li>AME grips w/ donuts</li>\n<li>Vintage moto bar</li>\n<li>Syncros Ti bottom bracket</li>\n<li>Cook Bros Dogbones 177mm</li>\n<li>TA Specialties Zephyr 33t chainring 110 BCD</li>\n<li>5DEV Trail/Enduro pedals</li>\n<li>KS EXA Form dropper post</li>\n<li>Velo saddle</li>\n<li>Kona seatpost clamp</li>\n<li>KMC 10 speed chain</li>\n<li>Campagnolo Record High Flange front hub.</li>\n<li>Vintage WTB skewer</li>\n<li>Mone Bikes Souped Up Coaster Hub 18t</li>\n<li>DT Swiss MT1700 hoops</li>\n<li>DT Swiss Competition spokes w/ ProLoc brass nipples</li>\n<li>Maxxis Prototype Tire 27.5×2.8 front and rear</li>\n</ul>\n<p> </p>\n<hr />\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>We’d like to thank all of you who <a href=\"mailto:readersrides@theradavist.com\" target=\"_blank\">submitted Readers Rides</a> builds to be shared here at The Radavist.
