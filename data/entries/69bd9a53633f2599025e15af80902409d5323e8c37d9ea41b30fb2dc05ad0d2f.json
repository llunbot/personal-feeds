Military officials believe one way to guard against this would be to have the capability to rapidly replace those satellitesâ€”whether they're for spying, communications, or other purposes.</p>\n<p>The US Space Force took a step toward this goal two years ago with a mission called Tactically Responsive Launch-2, or TacRL-2. This small satellite was built in less than a year by taking existing components and putting them together to create a space domain awareness satellite. The mission was then launched within 21 days, on June 13, 2021, by a solid-fueled Pegasus rocket built by Northrop Grumman.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1968617#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1968617&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Eric Berger","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"69bd9a53633f2599025e15af80902409d5323e8c37d9ea41b30fb2dc05ad0d2f","category":"Tech"}
