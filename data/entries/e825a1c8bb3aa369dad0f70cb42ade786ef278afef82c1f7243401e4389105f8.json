Their symmetric 25 or 30mm carbon XRC rim shape itself hadn’t changed in even longer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, DT were ahead of their time, with Nino Schurter dominating the XCO World Cup &amp; World Championships on 30mm internal carbon XMC wheels as far back as <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/xc-pro-bike-update-deja-vu-world-cup-winning-world-champ-nino-schurters-scott-spark-rc/\" target=\"_blank\">2017</a>, <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/xc-world-champ-custom-prototype-equipped-scott-spark-rc-for-nino-schurters-7th-win/\" target=\"_blank\">2018</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/pro-bike-check-nino-schurter-kate-courtneys-new-2019-scott-spark-rc-race-bikes/\">2019</a>.

And of course, we can infer a lot more from these photos. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>First off, the name stays the same. The top-tier carbon cross-country race wheelset is still called the DT Swiss XRC 1200 Spline.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>New asymmetric carbon rim</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Unreleased-DT-Swiss-XRC-1200-Spline-lightweight-carbon-XC-mountain-bike-wheels_photo-by-Markus-Greber-for-Canyon-Sidi_new-asymmetric-rim-detail.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1013\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Unreleased-DT-Swiss-XRC-1200-Spline-lightweight-carbon-XC-mountain-bike-wheels_photo-by-Markus-Greber-for-Canyon-Sidi_new-asymmetric-rim-detail.jpg\" alt=\"Unreleased DT Swiss XRC 1200 Spline lightweight carbon XC mountain bike wheels, rim detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Unreleased-DT-Swiss-XRC-1200-Spline-lightweight-carbon-XC-mountain-bike-wheels_photo-by-Markus-Greber-for-Canyon-Sidi_new-asymmetric-rim-detail.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Unreleased-DT-Swiss-XRC-1200-Spline-lightweight-carbon-XC-mountain-bike-wheels_photo-by-Markus-Greber-for-Canyon-Sidi_new-asymmetric-rim-detail-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Unreleased-DT-Swiss-XRC-1200-Spline-lightweight-carbon-XC-mountain-bike-wheels_photo-by-Markus-Greber-for-Canyon-Sidi_new-asymmetric-rim-detail-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Unreleased-DT-Swiss-XRC-1200-Spline-lightweight-carbon-XC-mountain-bike-wheels_photo-by-Markus-Greber-for-Canyon-Sidi_new-asymmetric-rim-detail-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Unreleased-DT-Swiss-XRC-1200-Spline-lightweight-carbon-XC-mountain-bike-wheels_photo-by-Markus-Greber-for-Canyon-Sidi_new-asymmetric-rim-detail-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Unreleased-DT-Swiss-XRC-1200-Spline-lightweight-carbon-XC-mountain-bike-wheels_photo-by-Markus-Greber-for-Canyon-Sidi_new-asymmetric-rim-detail-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Unreleased-DT-Swiss-XRC-1200-Spline-lightweight-carbon-XC-mountain-bike-wheels_photo-by-Markus-Greber-for-Canyon-Sidi_new-asymmetric-rim-detail-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Canyon’s website says new wheels feature a 20mm deep x 30mm internal hookless tubeless carbon rim. That compares to the current 25mm deep XRC that is offered with 25mm or 30mm internal widths, for both 27.5 or 29″ wheels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These new XRC 1200 wheels also have saved some weight. Canyon claims they weigh just 1311g for the pair (597g front, 714g rear). That’s down 11.4% or a savings of 169g compared to the same 30mm width of the current 1480g 29er XRCs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We haven’t received any technical details from DT Swiss, but we can see a new asymmetric rim profile. The spokes on this rear wheel appear to hit the center of the nose of the rim profile, slightly offset to the disc brake side, with a wider nose back towards the center at the valve. Presumably, the same thing happens on the front in the opposite direction in order to balance spoke tension on both wheels.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>New straight-pull Spline hubs, too</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Unreleased-DT-Swiss-XRC-1200-Spline-lightweight-carbon-XC-mountain-bike-wheels_photo-by-Markus-Greber-for-Canyon-Sidi_new-front-hub.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Unreleased-DT-Swiss-XRC-1200-Spline-lightweight-carbon-XC-mountain-bike-wheels_photo-by-Markus-Greber-for-Canyon-Sidi_new-front-hub.jpg\" alt=\"Unreleased DT Swiss XRC 1200 Spline lightweight carbon XC mountain bike wheels, hub detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Unreleased-DT-Swiss-XRC-1200-Spline-lightweight-carbon-XC-mountain-bike-wheels_photo-by-Markus-Greber-for-Canyon-Sidi_new-front-hub.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Unreleased-DT-Swiss-XRC-1200-Spline-lightweight-carbon-XC-mountain-bike-wheels_photo-by-Markus-Greber-for-Canyon-Sidi_new-front-hub-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Unreleased-DT-Swiss-XRC-1200-Spline-lightweight-carbon-XC-mountain-bike-wheels_photo-by-Markus-Greber-for-Canyon-Sidi_new-front-hub-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Unreleased-DT-Swiss-XRC-1200-Spline-lightweight-carbon-XC-mountain-bike-wheels_photo-by-Markus-Greber-for-Canyon-Sidi_new-front-hub-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Unreleased-DT-Swiss-XRC-1200-Spline-lightweight-carbon-XC-mountain-bike-wheels_photo-by-Markus-Greber-for-Canyon-Sidi_new-front-hub-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Unreleased-DT-Swiss-XRC-1200-Spline-lightweight-carbon-XC-mountain-bike-wheels_photo-by-Markus-Greber-for-Canyon-Sidi_new-front-hub-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Unreleased-DT-Swiss-XRC-1200-Spline-lightweight-carbon-XC-mountain-bike-wheels_photo-by-Markus-Greber-for-Canyon-Sidi_new-front-hub-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Canyon-Sidi sneak peek also gives us an up-close look at a new front hub shell too. The driveside looks like the existing straight-pull Spline hub from the current DT wheels. But the disc side now expands back to a higher flange, presumably to increase stiffness next to the input of braking forces? The hub also now slightly tapers into the center, vs. the cylindrical hubshell of the existing XRC 1200 front hub. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s no direct mention of it, but typically the 1200-level in DT naming means a 180 hubshell.
