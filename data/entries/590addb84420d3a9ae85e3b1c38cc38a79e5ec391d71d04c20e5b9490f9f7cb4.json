Better yet, you’ll also win a pair of Boyd Cycling Jocassee wheels, a Time ADHX 45 frameset, and a pair of IRC Doublecross tires to race on. It’s not quite a complete bike, but it looks like one heck of a starting point. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second and third place still go home with a set of Boyd wheels and IRC tires too, though only the grand prize winner gets the free UNBOUND entry. The contest starts today and runs until January 22nd, 2024, at 11:59 PM EST. You can enter though the link below. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://boydcycling.com/pages/unbound-dream-giveaway\" target=\"_blank\"><em>boydcycling.com</em></a></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/free-unbound-entry-dream-giveaway-from-boyd-cycling-time-bicycles-irc-tires/\">Skip the UNBOUND Lottery with Dream Giveaway from Boyd Cycling, Time Bicycles &amp; IRC Tires</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Zach Overholt","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"590addb84420d3a9ae85e3b1c38cc38a79e5ec391d71d04c20e5b9490f9f7cb4","category":"Cycling"}
