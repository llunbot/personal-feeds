Well, not anymore, because Amazon’s Woot is selling a variety of normally-$99 Solo Loop models in all sorts of colors and sizes for up to 70 percent off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Numerous colors are available, from black and white to blues, reds, yellows, green, and purple, and the gorgeous Pride edition in both regular ($30) and braided versions ($20). Just note, that you’ll need to measure your wrist to select the size you need. Since these bands are not adjustable, there are 12 sizes to pick from, and the wrong one won’t fit right. Depending on the shade you choose, not all may be available:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://electronics.woot.com/offers/apple-watch-braided-solo-loop-black-white-hues\">Apple Watch Braided Solo Loop – Black &amp; White Hues</a> – $30, was $99</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://electronics.woot.com/offers/apple-watch-braided-solo-loop-blue-hues\">Apple Watch Braided Solo Loop – Blue Hues</a> – $30, was $99</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://electronics.woot.com/offers/apple-watch-solo-loop-black-white-hues\">Apple Watch Solo Loop – Black &amp; White Hues</a> – $20, was $49</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://electronics.woot.com/offers/apple-watch-braided-solo-loop-red-orange-yellow-hues\">Apple Watch Braided Solo Loop – Red, Orange, Yellow</a> – $30, was $99</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://electronics.woot.com/offers/apple-watch-braided-solo-loop-pride-edition\">Apple Watch Braided Solo Loop – Pride Edition</a> – $30, was $99</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://electronics.woot.com/offers/apple-watch-solo-loop-blue-hues\">Apple Watch Solo Loop – Blue Hues</a> – $20, was $49</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://electronics.woot.com/offers/apple-watch-solo-loop-red-orange-yellow-hues\">Apple Watch Solo Loop – Red, Orange, Yellow Hues</a> – $20, was $60</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://electronics.woot.com/offers/apple-watch-braided-solo-loop-green-hues\">Apple Watch Braided Solo Loop – Green Hues</a> – $30, was $99</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://electronics.woot.com/offers/apple-watch-braided-solo-loop-purple-hues\">Apple Watch Braided Solo Loop – Purple Hues</a> – $30, was $99</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://electronics.woot.com/offers/apple-watch-solo-loop-green-hues\">Apple Watch Solo Loop – Green Hues</a> – $20, was $49</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://electronics.woot.com/offers/apple-watch-solo-loop-purple-hues\">Apple Watch Solo Loop – Purple Hues</a> – $20, was $49</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You also need to choose the Apple Watch size you need the band for. The smaller model will fit 38mm, 40mm, 41mm, and 42mm watches, while the larger one will work with 44mm, 45mm, 46mm, and 49mm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the price already going down from $100 to $30, you probably have a bit of wiggle room to buy several. Well, if you do, Woot provides a code <strong>APPLEBANDS</strong> for an extra 15 percent off for purchases above $39.  The code is only available through November 8, so hurry up and place your order.</p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"aaa9c17a0435fd430a13d7cae001b83e8001c5c8c4c0d657de1312b9ad14a577","category":"Apple"}
