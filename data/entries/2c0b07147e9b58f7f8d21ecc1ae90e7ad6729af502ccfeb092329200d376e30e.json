Cook aimed to maintain a relationship with Trump during Trump's first term as president, and it appears Cook plans to continue on with that plan going forward.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSources that spoke to <em>Axios</em> said that Cook is donating to the inauguration \"in the spirit of unity.\" Apple is not expected to make a donation.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nTrump is taking office as Apple faces regulatory pressure both in the United States and in other countries.

The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-vs-doj/\">Apple vs. DoJ</a> legal battle will play out during Trump's term.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAmazon, Meta, Uber, OpenAI's Sam Altman, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Coinbase, Toyota, Ford, GM, AT&amp;T, Black &amp; Decker, and Charter Communications are also making donations to Trump's inauguration fund.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/tim-cook/\">Tim Cook</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/03/tim-cook-trump-inauguration-donation/\">Apple CEO Tim Cook Donating $1 Million to Trump's Inaugural Fund</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-ceo-tim-cook-donating-1-million-to-trumps-inaugural-fund.2446658/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"2c0b07147e9b58f7f8d21ecc1ae90e7ad6729af502ccfeb092329200d376e30e","category":"Apple"}
