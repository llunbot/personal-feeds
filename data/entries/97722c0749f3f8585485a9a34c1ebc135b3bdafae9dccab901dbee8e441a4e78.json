At first, Google's operating system started showing up in new vehicles as custom installations, but more recently the company developed <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/05/android-automotive-os-review-under-the-hood-with-googles-car-os/\">Android Automotive</a>, which you can find in new cars from General Motors, Polestar, Volvo, Honda, and soon, both BMW and Volkswagen Group.</p>\n<p>A perennial question that has accompanied the spread of Android Automotive has been the question of support. A car has a much longer expected service life than a smartphone, especially an Android smartphone, and with infotainment systems so integral to a car's operations now, how long can we reasonably expect those infotainment systems to be supported?</p>\n<p>So far, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/01/the-fairphone-2-will-hit-end-of-life-after-7-years-of-updates/\">a bit more than seven years</a> is the longest any Android phone has received support, before <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/the-fairphone-2-hits-five-years-of-updates-with-some-help-from-lineageos/\">unsupported chips finally called time on the Fairphone</a>. I'm not sure anyone would be OK with having their car sent to the scrap heap after just seven years, however.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1925990#p3\">Read 11 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1925990&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Jonathan M.
