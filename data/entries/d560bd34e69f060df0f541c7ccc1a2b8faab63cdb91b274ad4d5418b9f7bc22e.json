Streaming services debut, <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/warner-bros-discovery-will-launch-new-max-streaming-service-may-23/\">combine, and rebrand</a> constantly, and the streaming wars have never been hotter. Yet, the original streaming king remains on top when it comes to eyeballs on the screen. As <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-04-23/these-are-the-most-popular-tv-shows-on-the-internet\">Bloomberg</a> calculated via Nielsen data this week, <a href=\"https://fave.co/3H9H7pI\" target=\"_blank\">Netflix</a> accounts for 70–80 percent of the 10 most-watched TV shows in the US weekly.</p>\n<p>On Sunday, Bloomberg shared a detailed and handily interactive breakdown of streaming data accumulated from Nielsen and third-party analyst firms Antenna and Parrot. Critically, though, the report lacks data on what shows are driving <a href=\"https://fave.co/3NaCrDL\" target=\"_blank\">Paramount+</a>, since \"it's the only major streaming service that doesn’t participate in the Nielsen charts\" and Prime Video, since Nielsen doesn’t include viewership on third-party services.</p>\n<p>Having launched in March 2021, Paramount+ is relatively new, but Antenna reports it acquired more new subscribers (7.6 million) from January to March 2023 than other streaming services recorded (Prime Video isn't included). However, \"about 7 percent of the people who pay for Paramount+ cancel every month,\" Bloomberg said. Still, the streaming service with the second most subscriber gains during this period (HBO Max) was behind 26.3 percent. Paramount+ may be an interesting service to keep track of as the battle for subscribers continues.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1933876#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1933876&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"d560bd34e69f060df0f541c7ccc1a2b8faab63cdb91b274ad4d5418b9f7bc22e","category":"Tech"}
