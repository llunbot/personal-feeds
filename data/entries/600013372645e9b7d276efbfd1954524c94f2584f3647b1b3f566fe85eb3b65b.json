Starting and ending at <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/districtbicycles/\" target=\"_blank\">District Bicycles</a> in Stillwater, the 300-mile loop is comprised of the outer perimeter of every Mid South course over the past 13 years, traversing the tribal land of the Quapaw, Kiowa, Osage, Kickapoo, Pawnee, Iowa, and Wichita Nations. It goes through every small city the Mid South has ever gone through: Guthrie, Perry, Pawnee and more. The event was free, there was no registration cap, no time limits. Register online, get to the Grand Depart, roll your bike up to the line, and go. And on September 18th, 110 people did just that.</p>\n<p><img width=\"2400\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mega_Mid_South_Mathy-36.jpg?fit=1200,1200&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mega_Mid_South_Mathy-36.jpg?w=2400&amp;quality=75 2400w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mega_Mid_South_Mathy-36.jpg?resize=1200,600&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mega_Mid_South_Mathy-36.jpg?resize=2000,1000&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mega_Mid_South_Mathy-36.jpg?resize=768,384&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mega_Mid_South_Mathy-36.jpg?resize=1536,768&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mega_Mid_South_Mathy-36.jpg?resize=2048,1024&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p><em>Friends, family members and race supporters wait for riders to arrive in Stillwater, OK during a thunderstorm the evening of October 19th.</em></p>\n<p>They rode into weather that featured daily 95º to 105ºF heat and 50 – 70% humidity. The fastest racer, Justin Cary of Texas, brought it in at an astounding 23 hours and 55 minutes.

But is it too late? Have we gone past the point where love letters matter? Has our politics and the influence of social media made them a moot point?</p>\n<p>2024 has been an intense, contentious year in the world at large and in Oklahoma, specifically. Non-binary youth Nex Benedict was savagely beaten by their classmates and their subsequent death from injuries was labeled a suicide. State Senator Tom Woods called LGBTQ+ Oklahomans “filth” who needed to be kept out “because we’re a Christian state.” In June Oklahoma’s state superintendent of schools, Ryan Walters, directed all public schools to teach the Bible, including the Ten Commandments, as part of their curriculum.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2400\" height=\"1098\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mega_Mid_South_Mathy-5.jpg?fit=1200,1098&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mega_Mid_South_Mathy-5.jpg?w=2400&amp;quality=75 2400w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mega_Mid_South_Mathy-5.jpg?resize=1200,549&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mega_Mid_South_Mathy-5.jpg?resize=2000,915&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mega_Mid_South_Mathy-5.jpg?resize=768,351&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mega_Mid_South_Mathy-5.jpg?resize=1536,703&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mega_Mid_South_Mathy-5.jpg?resize=2048,937&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p><em>Cushing, OK is the center of a huge number of oil pipelines and has a maximum storage capacity of 98 million barrels of oil. This makes it the holder of nearly 15% of all oil in America at any given time.</em></p>\n<p>So I went out to Oklahoma to experience Bobby’s love letter for myself, while also asking others what it is that they loved about not just Oklahoma but all of the people in it, regardless of politics, gender identity or race. I asked them to write a love letter of their own, if you will. But perhaps the most beautiful love letter for Oklahoma that I received isn’t a letter at all. It’s a poem, written by Arial Ross.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2400\" height=\"1109\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mega_Mid_South_Mathy-72.jpg?fit=1200,1109&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mega_Mid_South_Mathy-72.jpg?w=2400&amp;quality=75 2400w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mega_Mid_South_Mathy-72.jpg?resize=1200,555&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mega_Mid_South_Mathy-72.jpg?resize=2000,924&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mega_Mid_South_Mathy-72.jpg?resize=768,355&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mega_Mid_South_Mathy-72.jpg?resize=1536,710&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mega_Mid_South_Mathy-72.jpg?resize=2048,946&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p><em>“The particular beauty of Oklahoma is not really the beauty that as a nation we recognize. There is no national park in Oklahoma. As a country, we prioritize other types of natural beauty like canyons and mountains. The physical beauty of Oklahoma is more subtle and it takes longer to see and appreciate.” —Dr. Arial Ross, Professor of Comparative Literature, Oklahoma State University, Stillwater, OK.</em></p>\n<p>Dr. Ross is a professor of comparative literature at Oklahoma State University. Originally from Colorado, she moved to Stillwater, Oklahoma with her husband Seth and then-3 year old son, Mark. She didn’t expect to stay in Stillwater for long. Over the years her love for Oklahoma has quietly grown. “I’ve thought a lot about what is the particular beauty of the Oklahoma landscape. The physical beauty of Oklahoma is more subtle and it takes longer to see and appreciate. I think the people in Oklahoma have been shaped by that. We know what we have here, but we recognize that nobody else does or that it takes a lot to recognize. So I think a love letter to Oklahoma just involves time. You can’t actually see what there is to love about Oklahoma immediately. You have to be patient. You have to stay here for a while. You have to be willing to see it, to adjust your eyes and your heart to be able to love Oklahoma.”</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2400\" height=\"1128\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mega_Mid_South_Mathy-23.jpg?fit=1200,1128&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mega_Mid_South_Mathy-23.jpg?w=2400&amp;quality=75 2400w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mega_Mid_South_Mathy-23.jpg?resize=1200,564&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mega_Mid_South_Mathy-23.jpg?resize=2000,940&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mega_Mid_South_Mathy-23.jpg?resize=768,361&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mega_Mid_South_Mathy-23.jpg?resize=1536,722&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mega_Mid_South_Mathy-23.jpg?resize=2048,963&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p><em>A lone Mega Mid South rider travels the red dirt roads the morning of October 20th, the third day of the race.</em></p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>The Meeting Tree, By Dr. Arial Ross</h3>\n<p>There’s so much dirt here –<br />\nbut look what we’ve done with it.<br />\nIt sifted under the door sill, so we opened<br />\nwide, and invited the dirt in, said<br />\nthis is a house of dirt now.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2400\" height=\"1102\" src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mega_Mid_South_Mathy-4.jpg?fit=1200,1102&amp;quality=75\" srcset=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mega_Mid_South_Mathy-4.jpg?w=2400&amp;quality=75 2400w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mega_Mid_South_Mathy-4.jpg?resize=1200,551&amp;quality=75 1200w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mega_Mid_South_Mathy-4.jpg?resize=2000,918&amp;quality=75 2000w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mega_Mid_South_Mathy-4.jpg?resize=768,353&amp;quality=75 768w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mega_Mid_South_Mathy-4.jpg?resize=1536,705&amp;quality=75 1536w, https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2024/09/2024_Mega_Mid_South_Mathy-4.jpg?resize=2048,940&amp;quality=75 2048w\" /></p>\n<p><em>“The people that I encounter I think are kind, nice and thoughtful.

I’ve come more and more convinced that if we ignore the politicians and their identity politics, talking points and wedge issues, we will find that we have infinitely more in common than we don’t. Or, in short, love letters like Bobby’s do matter.</p>\n<p>They matter more than I think even Bobby himself realizes. This is also the home ground of gravel cycling. It’s not in the recent pro-ification of the “sport” or money chasing moves by UCI, USA Cycling, and a small number of race promoters. It’s right there in places like Stillwater, Perry, Guthrie and Morris, OK where cyclists of all identities from all over the place meet strangers, have conversations while giving and receiving small acts of kindness. Ignore the clickbait headlines, all of them, and go ride your bike in new places while meeting new people. You and they will both be the better for it.</p>\n<p><em>About the photographs, from the author:</em></p>\n<p><em>All images (save for a few, the photo nerds in the crowd will be able to tell) in the body of this piece were taken with a 4 x 5” ultra wide camera body that I made myself which can take multiple formats and lenses. For this project I used a 6 x 12 cm, 120 format film back. Panoramic imagery suits Oklahoma’s landscapes so well, and makes for a challenging approach to portraits that I really wanted to try to tackle. While I am known for handmade camera lenses, this time I used commercially made Mamiya 75mm f/5.6 and Graflex 90mm f/11 lenses.
