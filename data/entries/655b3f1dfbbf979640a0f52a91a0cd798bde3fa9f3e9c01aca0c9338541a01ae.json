But the cheers were short-lived as critics quickly noticed that Lilly also quietly raised the price on current versions of the drug—a move that was notably missing from the company's press release this week.</p>\n<p>In the past, Lilly sold Zepbound only in injectable pens with a list price of $1,060 for a month's supply. Several dosages are available—2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 12.5 mg, or 15 mg—and patients progressively increase their dosage until they reach a maintenance dosage. The recommended maintenance dosages are 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg. The higher the dose, the more the weight loss. For instance, people using the 15 mg doses lost an average of <a href=\"https://zepbound.lilly.com/what-is-zepbound\">21 percent of their weight</a> over 17 months in a clinical trial, while those on 5 mg doses only lost an average of 15 percent of their weight.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, Lilly announced that it will now sell Zepbound in vials, too. And a month's supply of vials with the 2.5 mg doses will cost $399, while a month's supply of 5 mg doses is priced at $549—a welcome drop from the $1,060 price tag. These prices are for a self-pay option, meaning that patients with a valid, on-label prescription can buy them directly from Lilly if they have no insurance or have insurance that does not cover the drug.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046139#p3\">Read 7 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2046139&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Beth Mole","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"655b3f1dfbbf979640a0f52a91a0cd798bde3fa9f3e9c01aca0c9338541a01ae","category":"Tech"}
