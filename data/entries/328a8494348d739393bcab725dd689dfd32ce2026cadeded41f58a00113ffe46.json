For the first time, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSVCVXZF?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">the Apple Watch Ultra 2 is available for $719 at Amazon</a>, making it the perfect moment for adventure fans to grab the smartwatch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Apple Watch Ultra 2 is designed for endurance, making it ideal for athletes, outdoor adventurers, and water sports enthusiasts. First of all, it features a rugged 49mm corrosion-resistant titanium case. There’s also Apple’s classic Digital Crown as well as a customizable Action button for instant control over various functions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the standout features is the superbright Always-On Retina display. The screen is large and bright enough (up to 3000 nits) that you’ll be able to see what’s written on it even in direct sunlight—no more squinting! And you’ll get Apple’s newest S9 chip with the first-ever Neural Engine on an Apple Watch, as well as an array of sensors including heart-rate, ECG, and temperature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The battery life is also worth mentioning because it can “survive” for up to 36 hours, or twice that if you set it in low power mode. The smartwatch keeps track of the user’s location via GPS, providing accurate information about distances and routes taken. The Compass app will even offer extra details like elevation, incline, longitude, and latitude.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever reason you have to have set your eyes on the Apple Watch Ultra 2, the $80 discount should move to the top of your list, so grab one and get ready for all of your summer outdoor adventures.</p>\n\n\n<span>Get the Apple Watch Ultra 2 for $719</span><div><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSVCVXZF?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">View deal</a></div>\nSmartwatches</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"328a8494348d739393bcab725dd689dfd32ce2026cadeded41f58a00113ffe46","category":"Apple"}
