We are also introducing autocorrect which seamlessly\nfixes common typing mistakes as you type.</p>\n\n<p>Getting started with spellcheck in Notepad is easy as misspelled\nwords are automatically underlined in red. To fix a spelling\nmistake, click, tap, or use the keyboard shortcut Shift + F10 on\nthe misspelled word to see suggested spellings. Selecting a\nsuggestion immediately updates the word. You can also choose to\nignore words in a single document or add them to the dictionary,\nso they are not flagged as a mistake again. Spellcheck in Notepad\nsupports multiple languages.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Better late than never, but it’s kind of wild that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Notepad\">Notepad is 41 years old</a> and only getting these features now. I haven’t used a single Mac app that doesn’t offer the system’s built-in spellchecking for over 20 years.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/07/09/notepad-spellcheck\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"56f6fb012b69b6c12efa536672d82cb0207a6e4c523895d47e708145cb6d3eb7","category":"Tech"}
