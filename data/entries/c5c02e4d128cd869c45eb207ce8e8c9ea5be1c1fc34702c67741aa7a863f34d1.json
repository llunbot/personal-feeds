If any of those problems sound familiar, we’ve got you covered.</p>\n<p>Even if our advice is helpful, it still doesn’t change the fact that bike genres have been multiplying as rapidly as a colony of wild rabbits.</p>\n<p>This amount of choice certainly fuels opinion here at BikeRadar, and our tech gurus Robin Weaver, Tom Law and Alex Evans got together to chime in with their takes.</p>\n<h2>Alex Evans: Which came first, rider needs or bikes we didn’t know we wanted?</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Norco Range C1 high pivot trail mountain bike ridden by male mountain bike tester Alex Evans on a trail called Too Hard For EWS in Scotland's Tweed Valley in the UK.\" title=\"Norco Range C1 high pivot enduro mountain bike-30\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Norco’s high-pivot Range is a surprisingly versatile bike.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Ian Linton / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Some would argue the evolution of mountain biking has created the space and need for plenty of terrain- and rider-specific genres of bike.</p>\n<p>Others would state categorically this raft of choice is industry-driven.

My <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-downhill-mountain-bikes/\">downhill bike</a> took me on missions over field, mountain and doubletrack, amassing more miles than its gravity-focused form really should have allowed.</p>\n<p>My desecration of bike genres was driven through necessity rather than desire. After all, how was I supposed to enjoy the multiple pleasures of cycling’s different disciplines (even back then) on the limited number of bikes a Saturday job salary could afford?

And maybe that answers the cycling discipline diversification chicken and egg conundrum.</p>\n<p>It certainly seems – to me at least – that rider demand has driven evolution, and the industry has responded dutifully to our desires. Clearly, in this example, the discipline chicken came way before the bike-type egg.</p>\n<p>Because of that, we no longer have to go through the pain of taking inappropriate bikes on very niche rides.</p>\n<p>I’m excited to see what the future of mountain biking looks like – driven by all our weird, wonderful and very specific needs.</p>\n<h2>Tom Law: Bikes are versatile, so why do we need more niches?</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Trail Bike of the Year 2023 top three\" title=\"Trail Bike of the Year 2023 top three\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Even in one genre, such as trail bikes, there are so many different shapes and sizes.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Olly Bowman / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Ever slide into your favourite restaurant, sit down, peruse the menu and have so much choice you don’t know where to start?

So you think about a trail bike and get the same conclusion but skewed slightly more the other way.</p>\n<p>Then you consider downcountry bikes. But if you have a downcountry bike, you might want a downhill bike for bike-park days.</p>\n<p>That journey can go round and round in circles.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Tom's Transition Spur downcountry bike\" title=\"09-33-58_SNY0021\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> It’s perhaps the most hotly debated new sub-genre, but downcountry bikes are a lot of fun.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Steve Sayers / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>And that’s where I stand on the diversification of bike genres and niches.</p>\n<p>Modern bikes are so good.

Pigeon-holing things can make life far simpler. Create categories and slot each bike into the most applicable one. It’s neat and tidy, and I can see the appeal.</p>\n<p>But placing these theoretical constraints on bikes can be confusing and maybe even limiting.</p>\n<p>Don’t get me wrong, there’s a reason we call a downhill bike a downhill bike – it’s designed for one job and one job only. The same can be said for an all-out cross-country rig.</p>\n<p>Between these two category extremes, though, how we define a bike is a little more complex and open to interpretation.</p>\n<p>When I was growing up and racing downhill, things were simple. I had a downhill bike for racing and a jump bike with a long enough seatpost and gears that I could use it for cross-country riding.</p>\n<p>When I say cross-country riding, that included pedalling along singletrack, ripping turns in the woods and even heading to the dirt jumps (which, confusingly, we referred to as ‘the trails’).</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Merida One-Sixty 6000 full suspension mountain bike\" title=\"Merida One-Sixty 6000 - Ride shot 2\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Fancy riding XC on your enduro bike? Increased performance means you can, even if it might be slightly slower than on a dedicated XC rig.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Olly Bowman / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>The void between downhill and cross-country has been filled since then.</p>\n<p>We’re now at a point where we have downcountry bikes (burly cross-country bikes… or maybe lightweight trail bikes?), trail bikes, enduro bikes (bigger trail bikes), all-mountain bikes (these are the same as trail bikes… I think) and super-enduro bikes (even bigger trail bikes).</p>\n<p>For a newbie, I can see how this is confusing, especially if you’re not even bothered about racing. What sort of bike do you need for just ‘mountain biking’? And will it do everything you want it to?</p>\n<p>For the most part, it’s the amount of <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/how-much-suspension-travel-do-i-need-on-my-mountain-bike/\">suspension travel</a> and geometry that defines which category a bike falls into (more or less). However, I feel, in this day and age, it shouldn’t be the overriding factor or put limits (within reason) on the riding you’ll do on any of these bikes.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Nukeproof Mega 297 Carbon Elite full suspension mountain bike\" title=\"Nukeproof Mega 297 Carbon Elite - Ride shot 7\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Enduro bikes are nearly as capable as DH bikes, and you can still pedal back to the top of the trails on them.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Olly Bowman / Our Media</i></span></div>\n<p>Yes, some bikes will naturally lend themselves to certain types of riding better than others. But if you’re not racing, looking to optimise performance or make all the gains possible, there’s no reason why you can’t take your enduro bike on an all-day trail epic or slither down some technical descents on your short-travel downcountry machine.</p>\n<p>They might not be suited perfectly to these types of rides, but the bikes on offer are more than capable and will likely fare better than you might have been led to believe.</p>\n<p>My point here is bikes are so good now, the categories given to them aren’t the be-all and end-all of what you can do on them. Use these categories as a guideline but don’t be afraid to slide along that category spectrum, riding whatever takes your fancy.</p>","author":"Alex Evans","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"c5c02e4d128cd869c45eb207ce8e8c9ea5be1c1fc34702c67741aa7a863f34d1","category":"Cycling"}
