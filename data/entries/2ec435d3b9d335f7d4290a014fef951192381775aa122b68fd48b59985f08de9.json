This comprises of the ‘Active Debris Remover’ and ‘Alpha Disc’ two-piece construction.</p>\n<p>CeramicSpeed’s OSPW systems are relatively common on pro-level WorldTour road bikes, but less so on high-end mountain bikes. Oversized pulley wheel systems are typically accompanied by claims of reduced drivetrain friction and, as a result, improved efficiency.</p>\n<p>Here, however, CeramicSpeed has taken an oversized system and focused on “the robustness that the Eagle Transmission group is celebrated for”.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"CeramicSpeed OSPW X for SRAM Eagle Transmission\" title=\"CeramicSpeed OSPW X for SRAM Eagle Transmission\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> CeramicSpeed has launched OSPW X for SRAM Eagle Transmission drivetrains.</span></figcaption><span> <i>CeramicSpeed</i></span></div>\n<p>The ‘Active Debris Remover’ encloses the bearing, according to CeramicSpeed, with a “new dust cover design that sits safely anchored in a groove in the pulley wheel. This is paired with a bladed groove structure that surrounds the dust cover, which dynamically extracts debris from the pulley wheel when it’s rotating”.</p>\n<p>CeramicSpeed says a prototype version was tested at this year’s Cape Epic XC marathon race.</p>\n<p>‘Alpha Disc’, meanwhile, is a 20-tooth solid disc pulley wheel. It’s a two-piece construction, combining the narrow-wide tooth profile – apparently made from a “composite material that offers prolonged wear protection and noise reduction” – with a solid aluminium disc.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"CeramicSpeed OSPW X for SRAM Eagle Transmission\" title=\"CeramicSpeed OSPW X for SRAM Eagle Transmission\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> OSPW X incorporates two new technologies: ‘Active Debris Remover’ and ‘Alpha Disc’.</span></figcaption><span> <i>CeramicSpeed</i></span></div>\n<p>This, according to CeramicSpeed, eliminates the potential of external objects getting stuck between the spokes of the pulley wheel.</p>\n<p>While CeramicSpeed offers an <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/ceramicspeed-ospw-aero/\">OSPW Aero system</a>, this new Eagle design isn’t accompanied by any aerodynamic claims. “Our development and focus for Alpha Disc was specifically related to the functional attributes and protection afforded by the solid pulley disc,” says CeramicSpeed.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"CeramicSpeed OSPW X for SRAM Eagle Transmission\" title=\"CeramicSpeed OSPW X for SRAM Eagle Transmission\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> CeramicSpeed says its design “eliminates the potential of external objects getting stuck between the spokes of the pulley wheel”.</span></figcaption><span> <i>CeramicSpeed</i></span></div>\n<p>SRAM’s <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/news/sram-t-type-eagle-transmission/\">Eagle Transmission drivetrain was first introduced in March</a>, utilising a direct-mount rear derailleur design that removes the derailleur hanger from the equation.</p>\n<p>SRAM says it honed in on the durability of the design, with user-replaceable components, such as the cage, Skid Plate and outer parallelogram links.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"CeramicSpeed OSPW X for SRAM Eagle Transmission\" title=\"CeramicSpeed OSPW X for SRAM Eagle Transmission\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> OSPW X uses a 20-tooth lower pulley wheel.</span></figcaption><span> <i>CeramicSpeed</i></span></div>\n<p>The toothed outer portion of the Eagle Transmission derailleur’s lower pulley wheel can also rotate independently from the spoked centre section.
