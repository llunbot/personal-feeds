And I hope whoever wins this auction, rides the bike, rolling up to the group ride in an all-white skinsuit and a huge white helmet. Do you think Giro would make a white <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/prototype-giro-aerohead-2-0-aero-tt-helmet/\">Aerohead II</a> with gold logos?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The auction runs now until Sunday, March 24th on Catawiki. It is not clear though, who gets the money raised. Does it go into the Vatican City coffers? The current 8500€ bid (<em>at the time of publication</em>) has not yet met the minimum reserve. And the ‘experts’ estimate it will sell for 25,000€ or more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Place your bid for something unique at: <em><a href=\"https://www.catawiki.com/en/l/78951653-pinarello-dogma-f12-special-edition-egan-bernal-x-pope-francis-race-bicycle-2021\" target=\"_blank\">Catawiki.com</a></em></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/purchase-the-popes-pinarello-papal-dogma-gifted-by-giro-winner-egan-bernal-on-auction/\">Purchase the Pope’s Pinarello.
