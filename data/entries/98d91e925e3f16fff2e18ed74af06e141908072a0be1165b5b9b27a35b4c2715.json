The accident prevented SpaceX from completing many of the flight's goals, such as testing Starship's satellite deployment mechanism and new types of heat shield material.</p>\n<p>Those things are high on the to-do list for Flight 8, set to lift off at 5:30 pm CST (6:30 pm EST; 23:30 UTC) Monday from SpaceX's Starbase launch facility on the Texas Gulf Coast. Over the weekend, SpaceX plans to mount the rocket's Starship upper stage atop the Super Heavy booster already in position on the launch pad.</p><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/02/spacex-readies-a-redo-of-last-months-ill-fated-starship-test-flight/\">Read full article</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/02/spacex-readies-a-redo-of-last-months-ill-fated-starship-test-flight/#comments\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Stephen Clark","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"98d91e925e3f16fff2e18ed74af06e141908072a0be1165b5b9b27a35b4c2715","category":"Tech"}
