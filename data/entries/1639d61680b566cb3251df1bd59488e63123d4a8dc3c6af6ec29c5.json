Since its debut, Samsung has touted its devices' ability to take impressive pictures of the moon. Unlike brands such as Huawei, which simply overlay a PNG of the moon on such images, Samsung says that no overlays or texture effects are applied.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nYet on Friday, a Samsung user on the subreddit r/Android <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/11nzrb0/samsung_space_zoom_moon_shots_are_fake_and_here/\">shared a detailed post</a> purporting to \"prove\" that Samsung's moon shots are \"fake.\" Their methodology involved downloading a high-resolution image of the moon, downsizing it to just 170 by 170 pixels, clipping the highlights, and applying a gaussian blur to heavily obscure the moon's surface details. This low-resolution image was then displayed on a monitor and captured at a distance from a Samsung Galaxy device. The resulting image has considerably more detail than its source.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/03/samsung-moon.jpeg\" alt width=\"1360\" height=\"680\" />\r<br />\nSamsung devices seemingly achieve this effect by applying machine learning trained on a large number of moon images, making the photography effect purely computational. This has led to accusations that a texture is functionally still being applied to images of the moon and that the feature is a disingenuous representation of the camera hardware's actual capabilities, triggering heated debate online, even bringing into question the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>'s reliance on computational photography.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/samsung/\">Samsung</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/photography/\">Photography</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/03/13/samsung-fake-moon-shots-controversy/\">Samsung 'Fake' Moon Shots Controversy Puts Computational Photography in the Spotlight</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/samsung-fake-moon-shots-controversy-puts-computational-photography-in-the-spotlight.2383545/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"1639d61680b566cb3251df1bd59488e63123d4a8dc3c6af6ec29c5","category":"Apple"}
