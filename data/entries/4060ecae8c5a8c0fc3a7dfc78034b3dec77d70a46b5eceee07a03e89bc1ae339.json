The updated firmware is necessary, and there is no established method for getting the ‌Siri‌ Remote to update. The ‌Apple TV‌ will need to be up to date, on, and connected to the ‌Siri‌ Remote to initiate, but there is no way to force the new firmware to download. \r<br />\n\r<br />\nPrior to the launch of the latest ‌Apple TV‌ 4K, there were rumors that Apple would build ‌Find My‌ functionality into the ‌Siri‌ Remote. That didn't happen, but this new tvOS 17 option is essentially the same thing. The new ‌Siri‌ Remote feature has not been available previously as it required new firmware to function.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>Fun fact: This is the FIRST update to the Siri Remote (3rd Generation). It came out close to a year ago. <a href=\"https://t.co/3LaYD2gwQz\">https://t.co/3LaYD2gwQz</a></p>— Aaron (@aaronp613) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aaronp613/status/1701734124321480779?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 12, 2023</a></blockquote>  </div>\r<br />\nLocating the remote through the Control Center is possible because of deeper integration between the ‌iPhone‌ and the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> with the tvOS 17 and ‌iOS 17‌ updates. Locating the ‌Siri‌ Remote is a feature that is limited to the ‌Apple TV‌ 4K models released in 2021 and 2022. <div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-17/\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-17/\">iPadOS 17</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Neutral)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100\">Apple TV and Home Theater</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-17.241\">iOS 17</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ipados-17.242\">iPadOS 17</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/09/13/siri-remote-firmware-update-lost-functionality/\">You Can Now Use Your iPhone to Find a Lost Siri Remote in tvOS 17 and iOS 17</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/you-can-now-use-your-iphone-to-find-a-lost-siri-remote-in-tvos-17-and-ios-17.2401552/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"4060ecae8c5a8c0fc3a7dfc78034b3dec77d70a46b5eceee07a03e89bc1ae339","category":"Apple"}
