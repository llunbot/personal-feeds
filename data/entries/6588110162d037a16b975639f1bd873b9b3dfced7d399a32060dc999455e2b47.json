Last year's watchOS 10 update was compatible with all of the same Apple Watch models as watchOS 9, but a new rumor claims that watchOS 11 will drop support for the oldest currently supported Apple smartwatch: the Apple Watch Series 4. The full device compatibility list for watchOS 11 is said to be as follows:\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<ul>\r<br />\n\t<li>Apple Watch Series 5 (2019)</li>\r<br />\n\t<li>Apple Watch Series 6 (2020)</li>\r<br />\n\t<li>Apple Watch Series 7 (2021)</li>\r<br />\n\t<li>Apple Watch Series 8 (2022)</li>\r<br />\n\t<li>Apple Watch Series 9 (2023)</li>\r<br />\n\t<li>Apple Watch SE (first generation, 2020)</li>\r<br />\n\t<li>Apple Watch SE (second generation, 2022)</li>\r<br />\n\t<li>Apple Watch Ultra (first generation, 2022)</li>\r<br />\n\t<li>Apple Watch Ultra 2 (2023)</li></ul>\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe Apple Watch Series 4 debuted alongside the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max in 2018, introducing the device's first ever redesign, a larger display, double the amount of storage, Fall Detection, and the ability to take an ECG.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLast year, iOS 17 dropped support for the iPhone X, but iOS 18 is rumored to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/27/ios-18-compatible-iphones-rumor/\">support all of the same models</a> as its predecessor. Apple is expected to preview watchOS 11, iOS 18, and its other next-generation software updates at WWDC on June 10. The updates will likely release to the public in the fall. <div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/watchos-10/\">watchOS 10</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-watch.172\">Apple Watch</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/04/02/watchos-11-to-drop-support-for-series-4/\">watchOS 11 Rumored to Drop Support for Apple Watch Series 4</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/watchos-11-rumored-to-drop-support-for-apple-watch-series-4.2423361/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6588110162d037a16b975639f1bd873b9b3dfced7d399a32060dc999455e2b47","category":"Apple"}
