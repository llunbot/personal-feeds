The project intends ‘to protoype Canyon bicycle parts, including for bicycle frames’, which could be interpreted to mean that entire frames aren’t on the cards, but that subassemblies of frames such as lugs or dropouts might be. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"970\" height=\"647\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/10/05225618/canyon_aeroad_cover-970x647.jpg\" alt=\"Aero road bike\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/10/05225618/canyon_aeroad_cover-970x646.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/10/05225618/canyon_aeroad_cover-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/10/05225618/canyon_aeroad_cover-768x513.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/10/05225618/canyon_aeroad_cover-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/10/05225618/canyon_aeroad_cover-750x501.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/10/05225618/canyon_aeroad_cover-1140x761.jpg 1140w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/10/05225618/canyon_aeroad_cover-465x310.jpg 465w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/10/05225618/canyon_aeroad_cover-350x233.jpg 350w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2020/10/05225618/canyon_aeroad_cover.jpg 2048w\" /><figcaption>Pete Stuart / Cyclist</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Canyon is an influential player on the road, gravel and MTB scene with form when it comes to pushing into new areas.

its strength and stiffness, and its ability to borrow the best attributes of steel at a lower weight. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>3D-printed titanium has been used to great effect in more recent years, particularly for small, relatively complex parts that are produced in smaller numbers. Notable examples include <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/moots-vamoots-crd\" target=\"_blank\">Moots’ gorgeous dropouts</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/colnago-c68\" target=\"_blank\">Colnago C68’s frame lugs</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/in-depth/spurcycle-compact-bell\" target=\"_blank\">Silca Chisela computer mount</a> and the stunning <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/news/mirada-pro-and-reynolds-3d-printed-frame\" target=\"_blank\">Mirada frame</a> featured at the top of this article. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do you think Canyon and IperionX are brewing?
