How about a <a href=\"https://www.8degreepedal.com/\">new flat pedal</a> that uses a “breakthrough technology” of self/centering, flat floating, and is truly clipless? Meet the 8 Degree Floating Pedal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The press release claims that the 8 Degree Floating Pedal adapts to each rider’s biomechanics by allowing the rider to angle their feet. This, in turn, would/could reduce the risk of discomfort or injury associated with a fixed position on a pedal. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/8-Degree-Pedal-black-pair.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/8-Degree-Pedal-black-pair-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"8 Degree Pedal black pair\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/8-Degree-Pedal-black-pair-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/8-Degree-Pedal-black-pair-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/8-Degree-Pedal-black-pair-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/8-Degree-Pedal-black-pair-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/8-Degree-Pedal-black-pair-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/8-Degree-Pedal-black-pair.jpeg 1160w\" /></a><figcaption>(Photo/8 Degree pedal)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The “breakthrough” tech is versatile and can work for road and MTB cyclists, BMX, home/gym workouts, or recreational riders. They offer an adjustable range of float from -4 degrees to +4 degrees. This allows the cyclist to fine-tune the pedals to meet their specific needs. This would also make it a breeze to use the same pedals for different bikes, making it a pretty flexible pedal. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How It Works</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/8-Degree-Pedal-red-single.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/8-Degree-Pedal-red-single-800x533.jpeg\" alt=\"8 Degree Pedal red single\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/8-Degree-Pedal-red-single-800x533.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/8-Degree-Pedal-red-single-297x198.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/8-Degree-Pedal-red-single-120x80.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/8-Degree-Pedal-red-single-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/8-Degree-Pedal-red-single-720x480.jpeg 720w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/8-Degree-Pedal-red-single.jpeg 1160w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/videos/c/vp/47c5d9c1b99444df80e5e251e29bdbeb/47c5d9c1b99444df80e5e251e29bdbeb.HD-720p-1.6Mbps-20146928.mp4\">https://cdn.shopify.com/videos/c/vp/47c5d9c1b99444df80e5e251e29bdbeb/47c5d9c1b99444df80e5e251e29bdbeb.HD-720p-1.6Mbps-20146928.mp4</a></div>\n\n\n<p>Let me try to explain this. Once you put your foot on the pedal, the pedal will be able to pivot laterally +/- 4 degrees by swiveling the whole pedal body on its spindle, gliding back and forth on an internal rod with springs on either side providing the tension. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don’t know if that makes any sense, but you can see the pedal work in the video above. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Features</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>8-Degree Float: Offers an 8-degree float for comfortable foot movement</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Innovative Design: Unique flat pedal technology</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Self-Centering: Automatically returns to the neutral position</li>\n\n\n\n<li>No Special Gear Required: Works with standard shoes</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wide Float Range: Pivots laterally +/- 4 degrees</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Comfort and Efficiency: Reduces strain, and pressure points, and enhances pedal efficiency</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Injury Reduction: Alleviates the risk of strain by promoting natural leg movement</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Versatile: Suitable for all cycling disciplines</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/8-Degree-Pedal-black-single.jpeg\"><img width=\"800\" height=\"640\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/8-Degree-Pedal-black-single-800x640.jpeg\" alt=\"8 Degree Pedal black single\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/8-Degree-Pedal-black-single-800x640.jpeg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/8-Degree-Pedal-black-single-297x238.jpeg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/8-Degree-Pedal-black-single-120x96.jpeg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/8-Degree-Pedal-black-single-768x614.jpeg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/8-Degree-Pedal-black-single.jpeg 1160w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, there is no word on when these pedals will be available or the retail price.
