We’ve done that, <a href=\"https://spyglass.org/apple-ai-siri/\">a\nlot</a>. Probably enough — for now (famous last words). I’m\ntalking about Apple in general. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/2f3K43FHRKo?si=7lIWEBMSvCk-rxwG&amp;ref=spyglass.org\">Watching this OpenAI video</a> — again, not an event, just a product walk-through with various\nteam members (though this one happened to be “MC’d” by Sam Altman) — I had this old, familiar feeling as they walked through the new\nfeatures: joy.</p>\n\n<p>As ridiculous as it may sound, I was almost giddy around what I\nwas seeing. It’s a feeling that I recall well from many an Apple\nevent back in the day.</p>\n\n<p>“Yes, this is <em>exactly</em> what I wanted! They did it!” That kind\nof thing.</p>\n\n<p>This will sound unfair or harsh to Apple, but I really don’t think\nthat it is. I can really only speak for myself here, and perhaps\nI’m alone — but I suspect that I’m not — it has been a while\nsince I’ve gotten that feeling from an Apple announcement. That\nloving feeling.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I gave the updated ChatGPT the instruction “Create an image of the main characters from ‘Severance’ as Lego figures” and this is the first response it gave me:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/03/severance-chatgpt-4o.png\">\n  <img width=\"425\" src=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/03/severance-chatgpt-4o.png\" alt=\"Four Lego figures who look like Mark, Helly, Dylan (maybe?) and Irving (even less maybe).\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>I gave Apple’s Image Playground, running on MacOS 15.3.2 Sequoia, the equivalent prompt — “The main characters from ‘Severance’ as Lego figures” — and it gave me this as its first response:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/03/severance-image-playground.png\">\n  <img width=\"425\" src=\"https://daringfireball.net/misc/2025/03/severance-image-playground.png\" alt=\"Three Lego figures, two yellow, one red, which bear zero resemblance to anyone or anything from “Severance” whatsoever.\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>One of the above images qualifies as “<em>Hey, that could be better but it’s pretty good for the first crack from a simple prompt</em>”, and the other qualifies as “<em>This bears zero resemblance to anyone or anything from</em> Severance”.</p>\n\n<p>Guess which one of the two Apple is <a href=\"https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/2025/1/7.html\">actively promoting</a> to users as something they should try?</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/03/28/chatgpt-4o-adds-image-generation-and-its-fun-as-hell\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"8506669b838cf67a09a6db2d13ded6e2ba8c8b64666796f67d1a2558beebcb49","category":"Tech"}
