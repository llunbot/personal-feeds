And the truth is Samsung monitors aren’t just well-priced, but they’re also high enough quality that even some of the folks on our team have them on their desks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 32-inch Samsung Smart Monitor M8, for instance, won’t just serve as a monitor, but also as a smart TV of sorts. Even better, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Streaming-Upscaling-Ergonomic-LS32DM801UNXZA/dp/B0D1DBQRRS/?th=1\">this one’s only $400 at Amazon right now</a>, a 43 percent discount from its $700 MSRP. That’s a mere fraction of what you’d pay for the Apple Studio Display.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, it may not be a 5K monitor like the Studio Display, but at 4K it’s still very sharp. It even comes with AI upscaling so even if the content you’re looking at is not that high-quality, you’ll still get to see it as close to 4K as possible. The colors are vibrant, the contrast is deep, and you’ll simply love using it. It’s also got a detachable SlimFit Camera for Zoom and FaceTime calls.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since it comes with built-in streaming capabilities, you can put on Netflix every evening and enjoy your shows, or access free live TV via Samsung TV Plus. It’s slim and has a stylish design, so if you want to pop it up on a wall, that’s a perfectly good idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frankly, there’s nothing to complain about when it comes to this <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Streaming-Upscaling-Ergonomic-LS32DM801UNXZA/dp/B0D1DBQRRS/?th=1\">4K 32-inch Samsung smart monitor, especially when it’s only $400</a>. Really, don’t miss out on this deal!</p>\n\n\n<span>4K for $400?
