I’ll delete <em>this</em> post in a few hours, but for now here’s the footnote for your convenience:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When this Apple-OpenAI partnership was announced, there was much\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/05/30/information-altman-apple\">speculation</a> about who’d be paying whom. The answer is that\nneither side paying the other. Linking to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-12/apple-to-pay-openai-for-chatgpt-through-distribution-not-cash\">Mark Gurman’s\nscoop</a> on the arrangement, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/06/13/gurman-openai-apple\">I wrote back in June</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple getting this free of charge, in exchange only for the\nprestige of showing the ChatGPT logo and credit to users of Apple\ndevices who engage the integration, is the Apple-iest negotiation\nin recent memory. My money says Eddy Cue, Steve Jobs’s favorite\nco-negotiator, made the deal. (I’d love to take Eddy Cue with me\nto the dealer when next I buy a car.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What hadn’t occurred to me until now is that not only is OpenAI\ngetting no money from Apple out of this arrangement, but that the\nnet brand equity they’re getting from it might be <em>negative</em>.\nThese Super Bowl and high school basketball queries are handled\nperfectly by ChatGPT when using it directly — but Siri’s\nattribution makes it look like ChatGPT is to blame for these\nutterly and at times laughably wrong bungled answers. As it\nstands, Apple is getting a scapegoat more than a partner out of\nthis deal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/01/23/dont-miss-footnote-4\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"b2d2c9380c497a25d84d6b01d947d343ac11396a1202ce710c6935ebce243ccb","category":"Tech"}
