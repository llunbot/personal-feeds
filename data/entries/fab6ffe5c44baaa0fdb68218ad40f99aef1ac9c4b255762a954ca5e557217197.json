These are VirusBarrier and NetBarrier, which catch and kill malware threats plus spot potential intrusion attempts from outside as well as outgoing attempts from rogue software. The job of the first is self-explanatory but the second is a two-way firewall, a component you don’t often see included with security software at this sort of price. Together these tools offer a high level of protection against direct and indirect unwanted software and malware threats. </p>\n\n<p>VirusBarrier X9 can scan every file on any connected disk, including within compressed archives, and it can scan emails and connected iOS devices. Suspicious files are quarantined, and these can then be marked as trusted, left quarantined or a repair attempt can be made.</p>\n\n<p>In the June 2023 test by AV-Comparatives, Intego’s Virus Barrier received an “Approved” rating and showed good performance and improved compared to previous years. According to AV-Comparitives it detected a good 99.4 percent of Mac malware, 97 percent of PUAs (Potentially Unwanted Programs) and 100 percent of Windows viruses, so it can be recommended without restriction.</p>\n\n<p>In our testing VirusBarrier caught all our malware and ‘uninvited software’ samples including ones for other platforms. We were also warned when we opened a disk image with a malicious installer.</p>\n\n<p>The tool offers good compatibility with macOS, and unlike some of the competitors, it looks like a real Mac program.  </p>\n\n<p>The Mac Premium Bundle X9 adds three more sets of capabilities: the backup prowess of Personal Backup (a good ‘belt’ addition to your Time Machine ‘braces’), the useful cleaning, tidying and general speed optimizing tricks of Mac Washing Machine, and finally the multi-user safe surfing intelligence of ContentBarrier. Sure, that last one is not something everyone needs, but it’s great for parents. Whichever one of these software suites you choose, you can be sure they offer some of the best protection available for your Mac.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://offer.intego.com/Widg_8cbj3hvuz?aff_sub=1-1-668850-1-0-0\" target=\"_blank\">You can get Intego Mac Internet Security X9 here</a>.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/667651/intego-mac-internet-security-x9-review-2.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIntego Mac Internet Security X9 review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t2.

There’s also 24/7 live support. </p>\n\n<p>Payment is by subscription, and currently Clario has 54% off the usual $107.88 / £107.88 a year, so you can pay $50.00 / £50.00 a year (billed at $4.17 / £4.17 a month). The three devices included in the plan can include a combination of Macs and iOS or Android devices. There’s also a 7-day free trial. </p>\n\n<p>Set up is quick and painless with a wizard that takes you through configuration of all the key features while allowing you to evaluate the different options and determine which ones you want to enable. Once installed you can access information about the security of your Mac and monitor the status of your online accounts and personal data. The VPN will kick in if Clario detects you using an unprotected network. And from the Dashboard you can trigger a quick virus scan, which is actually quite thorough. </p>\n\n<p>We did encounter some issues with performance, with the program sometimes running slow before we were fully set up, but once we were fully configured everything ran smoothly. </p>\n\n<p>Whether you’re a novice or advanced user, Clario is an effective and supportive security program. </p>\n\n<p>You can get <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://clario.co/mac-antivirus/&amp;xcust=1-1-668850-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">Clairo Antivirus for Mac here</a>.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/800037/clario-antivirus-1-5-for-mac-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tClario Antivirus 1.5 for Mac review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t3.

Norton 360 is available in Plus, Standard and Deluxe (there is also an Advanced edition in the U.K., and a Select +LifeLock edition in the U.S. both of which support up to 10 devices). The core Norton 360 protection features do a good job, but the cloud backup benefits are missing from the Mac edition. If you go beyond the Standard edition you get Dark Web Monitoring, Parental Control and School Time, and licenses for up to five devices (for the Deluxe edition) or 10 (for the Advanced or Select versions). </p>\n\n<p>Norton 360 focuses on catching unwanted software, but it also offers some useful additional features including a VPN for securing personal data while online, and a tool for managing passwords, bank card details and similar data. You’ll also get protection against identity theft with some editions, Norton calls this Dark Web Monitoring. The service regularly checks whether your email, telephone number, credit card number or other contact details have fallen into the wrong hands. Note that the Cloud Backup feature doesn’t work on macOS, but that is more of an extra rather than a vital part of the package.</p>\n\n<p>There is also protection against unwanted, uninvited and possibly malicious software. A Norton Password Manager utility that also helps manage wallet data for autofill payments, addresses, notes and favorites. Much of these are things that macOS does already, but the clear interface makes it easy to understand. </p>\n\n<p>Beware that the first year is discounted, so you will be charged more in subsequent years. The price currently varies between $19.99/£19.99 and $29.99/£29.99 for the first year (renewing at a higher price)</p>\n\n<p>Norton performed well in tests and was efficient at spotting unwanted and potentially risky software, from browser search engine hack scripts to actual trojans. In a test by the auditors at <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.av-test.org/en/antivirus/home-macos/macos-ventura/march-2023/norton-norton-360-8.8-235107/&amp;xcust=1-1-668850-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">AV-Test</a> in March 2023, the program’s excellent detection of Mac malware was recognized with a 100% score for the detection of malware.

There are a few niggles such as the unwanted upselling for Cleanup Premium and the fact that the File Shield monitoring slows down file copy times a bit.</p>\n\n<p>Otherwise, it’s a well-featured suite which will protect from all sorts of nasties including watching for browser script hacks, potential ransomware and other remote attack activity. It will, of course, also scan for potentially unwanted programs and actual malware threats, whether on your Mac or your removable media or in email attachments.</p>\n\n<p>Custom scheduled scans can be set up, although the automatic background monitoring teamed with occasional specific manual scans is likely to be enough for most requirements. Wi-Fi network monitoring for vulnerabilities is another feature this software offers, and the Real Site option watches for fake sites pretending to be legitimate shopping or banking sites, a serious risk that goes beyond just watching for unwanted files on your own Mac. It is very effective at all these things, although we found that customising its behaviour can be a little fiddly.</p>\n\n<p>You can get <a href=\"https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-100470607-13637464?sid=1-1-668850-1-0-0&amp;url=https://www.avast.com/en-gb/premium-security#mac\" target=\"_blank\">Avast Premium Security for Mac here</a>. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668132/avast-premium-security-for-mac-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAvast Premium Security review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t7.

The bundled VPN is very basic and gives you only 200MB of data per day, but the rest of the suite of tools is effective and easy to manage.</p>\n\n<p>But when you compare what the Mac version offers compared to the Windows version, you’ll feel quite hard done by. There’s no password manager, no social network protection, no webcam or microphone protection, no Wi-Fi security advisor and plenty of other features that Windows users get for the same price.</p>\n\n<p>Bitdefender is also lagging behind its rivals with no identity protection. If your goal is simply to keep your Mac protected from malware, then Bitdefender does a great job. But you can find better value elsewhere.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668124/bitdefender-total-security-2021-review-2.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBitdefender Total Security review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t8.

Either click the Free Trial button or sign up for a $29.95/£24 a year subscription  and the installation file is automatically downloaded. After the initial setup, where you need to grant permission to access the Downloads folder and modify security settings, you are all set. </p>\n\n<p>You can run a manual scan from the main screen, but there are several other options. A quick scan checks system files and other areas on your Mac, you can select just your hard drive to runs a scan on all folders and files on the disk, and dragging and dropping a single folder or file onto the scanning pane checks it for malware. You can also select an external drive or connected USB stick for scanning. There’s also a real-time scanning component–Sentry–that is always on guard. </p>\n\n<p>It is possible to schedule any type of scan to run on specific days and times. By default, any malicious files are automatically quarantined, but you can decide whether or not to quarantine infected files.

Unfortunately, the Mac version falls short of many of the features of the Windows version. Malwarebytes Premium for Mac includes the basic virus and malware scanning as well as the ability to detect malicious apps, or PUPs (potentially unwanted program). The real-time protection constantly monitors your system for security threats, automatically blocking and quarantining anything that could infect your computer.</p>\n\n<p>But it doesn’t directly come with protection against malicious links and phishing attempts. Nor does it offer safeguards against ransomware and zero-day exploits.</p>\n\n<p>There is a free version of Malwarebytes, but that just includes just basic virus scanning. The premium version costs $3.33/£2.50 billed monthly or $39.99/£29.99 billed annually for one device, and $6.67/£5.83 billed monthly or $79.99/£69.99 billed annually for five devices. There’s a free 14-day trial. </p>\n\n<p>Malwarebytes Premium on a Mac is accessible through a menu bar icon. Clicking the icon displays a menu with options to start a scan, temporarily turn off the malware protection and malicious app blocker, update the program, view and tweak its settings, and open the management console.</p>\n\n<p>From the management console, you can trigger a manual scan and set up scheduled scans to run on a recurring basis. A detection history displays all quarantined items. There’s an Allow list to add legitimate files or programs that were mistakenly flagged as malware to. </p>\n\n<p>Malwarebytes Premium has regularly and consistently gotten <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.av-test.org/en/antivirus/home-windows/manufacturer/malwarebytes/&amp;xcust=1-1-668850-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">top marks from AV-Test</a> for protection, performance, and usability.

If you want “just a virus scanner”, Avast’s Free Antivirus version, which is the free version of Avast Premium Security (<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234101/avast-premium-security-review.html\">reviewed separately</a>), gets our recommendation. The Avast One version is also based on Avast Security, but offers some additional functions.</p>\n\n<p>In a recent test by <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.av-comparatives.org/tests/mac-security-test-review-2023/&amp;xcust=1-1-668850-1-0-0&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">AV-Comparatives in June 2023</a>, Avast was among the best products, detecting 100 percent of Mac malware, 99 percent of potentially unwanted applications and 100 percent of Windows viruses.</p>\n\n<p>When we ran Avast we experienced no slowdowns and no negative effect on system performance. One of the biggest challenges was installation. In order to be able to check files, a virus scanner must install some background programs and needs access to the file system, so you will have to jump through some hoops to allow access. None of this is Avast’s fault, of course. </p>\n\n<p>As for the interface, we found the three-column overview with all the listed functions is very cluttered and a bit overwhelming. Avast One Essential offers several dozen more functions than the Avast Free Antivirus app. It includes options such as ransomware protection, privacy protection, recommends cleaning up the hard drive without being asked, and searches for data leaks. There’s also a free VPN service with 5GB data volume per week, but, you can only select the location in another country for an additional charge.</p>\n\n<p>The exaggerated warnings about alleged security gaps are worse, with Avast One classifying our home WLAN as insecure and recommending the use of a VPN. It’s mainly this intrusive advertising for paid functions that cost the app our full recommendation. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2005226/malware-protection-avast-security-antivirus-scanner-in-test.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAvast Free Antivirus review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t15.

It includes several useful features, but lacks certain key options, especially in the virus scanning. </p>\n\n<p>The program is $59.99 a year for one device, which is steep, but there’s a free 30-day trial that requires no credit card and even gives you free technical support if you need it. </p>\n\n<p>Clicking the Scan button runs a full virus scan that checks your entire system, while clicking the link for Viruses &amp; Threats takes you to another screen where you can scan just specific folders. But there are no options to run a quick scan or even to schedule a scan, unlike the Windows version which includes a quick scan. It provides real-time virus and spyware scanning to automatically block malware, and ‘DeepGuard’ monitors applications for any changes indicative of a malware infection. </p>\n\n<p>You can set up the ID monitoring to check your email address for data breaches among your online accounts. The VPN is another defense and includes tracking protection to prevent advertisers from monitoring your online activity and a kill switch to quickly cut off all internet traffic. </p>\n\n<p>F-Secure offers a password vault that creates and stores secure logins for all your accounts.

But most actually require a paid subscription, so the product’s overall usefulness is limited and the constant sales pitches annoying. </p>\n\n<p>You can run a quick scan to check out system files and other vulnerable areas or a full scan to analyze your entire Mac for malware. These scans can run daily, weekly, or monthly. You can also create a custom scan. There are also real-time virus protection scans to scan new files saved to your computer or downloaded from the internet. You have to pay to scan a USB drive. Malware discovered is automatically quarantined. Avira was effective at detecting and stopping malware when we tested it.</p>\n\n<p>The free version of Avira includes a junk cleaner that can identify issues via a smart scan, but you need to pay to actually clean up anything beyond the junk files. </p>\n\n<p>The old adage of “you get what you pay for” is certainly true with Avira Free Security. Take away the tools that require a subscription, and you’re left with the antivirus feature, a limited VPN, a password manager that works only in Safari, and a junk file cleaner. </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668094/avira-free-security-for-mac-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAvira Free Security for Mac review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t18.

We’d argue that they are wrong – or overconfident, at the very least.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not long ago, the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/676327/silver-sparrow-malware-detected-on-m1-macs-what-you-need-to-know.html\">Silver Sparrow malware</a> was detected on Macs powered by the M1 processor and infected hundreds of thousands of Macs in total. The bad guys, then, are still very much targeting Mac users and they’re getting smarter and greedier. As a result, cyber security is something you can’t afford to ignore, and good Mac antivirus is a very good place to start if you want to stay safe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668710/how-secure-mac.html\">Macs are generally more secure</a> than their Windows brethren for two reasons. On the technical side, macOS is a Unix-based operating system. As a Unix-based operating system macOS is sandboxed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sandboxing is like having a series of fire doors: even if malware gains access to your Mac, it is unable to spread to other areas of the machine. They are more difficult to exploit than Windows PCs, but Macs are not unhackable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More general advice can be found in our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1432223/mac-security-tips-password-find-my-users-lockdown-mode.html\">Mac security tips</a>; and those who have been hit by a malware attack should try <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671430/how-remove-virus-mac.html\">how to remove a virus from a Mac</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to choose the best Mac antivirus</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Features fundamental to all packages are two ways to find viruses: on-demand protection and via always-on protection. The former finds viruses by examining one file after another during scheduled scans, or when you choose to undertake a scan, perhaps because you’re worried your Mac might be infected. The speed at which the Mac antivirus app can do this is important, because some take a long time and also hog the Mac’s CPU while they do so. Waiting six hours to find out if your Mac is infected is neither convenient nor relaxing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Always-on malware protection is what protects the user outside of the times when scans are run. If some malware arrives, perhaps via an email or a downloaded file, then the always-on protection should be able to detect it and either quarantine it (copy it to a safe folder so the user can decide what to do with it), or simply delete it. Usually a notification is shown when malware is detected in this way, but not all antimalware apps show the same amount of explanation of what’s happened – and this was one of the factors we examined in our testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outside of direct malware detection, many security suites include additional tools such as ransomware protection. Ransomware is a type of malware that, once it’s infected a computer, encrypts all the user’s files and then demands a fee to decrypt them. To protect against this infection, anti-ransomware features typically block any app from writing to a user’s home folders, such as Documents or Photos, unless the app’s pre-approved (a process called whitelisting). Lots of apps come already pre-approved, of course, such as Microsoft Word, or Apple’s own Photos app. But you can add others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several products also include virtual private network (\n<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668698/best-vpn-for-mac-2.html\">VPN</a>) add-ons. These protect an internet connection by encrypting it, and this is useful when utilising unsafe open WiFi such as that provided by a café or hotel. In our experience, these are not replacements for separate paid-for VPN services as many do not unblock video streaming services and some are cut-down versions which constantly nag you to pay extra for the full, premium versions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Web protection via browser plugins or extensions is also a common component and aims to stop you (or your children) doing anything you regret online, such as visiting fake or infected websites or handing over personal information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are usually different options from each vendor, and you get more extras with the top packages, and far fewer with free ones. They might include password managers, parental controls, cloud storage – the list goes on. Generally, the underlying antimalware engine is the same in all products from the same company, so you can save money if you don’t need those additional features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do bear in mind that all antivirus for Mac apps are sold as yearly subscriptions. That’s right, you can’t just pay once and use forever. Often there’s a hefty discount for that first year’s subscription, but this can burn you when automatic renewal occurs a year later and the full retail price is charged: often 100% more. Alternatively, you can purchase several years’ subscriptions at once for a bigger discount.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the best Mac antivirus subscriptions allow you to install the software on more than one computer (including Windows and Android devices), which can sometimes add significantly to the value – all computers, phones and tablets within a household can be protected with one subscription.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Spotting fake Mac antivirus software </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Beware that, due to the fact that people are so concerned about malware threats on the Mac, there have been cases of malware disguising itself as an antivirus app, such as the Mac Auto Fixer pop-ups that appeared on some Macs suggesting that software needs to be installed (at a high price). This is similar to another fake antivirus app called MacDefender.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another Mac antivirus company that is often thought of as unscrupulous is <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/552819/mackeeper-review.html\">MacKeeper</a>. In the past various reports have suggested it is a scam or at worst malware. In recent times MacKeeper has attempted to transform itself and leave its disreputability behind. It has, for example, gained Apple Notarization – which means the software is checked by Apple for malicious components. The company has also been working to get certifications from various bodies to prove it isn’t a PUP, including an AV-Test certificate. If you have any problems with MacKeeper we do explain how to remove it here: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/224718/how-to-uninstall-mackeeper-from-your-mac.html\">How to uninstall MacKeeper</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How we test Mac antivirus software </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Each software package is evaluated creating a clean installation of macOS, cloning it for each AV product, and then booting separately into each one to install a different package. This was to ensure that previous app installations didn’t interfere with new ones – sometimes AV software treats other AV software as an infection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to visiting malicious websites, downloading known malicious software, and even running said malware on our Mac, we also reference the most recent reports from two labs that regularly cover macOS malware: <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=http://www.av-comparatives.org/&amp;xcust=1-1-231118-1-0-0%7Cxid:fr1630002835232gbh&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/231118/best-antivirus-for-mac.html\">AV Comparatives</a> and <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=111346X1569486&amp;url=https://www.av-test.org/&amp;xcust=1-1-231118-1-0-0%7Cxid:fr1630002835232bgc&amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/231118/best-antivirus-for-mac.html\">AV-TEST</a>. These laboratories test AV software against sets of known malware as well as products that are grouped as potentially unwanted applications (like adware).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latter doesn’t damage or expose your computer or its files but may consume power and CPU cycles. Because the testing effectively looks at a combination of virus databases and behavior, they remain good gauges even after many months. When an antivirus for Mac software package lacks a rating from a known security research lab, we do more extensive testing with real malware.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, while we gave props for a lot of different features and behaviors, we marked products down if they lacked any or all of the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>A nearly perfect score on macOS malware detection</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ransomware monitoring</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Native browser plug-in or system-level Web proxy</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A high score on Windows malware detection</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Privacy concerns</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Using a Mac antivirus product, especially any that includes tools to also improve your online privacy, may lull you into believing you’re safe from personal and private information leaking out. That’s not quite the case. While there’s no reason to panic, you should consider a few reasonable issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, an antivirus for Mac product may upload the complete text of files flagged to the cloud, where it can be analyzed by separate tools hosted there. This practice is normal and sensible: Some malware can detect when a running process may examine it, and will then engage in subterfuge. Antivirus software makers also can access their massive databases to examine files with characteristics that trigger their algorithms—certain elements that match known malware. As a result, security researchers discover new viruses, worms, Trojans horses, and the like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, helping the greater good means you’ll have to be comfortable with trusting a third-party with your file contents. Where appropriate, we noted privacy policy issues in individual reviews.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, this software may also rely partly or entirely on cloud-based checks of URLs, malware, and the like. Accordingly, an AV package might upload every URL you visit, metadata about files, signatures of files, information about your computer’s hardware, a list of running or installed applications, and more. Companies vary on their disclosure of such policies, and may not let you opt out of this kind of sharing. We note issues in each review as available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Third, anti-virus software makers also get a sense of what behavior is happening on your computer that’s being monitored or blocked, and may use that information for their own purposes. In some cases, you can opt out of this information gathering.</p>\n\nAntivirus, Personal Software, Security Software and Services</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"fab6ffe5c44baaa0fdb68218ad40f99aef1ac9c4b255762a954ca5e557217197","category":"Apple"}
