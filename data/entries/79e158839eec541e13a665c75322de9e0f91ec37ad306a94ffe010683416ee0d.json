The games are downloaded directly to a mobile device from Netflix and are not streamed from the Netflix app. \r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nAs noted by <em><a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/netflix-takes-first-stab-at-mobile-gaming-in-its-android-app-but-only-in-poland/\">CNET</a></em>, the games that are being offered have been available for a few years outside of the Netflix app and were created in partnership with Netflix for the second and third seasons of \"Stranger Things.\"\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nBack in July, Netflix said that it considered gaming to be another new content category, similar to its expansion into original films, animation, and unscripted television.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nWith its expansion into mobile gaming, Netflix will compete directly with ‌Apple Arcade‌, Apple's $4.99 per month gaming service that allows users to access hundreds of ad-free games on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a>, Mac, and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>.\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<br />\r\nGiven that the two games Netflix is experimenting with are already existing titles, we may need to wait for some time to see where Netflix plans to take its mobile gaming feature in the future.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/netflix/\">Netflix</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/26/netflix-mobile-games-testing-poland/\">Netflix Now Testing Integrated Mobile Games in Poland</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/netflix-now-testing-integrated-mobile-games-in-poland.2308794/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br /><div>\r\n<a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=jCKI8ncjJ6A:tthy2LjTHFU:6W8y8wAjSf4\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=6W8y8wAjSf4\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.macrumors.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?a=jCKI8ncjJ6A:tthy2LjTHFU:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/MacRumors-All?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a>\r\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/MacRumors-All/~4/jCKI8ncjJ6A\" />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"79e158839eec541e13a665c75322de9e0f91ec37ad306a94ffe010683416ee0d","category":"Apple"}
