Clearly, that can mean cheaper power. But it also means that we can potentially install panels in places that would otherwise be too expensive and still produce power profitably.</p>\n<p>One of the more intriguing options is to place the panels above artificial bodies of water, either floating or suspended on cables. While more expensive than land-based installs, this <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/03/the-economics-of-covering-californias-water-system-with-solar-panels/\">creates a win-win</a>: the panels limit the evaporation of water, and the water cools the panels, allowing them to operate more efficiently in warm climates.</p>\n<p>While the potential of floating solar has been examined in a number of places, a group of researchers has now done a global analysis and find that it's huge. Even if we limit installs to a fraction of the surface of existing reservoirs, floating panels could generate nearly 10,000 TeraWatt-hours per year, while keeping over 100 cubic kilometers of water from evaporating.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1923587#p3\">Read 13 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1923587&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"John Timmer","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"fffe81de5234abc98e16fab199edf9df6a1ec04f3890a5d799d193858cf7272a","category":"Tech"}
