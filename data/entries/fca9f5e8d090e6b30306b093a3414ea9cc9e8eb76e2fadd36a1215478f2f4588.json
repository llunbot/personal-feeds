Apple will also take a passive 20% equity interest in Globalstar at a cost of $400 million.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple's satellite services debuted in late 2022 on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-14/\">iPhone 14</a> models with the launch of Emergency SOS and ‌Find My‌ location updates via satellite in the U.S. and Canada, allowing users in remote areas to contact emergency services via text message. Over time, Apple's satellite services have expanded to additional countries and added new functions including Roadside Assistance in late 2023, and with <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-18/\">iOS 18</a> this year, users can now communicate with others using iMessage and text messages via satellite even in non-emergency situations.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nAt the time of Apple's original satellite services launch in 2022, the company said the services would be offered for free for the first two years upon the purchase of a compatible phone, with a fee required beyond that time to continue using them. Apple has, however, extended the free service period and has yet to begin charging a fee. It is unclear at this point if or when Apple will begin charging for use of satellite services, and if so, what the fee will be.<br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/01/apple-globalstar-satellite-agreement/\">Apple Expands Globalstar Relationship to Support Growing Satellite Services</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-expands-globalstar-relationship-to-support-growing-satellite-services.2441698/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Eric Slivka","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"fca9f5e8d090e6b30306b093a3414ea9cc9e8eb76e2fadd36a1215478f2f4588","category":"Apple"}
