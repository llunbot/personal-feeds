These credentials are issued by any one of hundreds of CAs (certificate authorities) to domain owners. The rules for how certificates are issued and the process for verifying the rightful owner of a domain are left to the <a href=\"https://cabforum.org/\">CA/Browser Forum</a>. One \"base requirement rule\" allows CAs to send an email to an address listed in the WHOIS record for the domain being applied for. When the receiver clicks an enclosed link, the certificate is automatically approved.</p>\n<h2>Non-trivial dependencies</h2>\n<p>Researchers from security firm watchTowr recently demonstrated how threat actors could abuse the rule to <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/09/rogue-whois-server-gives-researcher-superpowers-no-one-should-ever-have/\">obtain fraudulently issued certificates</a> for domains they didnâ€™t own. The security failure resulted from a lack of uniform rules for determining the validity of sites claiming to provide official WHOIS records.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051511#p3\">Read 8 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051511&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"41ded3e314d849ea79eed866e6ebbef743e6db6f7ec69d37e3f26ceeac86b169","category":"Tech"}
