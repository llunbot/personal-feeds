But, that explanation is not true, according to Apple.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nFrom the report:<blockquote><strong>Update 11:18am ET:</strong> Apple has confirmed to Macworld that the C1 modem is not responsible for the decision to leave MagSafe charging off the new iPhone 16e.</blockquote>A well-known iPhone case maker told <em>MacRumors</em> that it completed testing that confirmed MagSafe cases do not impact the C1 modem's performance.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSo, why does the iPhone 16e lack MagSafe? Apple has not disclosed its actual reasoning, but we would wager that it simply comes down to pricing considerations.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/21/iphone-16e-now-available-for-pre-order-ahead-of-february-28-launch/\">iPhone 16e pre-ordering</a> started today, and the device launches Friday, February 28.<div>Related Roundup: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/iphone-16e/\">iPhone 16e</a></div><div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/magsafe/\">MagSafe</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#iPhone-16e\">iPhone 16e (Buy Now)</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/02/21/iphone-16e-no-magsafe-unrelated-to-c1/\">Apple Denies Speculation Surrounding iPhone 16e's Lack of MagSafe</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-denies-speculation-surrounding-iphone-16es-lack-of-magsafe.2449889/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"ecacc5f9bf321b57bdd1f0b5b0e2c7e9b239ac474c08944ea1ac131d6f58e5dd","category":"Apple"}
