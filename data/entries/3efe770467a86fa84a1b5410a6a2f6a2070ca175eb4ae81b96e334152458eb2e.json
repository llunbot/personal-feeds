It’s one of the most iconic and influential tech gadgets of all time, and everyone wants to know what’s coming next. That Apple is so secretive only heightens the appeal of iPhone rumors and leaks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it should come as little surprise that iPhone 17 rumors, leaks, and info started to circulate months before the iPhone 16 was even formally announced. Here’s everything we know so far, but don’t take any of it as solid info: even when early rumors are accurate, plans can change, and nothing is ever certain until Apple announces it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Updated January 24:</strong> Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says the Dynamic Island will remain relatively unchanged across iPhone 17 models. Some earlier rumors suggested it might be smaller.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 17: Release date</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s something we do know: The new iPhone lineup is almost always announced in September—usually on a Tuesday in the second week of September, to be specific. So we would expect the iPhone 17 line to be announced on or around September 9, 2025. Here’s when the most recent models were released:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>iPhone 15:</strong> September 12, 2023</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPhone 14: </strong>Sepember 7, 2022</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPhone 13:</strong> Sepember 14, 2021</li>\n\n\n\n<li>i<strong>Phone 12:</strong> October 13, 2020 (delayed due to Covid)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Historically, preorders for the iPhone begin on the Friday after the announcement, and the phones ship a week later. On occasion, some specific models may ship a couple of weeks later than the others due to production issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 17: Price</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We haven’t yet heard if the iPhone 17 line will cost the same as the iPhone 16 line. One rumor from a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2405536/iphone-17-leaked-specs-displays-chip-memory-pricing.html\">popular leaker on Weibo</a> contends that the “Plus” model will be replaced by the new “Slim” model that costs more than the Pro Max, though it won’t have the same processor and RAM and the Pro models. The supposed pricing would be:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>iPhone 17</strong>: 6.27-inch LTPO display, A19/8GB ($799)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPhone 17 Pro</strong>: 6.27-inch LTPO display, A19 Pro/12GB ($1,099)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPhone 17 Pro Max</strong>: 6.86-inch LTPO display, A19 Pro/12GB ($1,199)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>iPhone 17 Slim</strong>: 6.65-inch LTPO display, A19/8GB ($1,299)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This would mean a significant upward shift in overall iPhone pricing, with the Pro model jumping up $100 and a new model replacing the Plus with a price of $100 more than the Pro Max.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 17: Colors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We haven’t yet heard anything about what colors to expect from the iPhone 17 line. The iPhone 16 comes in five colors including Ultramarine, Teal, Pink, White and Black. While the iPhone 16 Pro comes in Desert Titanium, Natural Titanium, White Titanium and Black Titanium, which are reminiscent of the classic gold and space gray options. There were rumors that the iPhone 16 would also come in purple, so perhaps that’s in the pipeline for 2025. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 17: New slimmer ‘iPhone 17 Air’ model</h2>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3131_fa79fa.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPad Air M2 vs Pro\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3131_fa79fa.jpeg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 4032w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3131_fa79fa.jpeg?resize=300%2C225&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3131_fa79fa.jpeg?resize=768%2C576&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3131_fa79fa.jpeg?resize=1200%2C900&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3131_fa79fa.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1152&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3131_fa79fa.jpeg?resize=2048%2C1536&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"900\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t<figcaption><p>The iPhone 17 is expected to have an ultra-thin model like the M4 iPad Pro.</p></figcaption></figure><p>Petter Ahrnstedt</p></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Several analysts have reported that the existing Plus model will be replaced by a <strong>new “Slim” model</strong> with a larger screen size and a much thinner body. Analyst Jeff Pu was the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2324602/iphone-17-slim-24mp-front-camera-2025.html\">first to report this change</a> (in May 2024), and in the same month,  The Information <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2337606/the-2025-iphone-could-feature-a-thin-redesigned-ultra-high-end-model.html\">reported on the Slim model</a>, stating that it would be a new even-higher-end model that sits above “Pro Max” in the lineup and would have a centered rear camera and a smaller Dynamic Island.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2419247/apple-will-finally-launch-the-iphone-air-in-2025-leaker-claims.html\">video by Jon Prosser</a> in August 2024 surmises that the slim iPhone will be called the iPhone Air (we agree that makes sense) and <strong>will <em>not</em> be the most expensive in the lineup</strong> (it’s been rumored for years that Apple is planning to launch a new model with higher-end features above the Pro Max), but rather be a mid-priced model that prioritizes form and design over specs, much like the MacBook Air. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, a report by Mark Gurman of Bloomberg in August 2024 claimed the new model will fit between the standard iPhone and the Pro: ” If you want something snazzier than a standard iPhone–but don’t really need the performance, screen size, or cameras of a Pro model–you can get something that looks much cooler while still having the specifications of a regular iPhone.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A report from Jeff Pu in November 2024 claims that the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2525205/get-ready-for-the-iphone-17-air-apples-thinnest-phone-ever.html\">iPhone 17 Air/Slim will be around 6mm thick</a>. That’s thinner than any iPhone so far. The iPhone 16, for context, is 7.8mm thick. The thinnest new iPad Pro is 5.1mm thick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.sisajournal-e.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=408493\">Korea’s Sisa Journal</a> in January 2025, the so-called iPhone 17 Air will be <strong>6.25mm thick</strong> and cost in the <strong>same price range as the iPhone 16 Plus</strong> (starting at $899 U.S.). A <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2574312/the-iphone-17-air-may-be-even-thinner-with-a-mind-blowing-5-5mm-body.html\">medium post from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo</a> stated that the “thinnest part” of the new ultra-slim iPhone is just <strong>5.5mm thick</strong>, but it’s difficult to know what that means without more context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In October 2024 Pu <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/18/iphone-17-air-rumored-features/\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> he expects the phone to have an A19 chip (not A19 Pro), 8GB of RAM, around a 6.6-inch display, an aluminum body, and a single 48MP rear camera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another <a href=\"http://Ajinomoto\">report</a> (in July 2024) suggested that Apple <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2403725/apples-secret-ingredient-for-making-the-iphone-thinner-just-got-delayed-to-2026.html\">won’t use resin-coated copper components</a> on the mainboard due to quality issues with the supplier. This was one of the ways Apple planned to reduce internal space requirements, so it’s unclear if it will have an impact on the iPhone 17 slim model’s overall thickness or not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2584214/iphone-17-air-leak-shows-off-new-camera-bar-design.html\">leaked image in January</a> reportedly showed the case of the new iPhone 17 Air, with prominent “<strong>camera bar</strong>” design.</p>\n\n\n<div><figure><img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iphone-17-air-leak.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all&amp;w=1200\" alt=\"image showing iPhone 17 Air rear case\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iphone-17-air-leak.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iphone-17-air-leak.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iphone-17-air-leak.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iphone-17-air-leak.jpg?resize=1200%2C800&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iphone-17-air-leak.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iphone-17-air-leak.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iphone-17-air-leak.jpg?resize=1240%2C826&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/iphone-17-air-leak.jpg?resize=150%2C100&amp;quality=50&amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure><p>Majin Bu/X</p></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone 17: Rumored specs and features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>All iPhone 17 models have been rumored to feature a <strong><a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/08/02/iphone-17-24mp-front-camera-rumor/\">24MP front-facing camera</a></strong> and the <strong>always-on display</strong> is supposed to <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2251596/report-claims-the-iphone-17-will-finally-get-an-always-on-display.html\">finally be available on the non-Pro models</a>. Some believe that ProMotion will come to the non-Pro models too, since the same LPTO technology that enables the always-on display is what makes ProMotion possible, in Apple’s iPhone implementation. If true, it would be the first time Apple has offered ProMotion on a non-Pro device.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some iPhone 17 models (maybe even all of them) will have a <strong><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2555317/leaked-iphone-17-frame-shows-wide-pixel-style-camera-bump.html\">new camera bump</a></strong>, a wide rectangular raised area that stretches across the phone similar in style to Google’s Pixel line. According to a leaked image of one iPhone 17 aluminum frame (we don’t know from which model), it will be substantial in size. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple is also <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2270684/iphone-17-anti-glare-scratch-resistant-display.html\">said to be working with Corning</a> on a <strong>new anti-glare and scratch-resistant glass</strong> for the iPhone 17 lineup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All iPhone 17 models are expected to have <strong>aluminum frames and bodies</strong> (with glass), rather than steel frames or titanium bodies in the Pro models today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2406933/report-at-least-one-iphone-17-model-to-feature-a-mechanical-aperture.html\">report from The Information</a> in July 2024 claims that “at least one” model will feature a <strong>mechanical aperture</strong>, which would be new for iPhones but has been seen in a handful of Android phones so far.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don’t know much about what chips will power the iPhone 17 line, but we expect the high-end models (Pro and possibly Slim) will get an <strong>A19 Pro</strong>, while the non-Pro models may get a standard or cut-back version of the A19, or perhaps a more souped up variant of the A18.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Apple bumped every iPhone 16 model to 8GB of RAM due to the demands of Apple Intelligence, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2441215/\">rumors</a> have suggested Apple will increase the memory in the iPhone 17 Pro models to <strong>12GB</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An October 2024 <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/10/18/iphone-17-pro-rumored-features/\">research note</a> from analyst Jeff Pu corroborated these claims, and added that the iPhone 17 Pro would feature a <strong>48MP telephoto camera</strong> along with a new <strong>24MP front camera</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to wireless, the cellular modem is likely to still be supplied by Qualcomm; Apple’s own efforts to produce a top-tier 5G modem seem to be stalled and likely won’t be ready in time for next year’s iPhone 17 line. <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/828757/wi-fi-7-speed-latency-apple-devices.html\">Wi-Fi 7 support</a> seems likely, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>iPhone history</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><br />The iPhone 16 range and the iPhone SE 3 are the current-generation models available from Apple. In addition to this SE 4 model we’re also expecting <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2393967/iphone-17-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html\">iPhone 17</a> to launch in 2025.
