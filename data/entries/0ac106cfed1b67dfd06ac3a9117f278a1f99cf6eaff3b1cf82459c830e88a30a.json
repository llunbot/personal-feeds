And Amazon is offering such a deal. You can get a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5M7S6K?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">M1 MacBook Air with a 256GB SSD and a 7-core GPU for $849</a>, which is a $150 savings off the MRSP. If you want a bigger SSD you can get the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LFLC3?tag=macworld05-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\">same M1 MacBook Air but with a 512GB SSD for $1,099</a>, also a $150 savings. In order to activate the discounted prices, you must add the laptop to your cart and proceed to checkout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One important note: Amazon says it is currently awaiting stock of the M1 MacBook Air, so ship dates are in October.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I mentioned, we here at Macworld love the M1 MacBook Air because it’s a terrific combination of a small laptop with big performance. When we gave the M1 MacBook Air a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234819/macbook-air-m1-review-an-absolutely-stunning-debut-for-apple-silicon-in-a-mac.html\">4.5-star rating</a>, we were blown away by the huge performance gains it had over its Intel-based predecessor. And it actually performs well compared to the current M1 13-inch MacBook Pro—it’s incrementally slower, but you probably would not even notice. It also has a super-long battery life and a great Retina display.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<h4>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</h4>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h3>MacBook Air (M1, 2020)</h3>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/macbook-air-m1.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" /></div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMSRP:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$999 (256GB) | $1,249 (512GB)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/321564/633495/10014?prodsku=5721600&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.bestbuy.com%2Fclick%2F-%2F5721600%2Fpdp&amp;intsrc=CATF_4831&amp;subid1=1-1-355485-5-340033-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$949.99 at Best Buy</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5M7S6K?tag=macworld05-20&amp;linkCode=ogi&amp;th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;asc_refurl=https://www.macworld.com/feed\" target=\"_blank\">$998.00 at Amazon</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span> | </span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/435031/7613?u=https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-air&amp;subid1=1-1-355485-5-340033-9934\" target=\"_blank\">$999 at Apple</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n</div>","author":"Roman Loyola","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"0ac106cfed1b67dfd06ac3a9117f278a1f99cf6eaff3b1cf82459c830e88a30a","category":"Apple"}
