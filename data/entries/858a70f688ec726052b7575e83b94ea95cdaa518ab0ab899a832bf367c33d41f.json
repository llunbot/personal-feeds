The people are unaware of why the silo was built, and those who seek the truth face deadly consequences. Rebecca Ferguson stars as Juliette Nichols, an engineer who attempts to unravel the mysteries surrounding the silo following a loved one's murder. The show is based on Hugh Howey's best-selling book series.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple says the season two finale of Silo is available to stream starting today, although eagle-eyed fans will know it was actually released at 9 p.m. Eastern Time last night. Severance's season two premiere was released at the exact same time.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple recently announced that Silo will be a four-season show, allowing for the complete story from Howey's book series to be acted out.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSeverance, meanwhile, is a critically-acclaimed workplace thriller revolving around the mysterious company Lumon Industries. The company's employees cannot recall any memories about their personal lives while they are at work, and likewise they cannot remember anything about the workplace when they leave the office. The series has an ensemble cast that includes Adam Scott, Britt Lower, Tramell Tillman, Zach Cherry, and others.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2022/12/Severance-Apple-TV-Plus-Banner.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\" />\r<br />\nIn the second season, Apple says the employees \"learn the dire consequences of trifling with the severance barrier, leading them further down a path of woe.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSeverance was created by Dan Erickson, and Ben Stiller serves as an executive producer.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nApple TV+ costs $9.99 per month or $99 per year in the U.S., and the streaming service is also included in all Apple One subscription bundles.<div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-plus/\">Apple TV Plus</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/apple-tv-shows/\">Apple TV Shows</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2025/01/17/apple-tv-big-day-with-severance-and-silo/\">Apple TV+ Has Big Day With 'Severance' Return and 'Silo' Season Finale</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-tv-has-big-day-with-severance-return-and-silo-season-finale.2447574/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Joe Rossignol","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"858a70f688ec726052b7575e83b94ea95cdaa518ab0ab899a832bf367c33d41f","category":"Apple"}
