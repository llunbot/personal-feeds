We got our first taste of it in iOS/iPadOS 18.1 and macOS 15.1, but it was limited. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we have mentioned before, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2369986/apple-intelligence-siri-features-coming-after-ios-18-launch.html\">Apple Intelligence is a gradual rollout</a>, and some of the most exciting features are coming in the iOS/iPadOS 18.2 and macOS 15.2 releases in December. We’ll get ChatGPT integration, image generation features, Visual Intelligence on iPhone 16, Mail categories, and an expansion to additional markets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what Apple has on the way in December.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New hardware</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple rarely releases any new hardware in December. It’s not unprecedented for a surprise new product to arrive—Apple launched the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/234986/airpods-max-review.html\">AirPods Max</a> in 2020 as a surprise drop—but we’re not hearing any rumors about anything that could pop up in December. Also Apple doesn’t have any announced products that haven’t released yet (like the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/230880/imac-pro-review-mac-pro-power-in-the-shape-of-an-imac.html\">iMac Pro</a> in 2017) so it should be a quiet month as far as hardware is concerned.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Apps and software updates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s anything but quiet for software, however. More Apple Intelligence is on the way in the big December OS updates, along with a host of other tweaks and improvements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>iOS/iPadOS 18.2:</strong> Adds Image Playground, Genmoji, Image Wand in Notes, and Visual Intelligence (on iPhone 16). Plus auto-categories in the Mail app and ChatGPT integration in Siri and writing tools, AF/AE lock for the iPhone 16 Camera Control, sharing AirTag locations, and more. Apple Intelligence expands to English in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the UK with this release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>macOS 15.2:</strong> Adds all the same features as iOS 18.2, except for those specific to the iPhone 16 (Visual Intelligence and Camera Control changes).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Services</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Apple TV+</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are the shows, series, and movies we expect to release on Apple TV+ in TK.
