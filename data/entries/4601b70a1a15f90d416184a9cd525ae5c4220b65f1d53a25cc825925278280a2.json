The new Rear Top Tube Bag rounds out (<em>or maybe triangulates?</em>) Tailfin’s already solid menu of frame, toptube &amp; downtube bags. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tailfin describes the space in front of the seatpost as an often-overlooked area to add practical, easily-accessible storage, without the interference to pedaling that can happen with larger volume top tube bags. In addition, they says that their new Rear Top Tube Bag addresses common shortcomings in other rear top tube bags, such as instability, bulging, water ingress, poor zipper access, and aesthetic compromises. Tailfin suggests that this Rear Top Tube Bag spot is most useful for storing tools and spares.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although, it could clearly be perfect for a diagonally-cut 1/2 sandwich, as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Great things in a small package for MTB, Gravel, or Road</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2400\" height=\"1600\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TAILFIN-REAR-TOP-TUBE-BAG-LAUNCH-10.webp\" alt=\"A Tailfin Rear Top Tube Bag on a Specialized Epic MTB. \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TAILFIN-REAR-TOP-TUBE-BAG-LAUNCH-10.webp 2400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TAILFIN-REAR-TOP-TUBE-BAG-LAUNCH-10-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TAILFIN-REAR-TOP-TUBE-BAG-LAUNCH-10-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TAILFIN-REAR-TOP-TUBE-BAG-LAUNCH-10-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TAILFIN-REAR-TOP-TUBE-BAG-LAUNCH-10-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TAILFIN-REAR-TOP-TUBE-BAG-LAUNCH-10-2048x1365.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TAILFIN-REAR-TOP-TUBE-BAG-LAUNCH-10-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TAILFIN-REAR-TOP-TUBE-BAG-LAUNCH-10-720x480.webp 720w\" /><figcaption>The MTB-sized Rear Top Tube Bag is shorter and wider, to better work with a dropped saddle. The Road/Gravel version is taller, but thinner to accommodate a narrower pedaling stance.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Rear Top Tube Bag’s minimal appearance hides a wealth of small intelligent designs, that Tailfin says come based on years of testing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the surface, Hypalon and Ripstop Nylon fabrics are 3D-welded together with a waterproof zipper to create a seamless, tapered, and fully watertight package. Tailfin’s patented Zipper Gutter maintains waterproofing despite its reversed zipper orientation.  But importantly, this back-to-front zipper orientation enhances access and visibility of what’s inside, especially helpful on small frames or when dropper posts are lowered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside, a lightweight structure of diagonally-aligned carbon struts offers reinforcement. And a removable insole cushions contents, also making the interior easy to clean without detaching the bag from the frame. Outside, Tailfin’s next-gen V-Mount system offers multiple frame attachment points with their TPU Cargo Straps. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Combined, this design is stable and prevents deformation, ensuring effortless one-handed zipper use.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tailfin Rear Top Tube Bag – Pricing, options &amp; availability</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure><img width=\"2400\" height=\"1601\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/REAR-TOP-TUBE-BAG-CONTENTS.webp\" alt=\"Tailfin's Rear Top Tube Bag shown next to an assortment of spares and tools. \" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/REAR-TOP-TUBE-BAG-CONTENTS.webp 2400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/REAR-TOP-TUBE-BAG-CONTENTS-297x198.webp 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/REAR-TOP-TUBE-BAG-CONTENTS-1536x1025.webp 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/REAR-TOP-TUBE-BAG-CONTENTS-120x80.webp 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/REAR-TOP-TUBE-BAG-CONTENTS-768x512.webp 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/REAR-TOP-TUBE-BAG-CONTENTS-2048x1366.webp 2048w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/REAR-TOP-TUBE-BAG-CONTENTS-800x533.webp 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/REAR-TOP-TUBE-BAG-CONTENTS-720x480.webp 720w\" /><figcaption>The Rear Top Tube Bags are large enough to hold all the tools you need, but most likely not your phone.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Tailfin Rear Top Tube Bag comes in two versions, both available now, sized and shaped either for MTB or Road/Gravel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 0.8L Road/Gravel version of the Rear Top Tube Bag weighs 109g and features a taller (139mm high), narrower (36-45mm wide) profile with a trailing edge angle of 100° to match nearly horizontal toptubes and common dropbar bike seat angles. The 0.9L MTB version weighs 112g and has a wider (42-50mm), shorter (124mm tall) profile with an 85° angle, better-suited for sloping MTB toptube layouts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both Tailfin Rear Top Tube Bag for either Road/Gravel and MTB sell for the same $80 / 70€ and include 3 stretchy Cargo Straps. In most cases, Tailfin thinks you’ll just use 2 straps around the toptube, but there are attachment points at the back to secure the bags to the seatpost if you plan to carry especially heavy gear inside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://www.tailfin.cc/\">Tailfin.cc</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/tailfin-adds-tiny-triangle-rear-top-tube-bag/\">Tailfin Brings Cargo Closer With Tiny Triangular Rear Top Tube Bag</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com\">Bikerumor</a>.</p>","author":"Bennett Shane","siteTitle":"Bikerumor","siteHash":"49f427af0a926f4232eb837006841d7242e153e3afbb590f32e4b104ea3e2718","entryHash":"4601b70a1a15f90d416184a9cd525ae5c4220b65f1d53a25cc825925278280a2","category":"Cycling"}
