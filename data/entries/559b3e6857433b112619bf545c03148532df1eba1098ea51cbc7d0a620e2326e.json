Chain degreasers are liquid magic. They strip oil and gunk from your bike’s chain, cassette and jockey wheels, not only to keep them running smoothly, but to make them last longer as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are lots of degreasers on the market, from powerful solvents to easy-spray foam and water-based solutions, all promising the same results via different methods. But don’t be overwhelmed by the choice. All the degreasers we’ve recommended below will do the job; they just work in different ways and some might be more suitable than others, depending on your individual circumstances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this guide, we teamed up with <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/wobblywheelcyclery/\" target=\"_blank\">Wobbly Wheel Cyclery</a> in Sheffield to access lots of bikes with dirty chains – the more grime the better! For each chain cleaned, we coated it in degreaser, agitated it with the same stiff bristle brush, then rinsed or wiped it clean with either a dry rag or wet sponge, as per the manufacturer’s instructions. We didn’t use a chain cleaning tool, partly to emulate the minimal setup that most cyclists will have at home, and this way it was easier to compare like-for-like performance against solvent degreasers that don’t require any scrubbing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read on for our roundup of the best chain degreasers for cyclists. If you need to brush up on the basics first, check our handy bike maintenance guides. We can walk you through <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-clean-bike-chain\">how to clean your bike chain</a>, step by step, or you can potentially save yourself some wasted time by first familiarising yourself with <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/tutorials/how-to-check-your-bikes-chain-for-wear-and-stretch\">how to check your bike’s chain for wear</a>.

It comes with a trigger spray and is safe on all materials including rubber, plastic and anodised metals, so there’s no risk to your components.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It works fast: just spray generously over the chain, cassette and derailleur, leave it for a minute, then agitate with a brush or chain cleaning tool. In testing, it shifted a significant amount of grime with minimal effort, though it didn’t leave the chain spotless. A quick rinse with water and a sponge helped reveal much cleaner metal underneath.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One drawback is the spray pattern: it’s wide and tends to overshoot, making it messy and a little wasteful, especially in tight spaces. That said, a little goes a long way. The strong chemical smell is another thing to consider: it’s best used outside or in well-ventilated areas. Still, for overall cleaning power and ease of use, it’s a solid choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: A household name for a reason, Muc-Off’s powerful, biodegradable water-based degreaser is easy to use and delivers strong results, though its wide spray can be wasteful and smelly.</p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div>\r\n                <div>\r\n                   <div>\r\n

components</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Fresh, low-odour formula suitable for indoor use</strong></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Clings well and lifts grime quickly</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Juice Lubes Dirt Juice is a biodegradable, water-based degreaser that performs well and offers good value for money. It’s safe for use on carbon fibre, metals, rubber, plastic and seals, and designed to clean all bike types. While it’s a drivetrain-specific cleaner, the brand does state that it can be used on any other parts of the bike that are caked with grease and grime.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Used straight from the bottle and sprayed directly onto the chain, it clings well and starts breaking down grime almost instantly.

It dispenses a dense, shaving foam-like consistency through a thin precision nozzle, which makes for a controlled application. Unlike some sprays that blast out uncontrollably, this one lets you slowly layer the foam along the chain in a neat line, reducing waste and overspray. Of all the foaming cleaners, this is the easiest to control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It sits well on the chain without dripping off, which is great for indoor use or quick top-up cleans. There’s no harsh smell either, just a faint scent that’s barely noticeable.

With a plant-based, biodegradable formula free from phosphates and acids, it’s designed to offer serious cleaning power without the environmental baggage of harsher solvents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In practice, it does a solid job of cutting through grime. It shifts dirt effectively, though like most water-based cleaners, it struggles slightly with caked-on grease and might leave behind some residue on especially filthy drivetrains. That said, if you’re spending the money on Silca degreaser, you’re probably precious about your bike and keeping it clean already. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The degreaser oxidises on contact with metal, turning a deep red: a dramatic visual touch that some folks might appreciate. Unfortunately like many of the other cleaners on this list, application is a stumbling point. The standard spray nozzle emits a wide mist that’s hard to control. It’s great for brakes, cassettes and derailleurs, but still likely to result in wasted product, and for a cleaner priced at £30 for just under half a litre, you don’t really want it to end up on the floor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scent-wise, Silca promises cinnamon, but the reality is… odd. Not enough to clear the room, but definitely best used outdoors or in a well-ventilated area, unless you happen to like it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Verdict</strong>: Eco-friendly degreaser that works incredibly well with minimal fuss.

They cling well to components, but often need a second application for deep cleaning.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Application and waste</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Most chain cleaners come in spray bottles or aerosols. Trigger sprays tend to emit a wide fan of spray, which can lead to wasted product on the floor. Aerosols with straw applicators are more precise, but often come with environmental trade-offs, plus they often have a strong smell and can fill a workshop with fumes if you use a lot without good ventilation. Foam-based options tend to be neater, but if overapplied, they can also be wasteful. Whichever format you choose, applying the degreaser directly to the chain in short, controlled bursts will help to reduce waste and give you more value for your money.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Environmental impact</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Biodegradable formulas are increasingly becoming the norm now, and they’re generally safe to rinse off into drains. However, solvent-based aerosols often contain VOCs (volatile organic compounds), which are less environmentally-friendly and should be used sparingly and outdoors. If you’re keen to reduce your environmental footprint, opt for a brand that offers refills and concentrated formulas that you can dilute and use for longer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Value for money</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>More expensive doesn’t always mean better. Some premium degreasers offer luxury packaging or subtle scent gimmicks, but perform similarly to cheaper, biodegradable options. What matters most is how dirty your drivetrain gets, how frequently you clean it, and whether you prioritise convenience, potency, or environmental impact. A well-priced degreaser that gets the job done without requiring loads of product (or waste) offers the best long-term value for money.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Can I clean my chain with WD40?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Not ideally, but you can if you wish. While WD40 does have degreasing properties, the standard multi-use version is more of a water dispersant and light lubricant, so it’s not designed to cut through heavy grime. There is a specific WD40 Bike Degreaser, which would be more appropriate, but regular WD40 won’t match the cleaning power of purpose-built chain degreasers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Can I clean my chain with washing up liquid?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Washing up liquid can work in a pinch, but again it’s not ideal. It’s designed to break down food grease, not drivetrain gunk, and may struggle with stubborn grime. It also doesn’t rinse away chain oil properly and could leave a residue. If you do use it, be sure to rinse and wipe it thoroughly to remove as much residue as possible, and re-lube your chain afterwards. For regular maintenance, dedicated bike chain degreasers are far more effective.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>How often should I degrease my drivetrain?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It depends on your riding conditions and mileage. As a general rule, try to clean your chain and drivetrain every 100-200km if you’re riding in wet or muddy conditions, or every 300-500km in dry weather. If your chain looks black and sticky or makes noise while you pedal, it’s definitely time for a clean.

Foam-based or thick degreasers work well with a brush, while thin liquids may benefit from a tool to capture and recycle the cleaner. This can be a great way to reduce the amount of degreaser that ends up on the floor as well, and make the product go further.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Do I need to re-lube the chain after cleaning?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. Degreasers strip away all lubricant as well as dirt. After cleaning and drying your chain, always apply fresh chain lube to prevent your chain from rusting and keep it running smoothly for longer. Be sure to check out our guide to the <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-bike-chain-lubes\">best bike chain lube</a> if you need to stock up.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Can I use drivetrain degreasers on other parts of the bike?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many drivetrain degreasers are safe for use on other metal components, including derailleurs and cassettes. Some are even suitable for frame and brake cleaning as is, while others will stipulate that you should dilute the formula first. Always check the label, though. Certain formulas might be too harsh for delicate components or finishes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>What’s the difference between a degreaser and a general bike cleaner?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Degreasers are formulated to cut through oil, grease and grime, particularly on the drivetrain, while general <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-bike-cleaner\">bike cleaners</a> are milder and better suited to removing dust, dirt and road grime from the frame, wheels and other components. Using a drivetrain cleaner on your frame would be overkill, while using a frame cleaner on your chain won’t get it properly clean. As we mentioned above, there’s also a risk of using harsh solvents on delicate bike parts, so it’s always best to check the label and use a product the way the manufacturers intended.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/newsletters\"><img width=\"970\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-970x351.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-970x351.jpg 970w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-300x109.jpg 300w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-768x278.jpg 768w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-1536x556.jpg 1536w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-2048x741.jpg 2048w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-750x271.jpg 750w, https://dqh479dn9vg99.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2024/10/Newsletter-flash-1-1140x412.jpg 1140w\" /></a><figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk/buying-guides/best-bike-chain-cleaner\">Best bike chain cleaners 2025 reviewed: Degreasers and drivetrain cleaners</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://www.cyclist.co.uk\">Cyclist</a>.</p>","author":"Pnorman","siteTitle":"Cyclist.co.uk","siteHash":"561486e7070fa5351de9318ad0fa26c2a39332acba5fc7c7d1694a01d53d431e","entryHash":"559b3e6857433b112619bf545c03148532df1eba1098ea51cbc7d0a620e2326e","category":"Cycling"}
