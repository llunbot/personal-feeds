The outlet says that code in tvOS 17 suggests that Apple Music and Apple Podcasts are the first apps being rewritten to be compatible with the new display, which will show a blurred animation based on the colors of the album art when a song or podcast is playing. The screen could also potentially show important notifications. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<div><blockquote><p>An Engineering build HomePod frameshell with a completely different glass on top- it‚Äôs set for touchscreen, with black bezel<br />The design of shell is similar to HomePod 2nd gen's, not the 1st gen‚Äîit stands Ô£ø might decided add üñ•Ô∏è for 2's but not at last, OR it‚Äôs next generation <a href=\"https://t.co/W5zRIVGPiK\">pic.twitter.com/W5zRIVGPiK</a></p>‚Äî Kosutami (@KosutamiSan) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KosutamiSan/status/1715670862773514358?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 21, 2023</a></blockquote>  </div>\r<br />\n<em>Bloomberg</em> reporter Mark Gurman was first to suggest in <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/22/apple-speakers-with-screens-and-cameras-report/\">2021</a> that Apple is working on new HomePods with displays and cameras.
