With missing features and bugs, customers complained about a loss of functionality and hardware not working the way it should. As Sonos deals with the expensive repercussions, a report from <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-09-23/how-sonos-botched-an-app-and-infuriated-its-customers\">Bloomberg</a> today highlights how Sonos allowed the release of an update so buggy and incomplete as to overturn its goodwill with long-standing customers.</p>\n<p>Illustrating how poorly this app update has gone, last month<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/pained-by-having-let-you-down-sonos-apologizes-for-app-failures/\">,</a> <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/07/pained-by-having-let-you-down-sonos-apologizes-for-app-failures/\">Sonos CEO</a> Patrick Spence said the company would spend <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/app-redesign-blowback-will-cost-sonos-up-to-30-million-ceo-says/\">$20 million to $30 million</a> in the short term to get the app where it needs to be (which is, basically, functioning as well as the predecessor) and rebuild customer and partner trust. Sonos also expects to miss its annual revenue target by $200 million. This is partially due to its delay of two hardware releases to focus on the app. Bloomberg noted that “Sonos shares are down 25% this year.” Annual bonuses and merit-based raises have also reportedly been canceled.</p>\n<h2>Outdated code</h2>\n<p>One reason for the app’s failure is the outdated code and infrastructure that the prior app was running on. Anonymous employees Bloomberg spoke with claimed that the Sonos app’s <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/agile/software-development/technical-debt\">technical debt</a> had been building up for 20 years before the update.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051728#p3\">Read 16 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2051728&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Scharon Harding","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"e9ece7e1ed5e496433293e5e721437b2d59b8fc5658ed96c083278e6328baf8f","category":"Tech"}
