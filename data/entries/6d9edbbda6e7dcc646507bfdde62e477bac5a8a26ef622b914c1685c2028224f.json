RCs precede a public launch and mark the final version of the software that will be provided to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/iphone/\">iPhone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipad/\">iPad</a> users. \r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2023/04/iOS-16.6-Feature.jpg\" alt width=\"2500\" height=\"1406\" />\r<br />\nRegistered developers can opt in to the betas by opening up the Settings app, going to Software Update, tapping on the “Beta Updates” option and toggling on the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-16/\">iOS 16</a> Developer Beta.

The feature is meant to let Apple device owners verify that they are messaging with the people they intend to message rather than a malicious entity that has intercepted a message or is eavesdropping on a conversation.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nIn the first beta, hints of iMessage Contact Key were available, but the option was not fully enabled and the references have since been removed, so it remains unclear if this is something we can expect to see in iOS 16.6. \r<br />\n<div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ios-16/\">iOS 16</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/ipados-16/\">iPadOS 16</a></div><div>Related Forum: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/ios-16.238\">iOS 16</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/07/18/apple-releases-ios-16-6-rc/\">Apple Seeds Release Candidate Versions of iOS 16.6 and iPadOS 16.6 to Developers</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/apple-seeds-release-candidate-versions-of-ios-16-6-and-ipados-16-6-to-developers.2396240/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"6d9edbbda6e7dcc646507bfdde62e477bac5a8a26ef622b914c1685c2028224f","category":"Apple"}
