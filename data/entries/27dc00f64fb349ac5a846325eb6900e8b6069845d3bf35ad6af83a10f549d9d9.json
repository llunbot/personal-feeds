Ride Group is an organization committed to fighting for the rights of the LGBTQ+ community within all aspects of cycling. As such, Baphomet has partnered up with the Radavist to raffle off a full bike with all proceeds going directly to <a href=\"https://www.ridegroup.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Ride Group</a>!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/10/Baphomet-Bicycles-New-Mexico-Single-Speed-Rigid-MTB-7.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/10/Baphomet-Bicycles-New-Mexico-Single-Speed-Rigid-MTB-19.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/10/Baphomet-Bicycles-New-Mexico-Single-Speed-Rigid-MTB-22.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>This project began as simply building a bike for a show. However, it rapidly morphed into something so much bigger. This bike will be the first of many charity raffle bikes and this one is meant to represent all I find truly amazing about cycling—simplicity, and eagerness for adventure! The ability to cruise around comfortably, or pack up for a multi-day adventure into the beautiful natural spaces. This is exactly what I want out of a bike, so that’s what I made for you! Living in the Land of Enchantment means I am lucky to be surrounded by talented makers and artists who share my drive to make the world of cycling more inclusive. That’s why this bike shares the colour scheme of our state license plate alongside some special southwest graphics from the Radavist and Send It Safely.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.theradavist.com/uploads/2021/10/Baphomet-Bicycles-New-Mexico-Single-Speed-Rigid-MTB-36.jpg?fit=1024,9999&amp;quality=75\" /></p>\n<p>If you want to win this custom-built New Mexico-themed bike assembled at <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sincerecycles/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Sincere Cycles</a> in Santa Fe, all you have to do is follow these simple instructions:<br />\n-go to <a href=\"https://www.ridegroup.org/wristbands\" target=\"_blank\">www.ridegroup.org/wristbands</a> and purchase at least one Baphomet Bike Raffle + Wristband.<br />\n-Once you do, send your receipt to <a href=\"mailto:sendit@baphometbicycles.com\" target=\"_blank\">sendit@baphometbicycles.com</a> and you will receive one entry to the raffle per “Baphomet Bike Raffle + Wristband” that you purchase.<br />\n-That’s it! </p>\n<p>When the raffle is over the winner will receive an email from Baphomet Bikes saying you have won and get the bike shipped out to wherever you are.
