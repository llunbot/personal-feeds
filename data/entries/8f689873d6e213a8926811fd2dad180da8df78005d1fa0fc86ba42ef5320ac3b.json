Jeffsy has always been YT’s action-packed happy-medium bike – in between their shorter- and longer-travel mountain bikes. But now they fully embrace versatility with a new Jeffsy mk3 that dials-in that sweet spot of mid-travel suspension, with refined geometry that’s now more confident going uphill or down. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2023 YT Jeffsy mk3 mid-travel trail mountain bike</h2>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, it’s a new bike that aims to be the mountain biker’s best friend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shifting a bit in how YT talk about it, what was once an all-mountain bike is now a trail bike. But really, that’s less to say about Jeffsy itself, and more about how we ride trails now. And how capable modern mountain bikes can be. With more mountain bikers riding more technical trails, trail bikes have stepped up to the challenge. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/YT-Jeffsy-v3-carbon-trail-bike_mid-travel-145mm-all-mountain-bike_2023-YT-Jeffsy-Core-5-CF-complete.jpg\"><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/YT-Jeffsy-v3-carbon-trail-bike_mid-travel-145mm-all-mountain-bike_2023-YT-Jeffsy-Core-5-CF-complete.jpg\" alt=\"2023 YT Jeffsy mk3 trail bike, 145mm all-mountain bike, Core % CF complete\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/YT-Jeffsy-v3-carbon-trail-bike_mid-travel-145mm-all-mountain-bike_2023-YT-Jeffsy-Core-5-CF-complete.jpg 2000w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/YT-Jeffsy-v3-carbon-trail-bike_mid-travel-145mm-all-mountain-bike_2023-YT-Jeffsy-Core-5-CF-complete-297x167.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/YT-Jeffsy-v3-carbon-trail-bike_mid-travel-145mm-all-mountain-bike_2023-YT-Jeffsy-Core-5-CF-complete-800x450.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/YT-Jeffsy-v3-carbon-trail-bike_mid-travel-145mm-all-mountain-bike_2023-YT-Jeffsy-Core-5-CF-complete-120x68.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/YT-Jeffsy-v3-carbon-trail-bike_mid-travel-145mm-all-mountain-bike_2023-YT-Jeffsy-Core-5-CF-complete-768x432.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/YT-Jeffsy-v3-carbon-trail-bike_mid-travel-145mm-all-mountain-bike_2023-YT-Jeffsy-Core-5-CF-complete-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/YT-Jeffsy-v3-carbon-trail-bike_mid-travel-145mm-all-mountain-bike_2023-YT-Jeffsy-Core-5-CF-complete-400x225.jpg 400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/YT-Jeffsy-v3-carbon-trail-bike_mid-travel-145mm-all-mountain-bike_2023-YT-Jeffsy-Core-5-CF-complete-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" /></a><figcaption>(Ride Photos/YT)</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Jeffsy is a bit smaller of a bike overall, but it really does feel more capable than ever in this latest iteration.

So stay tuned for a First Rides Review coming soon.

At the same time, it also dials it back a bit to 145mm of rear wheel travel. <em>Vs. 150mm on the mk2 29er or even 160 on mk2 27.5″ bikes</em>. And the new bikes pair with 150mm travel forks. That really drops it more in a logical middle ground between YT’s <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/yt-izzo-130mm-trail-bike-updated-with-new-core-models-starting-from-3399/\" target=\"_blank\">130mm Izzo</a> and their <a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/yt-capra-mkiii-29er-and-mx-bikes-land-with-limited-edition-launch-goat-model/\" target=\"_blank\">170mm travel Capra</a> enduro bikes.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/YT-Jeffsy-v3-carbon-trail-bike_mid-travel-145mm-all-mountain-bike_V4L-four-bar-suspension.jpg\"><img width=\"1800\" height=\"1200\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/YT-Jeffsy-v3-carbon-trail-bike_mid-travel-145mm-all-mountain-bike_V4L-four-bar-suspension.jpg\" alt=\"2023 YT Jeffsy mk3 trail bike, 145mm all-mountain bike,V4l suspension detail\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/YT-Jeffsy-v3-carbon-trail-bike_mid-travel-145mm-all-mountain-bike_V4L-four-bar-suspension.jpg 1800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/YT-Jeffsy-v3-carbon-trail-bike_mid-travel-145mm-all-mountain-bike_V4L-four-bar-suspension-297x198.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/YT-Jeffsy-v3-carbon-trail-bike_mid-travel-145mm-all-mountain-bike_V4L-four-bar-suspension-800x533.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/YT-Jeffsy-v3-carbon-trail-bike_mid-travel-145mm-all-mountain-bike_V4L-four-bar-suspension-120x80.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/YT-Jeffsy-v3-carbon-trail-bike_mid-travel-145mm-all-mountain-bike_V4L-four-bar-suspension-768x512.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/YT-Jeffsy-v3-carbon-trail-bike_mid-travel-145mm-all-mountain-bike_V4L-four-bar-suspension-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/YT-Jeffsy-v3-carbon-trail-bike_mid-travel-145mm-all-mountain-bike_V4L-four-bar-suspension-720x480.jpg 720w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But while travel is slightly reduced, YT refined the V4L four-bar suspension kinematics. Newly improved support at the bike’s deep 30% sag setting improves pedaling efficiency on the flats and climbs – without making the bike harsh over small bumps. Then, later in the travel, increased end stroke progression still means a more bottomless, supportive feel – even with that 5mm less travel at the rear wheel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Jeffsy is actually more capable as ever, retaining its gravity bike inspiration combined with newly optimized acceleration.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Contemporary trail geometry</h3>\n\n\n\n<figure><a href=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-YT-Jeffsy-mk3-trail-bike_mid-travel-145mm-all-mountain-bike_updated-geometry.jpg\"><img width=\"2400\" height=\"1000\" src=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-YT-Jeffsy-mk3-trail-bike_mid-travel-145mm-all-mountain-bike_updated-geometry.jpg\" alt=\"2023 YT Jeffsy mk3 trail bike, 145mm all-mountain bike, updated geometry\" srcset=\"https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-YT-Jeffsy-mk3-trail-bike_mid-travel-145mm-all-mountain-bike_updated-geometry.jpg 2400w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-YT-Jeffsy-mk3-trail-bike_mid-travel-145mm-all-mountain-bike_updated-geometry-297x124.jpg 297w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-YT-Jeffsy-mk3-trail-bike_mid-travel-145mm-all-mountain-bike_updated-geometry-800x333.jpg 800w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-YT-Jeffsy-mk3-trail-bike_mid-travel-145mm-all-mountain-bike_updated-geometry-120x50.jpg 120w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-YT-Jeffsy-mk3-trail-bike_mid-travel-145mm-all-mountain-bike_updated-geometry-768x320.jpg 768w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-YT-Jeffsy-mk3-trail-bike_mid-travel-145mm-all-mountain-bike_updated-geometry-1536x640.jpg 1536w, https://bikerumor.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/2023-YT-Jeffsy-mk3-trail-bike_mid-travel-145mm-all-mountain-bike_updated-geometry-2048x853.jpg 2048w\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The geometry of the gen3 Jeffsy is also refined to complement that suspension tweak.
