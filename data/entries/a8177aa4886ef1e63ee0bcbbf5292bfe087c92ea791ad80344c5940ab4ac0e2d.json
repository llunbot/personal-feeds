The LPTO panels feature 120Hz ProMotion support and a 1Hz refresh rate capability that enables an idle Lock Screen to stay visible without significantly impacting battery.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nSamsung's early start doesn't necessarily mean the end for BOE as an Apple supplier, according to the report. The Chinese display panel maker is reportedly showing progress in solving the light leak issue, and could start supplying OLED panels for ‌iPhone 15‌ within the year.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe ‌iPhone 15‌ series is expected to arrive in September, as usual.
