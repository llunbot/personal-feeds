The maximum rate of oxygen consumption is your VO2 max.</p>\n<p>In other words, your VO2 max defines the size of your aerobic engine. The bigger this engine is, the more power can be produced via this energy system.</p>\n<p>VO2 max is usually measured as the volume of oxygen (ml) that’s consumed per kg of body weight per minute, or ml/kg/min for short (a relative measurement). It can also be expressed without taking body weight into account too (an absolute measurement).</p>\n<p>VO2 max is measured in the lab. But you can get an indication of how your VO2 max might be changing by testing your maximum power over five-to-six-minute efforts or taking a ramp test using a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-smart-trainer/\">smart trainer</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/best-indoor-cycling-apps/\">indoor cycling app</a>.</p>\n<h2>What’s a good VO2 max?</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Annemiek Van Vleuten\" title=\"Annemiek Van Vleuten\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Elite male and female riders have VO2 max figures of around 80-90ml/kg/min and 60-70ml/kg/min respectively.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Justin Setterfield / Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>The average sedentary male has a VO2 max of 35 to 40ml/kg/min.

You’ll typically need to up your volume of training and make your workouts more specific and targeted.</p>\n<p>Elite athletes operate at or very close to their genetic maximum and so large jumps in aerobic capacity for them are very difficult to achieve.</p>\n<p>However, in our experience, it’s pretty rare for the average cyclist who is fitting training around work and life commitments to hit their genetic ceiling, so VO2 max usually has some scope for improvement.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"French triathlete Ludovic Chorgnon trains on an exercise bike in a sauna in La Possesion, on the French Indian Ocean island of La Reunion, on June 17, 2022. - Chorgnon, 50, is training for the \" title=\"TRIATHLON-IRONMAN-FRA-OVERSEAS-LA REUNION-US-DESERT-HEAT\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Slowing the decline in VO2 max as you age is an achievement.</span></figcaption><span> <i>RICHARD BOUHET/AFP via Getty Images</i></span></div>\n<p>Other factors that impact VO2 max include gender (females have lower VO2 max values, as mentioned above) and age (VO2 max typically declines by 4 to 4.6ml/kg/min per decade beyond the age of 30).</p>\n<p>On that note, when considering a realistic progression of VO2 max, age is certainly something to bear in mind as you <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/how-to-keep-cycling-through-your-40s-50s-60s-70s-and-beyond/#:~:text=To%20boost%20your%20functional%20fitness,certainly%20train%2C%E2%80%9D%20says%20Roberts.\">keep cycling through the decades</a>.</p>\n<p>If you tested your VO2 max at age 30, then again at age 50, and you’d managed to maintain the same level, that would be a positive outcome. Relative to your age, you’d have improved your VO2 max, even though the actual value had not changed.</p>\n<p>Sudden increases in altitude also impact VO2 max because the concentration of oxygen in the air is lower, and this slows the rate at which oxygen can be transferred from the lungs into the blood, although the body adapts to counteract this over time.</p>\n<p>Similar adaptations are also achieved through EPO supplementation – a banned substance common in the blood-doping heyday, which increases the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood.</p>\n<h2>How to improve your VO2 max</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Zwift avatar doing workout\" title=\"2021-06-18_1443061\" />\n\n</div><div><figcaption><span><i></i> Intervals are an effective way to improve your VO2 max.</span></figcaption><span> <i>Zwift</i></span></div>\n<p>If you’re fairly <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/beginners-cycling-tips-25-essential-pieces-of-advice-for-new-cyclists/\">new to cycling</a>, then just riding on a consistent basis can improve your VO2 max, and almost any kind of training will help.</p>\n<p>However, once you’ve been consistently training for a while, you’ll need to become more focused. Many <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/60-minute-turbo-training-sessions/\">60-minute turbo trainer sessions</a> can target V02 max and <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/beginners-guide-to-indoor-training-all-you-need-to-get-started/\">indoor training</a> platforms, such as <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/buyers-guides/trainerroad/\">TrainerRoad</a>, have structured training plans dedicated to VO2 max improvement.</p>\n<p>There are broadly two types of adaptations we’re looking to achieve when we’re training VO2 max:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>‘Central’ adaptations, which relate to the delivery of oxygen via the lungs, heart and blood</li>\n<li>‘Peripheral’ adaptations, which relate to adaptations at the muscles that improve their ability to take on and process the oxygen</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Central adaptations respond best to <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/hiit-interval-training/\">intervals</a> that allow you to spend as much time as possible close to your VO2 max.</p>\n<p>Happily, you can get a rough idea of how much time you’re spending close to VO2 max by looking at <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/power-vs-heart-rate/\">heart rate</a> or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/how-to-train-with-power/\">training with power</a>. Any time you spend above 90 per cent of your maximum heart rate can be considered constructive VO2 max training time.</p>\n<section>\n    <div>\n        \n<h3>VO2 workouts</h3>\n<p>There are lots of workout designs that allow you to score a lot of time close to VO2 max, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>5-6 x 5-6 mins at 110-120 per cent FTP or 8/10 effort, with 3-4 mins of recovery between each</li>\n<li>2-4 blocks of ‘microburst’ intervals alternating 30 secs at 120-130 per cent FTP or 9/10 effort and 15 secs easy (each block lasting between 8 and 15 mins)</li>\n<li>5-6x hard-start intervals, starting at 120-130 per cent FTP or 9/10 effort for 30 secs, then settling into 105-115 per cent FTP for 5-6 mins with 3-4 mins of recovery between efforts</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n\n    </p></div>\n    </section>\n\n<p>Peripheral adaptations, on the other hand, respond most strongly to volume and workout duration. The best type of session for developing this is long, steady riding at zone two of your <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/training-zones/\">training zones</a> (55 to 75 per cent FTP, or 60 to 70 per cent of your max heart rate), or <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/base-training-cycling/\">base training</a>.</p>\n<p>Getting the right mix of these types of workouts is important. VO2 max-type intervals are hard work mentally and physically, and should be performed in moderation. A good mix for most cyclists in a <a href=\"https://www.bikeradar.com/advice/fitness-and-training/cycling-training-plan/\">training plan</a> is one to two interval sessions per week, keeping the remainder of your sessions to zone two (or lower).</p>\n<p>It’s also worth keeping in mind that relative VO2 max depends on body weight, so if you maintain the same ability to process oxygen, but lose some weight, your VO2 max will also increase.</p>\n<h2>The bigger picture</h2>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"Team UAE Emirates' Slovenian rider Tadej Pogacar cycles at the front of the race in the final kilometers, in Colle Aperto, during the 117th edition of the Giro di Lombardia (Tour of Lombardy), a 238km cycling race from Como to Bergamo on October 7, 2023.

Beyond this point, you fatigue quickly, but when riding at or below it, power can be sustained for a relatively long time.</p>\n<div>\n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n        \n    \n    <img width=\"620\" height=\"413\" alt=\"EMMEN, NETHERLANDS - SEPTEMBER 20: Zoe Backstedt of Great Britain sprints during the 29th UEC Road Cycling European Championships 2023, Elite Women´s U23 Individual Time Trial a 20,6 km / #UCIWWT / on September 20, 2023 in Emmen, Netherlands.

That latter athlete will usually outperform the former head-to-head.</p>\n<p>In contrast to amateur cyclists, who may be limited by their VO2 max and/or their maximal steady-state power (and the relationship between the two), elite riders possess both extraordinarily high VO2 max numbers and high maximal steady-state power numbers.</p>\n<p>Other factors that feed into performance include the cyclist’s anaerobic capacity (the ability to produce very high power through the anaerobic system), and their efficiency (which is partly determined by physiology, but also by factors such as bike fit and equipment).</p>\n<p>The bottom line is that VO2 max is a key metric most riders interested in improving their performance should look to increase, but a high VO2 max is only one of a number of factors that are important in cycling success.</p>","author":"Tom Bell","siteTitle":"BikeRadar","siteHash":"df99dd1320fcd97327a2def4c67247c08cd4090a7dab684a0eddb9b856f80ef1","entryHash":"3473421c4cc724c9b1d1c82c3ba6ab859a64e728a6c48ab7c4b53375dc64c787","category":"Cycling"}
