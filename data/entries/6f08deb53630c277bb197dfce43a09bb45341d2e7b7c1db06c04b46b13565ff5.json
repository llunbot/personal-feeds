You can only don them officially after winning a victory at the Union Cycliste International (UCI) World Cup and Championship races. After 30+ years of donning the UCI this honor, the time has come for <a href=\"https://theradavist.com/tag/ritchey/\" target=\"_blank\">Ritchey</a> — in accordance with UCI regulations — to retire the iconic rainbow stripes that dignify world champions in all cycling disciplines. The agreement between the UCI and Ritchey to use the world champion stripes expired at the end of 2024 and is not eligible for renewal.</p>\n<p>The brand’s response is to convert the stripes to monochrome blue or grey colors, as seen above.
