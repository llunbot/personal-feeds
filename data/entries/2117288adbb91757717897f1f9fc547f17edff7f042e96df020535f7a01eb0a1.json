{"title":"The best iPhone for kids 2025","link":"https://www.macworld.com/article/334296/the-best-iphone-for-kids.html","date":1741002999000,"content":"<p><a href=\"https://www.macworld.com\">Macworld</a></p>\n\n<div>\n<section><div></div></section>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s face it: Kids want iPhones. Their favorite celebrities use them, their parents use them, and some of their friends have them, too. But which iPhone is best for <em>your</em> kid? There are lots of factors to consider, not the least of which is the age of the child in question. When should a child be given their own iPhone? We’ll discuss that in a section below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For toddlers and young children who need a simple device for watching parent-approved videos and playing some games or educational apps, we recommend avoiding iPhones altogether and getting a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/357617/ipad-ninth-generation-design-display-specs-price.html\">basic iPad</a>. It’s affordable, you don’t have to worry about cellular connectivity, and the large size is easy for toddlers still working on their fine motor skills. You can check out our<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668916/best-kids-ipad.html\"> best iPad for kids</a> guide to see if this would be a better fit for your child, and we recommend a look at our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/672807/best-ipad-deals.html\">best iPad deals</a> roundup so you can get the best prices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, once a child gets old enough for phone connectivity to be useful (for mobile internet, texting friends, tracking and being contactable by you), it’s time to step up to a proper iPhone. Apple introduced the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2007943/iphone-16-release-date-specs-price-features.html\">iPhone 16</a> series in September 2024 and then added an <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1354114/new-iphone-se-release-date-se4-16e-design-specs-features.html\">iPhone 16e</a> to the range in February 2025. How does that change the landscape for the best iPhone for kids? Read on to find out and see our recommendations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever iPhone you get, you should consider using <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/233792/two-screen-time-tips-to-keep-kids-from-working-around-limits.html\">Screen Time</a> to manage their use. Built into iOS, Screen Time lets you set limits on how long your kid can use their phone, what apps they can download and use, and when they need to put it down for the night. It’s a great way for busy parents to keep tabs on what their kids are doing when they’re not within eyeshot, and ought to be the first thing you set up.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Best iPhone for kids in 2025</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Below you will find our top choices for iPhones for children. We aren’t recommending the ultimate iPhones because we think that unless you have a money tree in the garden you won’t want to be spending a whole lot of money on a phone for a child who is just as likely to leave it on a bus or drop it. But if you’d like a wider range of iPhones to choose from read our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670458/iphone-buying-guide.html\">iPhone buying guide</a> and our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/228816/best-iphone-pro-mini-max.html\">iPhone comparison</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also look at the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2613635/iphone-16-vs-iphone-16e-specs-price-features-compared.html\">iPhone 16e vs iPhone 16</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2615097/iphone-16e-vs-iphone-15-why-still-selling.html\">iPhone 16e vs the iPhone 15</a> to see if it’s worth saving money or spending more, plus you might be interested to read about the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2615781/upgrade-iphone-14-to-16e.html\">whether to upgrade from iPhone 14 and the iPhone 16e</a>, similarly you might want to consider the differences between the <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2620563/iphone-16e-vs-iphone-se-dispay-design-camera-procesor-specs-price.html\">iPhone SE vs iPhone 16e</a>. Alternatively, read: <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2453303/iphone-16-vs-iphone-16-pro-how-do-the-new-models-compare.html\">iPhone 16 vs iPhone 16 Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2452386/iphone-15-vs-iphone-16-comparison.html\">iPhone 15 vs iPhone 16</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another complication is the fact that the only iPhones currently sold by Apple that support <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2362804/apple-intelligence-faq-features-release-date-hardware-support.html\">Apple Intelligence features</a> are the iPhone 16, 16 Plus, 16 Pro, 16 Pro Max, and the iPhone 16e. If you and your child want Apple Intelligence features you should avoid the iPhone 15.</p>\n\n\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApple iPhone 16e: Best budget iPhone for kids\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure><img width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" alt=\"Apple iPhone 16e: Best budget iPhone for kids\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/iphone_16e_white_review_7.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n<li>Good price</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Decent display size</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Excellent battery life</li>\n</ul>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n<li>Only one camera on the back</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Only black or white color choice</li>\n</ul>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFrom $599\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today: \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Retailer</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Price</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/themes/idg-base-theme/dist/static/img/apple-logo.svg\" alt=\"Apple\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$599\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-16e\">View Deal</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Product</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Price</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\tPrice comparison from Backmarket\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-16e\" target=\"_blank\">$599 at  Apple</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>We recommend the iPhone 16e as the top choice here primarily because it represents the best value for money right now, at $599/£599. </p>\n\n<p>It features a single 48MP camera, rather than the dual camera set up on the rear of the iPhone 16, but it offers features like Deep Fusion for better low-light photography, and the front facing camera is just the same as that on the iPhone 16, and lets face it, most of the photos they take will be selfies. </p>\n\n<p>That A18 processor is capable of the fun features of Apple Intelligence and fast enough for email, checking social media apps, taking pictures, making FaceTime calls, and everything else your teen wants an iPhone for. And it’ll still get several years of iOS software updates.</p>\n\n<p>With a 6.1-inch display and it has a modern design and features. The iPhone 16e will deliver, with excellent battery life that will easily last a full day. Kids are never aware of the amount of battery their phone uses, so the iPhone 16e’s excellent battery life should tide them over until they remember to plug their iPhone in.</p>\n\n<p>One disadvantage is that the iPhone 16e comes in only white or black, but since you will want to protect it with a <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2443460/best-iphone-16-cases.html\">case</a>, your teen will be able to express their personality anyway.

have demanding standards and they’re going to want to look cool in front of their friends. More importantly, photo-taking and social media has become an important part of their social life. They’ll want an iPhone with a capable camera and the dual camera lenses on the back of the iPhone 16 set it apart from the iPhone 16e with its single camera lens. This additional ultra-wide camera lens lets the iPhone take photos with a wider field of view, perfect for landscapes or a large bunch of friends. </p>\n\n<p>The iPhone 16 camera is also capable of taking macro and spatial photos. That might be handy if your child is often working on projects and wants to expand their artistic eye for the pictures they take. It also features the Camera Control button, which the iPhone 16e lacks. It also offers Action Mode, which lets take steady video while you are moving. The iPhone 16e lacks this. </p>\n\n<p>The battery life is good. In our tests, we saw a four-hour boost in battery life for the iPhone 16 over the iPhone 15. That’s a drastic improvement. The battery life of the iPhone 16e is even better though. </p>\n\n<p>There are five colors to choose from, including pink, green and blue,  but we recommend getting <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2443460/best-iphone-16-cases.html\">an iPhone 16 case</a>, so the color is really redundant.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2470661/iphone-16-and-16-plus-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tApple iPhone 16 review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t\t<div></div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tiPhone 15: Best compromise\t\t\t\t\t\t</h2>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure><img width=\"1960\" height=\"1306\" alt=\"iPhone 15: Best compromise\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Apple-iPhone-15-review-5.jpg?quality=50&amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t</figure>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Pros</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n<li>48MP sensor camera</li>\n</ul>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>Cons</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<ul>\n<li>Less good battery life</li>\n</ul>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFrom $699 (Was $799)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBest Prices Today: \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\n\t\t<div>\n\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Retailer</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Price</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/themes/idg-base-theme/dist/static/img/apple-logo.svg\" alt=\"Apple\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$729\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/473657/7613?prodsku=MTLV3LL%2FA&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fus%2Fshop%2Fgo%2Fproduct%2FMTLV3LL%2FA%3Fcppart%3DUNLOCKED&amp;intsrc=CATF_3652\">View Deal</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<img src=\"https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/themes/idg-base-theme/dist/static/img/best-buy-logo.png\" alt=\"Best Buy\" loading=\"lazy\" />\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$729.99\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/321564/633495/10014?prodsku=6417991&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.bestbuy.com%2Fclick%2F-%2F6417991%2Fpdp&amp;intsrc=CATF_4831\">View Deal</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Product</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>Price</span>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\tPrice comparison from Backmarket\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://apple.sjv.io/c/321564/473657/7613?prodsku=MTLV3LL%2FA&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fus%2Fshop%2Fgo%2Fproduct%2FMTLV3LL%2FA%3Fcppart%3DUNLOCKED&amp;intsrc=CATF_3652\" target=\"_blank\">$729 at  Apple</a><a href=\"https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/321564/633495/10014?prodsku=6417991&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.bestbuy.com%2Fclick%2F-%2F6417991%2Fpdp&amp;intsrc=CATF_4831\" target=\"_blank\">$729.99 at  Best Buy</a>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p>While the iPhone 16 is a better overall phone, it’s pricy. The iPhone 16e is the cheapest iPhone, but it lacks that second camera. If you want to compromise, then choose the iPhone 15, which is priced right in the middle of those two handsets. It has a dual camera, unlike the iPhone 16e and offers Action Mode for recording steady video while in motion. </p>\n\n<p>One drawbacks of the iPhone 15 is it’s lack of support for Apple Intelligence features, which may not matter now, but are likely to lead to some FOMO in the future when their friends have fun image creation tools, for example. Another disadvantage is battery life. Battery life isn’t bad, but the iPhone 16 offers a dramatic improvement and the iPhone 16e is even better. </p>\n\n<p>But otherwise, the iPhone 15 is a top performer and can handle anything you child wants to do on it, including streaming videos, games, and a lot more.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t<a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2247687/iphone-15-review.html\" target=\"_blank\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tApple iPhone 15 review \t\t\t\t\t</a>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t<div>\n\t\t\t\t\t</div>\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t\n\n\n<h2>Buy a refurbished iPhone</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you buy one of the phones mentioned above our advice is to explore the second-hand and refurbished market. Buying a second-hand or refurbished iPhone can save you a lot of money. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your first port of call should be <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/230729/how-to-buy-refurbished-macbook-refurbished-iphone-refurbished-ipad.html\">Apple’s Refurbished store</a> where Apple sells iPhones that have either been returned as faulty or unwanted. These iPhones (and other products) are fixed up so they are good as new and sold at around 15% off their normal price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are various benefits to buying from <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/shop/refurbished\">Apple’s Refurbished Store in the U.S.</a> or <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/refurbished\" target=\"_blank\">U.K</a>., including the fact that all products in the Refurbished Store come with a one-year warranty. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may even be able to find an older iPhone model that Apple doesn’t sell anymore, such as the <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/refurbished/iphone/iphone-13-mini\">iPhone 13 mini</a> or an <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/refurbished/iphone/iphone-12-pro\">iPhone 15 Pro</a> in Apple’s refurbished store.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, Apple is not the only place that sells refurbished iPhones; plenty of companies make a living from refurbishing and selling iPhones.

Before you buy from one of these do check their policies regarding refurbishment and returns, and also we’d advise buying recent models of iPhones – some of these outlets have much older models. Consult <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/675021/how-long-does-apple-support-iphones.html\">How long does Apple support iPhones</a> for more information about the handsets to avoid. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Always make sure that the iPhone’s previous owner has completely wiped the iPhone and removed it from their iCloud account or you will encounter many problems. This is a good reason to buy from a reputable refurbished seller, rather than someone on eBay or Marketplace. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Refurbished iPhone sellers in the U.S.</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.decluttr.com/us/store/\" target=\"_blank\">Decluttr</a>: A popular destination for refurbished devices, often with sales that slash even more money off.

What’s not to love?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pass on an old iPhone to them</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another route to explore is handing over your current iPhone and buying yourself a new one! If you’ve had yours for a while, then it may be out of its contract period, but if you bought it outright then all you need to do is get a new SIM card for your youngster, give them your handset, then head off to the Apple store to give yourself a present for being such a magnanimous parent. If you’re unsure what to treat yourself to, our <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/228816/best-iphone-pro-mini-max.html\">best iPhone</a> roundup should prove a helpful guide. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you hand over your old iPhone make sure you set it up correctly for your child. Have a look at <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/230138/how-to-set-up-a-kid-friendly-iphone-or-ipad.html\">5 things to do before giving an old iPhone or iPad to your kid</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/230803/iphone-sell-trade-carrier-store-online.html\">how to prepare an iPhone for sale</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671481/how-to-reset-an-iphone-or-ipad.html\">how to reset an iPhone</a> and <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/670623/how-to-set-up-parental-controls-on-ipad-iphone.html\">how to set up parental controls on iPad &amp; iPhone</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Should kids have iPhones?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a huge question and a topic fraught with pros and cons. Everyone is different. There are still parents who don’t allow their kids to watch TV, let alone play computer games. Other parents don’t see any harm in letting their kids be familiar with technology. And others just need a few minutes of peace while they push a toddler around a supermarket, or something to stop the tweens fighting in the back of the car on a long journey. Surely allowing the kids a few minutes here and there with a mobile phone won’t damage their development. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could give them your own iPhone of course, but that depends on how prepared you are for the risk of them sending their favorite YouTube video to your manager at work. A better solution may be to give them an old iPhone or iPad: it can still be linked to your account so there is no need to pay for the apps you’ve already downloaded for them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may want older kids who walk to and from school to have an iPhone for safety and security, so that they can contact you to let you know their bus is canceled, for example. You may also want to use <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671675/how-to-use-find-my-iphone-to-find-lost-or-stolen-iphone-or-ipad.html\">an app to track their locations via the iPhone</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Teens will no doubt want a handset with a bit of credibility. It’s also at this age that the risks associated with mobile phone ownership become more prominent as concerns about their use of, and influence of, social media become apparent. You will want to familiarise yourself with Parental Controls and ensure that they are really mature enough to handle all that comes with this connection with the world and that they are able to avoid becoming addicted to their handsets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple founder Steve Jobs famously limited his kid’s use of technology, so maybe we should take a leaf out of his book. Or maybe we should accept that our kids are growing up in a world so immersed in technology that it is going to be a part of their lives whether we like it or not. We just need to control their access to it, rather than stop it altogether. </p>\n\n</div>","author":"","siteTitle":"Macworld","siteHash":"37e84dd5a21fa961d6d6630e269546024dbb7741b2e2fadbe74f47383c70dfbb","entryHash":"2117288adbb91757717897f1f9fc547f17edff7f042e96df020535f7a01eb0a1","category":"Apple"}
