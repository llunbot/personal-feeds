The service allows users to play games on mobile devices or desktop computers, and it is being tested with Google employees internally.\r<br />\n\r<br />\n<img src=\"https://images.macrumors.com/article-new/2021/09/General-YouTube-Feature-1.jpg\" alt width=\"2250\" height=\"1266\" />\r<br />\nPlayables appears to offer instant-play games through the YouTube website or YouTube mobile apps, offering an alternative to video content. In a statement, a YouTube spokesperson told <em>The <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/wsj-com/\">Wall Street Journal</a></em> that \"gaming has long been a focus at YouTube\" and that the company is \"always experimenting with new features,\" but the spokesperson declined to comment specifically on Playables.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nGoogle previously had the <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/09/29/google-shutting-down-stadia/\">Stadia cloud gaming service</a>, but announced plans to shut it down last September. Google said that the service was not able to gain the traction that Google had been expecting, and Stadia was <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/18/googles-stadia-shuts-down-today/\">officially shuttered</a> in January 2023.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nPlayables does not offer the same cloud based gaming as Stadia, focusing on simple games rather than console titles. One of the available games is Stack Bounce, an arcade game where players smash bricks with a ball.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThere is no word on when Playables could see a public launch.<div>Tag: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/youtube/\">YouTube</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/06/26/youtube-playables-gaming-service/\">YouTube Working on 'Playables' Gaming Service</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/youtube-working-on-playables-gaming-service.2394252/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Juli Clover","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"60b7793aa939ea1717ea06a2503f17e09087cd56a4744c43b8e304b3b41f63de","category":"Apple"}
