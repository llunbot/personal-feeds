It carries a severity rating of 9.8 out of 10. A maker of network security software, Fortinet silently fixed the vulnerability on November 28, 2022, but failed to mention the threat until December 12 of that year, when the company <a href=\"https://www.fortiguard.com/psirt/FG-IR-22-398\">said</a> it became aware of an “instance where this vulnerability was exploited in the wild.” On January 11, 2023—more than six weeks after the vulnerability was fixed—Fortinet <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/01/fortinet-says-hackers-exploited-critical-vulnerability-to-infect-vpn-customers/\">warned</a> a threat actor was exploiting it to infect government and government-related organizations with advanced custom-made malware.</p>\n<h2>Enter CoatHanger</h2>\n<p>The Netherlands officials first <a href=\"https://www.ncsc.nl/binaries/ncsc/documenten/publicaties/2024/februari/6/mivd-aivd-advisory-coathanger-tlp-clear/TLP-CLEAR+MIVD+AIVD+Advisory+COATHANGER.pdf\">reported</a> in February that Chinese state hackers had exploited CVE-2022-42475 to install an advanced and stealthy backdoor tracked as CoatHanger on Fortigate appliances inside the Dutch Ministry of Defense. Once installed, the never-before-seen malware, specifically designed for the underlying FortiOS operating system, was able to permanently reside on devices even when rebooted or receiving a firmware update. CoatHanger could also escape traditional detection measures, the officials warned. The damage resulting from the breach was limited, however, because infections were contained inside a segment reserved for non-classified uses.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030948#p3\">Read 6 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2030948&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Dan Goodin","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"391ea6fc8a13109b57f1fb079a9f3d954f89dc41ec11f699db48c4c0e467eebd","category":"Tech"}
