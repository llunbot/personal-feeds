AMD's pricing and performance numbers pit the cards against Nvidia's <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/05/review-nvidias-399-rtx-4060-ti-is-mostly-a-step-forward-but-only-a-small-one/\">GeForce RTX 4060 Ti</a> (specifically the <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3En9Dm3\" target=\"_blank\">$499</a> 16GB version) and the $599 <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/rtx-4070-review-an-ideal-gpu-for-anyone-who-skipped-the-graphics-card-shortage/\">RTX 4070</a>.</p>\n<p>AMD's pricing is aggressive enough that Nvidia is quietly cutting the prices of <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/582jhdc4\" target=\"_blank\">some 16GB RTX 4060 Ti cards</a> to $449, to match the RX 7700 XT. The announcement about the $50 reduction was buried toward the bottom of an email that Nvidia sent to GPU reviewers ahead of AMD's launch next week; it also drew attention to Nvidia-specific features like DLSS upscaling and frame generation, which compete with <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/08/amds-fps-doubling-fsr-3-is-coming-soon-and-not-just-to-radeon-graphics-cards/\">AMD's GPU-agnostic FSR</a>, plus <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/nvidia-dlss-3-5-ray-reconstruction/\">recent DLSS improvements</a> that improve ray-tracing performance.</p>\n<p>\"Finally, as a reminder, market prices can vary from the original launch MSRPs,\" Nvidia's Brian Burke wrote. \"Today, GeForce RTX 4070 is widely available at $599, and GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 16GB is now available at $449. Both of these GPUs are great upgrade choices for gamers seeking their next GPU for the upcoming 2 to 3 years.\"</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1965157#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1965157&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Andrew Cunningham","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"30daeb2c2526342c382d3d6ab1037b6c7973138ee891d6a13b0b45974a7f59f8","category":"Tech"}
