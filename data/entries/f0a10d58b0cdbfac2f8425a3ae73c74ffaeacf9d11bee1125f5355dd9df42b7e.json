This product refresh has been rumored for some time, but with plenty of ‌AirPods Max‌ inventory still in stock, Gurman suggested that the new model may not arrive until later.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nLikewise, Apple has apparently been working on an updated ‌Apple TV‌ that was originally supposed to launch <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/18/apple-tv-faster-chip-2024-launch/\">earlier this year</a>. With no sign of the new model and stable inventory of the current model, Gurman says that \"a new version isn't on the immediate horizon.\"\r<br />\n\r<br />\nThe new ‌AirPods Max‌ are <a href=\"https://x.com/markgurman/status/1762690933659988326\">not expected</a> to feature the H2 chip introduced in September 2022 or <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/02/20/airpods-max-2-could-miss-out-on-adaptive-audio/\">features like Adaptive Audio</a>. Gurman previously said that the changes are expected to be so minor that the refreshed device will still be considered to be first-generation ‌AirPods Max‌.\r<br />\n\r<br />\nWhenever it comes out, the next ‌Apple TV‌ is rumored to feature a <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2023/01/18/apple-tv-faster-chip-2024-launch/\">faster processor</a> than the current A15 Bionic chip, and even lower pricing. Apple analyst <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/ming-chi-kuo/\">Ming-Chi Kuo</a> suggested that the next ‌Apple TV‌ <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2022/10/18/kuo-even-cheaper-apple-tv/\">could have a sub-$100 starting price</a><div>Related Roundups: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/airpods-max/\">AirPods Max</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a></div><div>Tags: <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/2024-airpods-max/\">2024 AirPods Max</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-tv/\">Apple TV</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/bloomberg-com/\">Bloomberg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/guide/mark-gurman/\">Mark Gurman</a></div><div>Buyer's Guide: <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#AirPods-Max\">AirPods Max (Caution)</a>, <a href=\"https://buyersguide.macrumors.com/#Apple_TV\">Apple TV (Don't Buy)</a></div><div>Related Forums: <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/airpods.216\">AirPods</a>, <a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/forums/apple-tv-and-home-theater.100\">Apple TV and Home Theater</a></div><br />This article, \"<a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/06/new-airpods-max-and-apple-tv-unlikely/\">Gurman: New AirPods Max and Apple TV Unlikely to Be Announced at September Apple Event</a>\" first appeared on <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com\">MacRumors.com</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/gurman-new-airpods-max-and-apple-tv-unlikely-to-be-announced-at-september-apple-event.2435209/\">Discuss this article</a> in our forums<br /><br />","author":"Hartley Charlton","siteTitle":"MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories","siteHash":"4c0f1b1ecc2ed084c9f5be50f1058e33a55cdf9b904dadc33a2071fc2d63e8c1","entryHash":"f0a10d58b0cdbfac2f8425a3ae73c74ffaeacf9d11bee1125f5355dd9df42b7e","category":"Apple"}
