At just 3.3 inches tall, HomePod\nmini offers big sound in an impressively compact design. With a\nseamless, acoustically transparent mesh exterior and a backlit\ntouch surface that illuminates from edge to edge, HomePod mini is\na stunning smart speaker that complements any space. HomePod mini\nin midnight is available starting Wednesday, July 17, and joins\nother bold colors, including yellow, orange, blue, and white.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This confused me for a moment, because they make it sound like they’re simply adding this new color to the lineup.

The bigger question: is this a sign that a second-gen HomePod Mini is not coming soon? The current models debuted in November 2020, and are powered by the S5 chip from Apple Watch Series 5.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/07/15/homepod-mini-midnight\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"1ac732eec4035382808bcbb4db53facf68ab28c8fff04e5dea1fa21e9e1788ac","category":"Tech"}
