The app is free and available now on the App Store.</p>\n\n<p>While using Galactic Compass, you set your iPhone on a level surface, and a big green arrow on the screen points the way to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Center\">Galactic Center,</a> which is the rotational core of the spiral galaxy all of us live in. In that center is a supermassive black hole known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A*\">Sagittarius A*</a>, a celestial body from which no matter or light can escape. (So, in a way, the app is telling us what we should avoid.)</p>\n<p>But truthfully, the location of the galactic core at any given time isn't exactly useful, practical knowledge—at least for people who aren't James Tiberius Kirk in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_V:_The_Final_Frontier\"><em>Star Trek V</em></a>. But it may inspire a sense of awe about our place in the cosmos.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2004293#p3\">Read 9 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=2004293&amp;comments=1\">Comments</a></p>","author":"Benj Edwards","siteTitle":"Ars Technica","siteHash":"5b0ddf6e8923e49262a7894cfd77962733e43fbcc565a103b48373820b310636","entryHash":"54920eb793430c12f078944f6a8d92c12428cba8d39522fb9fe6f1828a3117c5","category":"Tech"}
