Guidance that stands the test of time.</p>\n\n<p>Join Addy Osmani, your curator, as we dive into a nuanced look at several key topics that will teach you tips and tricks that may help you optimize your own sites. The book also includes short interviews with contributors on what additional <strong>lessons, challenges, and tips</strong> they have to share some time after the case studies were written.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Performance</strong> includes examples of measuring, budgeting, optimizing, and monitoring performance, in addition to tips for building a performance culture.</li>\n<li><strong>Capabilities</strong> is about bridging the gap between native capabilities and the modern web. You’ll explore web apps, native apps, and progressive web applications.</li>\n<li><strong>Accessibility</strong> makes web apps viable for diverse users, including people with temporary or permanent disabilities. Most of us will have a disability at some point in our lives, and these case studies show how we can make the web work for all of us.</li>\n<li><strong>Developer Experience</strong> is about building a project environment and culture that encourage support, growth, and problem-solving within teams. Strong teams build great projects!</li>\n</ul>\n\nWe’re Trying Out Something New\n<p>In an effort to conserve resources here at Smashing, we’re trying something new with <em>Success at Scale</em>. The printed book will be 304 pages, and we’ll make an <strong>expanded PDF version available to everyone who purchases a print book</strong>. This accomplishes a few good things:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>We will use <strong>less paper and materials</strong> because we are making a smaller printed book;</li>\n<li>We’ll use fewer resources in general to print, ship, and store the books, leading to a <strong>smaller carbon footprint</strong>; and</li>\n<li>Keeping the book at more manageable size means we can <strong>continue to offer free shipping</strong> on all Smashing orders!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Smashing Books have always been printed with materials from <a href=\"https://fsc.org/en\">FSC Certified</a> forests. We are committed to finding new ways to conserve resources while still bringing you the best possible reading experience.</p>\n\n\n    <a href=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/success-at-scale-shipping-soon/success-at-scale-photoshop-opt.png\">\n    <img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/articles/success-at-scale-shipping-soon/success-at-scale-photoshop-opt.png\" />\n    </a>\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Author\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/addyosmani\"><img src=\"https://files.smashing.media/authors/addy-osmani-success-at-scale.jpg\" /></a><em>Addy Osmani</em> is an engineering leader working on Google Chrome.
