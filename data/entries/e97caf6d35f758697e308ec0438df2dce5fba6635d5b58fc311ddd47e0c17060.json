{"title":"Microsoft to Retire Skype in May","link":"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/02/28/the-next-chapter-moving-from-skype-to-microsoft-teams/","date":1740786944000,"content":"\n<p>Jeff Teper, president of collaborative apps and platforms at Microsoft:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In order to streamline our free consumer communications offerings\nso we can more easily adapt to customer needs, we will be retiring\nSkype in May 2025 to focus on Microsoft Teams (free), our modern\ncommunications and collaboration hub.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>NPR:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Microsoft, which <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2011/05/10/136169545/skype-microsofts-8-5-billion-mobile-bet\">acquired Skype in 2011 for $8.5 billion</a>,\nannounced in a post on <a href=\"https://x.com/Skype/status/1895477868261412953\">X</a> on Friday that the iconic\nvoice-over-Internet protocol (VoIP) service would soon go dark. It\nencouraged Skype users to instead migrate to a free version of\nMicrosoft Teams — a communication app that helps users work\ntogether in real time.</p>\n\n<p>In the more than two decades since it was founded, Skype has been\nlargely overtaken by a bevy of competitors, such as FaceTime,\nWhatsApp, Zoom, and Slack.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The writing has been on the wall for a long time that Skype was no longer strategic for Microsoft. Really, even right after the acquisition, it never seemed Microsoft had any sort of plan for what to do with Skype — even though, at the time, it was their largest-ever acquisition.</p>\n\n<p>But man, for a long while, Skype was singularly amazing, offering high-quality / low-latency audio calls at a time when everything else seemed low-quality / high-latency. I continued using Skype to record The Talk Show until a few years ago, and I can’t say I miss it. But I used Skype to record at least around 400 episodes — which means I’ve spent somewhere around 1,000 hours talking to people over Skype. I can close my eyes and just <em>hear</em> Skype’s kinda clunky but <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsUyjzRIU9w\">distinctive ringtone</a>. In the early days of podcasting, seemingly <em>every</em> show used Skype because it was so much better than anything else. And it was free! It felt like the future. I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say that if not for Skype, podcasting would’ve been set back several years.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/02/28/microsoft-skype-eol\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"e97caf6d35f758697e308ec0438df2dce5fba6635d5b58fc311ddd47e0c17060","category":"Tech"}
