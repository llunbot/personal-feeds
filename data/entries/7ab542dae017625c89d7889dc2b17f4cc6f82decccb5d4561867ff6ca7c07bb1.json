Like when I book a flight — I always get an email with an ICS attachment containing the flight details, and I just open that in Fantastical to import it. Forwarding that email to Fantastical would take longer than just opening the attachment. But what about a casual email from a friend or family member that doesn’t come with an attachment?</p>\n\n<p>Here’s an example email I sent to myself from a sort of burner account I have for testing and for doing things like this.</p>\n\n<pre><code>From: Heywood Floyd &lt;heywood••••••••@icloud.com&gt;  \nSubject: Party for Hal on Saturday  \nDate: June 3, 2025 at 1:22:45 PM EDT  \nTo: John Gruber &lt;••••••••@daringfireball.net&gt;  \n\nParty at my house is on this Saturday, 12-3 or so.\nYou don’t have to bring anything.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>That was the entire email, which I deliberately wrote in a very casual way (e.g. “this Saturday” instead of an actual date, and “12-3” as the time, without an explicit “pm”). Forwarded to Fantastical’s new event detection address, well under a minute later I got the following suggested event notification from Fantastical on my Mac:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Title: Party for Hal at Heywood Floyd's house  \nLocation: Heywood Floyd's house  \nDate: 7 June 2025, 12:00pm – 3:00pm  \nNote: \"You don't have to bring anything.\"\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Also included in the Note field was a link to the original message in Mail.</p>\n\n<p>In Apple Mail, Siri also suggested an event from the original email. After clicking “Add”, that event had the following details:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Title: Party with Floyd  \nLocation: «empty»  \nDate: 7 June 2025, 12:00pm – 3:00pm  \nNote: «empty»\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Nothing in Siri’s auto-detected event was wrong. Both got the date and time right. Siri’s title is fine — in real life, I’d know what that meant. But Fantastical’s title is perfect — it’s a party <em>for</em> Hal, <em>at</em> Heywood’s house. And Siri doesn’t include anything in the Note field, not even a link back to the original message, so it would be up to my own memory to remember where the party was.</p>\n\n<p>To be clear, Fantastical doesn’t just add these events to your calendar. It shows them as suggestions, and there’s a “Preview” button in addition to “Add”. I’ll still preview before adding, but using this service does seem like a decent timesaver for creating new events from casual emails.</p>\n\n<div>\n<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/06/03/fantastical-email-event-detection\"> ★ </a>\n</div>\n\n\t","author":"John Gruber","siteTitle":"Daring Fireball","siteHash":"fc569638025dadf22a867470f8215f38855cf50e975782a6c989909474292a36","entryHash":"7ab542dae017625c89d7889dc2b17f4cc6f82decccb5d4561867ff6ca7c07bb1","category":"Tech"}
